<|startoftext|>Hit me up if you're ready to go off the grid and say ✌️ to the non-sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a good chunk of us it was never about #trump. For us, from the beginning, it was simply about wanting an honest election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To all my christian fam who are freaking out...could I point you to a couple books on Christina history?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceshaker There are only two things I’m excited about when it comes to a Biden-Harris Presidency. (1) more Biden memes (2) calling out all the false prophets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, I see you #Oregon. Makin' moves...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've said this before. What I'm looking forward to over the next 4 years is hearing 1/2 phrase over and over and over again no matter how much freedom they strip from us.  "Well, at least he's not #Biden" 🐏 OR "He's better than #Trump" 🐏 #Election2020 #ElectionDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is not a solid fact-based argument that #BidenHarris2020 is morally superior to #Trump. #ElectionDay #VoteLibertarian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I would’ve thought of the idea of an #endoftheworld party for Tuesday night a lot sooner. #ElectionDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i think my plan for the remainder of Monday is to spam Twitter with my supreme thoughts, opinions, and beliefs regarding this election #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😱😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielbovat That is most definitely true. How can we serve those hurting people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielbovat Maybe. I think the self centeredness can cut multiple ways. Some think other should be running to them greeting with a latte and others can be too self centered to see the others hurting around them. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielbovat or something else...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielbovat I'm with you on your OP. I do want to ask though...when you're visiting a local body and the congregation is not hospitable, not serving or anything to you (or others). Doesn't that communicate something about that local body? Couldn't it communicate a character of selfishness?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielbovat I'm with you on this. We shouldn't be looking to be served. Would you agree that we should be looking to serve though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I find very interesting is that those who I know that advocate for the abolishment of government are the most hardworking and self-motivated people. They're also the most generous with their time, money &amp; resources. #anarchocapitalist #volunteerism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much should christians be concerned with fighting for “rights”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technetheologia The lack of unity is probably the biggest threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technetheologia I can’t help but think this is the wrong question to be asking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It bothers me how much the culture isn’t taking seriously pedophilia. The way people are mocked and ridiculed for trying to create awareness is really disheartening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Lamont1 thats not the point man! I get told by so many that my vote is "wasted" or that my vote is indirectly "for trump" or "for biden". Apparently, 3rd party votes are sovereign and triune.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@graceshaker I think that’s #Jorgensen2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's weird how those who vote #libertarian or 3rd party are the only one who cast a triune vote. Our vote for the 3rd party candidate is also a vote for #Trump AND for #Biden. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeeGoddess64 and in 2012, and in 2008. We are not to blame for those who voted for Trump or Hillary. Or those who are going to vote for Trump or Biden, both disasters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we get closer and closer to the election I’m more and more comfortable with voting 3rd party. #Election2020 #VoteThirdParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LPTexas I respect that but your tweet was about abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LPTexas True. The republicans will never end abortion. So what should we (pro-lifers) do then? We don't seem to have a friend with the LP either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As I have read through the many threads about the movement to change the name of #SRSU it is very obvious that so many don't know how to have a real #civilconversation. #Civildiscourse is dead in our society and it will be the death of us. #FreeSpeech #CivilSociety #SulRoss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's crazy that there are people starting college right now who were not born when 9/11 happened. It's a historic event for them. #nineeleven #September11th #NeverForget911 #GenZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting. We should all #cancelnetlix @netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its a mostly fun thread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This will be like that car accident you can't look away from.  https://t.co/SKxjZtYUGC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Lamont1 I'm curious what u mean by "affected". Part of my deal is we need to understand the ppl we disagree with. If we are able &amp; willing to do this then we can be effective in civil discourse &amp;maybe, just maybe, change a few minds. I think we talked abt this in our last convo. Maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is something I've been saying for a while now (&amp; many others as well). The more hes hated the more pop he becomes. Its hard to nt believe there is a conspiracy fm his haters 2get him re-elected. I know of countless who didn't support him in 16 who are voting 4him in 20 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Lamont1 Yessir. We can even go ahead and add Galatians 6:10 and might as well add Romans 12:9-21 just for a shortlist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@graceshaker i think i went in believing none of the professors cared about us and assumed they wouldn't actually want you in the office. I also didn't have the best attitude. Its a shame we program kids in junior high and high school to go to college immediately after graduation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tylcox34 @LivingGodsTruth @Flame314 Gotcha, man. That question was more for JM. I honestly think (bc there is no way for me to know for sure) that Flame's transition over to Lutheranism is honest. At the same time I am becoming increasingly aware of how theology is treated as a trend and that makes me sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't even know "worshipful" was a word. 😳😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobMurphyEcon I just can’t believe these videos are honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylcox34 @LivingGodsTruth @Flame314 I do have to ask because of the structure of the original tweet...are you equating leaving “reformed theology” for “Lutheranism” to being an apostate (walking from the faith)?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@graceshaker @TulsiGabbard @AndrewYang But Tulsi on foreign policy is pure gold. The way she calls out trump, the way she calls out the media, The way she calls out the DNC is awesome 😆 What she did to Kamala a few debates ago was nothing short of outstanding.

<|startoftext|>@graceshaker @TulsiGabbard @AndrewYang I don't like his solutions but he makes me think and I appreciate it. The only thing that he has really said that I'm on board with is that we should be able to own our personal data and profit off of it. #YangGang #Yang2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceshaker @TulsiGabbard @AndrewYang If the DNC had a clue they would put tulsi and Yang at the front but they don't. The issues that Yang brings up are very interesting, he's one of the few that talks about what he talks about and he talks about it the right way. That's what I appreciate about Yang.<|endoftext|>
