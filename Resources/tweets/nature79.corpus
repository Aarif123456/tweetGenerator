<|startoftext|>Wonderful advice from some great experts in the field. Thank you for sharing. I'm definitely passing this along to my network!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Just be smart. Finances can affect all areas of life - and future opportunities. Slow down, breathe, and know you can do this #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Don't beat yourself up about your financial state. No one is perfect with finances. #SquashTheStigma #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Above all be honest about your financial questions, concerns, and capabilities. Anything less will make a financial mess.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Ask friends, family, co-workers etc to recommend a financial pro they trust. Speak to one candidly about your concerns.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Lean on your friends and family for emotional support. Don't make emotionally charged decisions regarding your money #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A8 Understand what bankruptcy means for your current finances, your credit. Know how it will affect you short and long term.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 If you want to consolidate debt shop around and speak to a financial professional. Not all consolidation is good.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 Set a budget before taking out any type of line of credit. Don't start off by taking on debt you don't need or can't afford. #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 Know what creditors will be looking at, understand credit history &amp; scores, understand credit inquiries.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6 Don't just depend on your attorney to get you on a stable financial footing. Figure out your system for your finances.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6 Request login information to online accounts - such as banking and bills, to review activity #BeInTheFinancialKnow #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6, again, might be time to start new financial behaviors, like taking charge of your personal finances. #FinancialBootCamp #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6 Running your free credit report, asking for ledger of bank accounts, and make copies of all necessary docs.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're able to track bills via online accounts use those to see if payments are made. Decide who will own login information.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTC Testifies Before Senate Judiciary Committee on Its Efforts to Combat Fraud Affecting Older Americans |...  https://t.co/gycnmUGvQr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5 Have a collection of bills, debts - and record of who has agreed to undertake each one. Again, the less secrets the better.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even in high stress divorces, no one wants to walk away with more debt, a bad credit history, or dings to credit scores.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a candid talk with your spouse about how each financial choice can negatively impact credit scores - yours and theirs.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Determine which accounts, if any, would be better handled under one party's name. Be candid about what you can handle.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be afraid to ask for help from professionals, family, or friends. Don't wait until it's too late. #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be open and honest - right away. It happens, but don't conceal financial struggles. It will only make things harder.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Document all agreements so there is a record of what was said and decided - right down to the last penny.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may also need to learn new financial behaviors if you will have to work with less post divorce.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Begin thinking about what agreements, settlements, you may need to make with your soon-to-be ex when it comes to finances. #creditchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For those interested in learning (more) about student development theory, what are literature recommendations from this group? #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In that regard student feedback can help the evolution to begin and direct it. What do they need and how do they need it?  #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO that has been where the gaps and deficiencies are. Holding on to what has always been and not considering what could be #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think encouraging and fostering the idea that practice has to evolve is so critical in higher ed, which is an antiquated system #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiffMDyer Yes! That's where I think the gaps are. A lack of ability to adapt and evolve.  #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creating coalition w/appropriate partners, stakeholders, showing relevance of theory, and possibly gap analysis could work #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you believe in a theory/element of it I think it's easier to incorporate it into your practice vs using a theory just to use it #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My office is using theory to create a new form we can use when meeting students that assess their situation and provides a guide.  #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@am_ham13 Maybe using theories to design material, content, outreach, etc. You're using it but not letting it completely dictate #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being in the moment with the student should be where assistance begins. Being present vs internally thinking which theory to use #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with the statements that theories are great for foundation but are not a blueprint or GPS.  #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other fields of study shouldn't be discounted in their theory practice when you are looking for new resources and tools for your own #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meaning keeping the status quo because it seemingly works versus exploring new ideas or incorporating other ideas. #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to theory I don't think it is so much a specific theory but the idea that you could be limited in applying theories. #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an area of research interest for me @ThisIsConstanza. Ethnographic influence on economic behavior. One size does not fit all! #sachat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone in social work it's all about meeting the client where they're at!  #sachat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Experian_US You've been quoted in my #Storify story "#CreditChat: Smart Financial Habits"  http://t.co/PUC7mMmT28<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great chat as always! @Experian_US #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grab the low hanging fruit and then make detailed plans to tackle the rest. Goals aren't enough. You need plans!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A10. Find small changes to make to ease yourself into larger lifestyle changes. Cold turkey rarely works out well.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FixedIncome should be a concept we appreciate now when spending, saving, and making financial decisions. #Moneyfromthesky ?? #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are able to  live within your means now it will make it easier to do the same if you have to after retiring. #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A9 Start saving now! The more you save the easier the transition to retirement will be. #DontGetCaughtEmptyHanded #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter likes to clip coupons with me. She also appreciates that generic is just as good as name brand!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell your child what financial decisions you're making and why. If money is a reason for a decision again explain why.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maginify_money When I did that my daughter truly learned the value of a dollar because it was HER dollar!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A8. Habit 1: Talk with them. If money becomes a touchy topic they may not ask questions or may not see finances as important.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use social media to get a leg up on financial knowledge! Tweetchats, Facebook posts, Pinterest. These can be good convo starters #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 Talk to your friends about financial topics. Ya never know what new info or ideas they might have!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A6 Couples shouldn't talk about money when they're tired, angry, etc. Find a better time to have the #MoneyTalk #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A7 Do your homework. Research topics, products, etc. Find what works best for you, not necessarily what is popular.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamZoo Definitely. Parents find it easier to talk about sex and drugs than talking about money with their children!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have the money talk before cohabitation and especially be in the habit of #MoneyTalk before marriage.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if one person handles bill-paying both should review statements, accounts. And both should contribute.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money date nights. Talk about financial goals, plans, current concerns, career goals, etc. Be candid. #MoneyTalk  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be knowledgeable about how credit can impact your finances (overages, fees, too much credit, debt ratio). Some ppl don't know. #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4 Resist the sale notices via email or text. Or unsubscribe so you're not tempted. On sale isn't always cost efficient for you. #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter has accrued a nice savings (about $400). She's 10. She loves the idea of saving now! #Biggerisbetter #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on a spending diet for a few weeks to see how money can add up (savings) when you don't spend unnecessarily.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@expgstockton I use Food on The Table to send me emails on local grocery sales and recipes for meals to go with them!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@payoff Visuals are good. I love to use visuals. They're great daily reminders to keep me on track with lots of goals!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have the mindset to start saving today instead of thinking you have time to save (for retirement, etc) later.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, should have said "Want's AREN'T bad". They aren't. But everything in moderation!  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A3. Knowing needs vs wants is a great place to start. Wants are bad, but know your financial limits, too.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelicam63 Alert messages (bill coming due, finance charges, credit limits, etc) are easy to set up and helpful.  #creditchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A2 Be aware of all the charges on all your accounts (bank, credit, cell, etc) #NoSurprises #creditchat<|endoftext|>
