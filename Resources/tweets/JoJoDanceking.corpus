<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics I agree. If it‚Äôs good enough for CNN and all the other biased media outlets to completely loose all their integrity, credibility and honor, why not? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera I get it. Your trying to be the friend that tells you when you have egg on your face. The difference is... a true  friend doesn‚Äôt announce it to everyone in the world. You are a fake friend. You could have spoken to him privately. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzydymna @realDonaldTrump @OANN You have a huge platform on social media. I have been shadow banned on Twitter for at least a year and continue to be.

<|startoftext|>@prchovanec @NYCNavid We don‚Äôt need Asian credibility.

<|startoftext|>@prchovanec @NYCNavid Americas 1st was a great policy that scared the global markets of the world.

The American people will lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano The fact that you pointed out that he has lost by such a large amount, should make you question those totals.

<|startoftext|>@AOC Only one race... The Human Race. The entire word is a misnomer. Another lie taught by those in power trying to separate us. The truth is, DT‚Äôs comments were not about race at all but ethnic backgrounds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@enews This is my 14yrs old daughters version of River Phoenix. A real tragedy.  RIP young B-Boy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennielovesjoy @ABC Are you familiar with the phrase ‚Äúopportunist‚Äù?   Your very talented but using a tragedy to make a name for yourself is shameful. Think of his family‚Äôs pain. Very disrespectful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph As if this term could ever apply to your situation... totally not what it‚Äôs meant for. Own up to the fact this was a stupid statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hodgetwins These dudes get it! Point well-made üëçüíØ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Did you think that stirring up trouble for these hard working, under paid, folks was gonna get you all warm and fuzzy responses? Your just another delusional politician with an ignorant view of the real world. Listen more, talk less....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Wow dude! Have a lil T.D.S. (Trump Derangement Syndrome) Lately? Even you have got to want a break sometime. Think ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù thoughts. üôÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods @SassCBrown @tedlieu Good to see you back Jim. Freedom!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi I love how you guys have taken a stand against compromise with POTUS and now have gotten so low, that you have to use children being treated inhumanly to make you look like your stance is honorable. What a shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If a person were to sneak into Disneyland or cut in line at 1 of the rides, people would be up in arms &amp; cheer when security escorts them out. Why is it so hard for Dems to comprehend this? Not everyone gets a free pass to Disneyland. You have to work hard to earn your ticket in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs so funny is that when millions of Americans were losing their homes and living in cars or on the streets, etc... none of these Politicians stood up and did anything about it... but God Forbid an illegal gets put in a refuge camp or sent home. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è SMH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC You criticize and provide no actual feasible answers to real world problems. That is not the definition of standing up for what‚Äôs right. Please stop claiming that you are helping the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I‚Äôm pretty sure all these asylum seekers are saying, ‚Äúthank God AOC is standing at the gate, yelling at the security guards, rather than delivering necessities and creating a real plan of action to allow us freedom in her district.‚Äù But don‚Äôt forget the video camera.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano You are such a bleeding heart liberal that it leaves me speechless. I swear you might think unicorns exist in this world. God bless you! Your amazing and interestingly fun to follow. I ‚ù§Ô∏è it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flutterbly1 @Alyssa_Milano @MsPackyetti This sounds like an interesting story... curious how the two coincide... explain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano This is what American freedom is! This is what makes America the greatest country on earth. Stop making this a moral issue. It‚Äôs ok for people to hate. They expose their hateful ways &amp; allows U the freedom to choose not to associate with them. Let them all march. It‚Äôs their right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FINALLEVEL OG status !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRobotDesign @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs simple... the economy is great. Unemployment is down. That matters more to people than personal opinions on morality. Plus, the Dems have no good candidates for winning the presidency. Y‚Äôall need star power!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The Dems have shown that they‚Äôre incapable of sound judgement in negotiating good deals for the American people. They need to go back to politics 101 and learn how to support the current presidency for the nation. We Don‚Äôt forget who Stupidly didn‚Äôt support the border wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Politics over profit...?! Not what I would call a smart $ move. It will be interesting to see how this affects the movie. Somehow... I think Georgia movie goers and other pro-life southern states might boycott any Hollywood film or actor who boycotts Georgia. Not a good $ move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 Well I applaud any effort to seek truth. Even though most online sources are not certified as credible but nowadays you can‚Äôt trust even the so-called credible ones. They all swing the narrative one way or another. Best of luck to ya! Thanks for the solid debate. It‚Äôs appreciated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 @WpgSafeCracker Side note... have you ever thought about how many lives are saved every year because of white men being armed with guns? There is two sides to every coin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 @WpgSafeCracker Hey at least you can admit you were wrong. And I grew up in LA in the late 80‚Äôs, these numbers as a whole don‚Äôt even compare to 1 year of gang violence during that time. Not to go out of this country but have you looked at cartel killings in Mexico. The problem is mental health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 Media hype &amp; stereotypes is part of the problem. 30 people get shot &amp; killed in Chicago every week but you don‚Äôt hear those stories do you? I hate to say it but your affected by media sway. Do you throw out a bushel of apples because one is bad? Stop generalizing over ethnicity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tlek90373305 @2Adling @lessliemichelle I was young once and thought that way too. Good luck to ya! I don‚Äôt want babies to die either. It‚Äôs sucks that this is a reality some women have to face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omldolanss Side note... have you ever thought about how many lives are saved every year because of people being armed with guns? There is two sides to every coin. The liberal media don‚Äôt publish those stories very often... do they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy_Tweets2 @omldolanss ‚ÄúLooks‚Äù is exactly the point. CNN was Guilty of using the word assault rifle till people had to put them in check and then they changed it to ‚Äúassault style rifle‚Äù. It‚Äôs a ridiculous farse Created by the media. I love the look of my modern assault style rifles. Carbine is great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 Well in that case, under your justification, Pretty much the majority of all men in this country are mass shooters. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tlek90373305 @2Adling @lessliemichelle There is 1000‚Äôs of people dying in wars all over the world, do you actively do anything about that? By allowing people to make their own decisions for their life and giving them options, is doing something about it. Would you rather them try to raise in poverty unwanted babies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annette50211914 @omldolanss If I have a tumor growing inside of me, is it my right to have it cut out? I don‚Äôt feel anyone should judge another person‚Äôs reasons for having an abortion until they have walked a day in that person‚Äôs shoes. That‚Äôs between God and themselves if it‚Äôs a sin. I‚Äôm pro-life not laws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geee_83 @omldolanss Right,  all the more reasons for the people to exercise their right to be allowed to arm themselves to the hilt... civilian tanks, planes, drones, grenades, etc... all good in my book, mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unknown__The @omldolanss Your right on track with that question... the liberal media has propagandized that word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omldolanss Yes it is. The idea of the second amendment is the ability to take back and keep in check a corrupt government. What chance would we have against our military if they are controlled by our corrupt government? I wish I could show you the difference. There is not enough time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShibuyaSlut Had only those kids been aborted... good point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ojos_azules11 Really, I don‚Äôt recall any rich white politicians going on a mass shooting spree...? You Silly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SincerelyJuanta @GovernorKayIvey Best argument I heard against that is the baby is an innocent life, the murderer, is not. Still I‚Äôm pro-choice for everyone else and I believe in the death penalty but I‚Äôm pro-life for my family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2Adling @lessliemichelle Do you really care that much? I‚Äôm curious. Because I‚Äôm pro-choice for everyone else but I‚Äôm pro-life for myself. That decision to kill a fetus is between them and their God. Who am I to judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omldolanss Guns aren‚Äôt the problem. I love guns! I love shooting them &amp; the ability to hunt &amp;  protect my family. But every woman deserves the right to choose what they do with their own body. It‚Äôs between them &amp; their God. I‚Äôm pro-life but that‚Äôs my choice. I‚Äôm pro-choice for everyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyRaynbow Here‚Äôs the deal with the abortion issue... if you‚Äôre not a pregnant woman facing a tough decision, you should just keep your opinion to yourself.

<|startoftext|>@KristySwansonXO Good for you Kristy! Political views should should not interfere with a solid acting career. Hollywood has gotten out of control. They have stepped outside of the red ropes and into people‚Äôs personal worlds. That to me is a violation. Good Luck to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones What are you suggesting? That‚Äôs where the real problem lies. People can pretend they are self aware of what‚Äôs going on in the world but when it comes to offering suggestions that doesn‚Äôt involve hate, All you hear is crickets.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think everyone gets what you‚Äôre doing. In a nationalist market, Tariffs against other non-US products makes sense But in a global economy, It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.

<|startoftext|>@RepKarenBass @Alyssa_Milano He literally states that only in the panhandle can you get away with the statement like that. Stop creating a false narrative. Makes you look desperate to find something to point fingers at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear you ignorant folks don‚Äôt get it... all this proves is once again, he is smarter than us.

<|startoftext|>@mickitiki They have only shut me down once for a sarcastic tweet but have me on a censored list that prevents me from voicing my anti-leftist opinions. I can co-sign you on this. It‚Äôs ridiculously biased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller Don‚Äôt you think if AOC truly believes in her cause, she would quit flying and driving in cars all over the place. This is the biggest farce created to garner attention.

<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN It‚Äôs the ‚Äútransgender‚Äù situation that is the problem. Just live your military life as the person you were born as &amp; your free to serve.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano This plan is brilliant. The cities that are pro-illegal immigration, should foster the burden. Teach the world how effectively they can resolve a difficult situation.

<|startoftext|>@tannerstake Exactly! A- mutha F‚Äôn MEN to that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Lynne_13 @laureemartell1 @Alyssa_Milano I can agree to that. it‚Äôs unfortunate that our tax dollars go to things that don‚Äôt actually help those in need. I work in healthcare. The caregiver wages are subpar and the corporate corruption is astronomical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eekthan @tedlieu @prageru That‚Äôs right but that wasn‚Äôt the point she was trying to make. She should have known better than to even answer a loaded ? like that knowing the dems would pick her apart for it. The way I heard it was not the same as you. That‚Äôs all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@prageru @tedlieu @RealCandaceO He‚Äôs a Typical Democratic. grasping at straws. Nothing in her statement suggests ‚Äúwhite‚Äù nationalism. He is taking a creative license leap to change the narrative. C.O. spoke about the word ‚ÄúNationalism‚Äù. He needs to quit adding his own propagandist agenda to the smear campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO They try to manipulate and spin everything to fit their propagandist agendas but truly intelligent people can see through it. Than their attempts and pleas look pitiful. It‚Äôs quite disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO Right! Keep it moving. They will never get it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @GOP @HouseJudiciary Typical Democratic... grasping at straws.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @cmclymer ...But you also didn‚Äôt dress or let anyone know at the time you were transgender.... you were dressed and acted like a us soldier.

<|startoftext|>@Vintage82Thycke @SchulteABC7 @ABC7Chicago @FOP7Chicago You have got to be playing devils advocate... because they had overwhelming evidence against this fool. I don‚Äôt understand why the feds don‚Äôt pick it up for under federal hate crime laws. That would be awesome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AwardsDarwin Imagine all his family and friends faces when he almost fell in the beginning... it‚Äôs amazing that he got up and finished the walk. I still gotta ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è when I think about why???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog What‚Äôs funny about all this is the fact that we have a president who openly spoke about just grabbing women by the pussy and just start kissing them... and couldn‚Äôt stop... creepy Joe touched a girls shoulders and Allegedly smelt her hair and kissed the back of her head... lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahPalinUSA Yeah well I‚Äôm down for it if you can prove you were a slave. My ancestors were a different type of slave but slaves non the less, so I‚Äôm gonna get in line for that check too... not sure where the money is going to come from but hell, as long as it‚Äôs used for a good cause. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Omar... if 1 person let alone 40,000 trespassed onto your land, you would call the cops claiming an emergency. Stop pretending this isn‚Äôt a serious problem. It makes all you Dems look stupid. Even Nancy recognizes it as a serious problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KelCampy @TalbertSwan How do you know the dog was his? It‚Äôs clearly next to the puncher... perspective my man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaimeMino @Alyssa_Milano Yes that might be true because you are a territory under the US. But your commonwealth laws actually govern the land unless challenged, then the US constitution presided. I consider you guys our citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isagarci9 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump United States citizenship is correct. On March 2, 1917, the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act was signed, collectively making Puerto Ricans United States citizens without rescinding their Puerto Rican citizenship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tats1216 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump My apologies... You are automatically US citizens by the US acknowledging you as a territory under the guidance of the Commonwealth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kruperti @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Not sure whom your referring to but if it is ‚ÄúI‚Äù... I would recommend researching it. As I have a very informed understanding of their situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan Re-read my first comment and tell me where I mentioned the ethnicity of the victim...? Do you even realize you are an ethnist who blames other ethnicities? Like I said, I don‚Äôt use the race card. It‚Äôs an argument that does not apply here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan And you proved mine... you legitimately have shown that you cannot separate one attack from another and are in fact, an ethnist. Someone who blindly blames another ethnicity for acts against another removed from that situation. My statement was in favor of fair treatment for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan No I didn‚Äôt. You have no clue my ethnic background and are assuming. I said I don‚Äôt play the race card... that‚Äôs the easiest way out of a difficult debate of a more serious problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Not technically... P.R. Is a US Territory like Guam or the Virgin Islands. They do not follow our Constitution and are not allowed to vote in our presidential elections. They are however allowed US citizenship as well as their own Commonwealth citizenship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan I think they are all circumstantial. Cops beating people on video don‚Äôt count. A lot of those cases are legit. Not all beaten are innocent either. But it might be a problem somewhere. I don‚Äôt play the race card. It happens to all Ethnicities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelCampy @TalbertSwan Is that the law?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelCampy @TalbertSwan I‚Äôm watching it from a small cell phone. I didn‚Äôt see the poke. But still, nowadays this shit is unnecessary. I didn‚Äôt see maga claims on there either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Nobody means to... some women are just plain over-sensitive liars. Just like some women are Wh*res. Some are B*tches. Some are scandalous as hell. Y‚Äôall need to stop believing everything you hear. We are not talking about sexual abuse. Get over it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano L.F. is out for fame! Why now? Her motive is weak. She is trying the man in the court of public opinion. That‚Äôs BS! Trying to throw dirt on a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Are you sure he‚Äôs not grabbing your ass in this photo...? Lol!  Nah, uncle Joe is a good dude who does creepy shit but only cuz Joe needs love too. I don‚Äôt think a woman who drops her story before a guy announces his run is legit. The fact She‚Äôs got fame over this is disgusting!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KelCampy @TalbertSwan 2 against 1 is pussy... and did you see the other guy put up his fists? No... stand your ground.. if this dude had a serious head trauma, those guys would go to prison for years. At least the puncher. Why couldn‚Äôt they just walk away? Time to grow up or face real consequences. üíØ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it lately every so-called ‚Äú#Woke‚Äù person I meet, tend to be clueless to how the real world works? I think we can do away with that term now... and you can go back to #artschool on your parents dime. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan I think Jussie Smollett might have ruined the legitimacy of this poor victims claim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan Looks like 2 pussies bullying a solo drunk white dude walking away, then sucker punching him, to me... and That is actually a felony assault.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @MarkRuffalo @lenadunham @KristaVernoff @PedroPascal1 @BrianKempGA This is nothing more than a rich, privileged, temper tantrum. This is not how politics is done in this country. Play by the rules that made this country great. Understand your views are not the only views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Yes... but punishing the hard working industry folks for something they have no control over is evil. You need to widen your perspective. Your actions would hurts thousands of families. Children‚Äôs lives would be altered. Not everyone has your ability to go without work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminEnfield I‚Äôve been working for &amp; with develop mentally disabled &amp; physically challenged/handicapped people for the past 25 years.

<|startoftext|>@dklottis @Nick86433390 @AndreaIPickens1 @ScottPresler @IlhanMN Sounds like a lot of bleeding heart, self-deprecating, white privileged guilt to me...

<|startoftext|>@RobinParnell4 @ScottPresler @IlhanMN This is sarcasm, right...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics I think you might be missing the point of his genius...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathinott @Alyssa_Milano Yeah I think this is a pretty simple topic with very complex answers. There is no right or wrong. Every case is subjectI‚Äôve, unique, circumstantial and about perspective. Government should have no say in this matter but taxpayers should not foot the bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano I may disagree with you on a lot of topics but I definitely agree with you on this. The Government should have no power over the right of a woman to choose. Her body, her choice! They should start a incentive plan like Subway used to run... After the 6th one, the 7th Is free! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeverTrumpusa16 @RepAdamSchiff I‚Äôm pretty sure standing by your president of your country and working towards his platform he was elected on... makes you not a traitor... but feel free to change the definition to what fits your narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustineTyme2 @RepAdamSchiff Funny... they created the term #TDS to describe the opposition. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@human_0_0_ @RepAdamSchiff He was wrong. End of story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionNole @RepAdamSchiff He diverted millions of dollars in resources for his biased personal attack and smear campaign of a sitting president.

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff This is why not every kid should get a trophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi I agree, you need the report so you can justify the horrible way you‚Äôve been treating a sitting president. Once again when you find out you‚Äôve wasted millions$ &amp; wreaked havoc on this country, will you finally own up to it and apologize or will you find another way to sabotage us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@souljaboy That‚Äôs what everyone says<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HealingMB No. I am tasked with preserving the species for the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Chuck this will blow your mind... the word racism and racist is a misnomer. Most people of this era have no idea that scientifically there is only 1 race. The human race!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah yeah just come up with a plan and release it to the people as soon as possible. We‚Äôve all heard your rhetorical talk many times. It‚Äôs time for you to put your money where your mouth is. I‚Äôll support you then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN I wonder what he‚Äôll talk about....?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So there is a lot of countries criticizing us for not letting immigrants into this country. Let‚Äôs make them put their money where their mouth is.

<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @chuckwoolery Yeah Twitter censors my views all the time. I‚Äôm waiting for the class action lawsuit. I‚Äôm in on that. DT was right on that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN And your suggestion to fix the problem is what...? Oh I see, your a complainer without a solution.  You may be a lucky immigrant who got in and Were able to better herself but this is a real problem with no easy solutions. Try to come up with one. I dare you...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN A good dude but way too much ethnically driven answers.   My ancestors were slaves to the British for 1000 yrs. and since the British helped colonize America, do my kids qualify for special bonds too?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiPubSchools @ChicagosMayor Mr. Mayor, now that the state can no longer prosecute Jussie Smollett, what about turning the case over to the Feds under the Federal hate-crime laws? Justice could still be served!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @DEADLINE Wow! I never thought I‚Äôd see the day where @Alyssa_Milano wouldn‚Äôt tweet about a huge story... well here it is, nothing about Jussie Smollett! Shocker! You know this is a travesty of justice and yet still not a peep. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You wanna be a hero DT? Have your boys at the FBI Indite Jussie Smollett under federal hate-crime charges.  The state dropped the ball, now the Feds can pick it up and run with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaferWeigel So why isn‚Äôt Jussie Smollett indicted under federal hate-crime charges than? The state dropped the ball, now the Feds can pick it up and run with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods So why isn‚Äôt Jussie Smollett indicted under federal charges than? The state dropped the ball, now the Feds can pick it up and run with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods The word racism or racist is a misnomer. Scientifically, There is only 1 race, ‚Äúthe Human race‚Äù! Look it up!

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff ... and after you see it, will you publicly apologize to president DT and his family? Only if you can honorably answer yes to this question, do you even deserve to see one single page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom A bunch of whiners. This is why not every kid should get a trophy. These Snowflakes grow up and eventually run biased news organizations like #CNN or write for the #washingtonpost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Yes this appears to be true. The best part of all this is simply the fact that we have gotten reprieve from the Dems whining over Barr‚Äôs 4 page summary clearing Our president of collusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Great choice of words! This does reek of government corruption and the overstepping of their reach. How come your the only one who has criticized the judge on this case. He should be called out more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec I said this from day 1 of this false story. Check my Twitter history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stclairashley My 13 yr old daughter just amazed me by telling me that the feminist movement is unnecessary and biased nowadays.

<|startoftext|>@stclairashley Her face at the end was priceless. That‚Äôs the face of somebody who has so many Yes people around them, They‚Äôre not used to seeing people give them some much-needed shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stclairashley This dude Obviously is turning states evidence on somebody around him. I‚Äôm going to say he snitched on his drug dealer. That could be the only deal that they made for them to completely Expunge his record. The grand jury couldn‚Äôt have been that far off the mark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stclairashley You‚Äôre onto something there lady. Let the civil suits begin...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN This is corruption at its finest. And for some reason, it stems from the Obama‚Äôs. A grand jury investigated him and found he was guilty of 16 Felonies. Where is the justice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN They are out to smear you and do anything they can to get you, that‚Äôs for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Yes they are out to get you, that‚Äôs for sure...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN TY for speaking honestly and frankly using the proper dialogue against societies enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Do you ever think about switching parties? It would appear that your Democratic Party has literally scorched, tarnished, defamed and left you out to dry. Your first amendment rights should always have been protected. I think you should run as an Independent next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Hopefully the Police take aim at the judge in this case and bring him down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods They learned from the Clintons...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs obvious JS snitched out his dealer and is going to testify in order to get everything dropped. He is going to send another man to prison for his wrong-doings. Thats why they are sealing the file. That‚Äôs f‚Äôd up!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I love how Don thinks it‚Äôs ok to be tough on the president.. was he tough on Obama? #CNN is one of the most hypocritical Media sources out there.

<|startoftext|>@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN This should give you guys some to talk about for the next two years... Lol. Meanwhile, I‚Äôll never trust #CNN ‚Äòs propaganda machine ever again. They were only wrong on 90% of their stories this year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1776Stonewall It‚Äôs a good idea but I‚Äôm still kinda pissed that trump didn‚Äôt give the middle class the tax cuts we deserve... instead of the rich. if he focuses on that in the next two years, I believe he‚Äôll get 4 more years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Trump was a private citizen at the time of this alleged interference... who‚Äôs watch was the country under? Who‚Äôs job was it to protect the American people? Oh that‚Äôs right, a Democrat named Obama. Keep trying to lie and change the Narrative. Move on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Murple10 @TwitterMoments And that wasn‚Äôt their job to protect the American people from Election interference. His administration wasn‚Äôt in charge.

<|startoftext|>@Murple10 @TwitterMoments The investigation was a big waste of time, created by sore losers, fostered by corrupt media.

<|startoftext|>@robreiner Anyone who uses hate &amp; separatist words like racist or racism are ignorant. There is scientifically only 1 race.

<|startoftext|>@SpintheVinyl @6thJared @CathyKoo I swear people think a rifle needs to look like your Grandpas old Winchester... it‚Äôs funny to me. These weapons are just modernized.

<|startoftext|>@jake_penguin @RyanTreeFiddy @CathyKoo Ummm no... the pistol grip aids in accuracy when holding a long weapon.

It also allows for easier/faster lifting from a lowered position. ‚ÄúMilitary style‚ÄùMisnomer just means a modern looking rifle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN One of the dumbest statements ever made. Why is #cnn pushing all this hate, prejudice, discrimination and bigotry all the time? They are the only News source that constantly is trying to create division. Agenda perhaps...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leah35766015 @sianoresist There‚Äôs a term for that... it‚Äôs called T.D.S. = a mental disorder called ‚ÄúTrump Derangement Syndrome‚Äù. It‚Äôs sweeping the nation. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzydymna As much of a boob the guy might be, he really never did get a fair shot as president. It‚Äôs pretty obvious they set their sights on destroying him from the get go.

Haters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@backyeardly @Amgela38883764 @LubyLucette @imraansiddiqi Not so sure anymore... And I don‚Äôt buy the black immigrant muslim woman argument. She got into politics.

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Had you just shut your ego down, closed your pie hole and negotiated a reasonable border plan, by making non-compromising, concessions, none of us would have to endure this Bureaucratic Malarkey.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Hate is not a crime. Acting on hate is a crime. Organized efforts to hurt other ethnic groups should be targeted like any other terrorist organization, what ever ethnicity of the group.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Amgela38883764 @backyeardly @LubyLucette @imraansiddiqi I think we might be arguing the same point... in a sense. You can‚Äôt trust BS media...? But for real, I live in Mn.

<|startoftext|>@Aeophile @CNN Anderson Cooper comes from an extremely wealthy family and was privileged to say the least. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some library bought and paid for in His background to get him where he is today. Maybe even through nepotism. Check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @DonaldJTrumpJr A.M. the word racism is a misnomer created to cause division. There is only 1 race. The human race! with multitudes of ethnicities. When you speak science, you should probably do a lil more research. Stop being a pawn in someone else‚Äôs game. The correct term: prejudice &amp; bigotry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN It says nothing about race or religion or any of the divisive techniques your going to attempt using #cnn... this is a have &amp; have nots/class problem. There is no mention of ethic background as a reason they committed fraud. Let alone look no further than your own Anderson Cooper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs all about the Benjamin‚Äôs baby! They know the costs associated with going this route and realize the intense scrutiny they would face once revealed. Plus, the political backlash/Suicide would crush the party. Better to walk away Constructing their own fake reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@backyeardly @LubyLucette @Amgela38883764 @imraansiddiqi But thedailybeast and Twitter is a reliable news source. Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pappiness Sounds fishy to me. I‚Äôd hate to see this turn into a media circus mistake i/e JS and Covington C.S. Incident. Then you‚Äôd all have to retract statements and feel stupid again. Think I‚Äôll wait to hear a guilty verdict before trying a man in the social media court of public opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi Yeah they oppose the fake emergency... but not the wall! Nice work there. You should pat yourself on the back,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Maybe you should have taken up the idea that negotiations and concessions were the way to go instead of letting your ego get in the way. Now your costing the American people more by having to deal with all this legal BS. I thought you guys were supposed to be smart... thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano I don‚Äôt believe you actually stated your opinion on the matter A.M.   So what exactly do you think and believe on the subject? If your so inclined to defend it, you should state your reasons for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadMac_It @missmissykins @Alyssa_Milano Are you able to prove otherwise? Does this bill not open the door to interpretation based on the wants of the host and unconsciousable ability of the Doctor to terminate a non-fetus? It‚Äôs a slippery slope...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_dol @Alyssa_Milano I‚Äôm glad you learned about your spacial place in the world. Now it might blow your mind to know that the word racism is a misnomer.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Awe A.M. you sold out to the social justice haters out there. You apologized cuz a few whiners complained... that breaks my heart.

<|startoftext|>@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I hate the fact that someone so congested with biased, fact-less, opinions, written on cue cards for him to read by his masters... is spot on!

<|startoftext|>@IamGMJohnson @Alyssa_Milano I can‚Äôt stand when people advocate for causes that aren‚Äôt their own.

<|startoftext|>@LPtallnfun @RyanAFournier If you want to know how misguided your verbiage is, just note, the word race, racism &amp; racist are misnomers used to cause division &amp; hate. We are all one Race. The Human Race! Look it up. It‚Äôs science! There are multiple ethnicities &amp; proper derogatory terms: prejudice &amp; bigotry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier The word Racist and Racism are misnomers created to cause division and hate.

<|startoftext|>@GOP @GOPChairwoman So, your advocating for a law that bans free speech in America? Anti-Semitism talk is a choice that people make. That‚Äôs on them.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano You offend people daily... Never apologize! You are showing your humanity. People are choosing to read or listen to you. It‚Äôs open to interpretation. You are not a coward. You express opinion and create dialogue. Some good, some bad, so be it. Don‚Äôt loose your integrity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano I feel U on the quote but there‚Äôs a flip side to it. It should read, ‚Äúwhatever you can understand, you love and it becomes who you are‚Äù is more accurate.

<|startoftext|>@simon34093637 @RealJamesWoods Similar but different. More than 24.1% of the world's population is Muslim.

<|startoftext|>@VenkaylaHaynes It took Wade Robson 20 plus years to come out and acknowledge the sexual abuse he faced under Michael Jackson. These girls just need time and separation from R. In time, they will see the light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon34093637 @RealJamesWoods I have spoken with them multiple times on the Koran. What most Christians don‚Äôt know, is that they basically have the same stories in it as our bible.

<|startoftext|>@tuesdaymalone @bri_sacks Haha... good point! Maybe to a foreign jail only. Where he learns what it‚Äôs like to shit in a bucket in the corner and is forced into sexual situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon34093637 @RealJamesWoods I‚Äôm from Minnesota. The Somali immigrants cause little to No problems here and love our country. They don‚Äôt follow or subscribe to the views of the radicals in the Middle East. I speak almost daily with some of them. Good, honest people. Don‚Äôt believe the media and gov propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VLWorthy @RealJamesWoods Also one thing to note, the hijackers that hit the world trade centers, were mainly Muslim radicals from Saudi Arabia. One of our biggest economic allies. Even Bin Laden was a Saudi. Know the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VLWorthy @RealJamesWoods I‚Äôm not judging but If you have never met or spoken to a Muslim American, you owe it to yourself and them to attempt to move beyond the media and gov. propaganda designed to cause division and hate, towards another culture. We may not be the same but we want the same out of life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VLWorthy @RealJamesWoods So I live in Mn and work with many Different religious people, including Muslim Americans, who became citizens from another country. I urge you to strike up a conversation with any of them if you get a chance. Seriously some good, honest, God fearing, people. They want peace too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnPen83554397 @RealJamesWoods exactly what statement are you referring too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I think that might have been a lightning bolt from Allah...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX @IlhanMN Or at some point... just realize it‚Äôs ok to not have the same opinion on things and leave it up to Mn and her constituents to decide her fate.   Why is everybody so fragile nowadays? Just let it be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods So because she‚Äôs a Muslim, she‚Äôs not allowed to have a difference of opinion to American Governmental Policies? We should just denounce her views by calling her a racist or Anti-Semite in the media. That‚Äôll teach her.   Anyone else seeing how this game is being played???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lelesayshi @RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs because Twitter is run by liberals. I have been silenced by Twitter many times for punking leftist ideas with Sarcasm. They don‚Äôt like it but seem to love to popularize promoted tweets about these two Dems.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bri_sacks Try jumping up all emotional, pointing your finger &amp; beating your chest with the judge like you did Gayle. See how far that gets you.

<|startoftext|>@mannyfidel @wynnsworld Right... and that movie would have flopped. Reality check, the largest consumer base for Movies in America is the white middle class. They are playing to their crowd. Not everything has to be a message to right the wrongs of society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mannyfidel ‚ÄúNot good‚Äù lol. Not really... they are good for white people‚Äôs egos.

<|startoftext|>@Rharvley @tictoc I think everyone can agree a flat tax with no write-offs for anything but children, health and mortgage interest is the fairest and best way to go. My suggestion would be closer to the 23-25% rate. Everyone and everything we would need to make us live a good American life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaseyLoewer @Pwrweeks @tictoc You bring up a good point but I‚Äôm sure there could be a stipulation that removes farmers from that equation. The problem is, the rich will take advantage of any loopholes they can find. Most will shift their estate to a farm to avoid paying more taxes on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN @MidoriOCD Please continue to speak up, even if your wrong or lose in the long run, at least you‚Äôll have your integrity. Something missing from politicians nowadays. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepEliotEngel @IlhanMN They want you to play the role of a terrorist... then be a terrorist on the floor of Congress with your voice. Your constituents elected you. Fight for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @AOC Only 1 Race... the Human Race! Racism is a misnomer created by elitists to proliferate a false Narrative. Acknowledge the scientific proof and let‚Äôs correct our vocabulary. The proper terms are bigotry and prejudice. There are many different ethnicities under our 1 race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTylerZed Why is she not allowed to have an opinion? She can criticize whatever policies our government practices she wants. She was elected by her constituents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Exactly... Pro-Choice has it‚Äôs benefits! ...for conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_relman @AOC That‚Äôs common for that age. Less people = Less of a future problem. I encourage them to follow through. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods What? Don‚Äôt you need a birth certificate to apply for those? Very disconcerting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump A wall wouldn‚Äôt hurt the problem but will it solve the crisis...? That is the question<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @FoxNews If you are innocent and have nothing to hide, then why do you continue to try to persuade us they are lying... it makes you look guilty. Just stop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuomoPrimeTime In other words... ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs throw it against the wall and see if we can get something to stick!‚Äù #CNN has become the weapon of an overly propagandized subversive media nation of advantageously corrupted hype. Read between the lines...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Damn Jim... that‚Äôs very unsympathetic of you and cold hearted... But I guess if she‚Äôs going to put her business out there, it‚Äôs fair game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods @GOP It‚Äôs called quiet confidence... but indifference will burn them all in the end. They‚Äôve already lost the house, what‚Äôs next? Time for a change Jim, let‚Äôs rid us of these bipartisan politics and create a better, more independent future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Like you, Mr. President, she is entitled to her opinion. She was elected by her constituents. Let them decide her fate and stay out of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano That‚Äôs great news! I only wish my friends whom have died from the disease could have held on long enough to see this day. RIP to those who‚Äôve come and gone from the disease and prayers for the family &amp; friends of them. God Bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dawnparagracias @alx Yeah you never know but the video doesn‚Äôt lie. It‚Äôs awfully funny how there is not an actual location or a name of the school in the story...? I would say this is a fake story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dawnparagracias @alx Are you seriously excusing her actions...? I once saw a teacher beat the shit out of a kid in school with no repercussions. This may be far from that but her targeting him for his beliefs is where she crossed the line. No teacher has the right to put their hands on a student ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Randall_65 @Alyssa_Milano Haha! True.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@future_majority That‚Äôs right! Go get ‚Äòem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano I‚Äôm so proud of you for not calling it racism. We need to shift that dialogue to the proper terms which are bigotry and prejudice. The word racist or racism is a misnomer. Based on science, There is only one race. the Human Race! We are in this together. Thanks for acknowledging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Yes that‚Äôs true but people spending more on taxes to pay for it doesn‚Äôt help either. This has been proposed many times but yet the funding for it has never made sense. Find the way to fund it properly first, then everyone will jump on board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano How anyone could find what Jaden is doing to be a negative, is beyond me. He clearly is a Republican and is taking matters in his own hand by donating his own time and money and not relying on the government or government handouts to fix the problem. Respect!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Randall_65 @Alyssa_Milano You mean more than the celebrity/actor/reality tv star/athlete(golfer) in the White House now.... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alx Looks to me like she wrapped it around his neck as if to try to strangle him.  There is no cause or excuse for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes Mr. President... but no other president has ever had so many statements fact checked and ended up being lies or gross exaggerations of the truth. Minor embellishments we will accept but outright lies. Come on... your only fooling yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brucebuffer That‚Äôs awesome! Your next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano You and my wife would get along... she loves them too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ The word Racism is a misnomer perpetuating a false Narrative that does not exist. There is only one race... the Human Race with multiple ethnicities. Check the science. Correct term is bigotry and prejudice. But y‚Äôall don‚Äôt hear me though... we must remove the word from our vocab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ One ‚ù§Ô∏è? Not sure brah if that‚Äôs how it works but I feel you. White people like that need to get a grip on reality. That is not an offense that needed police intervention. Good luck to ya!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @HowardU No time like the present to shamefully plug yourself... how about mentioning the actual issues.  Self promotion at it‚Äôs finest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Yes and the Reps believe extremely...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycjim Censorship at its finest...far-left spew unsubstantiated claims day in, day out. Twitter never suspends or deletes them or their biased comments.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo CC I agree with the statement above but please stop using the word Race or Racist. It is a misnomer. There is only 1 race. The Human Race!

<|startoftext|>@atmosphere In my opinion, JaRule may not be the dopest but we all know... The more successful you are, the more hate it brings. You just shake it off and keep it moving... life‚Äôs too short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano If 1 strange person, let alone 34,000 a month were coming thru your fenced in yard, you would call 911 and pray the cops take it as an emergency... but for some reason, you overly biased Libs, don‚Äôt see it that way. Once something bad happens to your family, you‚Äôd change Ur mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN He was great in that movie. Watched it with the family and remembered how awesome Freddy Mercury and Queen truly was. Legends! Thank you young Rami for aspiring to be an Oscar winning actor. Respect!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msradiohost Thank You! I can agree that maybe the shame he will have to live with for the rest of his life might be enough. Taking attention &amp; resources away from the good people of Chicago might be better served if he works lots of community service hours w/true victims and pays big finesüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones Good! Let‚Äôs get rid of them and the Republican Party and create newer, more focused on actually building up this country, modern, parties that don‚Äôt play partisan politics with the American people‚Äôs livelihoods. Good Riddance!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom Not really... our Founding Fathers would see the strength in educating the people of this country, not just the ones who can afford it... and I‚Äôm not a fan of Bernie. You must hold stock in some company that serves colleges, to be so short-sighted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nythomas98 @JonKisselKissel @WalshFreedom @billmaher Tom, I like your rhetoric on the Snowflakes but I think you miss the point on the benefit... of what he said. All those things he listed in his monologue are not beneficial to middle Americans. It‚Äôs a loss of control in their way of life. If they wanted that, they would just move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NittyOfficial @JonKisselKissel @WalshFreedom @billmaher ...Because stuffing envelopes and cardboard boxes, in a giant shipping factory, for $12 an hour, under the richest man in America, for hours and days on end, for Uber commercialism... is a much healthier, better alternative? Lol. I think you missed the true irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKisselKissel @WalshFreedom @billmaher If you missed the politically arrogant undertones, you might have heard that message... others could actually hear what he really was saying... and he‚Äôs 100% out of touch and wrong. But maybe his $10 latte and overpriced weed got the best of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@will_ginth Good thing he‚Äôs only a comedian...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newsweek This is typically the way middle Americans think of big cities... ‚Äúa great place to visit but I don‚Äôt have any desire to live there. Way too noisy, crowded and not enough nature‚Äù. I think Bill misses the point...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billmaher If only the business world would take BM‚Äôs Comedic advice... we would be so much better off. That‚Äôs why Bill is worth billions right? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TTeenbean007 Next time Bill gets an $8 coffee and is charged $150 to change a flat tire after waiting 1.5 hrs in traffic, maybe he‚Äôll reflect on these comments and realize who the real dumbasses of the world are.

<|startoftext|>@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein I see nothing wrong here. You guys need to spend more time trying to build on something rather than trying to destroy a woman‚Äôs career.

<|startoftext|>@msradiohost Ditto! Definitely jail time. Dude committed a hate crime against humanity. He needs to be tried as any other hate monger.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBudden Lol! These dudes were straight amateurs. They bought the rope and the face masks all on the same day! Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HonkeyCrisis The difference was RL came out and publicly owned up to it and faced his sentence... that‚Äôs real talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vjja310 @SUBWAY What do ya pay for that...?  5 years! Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@androstoney @CNN This is a crime against humanity. Black and white can agree.,. Hate is hate. This was an orchestrated hate crime and he should be punished accordingly. End of story. God Bless!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Nobody will ever hold another Minority responsible for Jussie‚Äôs Actions. We are one race! This man committed a hate crime against humanity.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano So, when exactly do you side with the Freedoms granted in the Constitution?

<|startoftext|>All this ‚Äúmodern world‚Äôs‚Äù politically correct rhetoric has led the Celebrities and Popular people to kowtow to any critical assault by social media out of fear of losing their livelihood.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano It‚Äôs not ok... but it is the reality of the modern world we live in. We can‚Äôt go back. We also can‚Äôt punish good people for bad people‚Äôs actions.

<|startoftext|>@AOC @RepSarbanes They also were historically Pro-Slavery and the Jim Crow laws...? A Republican ended slavery. They hold POC down with their biased programs. How can anyone ever trust the Democratic Party again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Say, what happened to your Nick Sandman/Nathan P. Story you had pinned? Did you take it down after you found out he is suing all those slanderous claims made against him...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @EllisFromPhilly That‚Äôs a good woman.  My wife does almost all of those things on a daily basis but adds a full time job in there as well. She‚Äôs amazing! Our house wouldn‚Äôt run without her. I appreciate her so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LLinWood It‚Äôs such a fine line... public opinion vs actual fact. Defamation is a real thing and this could open the door to millions of these type of lawsuits. If BM loses he should sue his source of the video he watched. Start the media blame game to end further false accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimCable007 @LLinWood So U watched the whole video then? Because in the video, you would see NP move into NS‚Äôs space &amp; begin to beat his drum in his face. He was the antagonist. Then proceeded to say the boy didn‚Äôt  permit him to pass. Which ultimately defamed him &amp; labeled him. He lied about V.V. too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Wow! Now let‚Äôs do all you women without makeup, hair coloring/extensions, fake eyelashes, etc... who‚Äôs up first? No takers! I wonder why...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usatodaylife @Alyssa_Milano Don‚Äôt you think the current policies work? After all, these men have been outed and criminalized in this time. What areas need changing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimCable007 @LLinWood Did you watch the full 1.5 hr video. Most that did saw a completely different side to the story and sided with the boys. The boys thought Nathan was bringing music to them and were enjoying it. NS was targeted cuz he was just standing there. Ever wonder why the media dropped it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newyorknewart That‚Äôs not racist at all... it‚Äôs quite the opposite. His ability to get a gaming license for a casino is being rejected because he‚Äôs not American Indian and is being discriminated &amp; turned down because his ethnicity is Caucasian &amp; he doesn‚Äôt live on a reservation. That‚Äôs F‚Äôd up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1691UK Lyrically only Jay Z/Nas can come close to Eminem. But lil Wheezy is probably next in line.

<|startoftext|>@Hosscaptn1 @bk00023 @ewarren I didn‚Äôt say raise taxes... I said pay their percentage share. = with everyone else. A flat # in 20-30% max range, no write-offs.  How can you argue that wouldn‚Äôt be better...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hosscaptn1 @bk00023 @ewarren Like the privatized hospitals don‚Äôt have bureaucracy? How much goes to Bonuses, thwarted to unnecessary areas or gets mismanaged. We both can agree, hospitals are an economic nightmare for everyone but the ownership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony18392503 @Chris_1791 I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I own a mural painting company. Under Obama‚Äôs first couple years I did ok. Towards the end I was struggling to turn a profit.

<|startoftext|>@CNN Every trip for all presidents since Clinton has been about 3 million a trip. His would be about 1.6 million over.

<|startoftext|>@Hosscaptn1 @bk00023 @ewarren That‚Äôs true. I wonder though if the hospitals, etc... were publicly owned and the revenue went back into the Counties or state &amp; the rich pay their Percentage share of taxes, if we all would be better off. I personally would prefer that than waiting for Hand outs From rich people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewPollackFL @PollackHunter As despicable as this is... I cannot blame this guy. He might not be a hero like they make movies about but he didn‚Äôt pull the trigger in their deaths. Very few people would race into a gun fight unarmed. Did he make mistakes yes. Could he have done more, maybe. Fear took over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bk00023 @ewarren They do that for tax write offs... or guilt. Rarely for true philanthropic reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Flat tax, same rate for everyone, no write-offs.   It‚Äôs fair. Nobody can complain and that would add trillions to the revenue base.   Only people who don‚Äôt want this is the rich who create laws to help them hide and squander their assets. The greedy should be Eliminated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewPollackFL Some of the greatest accomplishments come from the most horrific tragedies. I applaud your drive to make change &amp; hold those responsible for what happened. I would hope I would have the strength and fortitude to do the same if that happened to my family. I Respect you. Good luck<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent So it‚Äôs racists to use the word ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù before describing a person??? That‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano It‚Äôs sick and it‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs a sign of much deeper problems with our society.

<|startoftext|>@_centrist__ @conscious_sis @heatherscope Finally, someone who thinks outside the party box! Yes. Why the dems haven‚Äôt figured it out, is why they are probably gonna lose again. They need to be who they claim to be and not try to play partisan dirty politics. It doesn‚Äôt suit them. It‚Äôs not their style and will backfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conscious_sis @MamaGray1024 @_centrist__ @heatherscope Well I guess you know me better than I do... what was I thinking? Your right, all those years I voted Dem and Indy, I really should have just voted Rep. Thx for telling me who I am. I would have never known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_centrist__ @conscious_sis @MamaGray1024 @heatherscope I‚Äôm very strategic too and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. They could have been hero‚Äôs and not let ego get in the way. Everyone knows who DT is but now we know, they potentially could be worse. It was a bad move.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MusicIndustry_t One of the places that makes the most money is music education. They charge a lot for accredited schools and yet don‚Äôt have solid industry placement.

<|startoftext|>@5angelsfrankie @staceydash She doesn‚Äôt need a job. She‚Äôs doing just fine. I love how intolerant some people are to any opposition.

<|startoftext|>@MamaGray1024 @_centrist__ @heatherscope Were the democrats not elected to find solutions. I‚Äôm an Independent &amp; can honestly say the Dems came off looking worse.

<|startoftext|>@_centrist__ @heatherscope Well said. Even my wife, a liberal Dem, said why are they calling it ‚Äúcaving‚Äù? How about using phrases like ‚Äúagreed to opening the government‚Äù instead. They look like bullies. Give credit to doing the right thing for the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerosibrian @BurghHelens @heatherscope Reculticans &amp; the Demoncrats... when will people wise up and move away from partisan politics and rid themselves of political parties. The future is now. Go Independent!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BurghHelens @heatherscope I feel like the Democrats missed an opportunity to look like selfless heroes by working with the president &amp; negotiating a deal.

<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti But the boys didn‚Äôt walk into the March, the march walked into them with intentional purpose. That‚Äôs the difference... misguided but intentionally aimed at disruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti Life is about perspective. Yours, mine and the people actually involved in the incident.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Propaganda! Stop posting purported BS. Have you not wondered why mainstream media hasn‚Äôt pick up on this story? Because it doesn‚Äôt exist in reality. You are spreading the lies of bots and don‚Äôt even know it. Do better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethgodbee @MsPackyetti This wasn‚Äôt aimed at you @mspackyetti... @bethgodbee Didn‚Äôt appreciate my take and blocked me.  Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti Either way, there is two sides and both are somewhat guilty. NP was the antagonist in the situation. The kids reacted immature. It can be expected. We teach them to stand up to bullies and give them way more rights then I had as a kid. Plus, they had way less life experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti Also, NP is not an elderly man, he‚Äôs 62 and lied about being a Vietnam Veteran. If  a grown man would walk up to inches within your face and start beating a drum and chanting, WWYD? If it happened to my teenage son, I would have got inbetween it. He was 16 vs a man 4x his age<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti If you watched an hour long video, you watched a shortened version.

<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti Just because you have permit doesn‚Äôt mean you get to walk into other groups. There is no right of way.

<|startoftext|>@Phoebes89 @aeurton31 @benegesserit7 @jus_marmar @MsPackyetti The video is actually 1.45hrs long. You might have missed a lot. Also, the kids got an hour to roam free at the monument and told to meet up at the stairs where they were Continuously verbally Assaulted by the bhl‚Äôs. Nathan chose the kids to aim for.

He was an antagonist bully attacking red-blooded White American values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethgodbee @MsPackyetti Your liberal biased, bleeding-heart, white guilted empathetic, keyboard critical analysis, past painful experienced grievances, limited perspective, subjected, unsubstantiated, purported, conjectured stance is ignorance personified.

<|startoftext|>@Asturisk1 @1point_in_time @MsPackyetti Completely wrong on all your biased facts. They video made by the bhl‚Äôs was actually 1.45hrs &amp; was positioned right smack in the middle of the mall. They first attacked the Natives. The kids had an 1hr to roam free. Told to meet up at the steps. they did &amp; ended up in the mix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Polite_Lion @AllieMcCormackK @Cythim @MsPackyetti Makes sense...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravenewfilms @MsPackyetti Nobody faults him for doing that.

<|startoftext|>@allithon @Uncle_Jimbo This joking rape comment from a 15yr old boy, was made after the black Israelites yelled comments about the catholic alter boys being raped by the priests. They were making light of the B.I.‚Äôs ridiculous comment. Stop spreading propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Uncle_Jimbo It‚Äôs absolutely appalling to me that the liberal biased media continues to act like bully Nathan is the victim. These kids, let me say it again, kids, especially Nick, have been unjustly tried in the court of public opinion &amp; painted as racists over a 15 sec.clip in a 1.5hr video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano It‚Äôs legal. It‚Äôs one of the powers that the president has. There a few different ways he can go about getting the money for the wall but I don‚Äôt think he really ever thought he would have had to go this route. I‚Äôm pretty sure he thought the Dems would just give in and negotiate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesLCarter3 @TaraAnnThieke @TODAYshow Here, here. I did too and initially wanted to know both sides to the story. I‚Äôm glad I researched it out. Now I back the kids.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BHL1971 @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie Sure bud... now you show your weak hand. You‚Äôre a bleeding heart sympathizer of an era you never even lived in. Because if you did understand history you would know Native Americans were very savage against other tribes. You should probably learn history not Lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Wrong again. I am an independent and I can tell you, the shut down is currently at fault of the Democrats not coming to the table and giving concessions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heatherwhoever @TODAYshow @NBCNews @SavannahGuthrie I think anyone who watches the full 1.5 hr video vs the 2 min snippet actually see the truth. You guys have a skewed media version. Take time to seek out the video, watch it, then form an opinion. There‚Äôs a reason cnn/nbc have apologized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHL1971 @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie A good question. A better question, why is a grown man trying to antagonize a kid just standing there. Because he was a bully trying to prove a point. If a bully ran up on your kid, what would I do or feel? 62 yr old antagonist liar vs 16 yr old inexperienced at life. Fair fight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EKinnamon @TODAYshow @NBCNews @SavannahGuthrie Because the elder created the situation &amp; walked thru the crowd &amp; invaded the kids space &amp; began banging his drum in his face. How you don‚Äôt see that this grown ass man at fault is mind blowing. He was a bully picking on a kid. 62yrs old vs 16 inexperienced at life class fld trip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whoulooknat @BIGLAWU @TODAYshow What most who didn‚Äôt watch the full video missed was when the chaperones moved them back away from trying to have an informative talk w/the Black Israelites. Also, they were told they could walk around the monument and meet back at the steps in an hour. They were following rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABShik @TODAYshow @WLWT Wait,,, teenage boys acting like teenage boys to get a females attention...?  They should be tried and go to jail for that!  How dare they!  Lol!!! Ridiculous!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraAnnThieke @CharlesLCarter3 @TODAYshow But how many really saw it with their own eyes? How many were there or even watched the whole video, not just this 2 minute snippet. Only then can you technically state you saw it. After watching it, I backed the kids. They did nothing wrong but act like inexperienced kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everyoneleftlou @TODAYshow So you watched the whole 1.5 hr video then? Because anyone that did knows this kid was targeted by a grown man, who moved into this boys space to antagonize him. If not, maybe U watch it. It wasn‚Äôt until it became a attempt at ridicule that it became a standoff. Once again 16-62<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofsistahgal @TODAYshow I hope your trying to express that the media has changed the narrative that this kids constitutional rights as an American to stand proudly at the Lincoln monument, were blatantly changed by the biased media to become something racist because he openly supports our president . üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Facts are facts &amp; rights are rights. Not to #nbc &amp; #cnn.

<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Why #nbcnews and #cnn continues to beat this Native American drum is beyond rational thinking.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes and when will the social media and news media bring the proper story to the public? And the claims that that native man was a Vietnam veteran, need to be thoroughly checked. His age and the math don‚Äôt add up. Where is the story on that media?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freedom_moates Yes and sue Nathan For the outright lying on national TV About the boys civilly. Why hasn‚Äôt the main stream media come out and condemn the fact that this man lied that he was a Vietnam veteran? Do the math<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The Democrats need to get to the table and give concessions as well as you President Trump. You guys have played with the livelihood of the government workers long enough. It‚Äôs time to get back to business as usual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer They are clearly losing. The biased media polls are not representing the true feelings of the people. It‚Äôs obvious now, with them not coming to the table, this is an ego play on their part. Therefore they are single-handedly responsible for continuing the government shutdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you guys release everything in a written statement to the press, there is no way that they can get it wrong period. Just be honest with the people and keep moving forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamcardib No Cardi  you‚Äôre wrong. It is not our president that‚Äôs destroying our country. It‚Äôs the partisan politics that is closing off progress in this country.

<|startoftext|>@alexiadaley1 @eastwest6566 @RealDeanCain I‚Äôm gonna pose the question too... at 62, is it possible he could even have been A Vietnam veteran? The math doesn‚Äôt quite add up. You certainly don‚Äôt hear any stories about that on the news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeschmidt1995 @eastwest6566 @RealDeanCain Also, At 62, is it possible to be a Vietnam vet? Why hasn‚Äôt the media spoken about this? Hmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Go2Deb @juusukun @ctbuckeye1 The minute they surrounded the black Israelites to try to spread love and teach them that they weren‚Äôt bad people, The chaperones came and pushed them all back away from the situation.

<|startoftext|>@juusukun @eastwest6566 @RealDeanCain Was that Nathan‚Äôs job? Was he being paid to do that? Why didn‚Äôt he attempt to make the black Israelites move?

<|startoftext|>@eastwest6566 @RealDeanCain You appear to be a nice Mom. Watch the full 1.5hr video. Then check your comment. The boy was only guilty of standing in his space.

<|startoftext|>@GwynLaRee @sgretchen2 @RealDeanCain @SebGorka Sorry to correct you but I watched the full 1.5hr video. He moved thru the crowd and stopped right in front of the boy.

<|startoftext|>@soniagupta504 @Zoeys_Mom74 There is no way you could comment the way you did if you watched the full 1hr plus video.   But yeah we all feel sorry for what you experienced in your life...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EBrown8534 @soniagupta504 Your talking about the Native American right?...  Watch the video before you judge. He‚Äôs a 16 yr old boy. The other guy has lived 4 times as long as this boy and has experienced quite a diverse life... and entered into this boys space. But yeah, the boy should have known better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniagupta504 I guess you never watched the whole video made by the black Israelites. It‚Äôs about 1h 45mins where the boys are disrespected repeatedly. Or maybe you missed the part where Nathan moves into this boys space and beats his drum in his face, while the nervous 16 yr old smiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Only one law of God... ‚ÄúLove‚Äù  Beyond that, nothing matters. We are all sinners. Repentance and forgiveness are Man‚Äôs only saving grace.  God is everything everywhere and at all times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepThomasMassie It‚Äôs absolutely amazing to me how well mannered these boys behaved given a very challenging circumstance. They should be heralded, not blamed. Did everyone act Appropriately, no. It ended peacefully. That‚Äôs a huge step in the right direction. Who‚Äôs the antagonist in the video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weirdnewsaddict @Alyssa_Milano He can over the drugs, crime, etc... he can use the military and the military funding. It‚Äôs very unnecessary but I don‚Äôt put anything past him.

<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. We need more people like yourself who understand and speak the dialogue of our nations people. I respect everything you said. It‚Äôs long overdue. We need to rid this nation of political parties and vote in real leaders. Thank you for the discussion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weirdnewsaddict @Alyssa_Milano True... but they need to put money towards the wall and they won‚Äôt. DT don‚Äôt want to declare a national emergency but he will. So just negotiate and move on. Stop the games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weirdnewsaddict @Alyssa_Milano Yes he started it but it‚Äôs who ends it who everyone will remember. Their egos are getting in the way. End it now and move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DadoftheDecade @Alyssa_Milano Two sides to every story.   As unpopular as that statement may be, that was a peaceful protest with two antagonist marches happening. No one got hurt and everything turned out ok. Let‚Äôs not dwell on it and move forward. Hate is a thing of the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Damn Alyssa, that‚Äôs really f‚Äôd up. These people are Americans just like you. They just have a diff/perspective. Don‚Äôt create division. Bring people together with hope.  MAGA stands for Make America Great Again. We all want that in every sense of the phrase. Your better than this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Stop playing games and placing blame Nancy.   He is going to get his wall one way or another.  Use negotiation as your power. Give concessions for his concessions. End the shutdown with good faith.   Your the one looking stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Just stop... please... it‚Äôs never going to happen. Why don‚Äôt you focus on the future election.  Your bigger than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Thank you for speaking to both sides!  I‚Äôd say ‚Äúno‚Äù  How does that benefit anyone. Financially it could hurt more people.  The gov could be open tomorrow if the dems go to the WH and each party give concessions. This is only happening because Dems are playing games. It‚Äôs Ego<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a perspective. Whether it‚Äôs right or wrong, both or should I say ‚Äúall‚Äù sides are responsible. Nobody takes accountability nowadays. It‚Äôs pathetic.   Good luck to ya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Well if you know that, what‚Äôs stopping you from doing more for your cause? Fear? Fear of what eternal  damnation in hell will ultimately cost. Everyone has the power to change. Even DT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Perspective... at times, Yes! To accept pay while other guv‚Äômint workers aren‚Äôt, is evil. They should be doing everything in their power for the people who depend on them to foster a deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump To be human is barbaric. That‚Äôs true hypocrisy. How about claiming to have compassion while verbally attacking someone‚Äôs alternative point of view. Life is about perspective. I am as guilty &amp; as virtuous as the next guy. I don‚Äôt judge. I try to speak peace in a world of conflict<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN True but he will be voted out in two yrs if our democracy proves effective. These problems are non threatening to the livelihood of the American people. The Dems look petty now and screwed up. They should be planning for the future. Who can beat DT? They have no one right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN It‚Äôs ridiculous to argue a non factor that is subjective to the interpretation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN No I haven‚Äôt wondered why. It‚Äôs called DTSD ‚ÄúDonald Trump Stress Disorder‚Äù. It effects millions of Democrats. As an Independent myself, I don‚Äôt fear the doom and gloom of partisan politics. Some people should try it. It saves a heck of a lot of drama &amp; headaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump First, I did realize it... it was a sarcastic joke. I thought you would have picked up on it. Second, my career is built off of compassion and patience. Every day I work with and for children and adults w/develop mental disabilities. 26 yrs. &amp; I‚Äôm bronze &amp; lowmidcls. How about U?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN I agree it‚Äôs petty. But every move he makes is highly scrutinized and challenged. He still is the POTUS and he never really was given a chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN I hear what your saying but I hold the Dems to a higher standard. In good faith, they should honor those out of work by taking the deal, which would ultimately look favorable for bipartisanship and see where it leads. If DT doesn‚Äôt open the gov. He will have made a huge mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Yes it is.... if I‚Äôm understanding you, what your saying is they killed them with ‚ÄúLove‚Äù. How sweet. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taterpie534 @GOP @realDonaldTrump The democrats killed children? What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneC0RP @NickJFuentes All that can be corrected in time but you don‚Äôt play games w/people‚Äôs livelihoods. He‚Äôs going to get the wall. It‚Äôs what he ran his whole campaign and got elected on. Pass it and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soaked2thebone @NickJFuentes All that can be worked out after it goes through. They need to just pass it and move on. Both parties need to quit playing games with people‚Äôs livelihoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudia60717194 @CNN The past is the past. You can‚Äôt look back only forward. Now, at this time, the ball is in the Dems court. They can end it and either be the hero‚Äôs or the vindictive zeros. Let‚Äôs sign the deal, end the shutdown and move forward together without all the games. It is a fair deal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano That is the humane way. Trump told the Border Patrol that they could open fire on any rock throwers. They chose restraint and hit them with rubber bullets and tear gas.

<|startoftext|>@TravelFiendJA @ZellnerLaw I think if Bobby did the killing, it Happened in the moment. He was rejected by her and reacted. Possibly, striking her and knocking her out. Then panicked.

Allowing them to step 1 ft on our border, costs 1000‚Äô$ of dollars to the American taxpayer. If more people would offer to help pay to ship them back this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. A Solution!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I guess it‚Äôs better to be right &amp; exact in this election. Since so much fraud and corruption has already happened in the past. Every vote should be counted. Nobody can steal an election if the votes truly aren‚Äôt there. Maybe it would‚Äôve been faster if they just did a revote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs great that you had a productive meeting. Please post &amp; give yourself more praises. You deserve it! After all, you are the greatest president on the face of the earth, for all time &amp; will remain that for the rest of the eternity. Nobody has or will be better than you,Nobody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mismanagement or not, this is not the best practice to ridicule those out there trying to protect the forests from desimation.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a great thing for France and Europe to collaborate on. Please do.

<|startoftext|>@samcombs41 @Rzabel2016 @abosc33 @realDonaldTrump I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I was just providing info for those not aware of our asylum laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpencetLynn @Rzabel2016 @abosc33 @realDonaldTrump I agree... but in those situations listed above only, by the laws of this country, are refugees able to gain legal asylum.

<|startoftext|>@bighoov2023 @realDonaldTrump First off, I‚Äôm not a leftist. Second, That is actually the law. Third, I agree with you.

I‚Äôm just providing info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FearNoMission @realDonaldTrump TY. Very true, I am actually airing on the side of the president.

<|startoftext|>@Rzabel2016 @abosc33 @realDonaldTrump An asylum seeker must prove that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on one or more of 5 grounds: Race. Religion. Nationality.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can apply for asylum regardless of your im.status within 1year of coming to the US.

There are exceptions to the rule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Generally, a legal permanent resident can apply to naturalize, or become a U.S. citizen, five years after obtaining a ‚Äúgreen card.‚Äù When asylees get their ‚Äúgreen card‚Äù it is backdated one year, meaning that they can apply to naturalize four years after obtaining residence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump According to Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (I.N.A.) ¬ß 208(d)(5),the asylum interview takes place within 45 days after the date the application is filed &amp; a decision should be made within 180 days after the date the application is filed, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Had the Republicans passed that 10% tax cut for the middle class, instead of a huge tax cut for the rich and big corporations, they might have won hands down.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @HawleyMO They may be socialists but at least our tax dollars might go to programs for the poor and middle class. If they don‚Äôt go there, then we should get a tax cut. Maybe 10%, like you promised. Still less then you gave the rich and big corps. We deserve more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Loyal to the middle class?.... we‚Äôre still waiting on those tax cuts. 10% right? Where are they?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Great economy but no 10% tax cuts for the hard working middle class. Where are they? The rich got Tax cuts but you forgot the actual voters who get Reps elected.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DebbieStabenow She voted against what Tax cuts? The ones for the greedy rich... because she never got the chance to vote for the tax cuts for the middle class. Let‚Äôs focus on what the middle class families need, not the rich and big Corp.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MarthaMcSally Arizona citizens, like every one else in this country, need the tax cuts like the Rich in this country got.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL It will be interesting to see how are your supporters feel after they realize that 10% tax cut that you promised isn‚Äôt going to make it into their bank accounts this year or who knows if it ever will. Noone in Congress even really heard of it. U need to make good on ur promises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DannyTarkanian Those are all great things.

Where is that 10% tax cut you promised? We need it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I want to protect the small amount of income I make compared to the Rich. But the Rich seem to have gotten that tax cut that you promised us middle-class. Where is that 10%!? Maybe the Republicans might not gain the offices they need due to you not passing that 10%. A big mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Education4Libs I hear ya but DT is still F‚Äôn us middle class over by giving the rich huge tax cuts and not giving the middle class the 10% he promised us this year. Which only adds to the middle class burden. I prefer legal immigration for the sake of fiscal responsibility of the middle class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think you should be focusing more on the 10% tax cuts you promised the middle class. Because you weren‚Äôt able to do what you promised the American people, the Republicans may lose a good majority of these elections. Thanks to you. Think about that instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damanator39 @RealCandaceO Valid argument.

<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski The fact that you think this country was built on genocide &amp; slavery, Is pretty sad &amp; a dim view of what it truly is and has become. I get your rhetoric. But wars were fought for a reason &amp; slavery was a part of all life for all cultures at the time. I respect your opinion though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski Our flag: The stripes represent the original 13 Colonies and the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor, white symbolizes purity and innocence, &amp; blue represents vigilance, perseverance &amp; justice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski When I asked the question of "What the flag meant to you?"...  Honestly, i expected a lil bit more patriotism towards it.

<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski I guess that's why we have a flag day... For ships right? And we salute it, say a pledge to it, and carry it into battles...

<|startoftext|>@Thai_Daishiki @tonyposnanski Plus, wouldn't you agree that would be an honorable thing to do?

<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski True. But what does the flag stand for to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski Let's not forget... U think CK is a hero? So when Nike signed him to this multi-million $ endorsement deal, ask yourself, if he really believed in his cause, don't you think he or Nike would have donated all of that money to the cause? Wake up! u just got played by a corporation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski Nah, I'm boycotting Nike because they believe that using sweatshops in foreign countries to make their overpriced corporate garbage shoes and clothes, is an easy sell to the pigs in America who buy anything because they think it's cool. Like supporting C.K. It's about respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynKY1950 @tonyposnanski It may not have been about the flag for some but for those that hold the flag and what it stands for in high regard, it was disgraceful. Those lives are lost forever and now the divide is greater. Did it raise awareness? Sure but not in the right way. Wrong time, wrong place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warsnotover @JohnBrennan @Kaepernick7 I believe your son was a Hero. And the only time i know a Veteran kneels is to pay tribute to a fallen soldier or in front of the family of that soldier in honor or to pray. They are Brave in the face of adversity. RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momof3liny @Khanetix_ I would... But i don't buy Nike crap. I prefer not to buy sweatshop clothing from foreign countries.

<|startoftext|>@warsnotover @JohnBrennan @Kaepernick7 Real Heros stand and fight, not kneel and plead. Your son understood this. Your son was in the military and he was a hero! God rest his soul. I respect him. He should be honored more then CK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warsnotover @JohnBrennan @Kaepernick7 A peaceful protest that disgraced our National Anthem and the Veterans that have fought and defended our rights, some paying the ultimate price, so a rich young man who plays a game can be glorified, i think not. Like most vets, Your son would be ashamed. There's a time &amp; a place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBrennan Really... And how much money have you or Colin donated to police training and cultural bias reform?... Oh yeah, that's right, Nothing.

Police out there, throughout history, that serve all people equally. Criminals also come from all ethnicities. Most people are unaware that statistically more white people are killed by PD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaRoNCLiNa @Jinx1100 @bcwinbig @RobinGr1655 Finally, I think i understand where the confusion is... People are using this argument as a knock on DT. Who turned it political when he came out against it. I personally have just found it disrespectful &amp; non-political. I support the men &amp; women who served &amp; sacrificed. #IStand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 My personal understandings from friends and family in the military... Is they find it uber-disrespectful but that its a choice that everyone gets to make. My best friend is a super soldier Marine. His tattoos read "Freedom is not Free" &amp; "Live free or Die". He gets irate over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 We are on the same page there. I don't hold accountability to just soldiers though. I believe that is an action every American should take to honor them. They have fought, served and sacrificed enough. There may not be a way to do that, other then through voice and pocket book.üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sparkle26417481 @bcwinbig @RobinGr1655 You stand to honor those unlike DT that served in the military and fought for our freedoms. You stand as a sign of respect. It has nothing to do with DT or CK &amp; There is no comparison. It's everyone's right to Do what they feel but it's also my right to feel it's shameful to Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobdowling @bcwinbig @RobinGr1655 Thank you! Yes....üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cmhogan473 @Startaconvo1 @RobinGr1655 I'm just curious... Because i think we both are in agreeance here and might be arguing the sane point... Do you feel kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 I think they should still stay in the locker room. The national anthem is to honor those that have sacrificed to provide us with the freedoms we have.Anyone protesting something completely unrelated, is disrespectful.That's my opinion. I'm not disgruntled. It's about respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 Wait... I think for the most part we are arguing the same point. Haha. I completely agree with you here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 Because one actual soldier decided that was the way to honor police brutality victims like a dead soldier, then convinced a nonsoldier to take a Knee is irrelevant to the overall ideology that kneeling during tree anthem is disrespectful. One is a tribute, the other is a protest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So I'm a supporter of President DT. But everytime i hear someone mention the wall, i think of How all he Did was state he would make Mexico pay For it. Why do you need Congress to approve the US people paying for it? Do your job! Figure a way, For them to pay &amp; Quit lying 2 us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesGunn It's not treason until you can prove an actual attack was made against the US, where DT aided in it. Please read article 3, section 3 within the Judiciary section of the constitution and quit spreading your ignorant propaganda. Aren't you in enough trouble for your BS comments...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MbmpPB7 I completely agree with you... For some reason these "dotards" as you call them, can't grasp the fact that this happened before DT was president. Meaning under the Obama admin. And they actually believe it changed the outcome of the election. It's so ignorant to think that. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Startaconvo1 @Cmhogan473 @RobinGr1655 Oh no... They care. There are millions of red blooded football fan, U.S. patriots, out there just like him, "watching" to see how the league deals with this type of disrespect of or National Anthem and the NFL.

<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments Pouting... Whoa dude. I think i expressed my reasons with clarity.  i could turn your comment back on them. They are the ones pouting over social injustices &amp; maybe the league &amp; the owners really don't care what Their view is. Besides, this is Twitter! A worldwide debate forum.Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments We will see. Still enjoy your opinion. Have a great day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments Its like the gun debate... Trust me, they are not caving in. They are looking to appease everyone. They will offer something else in return. Just watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments They could suspend the whole season. Look at what happened with baseball a few years back. It took years to recover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments My view is not unjust. They are not protesting the NFL... If they were and had a good reason, I'd support them. They are not using Their own time And money to Do So either. If you showed me facts that These rich athletes are spending Their own money, I'd give a lil credit to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @Bu11M89 @TwitterMoments Their silent protest can still be in the lockerroom. And Brady is just making sure he doesn't get handicapped this next season. Piss off his line... Not a good play. Pun intended. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bu11M89 @shall1432 @TwitterMoments Bubble... Haha. Still... It's about respect! Those that have none, get shown the same. Zero tolerance for ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bu11M89 @shall1432 @TwitterMoments Well your a real patriot then. But all those that i know who served, stand for the flag, regardless. But maybe you regard, less. I honor those who served and believe they should too. I think I've stated my reasons. Have a good day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheScoop_US Wow... People really need to chill out. It's just a hat that stresses a belief in our political leaders to help in making this country great again.

<|startoftext|>@batsdingerbonds @TwitterMoments But let's not honor them...? Or do you consider it honoring them or their service by kneeling in protest? If that is Your argument, it's actually a halfway intelligent argument. Your debating and phrasing May need work but not bad. Said the fascist stain... Lol.Sticks &amp; stones...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bu11M89 @shall1432 @TwitterMoments It's about respect for those that sacrificed for the greater good. It's kinda sad that your nation doesn't have something similar. Is not a logical thing. Same reason you don't swear in church or in front of your grandmother. You honor those like we honor the anthem. Good day toU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DatSigmaJJJ @ShouldBeNoted @TwitterMoments Interesting to find out... I wonder under what law they would file under and how that would play out in "right to work" states. Sounds like a tort case that would get thrown out of court. Still interesting to watch this play out. Good point you have. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShouldBeNoted @TwitterMoments It will be interesting to see what happens. I'm not debating their reasoning behind it... I'm debating whether during the national anthem and on national tv is the proper place to aire their protest. I certainly am not for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Meks412 @AChrisCollie @TwitterMoments Wow. I guess i should respect you? And your peaceful protests?... I guess if that's the way you feel about it, we should all just bend over to respect Your wishes. Your respect is More important than everyone else's. I'm going to go @%*# off now. Your debate was too smart for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Last__RHINO @ElizaWallace27 @TwitterMoments That's because the flag didn't exist at that time. And i didn't say "died", i said sacrificed. More then most men will ever do for the right to live under the constitutional freedoms/laws. It's about respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieAnn59 @TwitterMoments Privileged... Haha. You know nothing about me and what i understand. Trust me, i understand everything the players understand. Except i don't have a multi-million dollar contract to play a game. I've had my share of profiling and even been a victim of police brutality, many times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabmarks1 @shall1432 @TwitterMoments Whatever they need to do to keep the game pure. I would understand if their issue was strictly about mistreatment from the NFL. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Wrong place for an agenda. Let people enjoy the game. It's Sunday for crying out loud. They just got out of church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments The Game will always have fans and great players. The teams understand this. Most players are only in the league a few years tops. There is so much talent out there. Shit thousands watch pop Warner every week. Hundreds of thousands watch high school. Millions watch college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments He could have done a hell of a lot more spending that 20 Million dollar salary on Police policy reform for his greater cause or the NFL policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Not many are willing to do something at all. So i give him credit. The consequences for his actions are pretty just though. He put the NFL in a tough spot. He literally has paid for it in his bank account. I'm sure in a few years he'll regret it. We will see.He can't admit it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments He was a champion of the football field. Now he's championed a cause. Good for him. He can go to his grave knowing he did what he thought was right. Can't argue that.I choose to think he would much rather be playing the game.I guess time will tell if he actually made a difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Silly right? Did Colin get another job in the NFL? Who got the last laugh? CK should have appreciated what he had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Nobody is denying anybody that right to protest that cause. It's the way they are doing it that is destroying the message. I'm not twisting anything. Trust me, there is more people against the way he is doing it then for it. The NFL is bending to the majority by making a policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Your missing the mark... That's the difference between being a True hero. You actually do some real shit. Not take a knee, disrespecting our Nation and then talk about it. Nah, you take action. You spend money. You donate time, energy, resources. He did the easiest thing. It's BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments In his shoes... Lol. Shit most people would slap their Momma for 10k. Plus, I have been a victim of American police brutality many times. I didn't get shot Thank God but I also know the difference. Why doesn't he spend his time and money on police training? That i would respect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWcolour @shall1432 @TwitterMoments The league made it a policy that the players can stand or stay in the Lockeroom or face fines and suspensions for violating the policy. The Dolphins are just stating they agree with the policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments That's the thing... All the blacks aren't protesting. Most of them are patriots and appreciate the God given talent they have been granted and the opportunity to make a great living in America, to support their family. And the NFL will be just fine without those players. One love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Colin Kapernick was a great player that put his political agenda before his team. He let his team down. What a shame. He could have been one of the greatest ever. Now he's the spokesmen for a cause. A great cause but i bet it doesn't pay as much as the NFL. Lesson learned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments There are millions of kids that play football in America. We can do without a few stars. Not to mention, if he's such a great star, it's because he has a great team around him. If he's not a self-centered person, he'll suck it up and stand for the betterment of the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments I just saw an employee at McDonalds take a knee before he handed a customer his burger. They fired him on the spot after they reminded him he didn't own the McDonalds and their customer didn't appreciate it. See the difference. Try that shit at your job. Same result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Right and that's why they will be fired and have no stage. Do you know the owners and the league donated millions of dollars to the players so they could advocate for this cause? They just asked that they don't do it during the game. They didn't Have to donate anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments Incorrect... They make millions and if they want to make change they can spend it in their own forum, away from the game but Not under the NFL's paid for and public display of a sport. They have that option. How many of them actually do it? See the difference? It's a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieAnn59 @TwitterMoments This is going to be league wide and will open up a chance for new stars to emerge once they fire all the policy violating one's. That will be a great day for American Sports!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizaWallace27 @TwitterMoments Nobody cares. This is America. We honor those that fought and sacrificed for this country. Leave political agendas and protests out of the game. Appreciate the fact you get to earn millionsand &amp; have fans for playing a game. Be a patriot. Keep it outside the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AChrisCollie @TwitterMoments But at the same time, earned my respect and Millions like me. I give them a lot of credit for keeping the game pure. Keep political agendas out of it &amp; respect those that have sacrificed for this great nation. Have a great day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShouldBeNoted @TwitterMoments They sure can. They would violate their contractual obligations by violating team &amp; league policy.They would be terminated, lose their salaries and new, respectful players would be on the field the very next week.Ask Colin Kapernick how that's going?Take the political agendas out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shall1432 @TwitterMoments I hope they do too, then they would forfeit their contractual obligations and would be fired and new respectful players would be given a chance to make millions. Maybe then they would understand the sacrifice of men and women who served our country &amp; respect/appreciate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterMoments If you respect that fact that millions of military servicemen have fought, sacrificed and died so you can make multi-millions playing a game on t.v., then you stand in appreciation.Take your political agendas elsewhere and leave it out of the game.Nobody is denying you that right<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScrewedHumans @carlray61 That list could literally continue page after page... It's amazing who and what the left believes to be true. They thought Hillary Clinton a saint. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWHerbert @indietv @Saintsfan5348 @realDonaldTrump It would not be... People are idiots. They need to learn what Article 3, Section 3 of the US Constitution under the Judicial section really means. Maybe they should seek legal advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 90% of those jobs in the psychiatric hospitals of America for the leftists. Please create more. It's mass hysteria out here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dr_Eager @realDonaldTrump I can't wait to see this... I hope the left, lives up to the hype. If they lose again, I'm thinking mass suicide or mass exodus out of America. Either way, it will ultimately drain the Tsunami. Good luck! Bring a better candidate to the table. The last one was quite corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickungar @hhaberernOT @realDonaldTrump Is it a show full of whining about our President elect? Pretty much describes most leftist media sources. I'm sure your audience base is "HUGE"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMBWhitney @JuliaDavisNews Thank you for posting this. I swear most leftist have never even read or understood what Article 3, Section 3 of the US Constitution was all about. They think DT "lying" is Treason. It's ridiculous. You must wage war with the US or aid your enemies in waging war. TY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews And what has our t.v. said about Putin? Y'all people believe anything you read or hear from the leftist media. It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC I checked it out. Our first hard lesson was Vietnam (the black mark on our F.P.)we learned a lot about trying to occupy and bring democracy. It only works if Big Brother is watching and holding court. Unfortunately we have to make sure they don't become dependant. Thats the trick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Haha. I agree. He is a strange dude and a strange choice. I'm thinking he was chosen to shake things up and continually play the shell game or 3 card Monty till Trump is out of office. Take the attention away from justice. Either way, I think DT is too egotistical to leave badly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC And bipartisanship in America is a lost cause... Even when Obama tried getting humanitarian requests passed thru congress he couldn't get bipartisanship. It's really sad when party lines override humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Also, I'm not necessarily a Trump supporter... Or a Republican, I'm just pro U.S. and believe that when a president gets elected, you support him and his policies until he truly causes issues for Americans. By that time, hopefully we elect someone new. I'm a Patriot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC I honestly think that anyone with a substantial amount of reason can figure that 12 hackers with computers truly couldnt disrupt the US Political System. I think it's a hand being played in a propaganda war against DT for discrediting mainstream media. The indictments are B.S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Thanks I'll check it out. According to my buddy, all their missions are surgical. There are no more Rambos. It has to be done in a way that doesn't come back to America. They basically Black Ops everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zippitydont @DanRather The real question you have to ask yourself... Is why are they targeting him with so much B.S.? Maybe, just Maybe, he's actually doing a good job and after he discredited them and made people believe they print lies and fake news, they went to war on a propaganda front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zippitydont @DanRather Like they say..Prove it. If you can't, then you have to side with it being the truth. As far as i know, none of those things have been proven. But i get it. Like what Trump did dismantling Hillary in the court of public opinion, the media is hoping to do the same &amp; put us at odds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesbianismtime @punkrockzo @riicearonii Sounds like a normal company/owner vs employee relationship to me... Try working in the human services field.

<|startoftext|>@WillSmirk4Food @dailykos Grovels... I think you need to get a better prescription for your glasses and invest in some hearing aids. Your view is way skewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The greatest way to destroy your enemy, is to make him a friend" Quote from Abraham Lincoln<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Brave my ass... They wasted a lot of time on ridiculous questions aimed at discrediting our President. What a Joke! We need real media that asks real questions about important issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Why deny something so ridiculous... He did say it was a small topic and we need to just move on. He also said i didn't even know DT at the time, he was a private citizen, why would i have anything? There was 500 other business leaders there. I don't know their any of their names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone still witch hunting over our President elect colluding with Russia, needs to get a grip on reality. Both leaders denied all claims and Putin even stated it was such a small thing to worry about and we should just drop it and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanaKStewart "The way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend" Quote from Abraham Lincoln<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbartist I like it.. and when paintings fetch a lot of money. It gives us working artists something to strive for and help project value onto the world. People see art as a high commodity. This influences other people of lesser means to realize that art is an investment. It trickles down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3wWens Thanks. You too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane Ok.. Correction, some eastern u.s. states allowed slavery too. But we don't count them. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane I understand... History is a tough subject for some people.  Anyway, the conversion was brought on by broad statements about republicans being selfish... Lincoln helped create the party and i just wanted to point that out because he was a great Republican &amp; president. Arguably #2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act was a law that ended slavery in Washington, D.C. by paying slave owners for releasing their slaves. Although not written by him, the act was signed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln on April 16, 1862.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane February 1, 1865 - President Abraham Lincoln signed a Joint Resolution submitting the proposed 13th Amendment to the states. December 18, 1865 - Secretary of State William Seward issued a statement verifying the ratification of the 13th Amendment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, as the nation approached its third year of bloody civil war. The proclamation declared "that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious states "are, and henceforward shall be free."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane Lincoln waited to unveil theproclamation until he could do so on the heels of a Union military success. On September 22, 1862, after the battle at Antietam, he issued a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation declaring all slaves free in the rebellious states as of January 1, 1863.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_noone_you_know @JimKilbane Who signed it into law? Who jointly proprosed the13th amendment? And that's because only the rebellious states had slavery. Duh..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC I think you &amp; i totally agree on all those issues. As for Asad... We kept him in power according to my buddy but once he turned on us, we should have taken him out. Planned many times for it but our gov has non public deals going on with him. Therefore we let him love on. pity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanHorning1 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos I'm no Dem but i got a solution... We send any illegals to their house. They can live with them and they can flip the bill for them. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bgreymatter @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Really... How many bombings on American soil have you been witness to? Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it isn't working. That means it IS working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldWideWimpy @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos So you will let any stranger walk onto your property and pitch a tent and live there? Perfect, we will send them all to your house. You can flip the bill for garbage disposal and all the other services they require. Thank you for your service to this country. What's your address<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos You can abolish it but we will just have to create something just like it to continue the work they were doing. I think it's a necessary evil in this modern world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC I'll make deal with you... If all of the things you spoke about don't come to fruition and good things happen for our economy, how about you stop spreading all the doom and gloom and try taking a positive stance on the issues. Sound like a fair deal. I think you could be an asset<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BennWaddington I really don't think that would happen but that is the power she holds. Look it up.

<|startoftext|>@ga_guzman77 @wiz1174 @realDonaldTrump They see Jesus Christ this way!!!   In that case, I think it's time to start bombing these other countries. We are still the dominant military force in the world... After all. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanMDIGGS1 @davemacladd @realDonaldTrump Haha. Please do. Instead of me... I think they will probably come arrest you under the Title: R Section: E Code:Tardo. A special FBI code created just for you. Nice one!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Civilized_Life They should rebrand it "Canadabis".  Good for them! Maybe they aren't so bad....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Sure it is... I don't think your worried about bombs and dodging bullets right now are ya? Hopefully, your working a decent job that supports your family, with good benefits and a little extra money to spare on fun things. I hope these good things for you. So does DT! Take care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Good luck to ya! I'm an optimist who wants What's best For America. I don't whine about things i cannot change. I wait to see the results. Maybe just Maybe, his tactics might work. We just will never see things the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC And needing a translator. F the investigaton. It's a waste of Time and energy. I don't think he was colluding. Its a leftist tactic. Opening talks with NK is a good start. Your Dems couldn't even get him to the table. Trade wars... Why do you think other countries are mad at us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Yeah, yeah... It's all the same bullshit rhetoric. The sky is not falling. Not yet at least. And I'm not complacent. I'm just not a pessimist.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickReddell @TheMariahRamsey @MLParrino @Alyssa_Milano That is a ridiculous statement. You must think white kids are not as unruly as these kids. Totally false. It's the neighborhood, the teachings and the attitudes..  Not the ethnicity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JJTurnUpdaMusic @Liberty_Ann @RasmusStorm @Alyssa_Milano Maybe his tough stance saves this kids life. You don't learn lessons from hand holding in serious situations.

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Unless you know the situation or the area and type of criminal the kid is, commenting in a derogatory way about the Police officer's response,  is ignorant. There's always two sides to every story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDKyleRogers @wewillresist2 @MSNBC Sure Kyle... That makes sense. I guess I'll never live up to your standards to earn my right to vote. You know, supporting our president elect and all... Thank you for pointing that out<|endoftext|>

The Putin thing is nuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patchoulimommy @BlowDevilUp @DaveRic72935199 @MSNBC @Sunnysgrl62 Of course they still have them. &amp; your real news stations are corrupt too.

Its time to cut the umbilical and return to manufacturing in the U.S. Remove the abbreviations and it's "US".Let's fix US then we can negotiate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "sky is not falling" American people. Relax.  Brett Kavanaugh is human. He's not going to destroy your ideals of everyone's right to choose their path.

<|startoftext|>@BennWaddington Sure it is...Do you realize that at any point she can throw out all members of Parliament and call for re-election. She also has the right to declare war. I guess that's what a Billionaire who pretty much owns most all the land in Multiple countries has the power to do. #monarchy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandscahill Are you still talking about the Queen..?  I think billionaires speak their own language.  It's like Binary Code with M'$ &amp; B'$ behind each number. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycetache Wow... That must have been some good weed. Puff puff pass, dude...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @krassenstein @RemoveHIM @realDonaldTrump No worries there... The real Patriots that believe in this oath "one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all..." Will prevail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarxMedia @StephenKing Are these complaints from people who legitimately still live under the rule of a queen?... Haha.  I think they should worry about their own problems before making a mockery out of American political leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Yes... but since all these liberals became bullish, traitorous, non-America supporting, A-holes, his approval rating has gone up and they say he now would have won with around 6% more of the initial votes. So enjoy, knowing he speaks for the majority of Americans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EgglyMaria @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Not sure what you mean but i have heard that argument.I'm sure DT has never had to work a hard day in his life. He may have put on a lot of hard hours on a project but pick up a shovel, no way!He is way disconnected from the real world &amp; people that put in a honest hard days work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc Everyone has challenges. It wasn't lazy at all. In fact, it was the lazy way to just blurt out things &amp; not care if i offended someone or not. It takes a lot more mental strength to know the difference between your view of things &amp; the way things really are or who your offending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shae_morin @cbcnewsbc Either way... I'm sure there are some people out there that feel that way. Good luck!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shae_morin @cbcnewsbc Everyone's adventure is different. But living life to the fullest, no matter what adventure you choose... Even Fatherhood, is the message I was trying to convey. I'm right there with you on living thru my 3 kids life experiences. It's a wonderful adventure &amp; i wouldn't trade it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc I was honest like you too once. Thought it would bring me better relationships in life. Instead,I found myself alone &amp; empty. I found out most people really don't want to hear the truth. Most people have fragile egos. I changed my life &amp; learned not to say things that hurt people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc Good luck to you Glenn. I wish you the best. Life can be hard. Try to make it a little easier on yourself by choosing to love instead of hate. Take it from me, when you get older, you realize Life is too short to worry about things you can't change. Just Live It to the fullest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc I can see your point. It can get overwhelming.I'm a Father of 3, semi-liberal, semi-conservative.I'm not happy sometimes with the images and ideas that the media is forcefeeding my kids daily.I just have to remind myself that I am their ultimate teacher &amp;they learn by watching me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc Your ideals are just that. Yours. If that's your belief, cool. Why you feel the need to try to hurt others with your belief system is where we disagree. There is no reason to try to condemn people who obviously don't feel the same as you. Live &amp; let love. It doesn't affect you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc She was a gem no matter what ethnicity. You should watch her video within this story. She is probably someone you could admire once you hear her talk about her life choices. She lived her life to the fullest without hate. Check it out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSat1 @cbcnewsbc Well thanks for taking the time to acknowledge your incorrect statement. Either way, your young &amp; have lived a certain life that I can't judge you on. I just hope u find the humanity within yourself and realize it's easy to spread hate but it's not hard to show empathy/compassion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbcnewsbc I had never heard of these guys until this story. After reading about them &amp; the life they lived, I realized how special they were to the world. It's people like them that come here for a short time to teach us lessons on how God intended us to live. Thank you. Rest in Paradise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaSelenaBaker @jwd1975 @Jusjules2 @oganali1000 @realDonaldTrump I agree. But the comment i was referring to was a disgusting display of no empathy or humanity. Change can be made in small ways and hopefully over time, makes a big difference. DT is pretty much all those things. Most politicians are. But he can change too. I try not to judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pshort0422 @DavidMa54099531 @StacyBogert @kareljaros @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Trump didn't create the program of separation. Fact: it was in effect during the Obama administration. It was protocol under certain circumstances. DT reasons were BS. He used it as a deterrent. Ivanka convinced him it was a bad political move &amp; he signed a exec. order to stop it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddy120876 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski üëçAgreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaggingNurse @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Where was Trump ever mentioned...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobinSeaholm @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski I hear what your saying."Two wrongs don't make a left" is my new slogan. A typical event w/war is after one regime is ousted, the next one tends to be worse. They started out the higher ground but end up in the mud like the others. There is no need for that. Be the bigger person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gkjksw @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Not to forget, i never once mentioned Trump or tried to defend him. I just pointed out the facts. Those people in that picture could have been POOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. Did anyone even think about their feelings or situation before spreading their image in defamation? See my point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgglyMaria @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski It's a joke.I'm a middle class human services worker. I can barely afford the cell phone I own. And you Have no idea what race, religion or ideals I live by. Stop being So judgmental. You're only proving my point on how quick liberals label and judge people without any knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gkjksw @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Not one single ignorant or bigoted thing was said in any comment i made. You're still labeling and using insults to describe your feelings. If you're scared, say that. Not things like,"DT supporters are dumb as rocks".If you don't understand the difference, use facts, not hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterizzy @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski The left does tend to have a lot of feelings toward Trump... They are constantly whining, insulting and complaining. At least on Twitter. Thanks for sharing. I wish you the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Koksalakn Cool story if it's true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chichiplus @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Then just bury your head in the sand. That way you will never need to know the truth. Because facts are pointless to the left and support is unobtainable. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gkjksw @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski So easy to what... Completely miss the whole point of what I wrote? In that case, "you're" right! Have a good day!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1948425 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski You valued it enough to comment. Thanks! Even though your response was highly creative, I enjoyed it and the fact that it proved my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyspain Have you ever owned a truck? They're awesome! You can carry lots of nuts in them. Seriously, mine can carry a half ton of them. But pull up to 10k lbs of nuts on a trailer.

<|startoftext|>@LeanneMAnd @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski @DrKellyPhD U don't think there are people like that on both sides.The leftist agenda benefits those people the most.They just aren't as vocal.Truth be told from my end, I've heard the most disconcerting things from the Trump non-supporters.I'm amazed because I hold them to a higher standard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddy120876 @ContentRetired @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski I understand that but most of the propaganda I've seen has come from the left. Are their bots coming from that side too? Most statements i hear are personal. Do the bots speak personally? I'm concerned...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pshort0422 @DavidMa54099531 @StacyBogert @kareljaros @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You wouldn't give an abused child back to their parents just because it's convenient. Immigration has to do their due diligence to determine these factors before returning the child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pshort0422 @DavidMa54099531 @StacyBogert @kareljaros @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump The immigration separations are to determine the welfare of the child and whether or not the child is in fact their kid. These kids have endured a lot and may have issues. Once determined they are ok and the family has a legit claim for entering the US they are returned to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pshort0422 @DavidMa54099531 @StacyBogert @kareljaros @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Absolutely not true. I work in the state healthcare system.Children are separated all the time immediately regardless of circumstance in many situations to determine the welfare of the child.All of these situations listed above are common reasons it could happen.usually temporary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StacyBogert @jack_mandle @kareljaros @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I never understand why people would label someone without first knowing the facts and understanding the situation. Shows a real lack of human compassion to judge someone you've never met or walked a day in their shoes. Your story is not uncommon. Some people can't understand that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kareljaros @StacyBogert @DanaBrass @NBCchansen @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Pretty sure your not allowed to bring your kids with U into central booking and with U while in a holding cell or while doing STS aka community service. And obviously not while in jail, County (misdemeanor) or prison (felony) &amp; your kids could be taken away permanently from CPS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So our Gov. doesn't take any precautions on behalf of these children in determining if they were brought into this country with family or not? They could have been kidnapped or taken from other family members without consent. The level of malnutrition &amp; abuse needs to be known 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The fact is:Legally or non-legally entering the country is a hugh cost burden to the American tax payers. We need a streamlined, cost- effective, protection based, criminal identification, system to allow asylum seekers in or they need to be sent back thru deportation immediately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Instead of judges, we hire 100's of mediators who review the claims case by case. If they pass selected criteria for political asylum, then they move on to the judging process. This would eliminate the huge cost burden of using judges by limiting the amount needed. Cost effective<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@putuhsesaelp @cydruc @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Agreed. It's even more like the freedoms bestowed upon us to be able to say these negative things about our President Elect on Independence day. What a great country we live in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ContentRetired @Eddy120876 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski We are Americans. Do we give up easy? No we endure and we push on.

<|startoftext|>@ContentRetired @Eddy120876 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski I couldn't agree more... An even better strategy is "love not hate" and "support not criticism".

<|startoftext|>@Eddy120876 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Also, I'm liberal/conservative too. Just not a crazy liberal who can't see both sides of the situation. I vote for whatever i believe in, not party lines. I voted Obama the previous election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddy120876 @emskware2015 @tonyposnanski Yeah. I can imagine. People out there tend to say whatever they want to another person. They don't hold nothing back.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Leaving US manufacturing is the equivalent of being a scab in the union wars. In a sense, HD is a crossing pickett lines... But they are a company that needs it's profits to survive. They planned this move prior to tariffs. They couldn't wait or they would have to cut more jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasquasages @RogueLeader23 @Mrdenimleather @realDonaldTrump This it's not the first time HD went overseas to keep the company afloat. This was also happening prior to the tariff wars. DT cannot be blamed. HD company greed cannot be blamed. This is bottom line policy of any company to remain profitable. It's sad but true and it's business!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I am an avid HD fan. I own 5 of them. I was disappointed at hearing this move &amp; did the research to understand. They are doing it only for their Euro/Asia market. It will save them tens of millions. DT needs to chill or give them incentives to stay. It's a sad reality of business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheezychuckyt3 @realDonaldTrump Exactly! He should give extra tax cut  incentives to stay and maybe throw government money at them for their Unions. They are only leaving because the difference is in the tens of millions of dollars to stay. HD should have just kept quiet about it. He's a bisiness man that knows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think that everyone is not seeing the HD side. HD is moving a type of manufacturing to Thailand because they will pay less on tariffs when selling to Euro/Asian markets.They are keeping production here for N.A. sales. The Union fees &amp; tariffs will cost the company more to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blk_dahlia2 @DonCheadle Sure lady. I'm sure your parents think your special just like mine does too. Still, another leftists with no facts to back your statements. Why don't you just look at all the positive things happening to the American economy right now and quit whining and complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCheadle I call Trump supporters, Pro-American Activists &amp; American Economic Enthusiasts.  We live in a Free Democratic Society. Any comparisons of Patriots of our Country &amp; supporters of our President to a Nazi Regime, is probably one of the most ignorant statements that could be made.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paweLPawlowskii @realDonaldTrump Who's social security card are they using to pay taxes?... Or are you just referring to sales tax?... In any event, how about just get a workers visa (green card) &amp; do it the right way. Oh and if they drive, car insurance... Who cares what language they speak. Just do it legally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stay positive liberal leftists...Some good things happened. You have less to worry about. Now get your leaders to vote bi-partisan on some of the  issues that ensure more people get the help they need and quit blaming everything on Trump. We are in this together. I appreciate you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HipHopGoldenAge I always wanted to hear the backstory to this video. It came out when they really started their comeback with a completely new sound. Got mad video-play on #MTV.

<|startoftext|>@DEW_Resistance @realDonaldTrump @PeteStauber I was there with my daughter. They let 9,000 in. About 3 to 4 thousand, not including the protesters, were turned away. Add another 1 to 2 thousand protesters and you will get a clearer view of the amount of people. A packed house. Saw it first hand. Plenty of photos will surface<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@canadayah @morguehunter @realDonaldTrump Who said I was white? Don't assume.  Just cuz i support our President you think I'm white?... And a white supremacist?...

<|startoftext|>@achirichella @realDonaldTrump Originally this comment was aimed at @achirichella not Donald Trump. She decided to post a bunch of unsubstantiated rhetoric asking people to retweet. She decided to block me &amp; delete her original comment. My apology if it's misleading to anyone. I'm pro rally! Takin' the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynSimpson9 @achirichella @realDonaldTrump I agree. In theory i never thought it had any substantial benefits but the truth is that since Trump admin took office &amp; dropped certain regulations, my small businesses have benefited. It might just be because the companies are doing better, who knows? As for the SM, it's a scam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@berg86 @achirichella @realDonaldTrump I have a family as well. I guess I'm just lucky to have had an intelligent debate with such an upstanding American patriot with kids. And thanks for the compliment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@berg86 @achirichella @realDonaldTrump Sure Bud. That's the idea... Do you even have kids? Or are you just whining about it because it's convenient?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freetomato @achirichella @realDonaldTrump If it benefits Americans... What's wrong with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@longislandkelly @achirichella @realDonaldTrump I used to dilly dally inn the stock market. After the receding in 08', i got it of it. It's a rich man's shell game. I won't Have Any part of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linksmechanix @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump That's true. Hopefully, something better will come thru. A lot of great Northern Mn. "American" families depend upon it. Take care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPhuim @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump As for migrant workers... They can still work in this country and get a paycheck from their employer having been granted a work visa. There is nothing stopping that process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPhuim @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump I'm not a fan of trade wars... Trade tariff policies and immigration are all contentious areas that need restructuring. I hope that we are able to create a better system to help these foreigners become citizens and patriots. We need to stabilize our country now for future gens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynSimpson9 @achirichella @realDonaldTrump I wish. I'm barely making it over the over the poverty line and was at the threshold for years. I own small businesses and have actually seen an increase in business due to the corporations spending money again. I guess it's trickle down theory. Who would have thought it worked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChipNoir This last message was aimed @chipnoir unfortunately, he decided to block me and delete his overly intelligent response. Thanks! Your a real chip off the old block...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_izzaguy @realDonaldTrump Well i support his current policies and i don't hate anyone. I only appreciate when administration's put the American people first. We have enough problems that need fixing here first. I'm willing to ride it out and see what happens until the next election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChipNoir Your wise intelligent words proceed you... I'm lucky to have had this intelligent conversation with such a genius. Your political party should hire you 2 foretell the future lotto numbers so they can use that money 2 buy a solid chance in the next election. See u in the breadline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteyAirborne @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump Those decisions are made at the local level. Funny how your derogatory statements have no facts or intelligent arguments behind them. Looks like your local administration failed you. I hope for all of our sake... your kids have a better future ahead of them. Have a good night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackmidnight76 @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump If your points are to be considered, that would make it an even better location. I'll be there with my family. Last thing i want to deal with is unruly protestors &amp; where ignorant violence could take place. Do those achieve anything? Not to me. Spend your money lobbying 4 Change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSingam2017 @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump The location has preference when it comes to advocating fur American steel... It's the closest to a big city with multiple hotels, restaurants, etc... To accommodate a large number of people going to the rally. It was a good economic choice for the area. The area will benefit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kshering @samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump Any preservation of that area came from past administration's. Plus our Governor gets to make those decisions. Only The current federal ones are overseen by the Trump administration after Congress passes them. As long as the upper liberals are pro America, they are cool with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knute45 @realDonaldTrump Change isn't always wanted or fair but hopefully beneficial to the American People. Eminent domain unfortunately is a sad reality that hopefully ends positively for the future generations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knute45 @realDonaldTrump Maybe that contact should be renegotiated as well. I'm not familiar with the terms but it really doesn't seem to fit the policy agenda and programs of the current administration. I'm curious if it was negotiated under Obama's admin. Hopefully, it benefits us. Good day to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_izzaguy @realDonaldTrump Well I'm sure there will be plenty of supporters of the President Elect and the current economic situation. That's a positive step towards patriotism in my book. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChipNoir All rhetoric. Look at the positives. The tariffs are only equally the playing field for economic growth of American business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynSimpson9 @achirichella @realDonaldTrump Not where I'm from... I don't place blame. I look at the current facts. The economy is doing well and my business is up. I lost 2 companies during the Obama administration and paid Out way Too much in taxes. Next year I'm projected to Get money back. Haven't had refund in 7 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morguehunter @realDonaldTrump Yeah right on. I'm not a fan of the man, I'm a fan of the President Elect. I support the positive shit and the direction the country is heading. Obviously, not everything but the economy is doing well here in Mn. I also don't complain. I see a lot of the bullshit lies from media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthagravely @frossiemae @realDonaldTrump Duluth its one of the larger cities in Minnesota and he is staging a rally in an area near the iron range where massive barges and ships transport it from its ports. The region has been thriving thanks to his trade policies against foreign steel. Educate yourself. Have a good day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@achirichella @realDonaldTrump No. Unsubstantiated Claim... Please stop with the Doom and gloom and appreciate the current economic successes this country is blessed with. Have a great night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTISTstacy @DarthBannon1 @realDonaldTrump That's great! American freedoms and Democracy at its best. I just hope the protests are peaceful and not mean spirited.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to attending. I'll be bringing my 13 year old daughter to experience what an American rally has to offer. Thank you for coming to Minnesota. Continued prosperity...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You people couldn't be more wrong. The venue is going to be filled with Patriots. Especially, Minnesotans associated w/the steel industry. With the economy booming &amp; new trade regulations on foreign steel, Minnesota which produces 80% of US steel, is thriving. He will be honored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Get the facts... This separation policy Started '06.    https://t.co/xob87zw2ct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NAACP The children are being separated from their families while their parents are in jail awaiting their chance to plead their case to a judge. They committed a crime with a child. In America you could lose your parenting rights all together. This is policy. The kids go to C.P.S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody said it was right but it's the way the (US) has been handling immigration crimes since '06. Also, this countries female inmates don't get their kids with them in jail either. They go thru Child Protective Services when there is no-one to take them. #KeepFamilesTogether<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@j_b_t @kjoerwin Yessir!...

<|startoftext|>@BethShell @_jamesewalkerjr @GenMhayden I told my socialist party friends trying to get one of their politicians on the ticket last election, If you think Trump isn't good for your agenda, think again. If he screws up, it opens up a lot of doors for other parties to walk thru. It has to get worse before it gets better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethShell @_jamesewalkerjr @GenMhayden Well, you may be right there. I think the man is full of ego. Ego is a dangerous thing for any man, especially for a President. But if does what he says he's going to do, we will all benefit. I'm going to stand by him and support his FP strategic plans until I have a reason not 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billowrites5 @realDonaldTrump @g7 This picture speaks volumes.  When your "The Man", they come to you... Not the other way around.  Can't wait to see how all this unfolds. Somehow, I feel our President Elect has something up his sleeve. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethShell @_jamesewalkerjr @GenMhayden I understand what you mean but just my opinion, I think a new deal Will go thru. There is going to be some back and forth game playing but in the end, there might be benefits for both countries. Trump wants what's best for the US but will give some leeway in order to make a deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KweenofNoize214 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 That's perfect. He should organize things like that, that's his lane. He should stay out of politics unless he's really serious about organizing rallies and making change. Screaming  F*** Trump. Really? He's better then that. Or should be..TY for your opinions though. Appreciated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 Nothing wrong with him voicing his opinions as an actor. It's the way he did it. If he's as intelligent as everyone is making him out to be, why couldn't he use his money and fame to change policies. He literally went to the lowest common denominator to disrespect our President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_b_t @kjoerwin If you are in such denial that he IS our President Elect and that IS one of the most important positions in the world... Then explaining why he is more important to the real world then the actor RD will have no effect... Most people could care less about what actors say. I don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstiJesse @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 Right... But are you stating none of the other political figures used that strategy? They all grandstand. It's part of the dog and pony show. He repealed Obama's policies because they didn't work properly. It wasnt necessarily Obama's fault, he couldn't pass what he wanted to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KweenofNoize214 @MizFrizz @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 Have you seen the t-shirts hipsters and kids are wearing nowadays... Way worse then those. I think they were just trying to make a statement. Offensive or not, they got their point across &amp; garnered the attention of a lot of people. They probably don't even swear in real life. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethShell @_jamesewalkerjr @GenMhayden We don't worry about what happens in Canada. They may be great people and allies but they are a non-factor in American Politics. They are still owned and ruled by the Queen. They should try to gain their own freedom first before they criticize ours. It's all Trump strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBoobin @qxeenfatima @nowthisnews It's all ironic at this point. The rhetoric is understood. My point is you don't actually make a difference by not actually contributing to the work. He Took a knee, was anything accomplished except more division. You could say he made things worse. Time will tell. He's out a job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@So_damntired Your absolutely right. It's so obvious. Like i said, it's a strategic move to discredit the Canadian government &amp; fair trade act. He would love to bring America into greater economic strength. As Americans, We have been sold down the river too many times by shady politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caps1928 @A_Dallas_Girl @ALandsoda @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan The only way we enter a nuclear war is if we are attacked on our home front.

<|startoftext|>@Caps1928 @A_Dallas_Girl @ALandsoda @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan The German people were decimated by improper and extreme sanctions, regulations and reparations after WW1 were placed on them.

<|startoftext|>@A_Dallas_Girl @ALandsoda @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan That's awesome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@A_Dallas_Girl @ALandsoda @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan I totally agree. We have done more for the world then any other country or a combination of them. I hold faith that everything is moving in a better direction. He is brave and dangerous at the same time. I'm staying positive. I hope the world does too. Have a great night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@So_damntired @RollandeM @mustangmadd I agree. His tactics are bullish. He is using separation to invoke a monetary response. He knows where to focus negative energy to get his desired result. Only time will tell if it works. The division can only happen if people let it. We will hold him accountable for his mistakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Dallas_Girl @ALandsoda @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan I bet. Ours is not a typical example of what a great leader exhibits... But if what he says he's going to do and actually follows thru with it, he could go down as the greatest president ever...For his actions, not his words. Poor economy breeds change. He is succeeding currently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALandsoda @A_Dallas_Girl @chris_paul_II @KPuckettPE @GrantDevereaux @realDonaldTrump @Canada @japan Exactly... It's a business strategy. People are way too emotional about this. A new fair trade deal could benefit both countries. People need to just chill on the Canada/America  hating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RollandeM @So_damntired @mustangmadd We're fine and our economy is doing great. I don't like his tactics but they have been working. He is America first. There's nothing wrong with that. Nor with Canada wanting what's best for Canada. This is just a business strategy to control the bargaining table. That's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@So_damntired @fanfan21 @POTUS If your an American, he is your President Elect. That is fact!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@So_damntired This is not about hating Canada. It's a business strategy to create a New fair trade agreement with Canada to benefit the American companies exporting to them. I see nothing wrong in that. His techniques are odd but they will work. Ask N.Korea...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddyrogerparker @So_damntired Canada is owned, ruled and controlled by Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain. They also booed our national anthem when George Bush bombed Iraq after 911.

<|startoftext|>@qxeenfatima @DaveBoobin @nowthisnews Thank God for our Veterans. Kinda hypocritical that he needed guidance from a Veteran in order to utilize his so-called first amendment right. Especially knowing the National Anthem is about honoring our soldiers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBoobin @nowthisnews Mocking was the whole point... I'm not really sure what your point was. Mine was that taking a stand by taking a knee, is quite frankly ridiculous. I based my response off what C.K. actually said. Your response was based off nothing but your emotional response. I guess you got me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethShell @_jamesewalkerjr @GenMhayden There is a lot of truth to what you say, no doubt. It is his M.O. to call out those that are not easily swayed by his grand plans for the American people. Unfortunately, there is a whole other side that isn't being shown. Canada media has been destroying Trump for years. Backlash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MizFrizz @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 Just as many images of all other faithful, intellectual, followers of the other politicians out there. I think these look like typical, good hearted, hard working, Americans to me. Intellectuals or not. I tend not to judge People by their looks. That leads to a lot of trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstiJesse @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 There was another person involved in the discussion but dropped out when they couldn't provide any real facts beyond their own personal emotions into the argument. That's why you can't see their responses. And he isn't playing the role... He "IS" our President. That is a fact.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos I believe the best Artists are able to control the narrative in a way that can disrupt the flow of consciousness among their audience. It's propaganda.

<|startoftext|>@gwenorel1 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 I know how this country started but complaining/voicing opinions does nothing. Patriots actually took up arms.

<|startoftext|>@gwenorel1 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 I seriously don't think you understand that complaining about your President is not a checks and balance system.

<|startoftext|>@gwenorel1 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 What people have lost jobs? Has is barely up compared to 4 years ago. Based off inflation alone, gas is still under projected costs. I hate rising has costs too but it's not a problem yet. I am worried about the environment but that's not trumps fault. The kid thing is nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwenorel1 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 It's not blind and he isn't a tyrant. You have to use facts in your argument, not emotions. Facts are... Our economy is very strong right now. He is accomplishing things that the past few presidents haven't been able to. Times are changing for the betterment of the u.s. economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwenorel1 @allisonBeDemure @joncoopertweets @Solutioneer72 I agree he's not a king... He's an elected official. Who does do some ridiculous things at times...

<|startoftext|>@kjoerwin I'm glad he's going to speak out... Just wish he actually used his big words and maybe say something substantial that could actually make change. Until then, he's just another Hollywood whiner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_MCMLXXXIX I lost interest in DeNiro when the real rapperJay Z said he was excited to live next to him but he ended up being an asshole neighbor. Complaining about everything and calling condo management/cops on him, etc... I think that pretty much sums it up. He's a sad man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlanaKStewart Yeah, I couldn't agree more. DeNiro is a great actor. It's sad to see him feel the need to grandstand at the award show.

<|startoftext|>@PeteRock Donald Trump is nothing more then a figure head and a policy creator in our times. Standing for the National Anthem has nothing to do with him.

<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 I agree with the President that there needs to be some sort of reform when it comes to immigration. I have seen first hand the problems with a open door policy. From the financial tax burden &amp; the criminals entering illegally. I think a good checks &amp; balance system is appropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 The hail term came from ancient Rome. It wasn't only used 4 Hitler.  We use it in America and have a song named "Hail to the Chief". Don't take it So literal and segue into something so minor as wordplay. The President most likely refuses to acknowledge the openly racist argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 Well these guys are just idiots. There is a lot of very fine and intelligent people that voted for and continue to support our President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 I agree with you on that. We may not see eye to eye on respecting and honoring our military history by standing for the National Anthem but we have shown what makes this country great... Having a voice and the freedom to exercise our rights. Best of luck to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think you should reconsider canceling it. To punish some of the players over the actions of the rest of the team, is unfair. Meeting the President of the United States is probably a dream come true to those patriotic players. Celebrate them and their contributions to the Game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 I will pray for her, her family &amp; everyone else that has been tragically killed over such blatant nonsense. The whole point of this argument was that I honor those that have fought &amp; lost their lives 4 the freedoms of this country. It's not perfect but i will always show respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 I'm not black or brown and I survived police brutality multiple times. I might have been lucky or at least i count myself lucky. You can read my encounter here:     https://t.co/UpB2r38Vwd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 Ah... Now Hitler! Really? Now your just being silly. Like i said, there is a time and a place to air grievances. I don't blame CK for being young and ignorant to the real meaning behind the National Anthem and why we pay homage to the Americans who fought to give us our freedoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SStandardCo I'm digging the design. I'm curious what the anchor represents. Can you explain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 How did this turn into Trump Bashing? I get Trump isnt your ideal politician, but he's still our commander &amp; chief. Like it or not. Not saying he shouldn't be held accountable to a higher standard but it Is what it Is? Don't put the cart Before the horse. support not criticism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 #take2knees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 He put his life on the line. Not you, not me and certainly not CK... That's what real heros do. Instead of one knee, You should take 2 knees tonight and thank your God for guys like Pat Tillman. They gave you the choice to be a less of an American Patriot. Thank you veterans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 The only blind person is you. Whereas, there is a point to be made, it's being made poorly. There is a time and a place. Yes, CK did bring attention to the fact that there is a problem. Geez, don't think anyone knew that? Eyes wide open. There's racism &amp; police brutality? No way!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 As a parent, i can say this... I would be proud of this young man for standing up (kneeling)  for what he believes in.   As a patriot of this country, I'm ashamed at what he did in order to do it.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Their are real social justice hero's out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 Oh and if you think I'm defending police brutality, you and I obviously aren't living in the same world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 Oh they may... Reason being, if they have to fight injustice, they will be willing to fight it on the front lines, not behind a tv screen. Change comes by action. Appropriate action. He gets accolades for speaking freely while others actually do the work. What a farse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 Neither is honoring and respecting the patriots who fought and died for those rights... But out of respect and honor, we created 3 national holidays for it. You ever notice its only people that have never done anything for their country that complain...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 And you believe that plain was to take a knee during the National Anthem to call attention to police brutality on black &amp; brown people. That's what you consider freedom of speech. How about donate all his millions to federal programs that better train cops in stressful situations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, someone makes sense of it all... This coach deserves an award. Although, in giving him it, i would figure he would probably leave it at the podium and say he is unworthy of receiving it &amp; that it should be given to each family of military members who served this country.  https://t.co/3sIB6Hwais<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews So let me get this straight, CK is fighting the oppression of blacks &amp; browns, in an unjust system created out of systemic racism &amp; executed by a regime of hatred from police officers, by touching his knee to the ground, during the National Anthem, on tv. That makes sense! U.S.A.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisDMillet @Kaepernick7 When you choose not to stand for our #NationalAnthem, your choosing not to honor the brave men and women whom have fought and given their lives for the people of this country and the freedoms we have.
