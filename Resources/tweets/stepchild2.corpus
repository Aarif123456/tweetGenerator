<|startoftext|>@Bernie_Dobson @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn Cool.  Complaining opposition it is.   I'd agree be brexit helped loose but that was leadership fault Lack of ambition, ability to compromise is terrible.  Tories will govern indefinitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bernie_Dobson @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn If the party went goes left of centre then we have a chance of being elected and doing some good for the country.

<|startoftext|>@Bernie_Dobson @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn If they're happy complaining by the sidelines, forming committees and going on marches to complain about something then stick with Corbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bernie_Dobson @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn True.  But Labour were spanked by the Tories.  You're right about values but they don't seem to be shared by the rest of the country.  I held my nose and voted for Corbyn even though I thought he was terrible.  If Labour want to govern then they need to evolve<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samdeedes @LadyMaryRising @Peter_Bennet @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn @keirstarmer @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer True.  But if Corbyn is unelectable and you don't find Starmer palatable, then who? Personally, Starmer is a breath of fresh air, a leader who can actually lead!.

<|startoftext|>@LadyMaryRising @Peter_Bennet @CassiPerry4 @jeremycorbyn @keirstarmer @UKLabour The only Labour leader who is remotely electable. The question is, does Labour actually want to govern or do they want to be that person who sits and complains about everything but is free from responsibility? I want labour in government!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aley_aa UK has free press. See how much lies from farage et al were aloud to be spouted unchecked. Just because you support the speaker that doesn't mean they shouldn't be held to account. Johnson lies consistently, but he will be held to account eventually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politicalaardv3 We need a press which only repeats what the government wants it to do. We need to be like Russia or North Korea üëçüëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leighhurst18 @MPIainDS @Telegraph We are leaving. The problem arises from the brexiteer elite not specifing on what terms or how to leave. The present battle is to ensure that it is done constitutionally and within the law and with scrutiny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighhurst18 @MPIainDS @Telegraph Exactly. Brexiteer campainers lie,  cheat,  mis-inform and slither around for their own personal gain. Then they go and mislead the queen and bare-faced lie to the country<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeaveEUOfficial In the UK EVERYONE is subject to the rule of law. This includes anti-democracy brexiteers. I thought that this is what you wanted? Bringing power back to britsh Parliament and britsh courts,  you can't have it both ways<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Who mentioned nazis? üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Obviously that's linked into confronting the rise of the far right and neo fascists (popularism is the msm term)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 üòÇüòÇüòÇtop work! We both know that that's not the case. Eco's do generally come from the left but even the comfortable middle appreciate that work needs to be done. It's not possible to continue to rape the planet without consequence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Balanced people look at the mass of evidence and the quality of the info or of the org putting it out. Based on that the denyers have no leg to stand on. Just because you don't like something doesn't make it less true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Decent people wake up and think "how can I make things better. How can I improve what we have" only the ignorant,  selfish or greedy wake up and think "fuck everybody else... More,  more,  more" very shallow,  short sighted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 When it is empirically shown to be warming,  ice caps melting,  glacier losses and rising sea levels and we can do things to limit or negate then it's not just bad it's plain stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 That's usually the case with the denyers. If it snows "look the planet isn't warming" but an increase in extreme weather events...  "huh,  what...." gazes at floor...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 üòÇüòÇüòÇ people generally are stupid... They get presented with facts then choose to ignore them because of their unwillingness to change despite the predicted outcome. The only ones denying climate change now are the wackos and those with a vested interest in the status quo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bukowski20191 Future generations will look back and say  "so they could have done something"  "yes" "but they didn't"  "no" "why not?" "too selfish.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CryinHillary @krassenstein Do either a greeting of hello (kiss on the cheek) or photoshop but certainly not the president of America disrespecting the memory of fall soldiers. Perspective and truth is the key<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UFTKaz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He's still working on what comes after the letter G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina Before I buy it please can you tell me how absorbant it is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The president is prepared to see a tree delivered but not to honour War heroes. Disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What. This is crazy talk. Go see a doctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep. Tired of loosing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Brexiteers don't have the balls to do the job, they just complain from the sidelines. Gove offered Brexit sec but declined. Weak weak weak... All of you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WriterWeegs @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may @KattyKayBBC @ChristianFraser Criminal investigation guilty pleas for the tie breaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddyashdown Sadly not limited to the tories. The weasels which are our political "elite" are one of the reasons Brexit was doomed from the off<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Seek help dude (after your arrest it will be provided) To be fair, if I was in your position I'd be shitting myself too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I guess charges are coming if you're spouting lies like these<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul__johnson @KattyKayBBC The power grab starts in earnest. The real reason for this "shit storm"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombstoneblues @Nigel_Farage Plus a 150k package for "loosing his job" as I understand it. Quids in for "fuck-it-up-farage"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Because those in power have to deal with reality. Those standing on the sidelines like Nigel would complain whatever the outcome and totally fuck it up if they had power, which is why they have non, and also why they ran away when Brexit was agreed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Entirely your fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump If he could find how to close an umbrella it'd be a start.... I think curing cancer is a bit of a big ask for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why is it disrespectful for a footballer to kneel during the anthem but perfectly fine for the president to miss paying his respects on armistice day. The secret service line is a lie. #disgrace #FakePresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kbari12 @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @FBI Ditto the trump crime enterprise. Release returns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not really what we should hear from a president. Let me help you. Work needs to be done to ensure that all votes counted are legal and legitimate, once the winner is established they can then take the seat. Partisanship needs to step to one side for democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity If the president told the truth, released his taxes and stopped working for the USA /RUSSIA /SAUDI partnership then he'd be in jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlaBotts @seanhannity The president uses an unsecured private phone. Hannity the trump campaign manager somehow overlooks this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@partyofthepeopl @VooDoomusik1 @PeterMBrown45 @foxandfriends Don't believe all high command tells you. Misinformation from the supreme leader is one of the most dangerous things of all. "In war, the first casualty is the truth"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Get educated, you know nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Instead of respecting the dead of ww1 as you're supposed to. You deserve no respect, time, vote. You are a low life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you saying that you're trying to steal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxandfriends The world stands behind President Macron in his efforts to stem the growing threat from America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump In all seriousness there is at great evil in the White House. The world must come together to protect peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just in... POTUS collusion.... New elections needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump USA is the greatest treat to world peace at present<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Cool. Happy to go along with ANY investigation into vote rigging /collusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Either your Russian friends helped you win in the first instance or the voters have finally seen through to you evil core<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends You weren't so bothered in the last election with Russia. Is the "fraud" just what results look like if you're not paying the Russians to work with you?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Which part of this criminal enterprise is she in charge of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillHouston11 @TrumpIsKnownAs @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS That's where we differ. Trump supporters see to have no morals/values, their barometer is in the bank. This is fine for some but the very bottom of society struggles. America can be better. Environmental roll-back is also hugely short-sighted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillHouston11 @TrumpIsKnownAs @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS That's the nature of politics, it depends on values and what you think as best. Trump is extreme as a politician and unusual in his approach so receives extreme reactions. He should not attack the integrity of law or journalism though. Very bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillHouston11 @TrumpIsKnownAs @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I think he's a terrible man but that's beside the point.

<|startoftext|>@WillHouston11 @TrumpIsKnownAs @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I would love to see trump in jail but it must be proved in a court of law.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We must clamp down on free speech and on the individuals right to protest! Long live the regime!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @MZHemingway @realDonaldTrump So much wrong with this. Trump is a traitor plain and simple. If you think it is ok for foreign powers to work to affect elections you are a traitor also. Trump is in power, he should be investigated, and is obviously, immediately<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews You needed a survey to work that out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @AlanDersh Look, it's not a competition, we all hate trump. What we're trying to establish is whether he broke the law. Everyone in every office has political leaning, that does not mean that they will not do their just thoroughly or without bias<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamiecust @anguish101 @FoxNews The application of law is very different to authoritarianism, as I assume you well know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiecust @anguish101 @FoxNews Right wing is Conservative, fascism is nazism etc. Extremeism is not desirable. You seem to have an issue with liberalism. Laws are required. History and social norms define the perameters. Everything inside there perameters is acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiecust @anguish101 @FoxNews That that vilifies or denegrates sections of society based, usually, on race or sexuality for example. Therefore it is fine to disagree with political stance but not on the traits of the individual or group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiecust @anguish101 @FoxNews There's free speach then there's hate speach potentially inciting violence /hate crimes. This is free speach<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD I can't understand how a person of religion can support this despot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD Even to compare trump to Jesus in person or situation is ridiculous and frankly quite worrying.  I don't believe in Jesus but generally respect those that do. I respect Dems and Reps but not trump. He's evil,  he's devisive and a deviant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD Your own words. Apparently people like me took down Jesus and people like me want to take down trump. Therefore trump is Jesus? Not interested in Christian militia. Can't wait before they're all Sent scuttling back under their collective rock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD And surely comparing trump to Jesus is blasphemy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD I'm saying that the two beliefs are on opposition and it seems impossible to be Christian and support trump considering what he has done and his policies. I do not expect to change your mind but don't understand your position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD Trump,  a documented sex offender,  potential rapist and user of prostitutes. Sounds just like the type of person a religious person should support<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMKM @BoomBangarang @djf510 @WindhundeHaus I'm wanting for justification for need for semi automatic weapons or need for legal kits to make automatic. Not hopeful though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMKM @BoomBangarang @djf510 @WindhundeHaus That would be the 30 million given to Trump to ensure no further regulation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @POTUS There is no god of any description. Why people continue with medieval folk law I don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL Have you read 1984, It can't happen here or Brave new world where Trump get his politics from.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Lazulu_OFFICIAL Hope the Italians don't use any big words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews The president of the US sinks to an all time low. National disgrace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump To all Americans. You've really got to do something about this prick really soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your Russian connections?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're a low rated president, so what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're a looser every day of the week and you're taking America with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL Trump fascists goose stepping around the country like "where do we invade next" You think Hitler was making Germany great again. Idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL And what did trump do about it? He removed sanctions AGAINST his Russian friends. Trump was compliant. Lock him up, lock him up....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL Was trump part of ww2? Has he rewritten the truth and claimed he stormed Normandy beaches alone? I bet you'd believe him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL @TruthFeedNews Ha ha ha üòÇ just because you don't understand stuff it doesn't mean it's not true. Try harder with learning. Concentrate and you'll get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL @TruthFeedNews Through foreign policy and environmental policy he attacks the world. He is our enemy. His time will come :-) Lock him up, lock him up....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJAYTIGER All right right minded people should care about any unarmed person being shot, we should also care if police are shot. Trumps a prick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazulu_OFFICIAL @TruthFeedNews The Truth. Scum president attacks the world. The truth must be broadcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthFeedNews Report reveals that trump is really mickey mouse is a stupid mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanJensen2018 @PatriotByGod @AppSame @JrcheneyJohn @jojoh888 @LeahR77 @bradcrain @StacyLStiles @DrMartyFox @Rubysayzz @TheTrumpLady I heard Trump got paid millions from ISIS directly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Perhaps they thought you'd make a great president.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump In that case America needs a new president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The poll was taken at a trump rally and you still only got 50% approval<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And the net tightens muah ha ha ha ha....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Won't it all come out at the trial?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corrynmb @realDonaldTrump We look forward to you visiting the UK. You will see the biggest protests against you ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxnation His only interest is his own enrichment and those around him. Too shallow, too stupid, too weak. Jail him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stemac5a Spectacular. Huge congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump From everyone here in the UK. We do not want you. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJBrianDawe @realDonaldTrump More Americans are killed every year by other Americans. How do you suggest to fix that? Or doesn't that matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wasn't it shown that she was straight and that your Russian buddies planted fake news. YOU ARE A CROOK! #JAILTHEPRESIDENT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrevorHarlock @Eurosport_UK Who the hell is quest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PernicketyPern Great idea. I've sown a little wild flower boarder so it should look great in a pot by that üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PernicketyPern Good idea, thanks. My garden is the size of a stamp buy I could probably have one in a big pot. Thanks üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#askmontyandjoe I want bees and butterflies in my garden. What's the plant I should start with to encourage them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsportmotogp Terribly tragic news. A star and a true champion. My thoughts are with friends and family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I've never seen a president put in jail before but you could be the one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What else did you tell them Comrade?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wanted to find out who was passing info to the US media. Only you passed info to Russia. #traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's like you're being followed around by big flashing red arrows saying Guilty! #draintheswamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can you not think of anyone else to bomb to distract the media?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You getting a bit twitchy there fella, is prison looming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well said DT. There has never been a time like this, where the president openly lies to the American people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mamakin72 @YoungDems4Trump That's just a list of lies or monumentally stupid decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoungDems4Trump For his rich friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you the first president to be this publicly politically castrated. Everyone is laughing at you....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtCafeNorwich @eddiemair She was criticising something she voted for then stating the tories were rigging elections. She was hopeless, and well out of her depth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What's the real media. Who do we believe and how do we know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No pay necessary. Their hate for a dishonest president was sufficient for everyone who turned out. You have to buy supporters. #russiancash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxandfriends @RealBrittHughes Respected news outlets around the world are investigating American politics, Fox News isn't respected for either impartiality or accuracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRUDGE_REPORT @realDonaldTrump Seriously are you not taking your medication?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI Were you bugged by the Russians and did you tell them where to put the mics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lock him up, lock him up, lock him up.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Asking for immunity is just like waving a great big flag saying Guilty. No immunity to offenders. Drain the swamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump so how are your popularity ratings going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump a new era of trump stupidity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Propaganda. Watch Fox, don't concern yourself with the truth it's inconvenient<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're in it up to your neck. What are you going to make up this time to divert attention? Obama and the space aliens? Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump your own party turned away from you realising the pure evil you embody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump major investigation by the FBI into you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump how did that work out for ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump if anyone knows dishonesty it's you Comrade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump with the help of Russia USA will be safe again... hang on, that can't be right....<|endoftext|>
