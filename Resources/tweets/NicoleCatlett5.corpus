<|startoftext|>Give it a rest. The only thing you’ve won is a ticket out of the WH. Take your demon spawn with you. @BrianKempGA has no integrity after what he did to win his election, so if he could cheat for you he would. So 🤐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Those angels from Africa that Paula White was trying to send said “Not today Satan! 😈” LOL! 🤣  @realDonaldTrump is the most corrupt president in history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that’s exactly what happened! No police in riot gear, pepper spray or rubber bullets. No beatings or arrests with knees on neck. In my opinion, the Proud Boys and police are on the same team. No doubt about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would think after being shot that he would have a come to Jesus moment, but instead the devil returned his wretched soul! The @GOP are enemies of the people and they must have consequences for what they have done. America will implode if this behavior keeps up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris4Perkins Ummm... I don’t see how the mailman was able to continue delivering mail that day! I would have gone ballistic! Keep your damn body fluids to yourself!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do you really think that would have made a damn bit of difference?!?!  You are the #WorstPresidentInUSHistory and the investigation into a non-candidate wouldn’t have given you one vote from resisters.  #81MillionVotes beats 74M. Trump was/is the dumbest student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent A bimbo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You lost the 2020 election by over 7 million votes, 81 million Americans voted you out! You shouldn’t be in office now since you lost to Hillary by 3 million votes. But, the out dated electoral college failed Americans in 2016.  https://t.co/1TPdFywZDr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh it’s so radical for Democrats to want: - Americans to have healthcare  - Affordable education  - Food on the table - Americans to have well paying jobs  - Clean air and water - Police accountability  - Americans to vote - etc  The @GOP hates Americans &amp; the Constitution<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This statement of yours is so infuriating!🤬 You repulsive republicans control the senate and the Democrats have sent you two bills and you’ve refused to vote on them. Republicans don’t give a damn about struggling Americans. You’re such evil trash! 🖕#MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Democrats better figure out what’s going on, otherwise we’re going to lose the House in two years.  With all the psychopath and his evil minions have done for 4 years, there’s no way Democrats should have lost so many seats. I’m definitely worried.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is really sick! What do they expect him to do, go change all the votes to trump! They already did a recount and he still lost.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What exactly are you expecting @GovKemp to do...lie, cheat, steal? Well he is good at that, but criminal activity on the GA Senate races won’t turn out well for either of you.

<|startoftext|>@CNN #TrumpTaxScam- "The law initially lowered taxes for most Americans, but it built in automatic, stepped tax increases every two years that begin in 2021 and that by 2027 would affect nearly everyone but people at the top of the economic hierarchy,"  They will blame @JoeBiden SMH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I’m sure trump has inquired about this. But all hell would break out if that happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you republicans are casting the illegal votes. That’s one less vote for you, LOL!  #TrumpIsLosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is there a runners up prize (flowers, tiny hands award) that I’m not aware of? You sure didn’t come in at first place. You lost by 5M votes and the electoral college. I know...you won a free moving truck, good for an hour. Enjoy!  #TrumpIsALooser  #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmpeeler Yes, they can which will be a problem because DeJoy said he’s putting his mail slow down scheme back in place after the judges court order expires at the end November.  Don’t mail them in, drop them off or vote in person. Biden can’t remove DeJoy, only the PO Govenors can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenGriffinFNC @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I hope you all are keeping up with what’s going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I like what Frank Figliuzzi just said on MSNBC, ‘We can do this the hard way or the easy way!’. Looks like they are choosing the hard way, in which I will enjoy seeing trump thrown out on his ass and everyone in his putrid administration!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liberalpuppy Aww, man I missed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! As soon as he walks away from the podium at the inauguration, republicans will say ‘thousands of Americans have died from covid-19 under his watch’. They will finally care. I can’t stand elected republicans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Seriously, WTF is wrong with you?!?! You haven’t won anything! The @GOP plan all along was to cry foul over mail in ballots.   Your voter suppression and dismantling of the post office didn’t work.  These mail in ballots are legal, were counted last and went for Biden. EOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar @NicolleDWallace Good morning! 🌞 I’m proud to have helped with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are they even updating the Georgia senate race count on tv? I want Ossoff to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hillary knew trump oh so well in the debates. If things don’t go Donald’s way then it’s rigged against him.   https://t.co/LXj59WKfaK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the highlights! Hated him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraGideon In general, a candidate may give a statement conceding the election to his or her opponent. That concession, however, is not legally binding, and the candidate can still win the election. Ex. Al Gore (D) conceded to George W. Bush (R) but lost due to courts.  Retract!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraGideon Why did you concede, they are still counting! Why are you giving up?!?! I hope your remarks are going to be that you are retracting your statement. Collins is under 50%!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So even if Biden wins we won’t get anything done because we aren’t going to take over the senate. This is fucked up. I’m so pissed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr #MoscowMitch we don’t need more $ for military equipment right now or for an FBI building which helps the #LiarInChief. Also, the republicans suggested $200 unemployment benefits is bogus and heartless. I pray you are sent home to retire in Nov. And I hope you reap what you sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Every day you lie to us. The Democrats in the House passed a bill months ago, which #MoscowMitch sat on for months.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Having less money in the bank, doesn’t make you lesser than someone with more money in the bank.

<|startoftext|>Exactly! And @jack and @Twitter won’t do anything about the 100k fake followers @realDonaldTrump gets like clockwork every two days. They are fake, they have 0-6 followers, no likes, tweets or retweet’s. I think @jack is in on it. tRumps followers should be cut in half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn’t the Minneapolis police after detaining him, just place him in the car?!?! I know why, because the police in Amerikkka enjoy brutalizing African Americans.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NorahODonnell @60Minutes Stop making crap up! He didn’t sign off on emergency usage of that drug, he signed off on a clinical study of the drug for Covid19.

Then rethugs tweet about getting PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look you #RussianPuppet aka @realDonaldTrump, none of your sycophants fabricated nonsense about the Obama administration is going to distract America from your 3 1/2 years of flat out incompetence. #BlueWave2020 will wipe you, #MoscowMitchMcConnell, Lindsey G. away for good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You aren’t doing anything but stealing PPE from states that acquire it on their own, then you dole it out like you found and purchased it! 😡 You and your administration receive an ‘F’ on your failure to keep Americans safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar OMG!!! He can’t stop lying. He didn’t inherit no ammunition! And he’s had 3 1/2 years to add more to the stockpile if he wanted to. I hate @realDonaldTrump. Such a disgusting being.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TIME He’s out of his fu**ing mind! My child won’t be going. Send Baron and your other grandkids if you want @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who gives a damn if we’re doing more testing than any other country!?!? The point is we’re not doing enough testing within our own country! Now just shut the hell up! Damn! I can’t wait until you’re gone. #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Scott! I look forward to hearing your thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The FAKE PRESIDENT is a coward for canceling the coronavirus briefings. I’m guessing the one tonight will be from the Oval Office with no questions from reporters. @realDonaldTrump can’t run for long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN CNN nor MSNBC has the ability to prevent fox from participating in the Democrats debates, you idiot. I’m glad faux news is starting to turn on you. Time to break away from your lunacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one says this 👆. The only thing you’ve done is your #TaxScam which I pray will be repealed in 2021 by the Biden administration. You did botch the covid-19 response, causing many deaths, massive unemployment, but I digress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Which you have none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re on live tv fool! And it’s being recorded around the world. #TrumpIsAnIdiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump lies every single day! He was dead serious! #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a good one!!😂😂 So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the closest #ChickenDonald has come to running! 😂😂 #TrumpIsALaughingStock  @realDonaldTrump #DontInjectDisinfectant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop giving away our PPE and ventilators until we get America in a better place. You’re always looking for a pat on the back from someone. You’re pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG!! She looks highly disturbed and mortified. @realDonaldTrump is beyond stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr is an disgusting being. NY pays more to the fed gov then they take. Unlike your welfare state of Kentucky. The PO💩 @realDonaldTrump only allowed corona planes to come into Democrat states on purpose. Then u all have the nerve 2 bitch about helping these states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports What the hell! He can leave and never come back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi, President Obama!! We will be waiting a long time, because nothing coherent comes out of @realDonaldTrump administration. Thank goodness for our Democrat governors and mayors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump your administration is still f’ing up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! @realDonaldTrump is sickening. Thank you @JDiamond1 for all you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlavicLady88 @cljmo Not once and never will! I don’t even capitalize his name, it’s just ‘trump’, if I’m not calling him the 🍊 🤡.  https://t.co/vLs9uQ6BhB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’ve been stealing ventilators and PPE from Democrat run states, when they’ve purchased them on their own without federal help and you’ve then handed the stolen goods out to red republican run states, which should be illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The states would have supplies and ventilators, if your administration and #FEMA would stop snatching them up from the states when they acquired them from private companies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/DguZ0JlDyb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 @realDonaldTrump is sickening and repulsive. Thank goodness for direct deposit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! The corruption in the trump administration never ends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏👏👏That’s my President!! And thank you for endorsing my next President @JoeBiden #BlueWave2020 🌊🌊  See you on the campaign trail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The republican @Scotus blows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump and GOP @Scotus loss today! Thank you Wisconsin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She was on his a$$! Didn’t let up. Love her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is still so powerful! The spineless  @GOP won’t do anything against @realDonaldTrump. So it’s up to us @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ @realDonaldTrump @VP That came from the 500 ventilators that trump stole from Colorado that they purchased from a private company and trump stole the order to dole out to republicans. Sick fu**s!  https://t.co/iTMORfXsRN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @rww_gop This statement is funny as hell 😂! You’re definitely telling jokes here. No one with any sense is voting for that orange 🤡. He’s totally incompetent, along with the corrupt @GOP. #WorstPresidentInHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr If the Democrats blocked a bill it’s because the republican bill is fu**ed up! Don’t worry, the Democrats will fix your screw ups as usual.   Now, help fund the post office USPS, instead of continually trying to destroy it. #MoscowMitch #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama is the leader we need at this time.  Not this useless, incompetent clown @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrudyandPierre @wisgop @Scotus I’m so sorry you had to go through that Trudy. But, thank you for hanging in there and voting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Pure $hit show when you’re at the podium!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief! Trumps removal can’t come fast enough! All ethics with this orange 🤡  administration gets thrown out the window daily!  @realDonaldTrump #WorstPresidentInHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope this $hit backfires on @realDonaldTrump, @Scotus, @GOP and Daniel Kelly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotus is run by trump groupies, who hears cases and rule by ideology instead of by laws. America is finished, point blank period. Repub @Scotus don’t give a damn about this country. They just voted for voter suppression. They must realize republicans must show up to vote 2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow He survives because he’s a trump appointee and you only get the boot if trump wants you gone. This acting secretary did exactly what he was told to do by trump himself. Trump doesn’t want anyone out there speaking the truth on his administrations failures concerning Covid-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is inept disgrace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ad! #TrumpPandemic #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBPritzker @chicagosmayor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ad! 💯 truth.  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @GOP are failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don’t you have something better to do?!?! You have the attention span of a gnat. Plus, I’m sure they weren’t expecting us to pay for their security. But, we can cut yours and your families. I’m tired of paying for you grifters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Stop kissing @realDonaldTrump a$$ and put a shelter in place NOW!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @VP for being a better man than @realDonaldTrump   @realDonaldTrump is so petty, I bet you he’s been holding back relief from states with majority Democrats on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WTF are you waiting for!!! Invoke the Defense Production Act! This is beyond ridiculous! @realDonaldTrump is incompetent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That tells us everything we already knew about the @GOP @SenateGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I see you’re about to act like a real a$$ in your coming news conference. Nothing new!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You just want to open back up those roach/bed bug motels you own!  #WorstPresidentEver  #TrumpVirus  #Trumpandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No! Everything you’ve done before this pandemic is going to make you loose the election! Like: working with Russia, shifting tax payer $$ to your companies, trying to make Ukraine do your dirty work on Joe B., #TaxScam etc. As usual, you only care about yourself. Wise up MAGATs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ad! @JoeBiden @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSherman @SpeakerPelosi you aren’t going to let this happen, right?!?!  @GOP as usual are up to no good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Oh please! 🤮 @realDonaldTrump is a 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics Sounds like the media didn’t fact check him to his face! SMH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JBPritzker @CNN Thank you governors for your leadership and tireless work during this #TrumpPandemic   #TrumpIsAFailure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JBPritzker @CNN You and your administration are incompetent! You’re still lying about the needed medical supplies. Thank goodness we have these great governors @JBPritzker taking charge, because otherwise more people would be infected and possibly would have died. #TrumpPandemic  #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Com. Hardy! Florida is lucky to have you. Great job!   https://t.co/NCWohEk1dm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a sicko!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholasbva @tailin107 @washingtonpost Yeah, this administration usually lies first on camera, then comes back later on off camera to clarify. It’s probably not written anywhere, because the GOP will definitely vote it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost I highly doubt this will happen. But, if it does, this money will be taxed and then I’ll have to claim it as additional income during tax time. The middle class has already been screwed over by #TrumpTaxScam   Yippee 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump People who need to be tested can’t get a test.  Medical staff don’t have the supplies to keep themselves safe while working.  And my 401k says otherwise. I’ve lost tens of thousands.  #TrumpPandemic  #WorstPresidentEver  #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re such an a$$! Can you ever not be petty?!?!   #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump FYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Right! And he was only up there 5 seconds before he showed his racism calling it the Chinese virus. He’s such a jerk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your large circular orange body isn’t hidden!  🍊 🤡  We’ll win when you’re removed from office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! He’s an imbecile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo @MSignorile @realDonaldTrump has some damn nerve! SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh wee, don’t hold back Joe! Glad I didn’t watch the imbecile-in-chief. Like you said, he’s totally unfit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Jentezen @freechapel Sorry, I’m busy and any church you recommend has to be satanic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME I don’t believe for one second that he or his sycophant doctors would tell the truth about the results. They’ll just say he’s healthier than a 20 yr old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t tell me or any other American when to pray, Dictator-In-Chief!   Mr. Two Corinthians Just 🤫🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder of what you did @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics I was just thinking the same thing! It’s sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov How about you stop trying to compare pandemics and get off your orange a$$ and fix the one on your watch! The Obama administration handled N1H1 and Ebola with 100% competence, listened to science and put emergency protocols into place. Your administration is a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov @realDonaldTrump this is your administrations fault. Doctors and nurses say that they don’t have the corona virus test kits and if they do have them they aren’t complete. WTF! Why didn’t your administration use the WHO test kits?!?! Morons in charge! #WorstPresidentInHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Americans elected @HillaryClinton , the electoral college elected you. And their wasn’t a coup you imbecile. And don’t get me started on how my 401k looks today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ummm... you don’t have anyone running against you, so of course you would win, duh! 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do you realize how asinine this tweet sounds?!?! You need some serious help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DHS_Wolf Did your lap dog @DevinNunes run over and tell you that?!?!  What time does a presidents work day start? You’ve been tweeting B.S. all morning. You’re the laziest and dumbest occupant I’ve ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can’t speak on anyone’s leadership. You couldn’t lead a 🐕 to a 🌳!  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you’re screwing up the stock market, start acting presidenti..oh never mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is the #WorstPresidentInHistory  You went golfing when we’re in a global crisis! Such a disgrace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You didn’t close any borders, you prevented certain countries from flying to America. Some countries had already stopped flying. And you make yourself look bad 24/7 with no help from the media. Stop blaming others for showing how incompetent you and your administration are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You go from one sycophant to another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 @ezraklein @realDonaldTrump is so sickening. He has to make everything about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All dressed and ready to fly to that dump Mar-a-Lago, I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DNC @JoeBiden @BernieSanders  Trump just admitted he would be cutting entitlements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotus Chief Justice Robert’s is on the trump train (tries to play like he isn’t). Robert’s knew exactly what Schumer meant. We heard crickets on your rebuke of trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything coming out of his mouth especially about the Obama administration is 100% lies! 😡He’s trying to throw Obama out there to cover up for his failures and have faux news run with this false statement.  No words can describe how much I detest @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How about you have several STFU’s!  #WorstPresidentEver  #ImpeachedForever  #BlueWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The republican races are uncontested. Who the hell else would have won?!?! SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SenCoryGardner @SteveDaines This tweet is laughable!! 😂😂 You don’t give a damn about the parks or environment. You wouldn’t have reversed all the protections that Obama put in place. But you’re a hate filled demon, so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! We’ve got to win back the senate and #DitchMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So MSNBC got rid of Chris Matthews Hardball for talking about a woman’s looks, but this lady MSNBC anchor Alison Morris is still on the payroll who flat out said on tv when reporting on Kobe B. death ‘Los Angeles ni**ers’?!?! There aren’t any g’s in Lakers.  Interesting MNBC?  https://t.co/ShpotMtLJ4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump STHU with this mess! You’re so ignorant. How is dropping out of a race because your delegate count isn’t looking good, a coup?!?! Everyone still has the right to vote (although republicans try to prevent that every way they can).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Praying for the devils minion! What a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Umm, your expert said it would be more than a year for a vaccine. Stop pushing this lie that a vaccine will be available within weeks or months.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lawrence Wondering why Tulsi G. is still running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Shocked you aren’t in Florida golfing. Someone must have told you that would be a bad look. More shocked that you listened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Anything coming out of your mouth will be lies and pure fiction. You can’t be trusted to tell the truth about anything. Are you going to continue with the lie of only having 15 cases in America? I’ll pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say this all the time! I don’t follow that fool. I hope your followers listen to you and unfollow @realDonaldTrump   He also has 100k fake followers added every 2 days and @Twitter won’t look into that and do anything about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every single time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar What an idiot! So he’s about to give whatever to his daughter, then she’s going to pass it on at school! Ugh, I can’t with these people. We’re f’d.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump First off, they haven’t done a damn thing yet and second why do all briefings to the public have to go through your lap dog Pence aka you first? Third your stock market was f’ked up today. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Grow the hell up! You’re sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is the #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow So, @VP Pence is there to squash any news coming from the CDC, so tRump @realDonaldTrump can try and get the stock market back on the upswing.   Got it! Always knew tRump didn’t give a darn about Americans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For the history records! LOL!  @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is only putting @VP in charge of the #CoronavirusOutbreak so when SHTF he can blame Mike.  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu They need to fix that pronto! I can see many people thinking that there are only 4 candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov @SecAzar Trumps meetings and calls are with FauxNews.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I didn’t realize America had a socialism slush fund for farmers!  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WTF! No way! The American people are paying for these welfare checks to the farmers. They already took money from us twice. And some of the farmers say they don’t want the aid, it’s not helping. Stop with the pandering and please get someone to explain how tariffs work!  🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please, no one believes this but the media and MAGAt twits!   You and Barr work together on your daily corruption.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN Not today satan! Lt. Col. Vindman was the only person in the room with morals and ethics and not one of your lying lap dogs.

<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski Your speech was straight up BS! I don’t know why I expected better from u. Repubs. are so corrupt. I pray a lot of you are voted out in November. The impeachment was not a partisan process. The House came with damning facts/evidence at their disposal, but rethuglicans ignored it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends Shut the hell up! Your little game isn’t going to work.  We’re going to stick together and  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho   Getting rid of #IMPOTUS45 is more important than fighting over our favorite candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your ignorance is astounding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VoteThemOut2020 Democrats running for office in 2020, including the Presidency need to relentlessly hammer Republicans and Trump for their corruption and not allowing anyone to forget this over the next 8 months. We need @ProjectLincoln ads/commercials. @DNC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorLankford Nope! 👎 We all know what the @SenateGOP reaction would be coming out of that classified setting. Even if Bolton’s exact words are ‘Trump did it! He tried to extort Ukraine. I heard it with my own ears.’ You all would come out saying ‘nothing to see here.’ #WeWantWitnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandibachom Stay safe Sandi! That’s very scary and I hope your security is tight. I think a lot of these trump supporters are definitely unhinged and your ‘just say the word’ statement is so true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WTH are you @realDonaldTrump @POTUS flat out lying again! 🤥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT Jared didn’t listen. He’s on CNN saying it’s a great deal and if the Palestinians don’t except it then their passing up an opportunity for peace. What a joke and disgusting human being he is. Runs in the family I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT I figured as much. Thanks for setting them straight. How can you have a peace plan when you didn’t negotiate with the Palestinians? Then you’re taking land and controlling everything. Absolutely no consideration for the Palestinian people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Wow, this is sick! So, what you have to show you have a million dollars in your account before you can come over?!?! They know this prevents a particular shade of people coming over legally. Racists 🤬!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re in court right now trying to get rid of the ACA which contains pre-existing condition coverage. And many other great things like, keeping your child on the parents insurance until 26 yrs of age, no more $ caps on coverage, etc. You’re despicable and a liar. 🤥🤥🤥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I can see your lies in space! We have pre-existing conditions cover because of President Obama and the Democrats, let’s get that straight. You, nor the republicans have anything to do with that. Plus, there is other great coverage in the ACA that you never speak of.  https://t.co/YtfFHgIYu6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheView Damn! This should have been NutMeg’s speech today!! Why do you all keep holding on to this cold, icy, childish, self-entitled trust fund baby, who is only there because of her last name. Very odd, Abby stood up to Meg now she’s leaving. Last week was a great week without Meghan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should have the stigma because you earned every ounce of it. I don’t care how many spineless republicans and democrats in House voted against it. You violated the constitution and tried to extort a vulnerable country and got caught. Witnesses verified this. #ImpeachedForever<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow, that’s awful! Puerto Rico can’t catch a break. Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker @grammysan09 I think Justice Kennedy paid them off. He wanted him specially to replace him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattklewis Trump keeps stealing money from the American people, to bribe farmers with. Don’t give farmers another penny from us.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS  #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You and your administration are the cancer. It has spread through the GOP, Government Agencies, courts and country.  Such arrogancy to say you have lowered cancer rates, when to this day you’re in court trying to take health care away from Americans.  You make me sick! #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Total corrupt administration! #IMPOTUS45  @realDonaldTrump is the head buffoon. Hiding you thievery until after the election...I guess this will be just like showing your taxes. Damn criminals! @stevenmnuchin1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’ve mentioned this to @TwitterMoments @Twitter @TwitterSupport several times and they won’t do anything about it. There is no way @realDonaldTrump is gaining hundreds of thousands of new legitimate followers every 2 days. Hackers/bots are making fake accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There is nothing more important than removing you from office. You’re dangerous to America and the world. Republicans only care about their party, not the constitution. You’re guilty af of all that you’re accused of in the articles of impeachment and more. #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look #IMPOTENCE the American people don’t want their children’s lives used to help you with your problems.  #IMPOTUS  #ImpeachAndRemove<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Seriously! Is this fool on this again today?!?! We read the memo, you’re guilty af!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s your mess, not the Biden’s! Do you not understand impeachment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop lying all the damn time! First, impeachment is about you...you are on trial not the Biden’s. Second, the Biden’s didn’t receive millions of dollars. Stop bearing false witness! #ImpeachAndRemove  #IMPOTUS45  #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It really says a lot that you don’t want people testifying under oath. You’re innocent right? Nope, you’re guilty af. A sham no witness trial with a not guilty verdict won’t count. Nunes also needs to be investigated. @RepDevinNunes #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends U will be found not guilty by republicans who are traitors to US and don’t follow the constitution or their oath of office. This includes Joe Manchin.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @replouiegohmert @HeyTammyBruce @FoxNews We know you want a quick sham trial in the senate so you can scream that you’ve been vindicated. Not going to happen.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @KatiePavlich @foxandfriends This tweet is a joke, right?!?! As you know, the House has been trying to get certain witnesses and documents but the orange obese one is blocking everything. You know, because he’s so innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally 100% agree with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please #IMPOTUS, you’re a child. That’s why you can’t deal with adult leaders. Just Resign!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump For Pete’s sake, you had ample opportunity to have due process during the judiciary hearings, but you refused. The whistleblower has the right to remain anonymous. Several patriotic government servants have confirmed the whistleblowers findings. #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All you’ve done for religion is to show that Evangelicals only talk a good game, but don’t follow/practice what’s in the good Book. A bunch of phonies out here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Totally agree with you Sunny. Then @HurdOnTheHill had the nerve to say he doesn’t want to weaponize impeachment of a president.

<|startoftext|>@ABC What a sickening picture to look at. This man is unholy in every way you can think of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mediaite @MeghanMcCain You acted like a real ass today! Totally unprofessional and rude. Mr. Steyer might be able to buy more commercial time then others, but doing so doesn’t guarantee a vote. So have several seats! Give the American people some credit. He still has to come with viable plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheView @TomSteyer Hey, at the View, Meghan acted like a real ass today with Mr. Steyer. When are you all going to check her childish rude behavior? Her attitude was totally uncalled for. It’s really sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can have the party of hatred, non-believers of the Constitution, breakers of the rules of law, fake Christians, 1%, basket of deplorables, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ha! Yeah right! 🤥🤥 Do you ever get tired of lying? Never mind I know the answer to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sorry, can’t take your word for anything. Need to hear what China says. 100% bet they say no such deal has been made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sondland testimony: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?”  “With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.”  “Everyone was in the loop.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Easy answer: - Try to extort/pressure Ukraine to meddle in US 2020 elections by withholding aid. - ‘Russia if you hear me.’ - ‘I think China should open   investigations into the Biden’s.’ - Prevent WH staff from testifying. - Ignore subpoenas/don’t turn over any requested docs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How can #MoscowMitchMcConnell and @GOP look at all the facts and credible testimony and say ‘nothing to see here.’ Our country is fundamentally broken and I fear things are going to get a lot worse. Hard to believe that’s even possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MoscowMitchMcConnell appearance on faux news saying that he is working with the WH on impeachment trial only shows that the @GOP doesn’t give a damn about the Constitution. Facts don’t matter to them. #MoscowMitch only cares about staying in power. Party over country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bet that reporter gets a personal call from the #CriminalInChief today.  https://t.co/NkBOTMU7Jc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Impeachment was made specifically for you. If what you’ve done isn’t impeachable, then nothing is. You used your corrupt behavior to bribe a foreign allie. And that’s just one of your crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re insane! All roads with you lead to Putin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We’ve already revealed how corrupt the Trump administration is during the impeachment inquiry. Can’t wait to hear what’s on those videos and recordings that your Ukrainian buddy gave Rep. Schiff’s committee and New York State. Nunes is going down with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You won’t get a fair trial in the Senate because republicans have already decided that your crimes don’t matter and they are 100% party over country. They know if a Democrat did all that you have done, that they would convict them. You have really destroyed this country. 🙉🙈🙊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are on some serious drugs if you think Pelosi, Schiff and Biden are going to testify. And this is about your crimes. You need to testify. Let’s call your staff who you claim will exonerate you. But, I know you won’t because they would have to lie under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the swamp, you damn 🤡!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hmmm...why do you think you can go to the Supreme Court to stop your impeachment? Is it because you stacked the court with bias right wing judges who won’t follow the law/constitution? Trump government lawless from top to bottom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If u would have used your 2 brain cells to listen to the impeachment hearings, u would know u don’t have the authority to stop the aid. It was illegal. Only Congress can stop the aid. Ukraine had already met all the reqs. to get the aid. Sondland testified it was a quid pro quo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Try not to embarr...oh never mind! That’s asking the impossible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is there any occasion in which you don’t lie?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, rarely see this mentioned. There needs to be an investigation into this. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @RepSwalwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson What the hell is wrong with these people! “Trump is a man of honor, integrity and family values,”. Mental illness is real in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is a lie! Sandy, testified that you @realDonaldTrump gave this excuse for holding up the money. You sick rethugs really don’t like facts. OMB wasn’t holding up the money for this reason, you were. Two OMB officials resigned because it was illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah right! You would have picked up the entire cost from the American tax payer you mean. I would say stop playing stupid but that’s natural for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get well soon!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump what bribe are you trying to offer @SenatorRomney today at lunch? I know. Sen.Romney is one of two republican senators who’s shown any sign of a moral compass, so you need to make sure he stays in line once your impeachment gets over to the senate. Got it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wow, living in an alternate reality must be amazing!  #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarrPompeo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What drugs are u taking?!?! U all had a terrible day. Sondland confirmed the quid pro quo and that everyone in your administration knew about it.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why is the American tax payer paying for another round of farmer welfare checks! Farmer bankruptcy is up 24% and smaller farmers are getting less than $5k because you’re going by how many acres the farmer has.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So, you want a brownie point for waiting to the second call to extort?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look fool, this call is irrelevant! Just because you didn’t try to extort/bribery on your first phone call doesn’t exonerate you from your extortion/bribery on the second phone call!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Corrupt Commander in Chief (Donald T.) is the most worthy person in American history for impeachment and removal. History will not look kindly on the GOP for their blind loyalty to a person and not the country.   #ImpeachAndRemove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You lie so much, it’s ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Then you need to start investigating yourself and your entire criminal administration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please! I found the documents so you expect us to believe that you aren’t able to get them? You really are pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You need to testify for the doctored memo you released with all the (...).  #ImpeachAndRemoveTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re such an idiot! There is no Democrat or Republican transcript. There is a stenographer in the room that documents both sides questions and answers into one document. Those documents were released with minor redactions for security.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy No, you must testify #CriminalInChief ! Written answers won’t work for you because you will use the same line ‘I don’t remember’ for every question like you did for the Mueller investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please, that request sounds just like you! You always ask people to make public statements to help smooth over your lies and crimes. Don’t believe you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who puts a perfectly good call on a secret coded server to hide it?!?!  I know...criminals who should be removed from office.  #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Correction - You mean your personal flunky decided to hide your crimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aldotcom @realDonaldTrump I hope the players protest and squash this nonsense! Students, you are paying this school thousands of dollars a year, don’t let them take away your free speech so that the occupant can feel comfortable. He should never feel comfortable anywhere he goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Spend what money? Your #TaxScam took our money and gave it to millionaires and billionaires. You know...those stock owners. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump STHU! People have to work multiple jobs just to make it out here and you’re joking about being lucky to have your sorry a$$ as the president! OMG, # BlueWave2020 can’t come fast enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so glad #Kentucky let that #KentuckyGovernor happen to you @realDonaldTrump   What a great morning 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MattBevin Please endorse and have a rally for #MoscowMitch and your side chick Lindsey Graham!  #BlueWave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And the spin begins, LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you #Kentucky ! Congratulations Governor Beshear #KYGov  You have one more to show the door and that’s #MoscowMitch @senatemajldr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MattBevin @tatereeves Kentucky and Mississippi...don’t listen to a word #TrumpTraitor says. He’s a liar and a thief. Vote out #MoscowMitch next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Straight to $1 bin for sure! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh how sweet, you finally claimed him! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We read the memo.  Donald Trump: ‘This is the end of my presidency. I’m f*cked!’  I concur!😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re so clueless and out of touch! Just 🤐🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We read the memo. What was after all those (...)’s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look #CriminalInChief , you might as well have said to the President of Ukraine ‘It would suck if something happened to that nice country of yours.’  Thanks for this tweet, we’ll add it to your pile of crimes and confessions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oops, missed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trumps entire administration is despicable. The hatred they must be teaching their children at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No he won’t!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What a delusional book title. You told him to name it that, didn’t you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump $5 bargain bin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump He’s everything you stated in your first statement, but in your last...’Christian’ 😂😂😂 you started your comedy act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats @RepAdamSchiff The electoral college and Russia elected #TraitorTrump . The American people elected Hillary Clinton by 3 million more votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d  https://t.co/d8Uq2m45eq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look, we can barely keep up with your weekly impeachable offenses! Prepare for impeachment buddy! No one is more deserving than you!  #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarrPompeo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And you’re getting impeached, now what!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, hell no! Start packing! You aren’t staying another 5 years.  #ImpeachmentIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @senatemajldr The #1 qualification for anything GOP related is to be ‘unqualified’!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yes, that’s all @senatemajldr has been doing is confirming unqualified judges! He’s a disgrace. The Supreme Court isn’t the only judgeship that’s important. We will have to suffer with these horrible judges for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Always blaming others. Any drop in the stock market is all your doing.  #TrumpTariffs #ImpeachmentIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The corruption never ends with this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Even if Democrats wanted to impeach #TrumpTraitor on day one, they couldn’t do so without the mountain of crimes that the occupant has committed for the past 3 yrs. So, have several seats with your fake outrage #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just another privileged brat! Hope he doesn’t see a penny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump You all lie like you breathe air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco 🤫🤫 Mr. Bankruptcies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You and the GOP don’t need any help destroying your party. You all are doing a great job on your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The bubble is going to burst with your #TaxScam still in place. And the Democrats are going to have to fix the republicans mess as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We read the redacted memo you released. You’re guilty. Release the Ukraine transcript (and Putin transcripts) from the secret code word server.  #TaxScam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have no impulse control, so having other people on the call listening means nothing for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That’s your go to now?!?! Anyone who tells the truth about you is a ‘Never Trumper’. Are you somehow getting someone’s voting history illegally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know him, but Col. Vindman was on the call and has 1st hand knowledge of what was said. We’ll get to the bottom of it today. And quoting Ingraham is a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Faux News, please tell your dear leader that Rep.Schiff can’t be impeached! This is embarrassing. 25/45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @GOPLeader, here are those open hearings that you unhinged sycophants have been requesting. Hope (not really) that you’re prepared. Oh heads up, this isn’t a hearing to ask about Hillary’s emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  You will never measure up to President Obama!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmNance Money can’t buy class or a soul! He’s such a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The GOP has some real issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL I’m so glad I slept in. I can’t bare listening to him. He is a total wacko for saying such a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Let me predict a couple of Trumps statements for tomorrow: ‘You can’t impeach a president that killed the leader of ISIS.’ ‘Obama couldn’t do it.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/2zcjB4Uhl1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Anyone who has the #CriminalInChiefs complete and total endorsement, is a definite - NO Vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Great! Also, please totally reverse #TrumpTaxScam .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Kelly can kick rocks! You were a yes man. He’s just like the selfish, amoral liar that he served. He can’t come back now and say he was trying to save America. He has plenty of unrighteous acts to account for. Deuces!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have some nerve mentioning anyone owing anyone else money! You still owe Washington $9M for your inauguration and hundreds of thousands of dollars around the country for your klan rallies. Pay up, deadbeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris The students were prevented from attending. So I’m sure you were only speaking to your staff and college heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris So, you’re expecting a pat on the back because you think all African Americans are criminals and criminal reform is all they care about?!?! This is the only thing that comes to your mind for AA’s? What a racists smack in the face. Beyond sick of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertjeffress @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness You mean fake Christian support, ok got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGraham @senatemajldr They can support you to their own demise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is a deadbeat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Such a petty little man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I’m surprised your mob of thugs (House Republicans) left their tiki torches at home.   #ArrestThemAllNow  #ArrestMattGaetz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff  Rep. Schiff, how could u let these republicans break into the SCIF room and disrupt for 5 hrs?!?! They threatened National Security. Why weren’t they arrested? Every last one of them need to face severe consequences. #ArrestGaetz #ArrestThemAllNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WTH are you talking about? There are republicans on the committee and they are able to ask all the questions they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can give that dream up. There is no way that they are winning back the House with the next election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That’s sad and disturbing.  #QuidProQuoTrumpsGottaGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile Trumps side piece @LindseyGrahamSC has already come out and kissed Trumps tush on camera saying this impeachment is a ‘political lynching’. Then he ran off, like the bit@h he is.  I don’t expect any of them to show any signs of a moral compass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump ‘A lynching’? You are beyond redemption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends If it came from @realDonaldTrump lips ‘no quid pro quo’, then we know that it is 100% a lie and that it is definitely evidence of ‘quid pro quo’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump The rethuglicans are rotten to the core. Stop lying about the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJohnJoyce @realDonaldTrump @RepAndyBiggsAZ You and the @GOP are hypocrites! ‘Lying to the American people’? You all and the occupant in the White House lie to us everyday. Your word salad on trumps criminal activities with Russia and Ukraine has been ridiculous. Stop clutching your fake pearls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Please have several seats!  https://t.co/U3Qb8SqvDL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wash, rinse, repeat with you. #STFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop lying 🤥🤥. It wouldn’t have been free.  And you still don’t get the point of receiving foreign money for your business! It’s illegal. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump In past years of the G7/8 being hosted in America, Doral has never been thought of as the best place to hold the meetings. Didn’t even make the list. Nothing has changed.  #GetOverIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s such a disgrace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlavicLady88 Wow, they (Republicans/MAGATs) are sicker than l thought!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG! #GetOverIt  It wasn’t a perfect phone call! It was the exact opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Point being, it wasn’t legally permissible, you would have made money off of it and as (unfortunately) the leader of the country should have known better. You think the law doesn’t apply to you.  Can’t wait until we’re rid of you. #TrumpTraitor  #ImpeachTheMF  #TrumpGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, the heads of the other countries called and said they weren’t going to stay there huh, LOL!   Sad, you can’t comprehend that what you were doing was illegal. And you weren’t trying to do anything great for this country, you greedy devil! 🤥 Glad you aren’t getting a penny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because @realDonaldTrump and every top leader under him are criminals that don’t follow the laws or the constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard @HillaryClinton Who the hell keeps donating to your campaign? Oh, wait...never mind. #RussianAsset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaeDalious @ZTPetrizzo @realDonaldTrump @EleanorNorton Ooh! I’m so scared. NOT! Smh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Trump2020ForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Line up for admission to the biggest insane asylum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you crazy (rhetorical question)!?!?! Literally no one has been trying to make such a horrendous deal! Damn 🤡!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RTErdogan Ummm...you’re not getting any credit for a ceasefire when you are the reason the death and destruction started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally! And he’s up there with a straight face saying Trump won’t make any money off of this. They disgust me. SMH  #TrumpCorruption  #CorruptGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump First, off you already retweeted this yesterday. Second, Democrats didn’t have control of anything for two years, so as usual the 3 year impeachment statement is a lie.  #NotExonerated #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Damn, you all lie so much! You know darn well that the interviews of the witnesses aren’t being done publicly because they don’t want them to hear each other’s testimony. STHU! So sick of you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr 🐂💩 she isn’t blocking anything! She said there are a couple of concerning pieces of the legislation that they are looking into. How about you worry about the 200+ bills sitting on your desk from the House. #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS are so unfit for the presidency! Exhibit A:  https://t.co/3ZtLl5RHpi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to hear that Congress is still finding significant evidence even with the obstruction. My question is, when is Congress going to start holding the people/departments accountable for not complying with subpoenas? People should have been arrested and fined by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Everything you utter is a lie. It was reported that Dems and Repugs get equal time on questions until there are no questions left to be asked. The House is gathering information for your impeachment, so the public won’t see this portion of the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdawsey1 @NicolleDWallace What in the hell is that supposed to mean?!?! ‘They have a lot of sand over there!’ @realDonaldTrump is pure nuts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @tatereeves Things must be really bad if you have to promote a republican in Mississippi!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What delusional drugs are you using? You aren’t living in reality. Sad  #TrumpResign 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ABC Deflection from the sick massacre video that was shown at your resort (that we all know you’ve seen and chuckled at) isn’t going to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Lawsuit? Give me a break! CNN reports the truth about you, not like the bias Faux news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse We know what you’re up too. You’re trying to get the whistleblower hurt. Adam Schiff is looking out for their safety. We don’t need to know who they are, we just need to know the details of you and your administrations crimes. We know what unhinged MAGATS would do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow You’ll get your due process during your Senate Impeachment trial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump   Trump should be removed from office now. He knew this would happen. This is what happens when you abandon your allies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We saw the memo that you released and it was nowhere near perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump First off, no one with at least two active brain cells would want to be your friend! I don’t see how anyone can stand to be around you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You sound crazy as hell! Are you going to stamp ‘No entry allowed’ on their ISIS passports! SMH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful! Thank you! 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @RepLeeZeldin You lie 24/7! 🤡  #TrumpResignNow  #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @joniernst @debfisher @BenSasse You clearly don’t listen to the farmers. And every time you say ‘wow’, it’s definitely not a ‘wow’!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ShannonBream @FoxNews Stop committing so many crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looking in the mirror again?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Prince estate doesn’t want you using his music for your unhinged hate rallies. I’m sure Kid Rock has a song that you can use. At this point just walk/exit in silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You were so unhinged! Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you pay the bill yet, deadbeat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I’m sure you followed your standard practice of telling officials that they have to go out and make a statement because you are looking bad. Well, they want to live another day, so I would expect them to lie to appease you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You haven’t done any of those things! Ok, well you lowered taxes for millionaires and billionaires. You don’t get a cookie for that. Resign clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Please get off Twitter, you sound ridiculous! SMH  #ResignNowTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Shut your lying mouth! You did plenty wrong, not just with Ukraine but also with Russia (Mueller report). We haven’t forgotten.   #CriminalPotus #ImpeachmentIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If this was a witch hunt 2 overturn an election, then I think we would start impeachment sooner then 3 yrs in, idiot! This is about holding this criminal admin accountable for their constant crime wave. And where is that Russian 💰 u #MiscowMitch received after lifting sanctions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity If you say it’s true, then it’s 100% NOT true.  🤥🤥🤥🤥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump STHU #MoscowMitch  You have some nerve complaining that Democrats are holding up some legislation, mr. grim reaper. And if you want it, along with the repugs and #TraitorInChief, then I’m definitely against it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Since when does being a trading partner cancel out wrongdoing and slaughter of allies?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The mayor wants you to pay upfront you deadbeat! Then you can have your klan/nazi/proud boys rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddstarnes @realDonaldTrump @toddstarnes @realDonaldTrump  are jokes! These states know that Trump doesn’t pay their bills for these rallies. If he wants to bring his hate speech, let him pay for it, not the people of Minneapolis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Because republicans can’t be trusted to secure the persons identity. You all want them splashed on the front of a newspaper. And you very well know how that would go for them and their safety. But that’s what you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wake up America, we have a traitor in the White House! @realDonaldTrump is #PutinsPuppet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re so full of yourself! And ‘unmatched wisdom’ is laughable. Seek help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh now he’s a Democrat lawyer and support Obama and Hillary. U make crap up all the time, no facts or truth, smh! Pure lunacy from u 24/7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Stop lying Lindsey, u know damn well that isn’t true. Staff told them the correct place to file the complaint (normal practice) they didn’t help ‘prepare’ it. For all you fake lying Christians/Evangelicals, you know all liars are going into the lake of fire, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You would think after the heinous act that was done to u, that u would have a come to Jesus moment. But, this tweet has proven that you never had and never will have any sense of decency or morals. Stop lying for the criminal potus who would throw u under the bus in a heartbeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump What an ignorant statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop being a drama queen, the Democrats are calm, cool and collected. The only manic goes by @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Oh please! You’re self-enriching right now at your golf resort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett No, it’s not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I know you can’t read and can barely write, but you’re delusional. The memo u released matches what the whistleblower reported. Americans see your criminal/extortion acts on paper, live tv, text msg and committee deposition. U are the fraud. #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarrPompeo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Please invest in a dictionary so you can learn what certain words mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is what the #FakePresident pins to his Twitter accounts?!?! I’m so exhausted responding to your idiocy! I think I need a break. Ugh  @POTUS #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS is a criminal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The whistleblower has the facts 100% correct. So what if they reached out to the committee that would do the investigation. They still went through the proper channels.  Smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, let’s impeach the occupant. #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Corruption- Investigate #MoscowMitch for removing sanctions off Russian businessman to get new factory built by that same Russian in Kentucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Then resign immediately!  https://t.co/sy6kFCGELc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Corruption- you and your kids are profiting off the presidency. Foreign leaders staying at you bed bug hotels, directing the military to stay at your hotels, every weekend you’re at your hotel, Ivanka trademarks from China, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump H. Biden was already investigated and no wrongdoing was found. Let’s look at u being highly unqualified for potus, throw in Jared and Ivanka as unqualified to work in WH, all the lame judges u and #MoscowMitch have put in place and all the best people you’ve hired and now in jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Good boy (Jim), now sit! 🐶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the swamp! Start in your own house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know you did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Blaming others as usual. What does impeachment have to do with the stock market? You don’t know how to run a government and your tariffs and #TaxScam are destroying the economy. Stocks were crashing before the  impeachment inquiry. Take responsibility for your stupidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @tatereeves If you have to promote a republican in backward a$$ Mississippi, then you and the republicans must be in real trouble. IJS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When the hell does #ExecutiveTime end?!?! You’re still tweeting...wtf!  @POTUS  #FakePresident  #ImpeachmentIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wish the Democrats weren’t doing anything! Democrats are working hard for the American people and working to hold #TrumpTraitor accountable, along with #ImpeachBarrToo, #MoscowMitch.  The #DoNothingPresident stays on Twitter all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Again, only old fencing is being repaired/replaced that the Obama Administration already paid for, you liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Congress is still going to get your tax returns, you shady crook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Omg, I just can’t with you! You released the transcript showing your words concerning the shake down of Ukraine. What don’t you understand? Being second hand doesn’t make it false. They share intelligence you idiot. Well, let’s check with Pompeo who has first hand knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop trying to push your tariff disaster off on the feds. This is all your doing. Own it, you poc.  #TrumpRecession  #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The majority of the American people didn’t vote for you, the electoral college did. Also, everything else you stated in this dumb a$$ tweet is bull $hit! 🤡🤥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Unlawful???? You’re an absolute joke! 🤡🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends STHU about 33,000 emails that you don’t have a clue about. You repeating this to your last breath is not going to make the government find any wrong doing on Hillary’s part. So just 🤐.   #TrumpResign  #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Code for: let’s ramp up voter suppression because I’m going to lose bigly.  Doug were you not at work that day, @SpeakerPelosi and Democrats have already passed election laws that the grim reaper is letting sit on his desk and won’t bring up for a vote. Talk to #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Aww...someone is having a bad week and needs some reassurance from his sycophants! SAD  #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarr  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So what! As soon as there is a final democratic candidate we’re going to make sure they are well funded. Plus we have morals on our side, which your father and the republicans have zero of.   #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can’t be this clueless and deranged! Seek help outside of the sycophant bubble.  #TrumpResign  #ImpeachTrumpPenceBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ha! You got jokes! FYI, you have no power over Joe Biden.  https://t.co/3XjGZ2JCkr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I bet you if Iran had dirt on Biden, those sanctions would be dropped like a hot potato!   #TraitorInChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What do you want...a cookie?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG! You’re nuts! How did Rep.Schiff make up your conversation? You released your criminal extortion conversation for all to read. And we see your lawless behavior in the complaint and that your criminal AG and personal lawyer were in on it. All of u should be in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well, the second hand info. led straight to your criminal acts! Enjoy impeachment witch!  #TrumpImpeachment  https://t.co/1hmdtcUzZ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Accurate?!?! 😂 I think not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you win North Carolina it will be due to gerrymandering or the crooked republican legislator that put bogus voting restrictions in place. Republicans have to cheat to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not at all. I want everything you stated. But I want to add Don jr and Ivanka being in orange jumpsuits looking disheveled! LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If so, so the f#@k what?!?! Just zip your fish lips up! You’re done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I bet you’re ringing @SpeakerPelosi phone off the hook today. Please Nancy don’t impeach me!  https://t.co/jwfzzE1dMM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not going to work buddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sure he did. Well, we need the whistleblower complaint as well. You’ve committed more than one criminal act.  #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Deflection won’t work #TraitorTrump  How about we look into all the business your tweddle-dee and tweedle-dum sons are doing around the world and the patents/copyrights Ivanka is getting while you’re in office and as she holds a position in the White House. How about that?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You and your cronies must not be attending if our country is going to be well represented. I would definitely prefer an empty chair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanghaviharsh @realDonaldTrump Why are you kissing this buffoons a$$! He hasn’t done anything good for America. Did he threaten to take financial assistance away from India?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t know who the whistleblower is, so how can you say they are partisan? Did Bill Barr your disgraced AG tell you who it is? Do you have their voting record?  #WhistleblowerGate  #TrumpIsAFelon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I know why others didn’t say anything, because they are 100% sycophants and just as lawless as you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What sick parent would bring their children anywhere near you, Smh! Child abuse. Plus, you can’t read those big words in that book. Have Eric read it to you, it’s at his reading level.  #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Democrats don’t have to build anything. The American people can see with their own eyes and ears daily that you are enriching yourself in every way possible and you know it! I can’t wait until the day that all your businesses crumble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, you had to find out what him and Putin discussed in their recent meeting? Netanyahu is the middle man for your marching orders from Putin and what he’s doing to get u elected again. I pray that we will get rid of both of you in the next elections. #PutinPuppet  #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don’t remind us of the terrible people you and #MoscowMitch have put on the courts. Our court system is screwed for at least 40 years. Your stupidity will live on after you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow Damn devils! The GOP are ruthless, you can’t take your eyes off of them for a second. Despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Really?!?! You do this today?!?! You’re a sad little man.  #ResignClown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wow, republicans won heavily republican districts (1 of them barely), what a shocker! U should be worried and blowing a sigh of relief and thanking your gun god, instead of celebrating. Democrats will continue to chip away your voters and flip seats, just like in 2018. #Resign 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I don’t think so liar! Bolton said he resigned last night. You don’t want it getting out that people no longer want to deal with you. I’m shocked that you have anyone working for you, but some repugs are just as bad as you. #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a piece of crap @realDonaldTrump is! You’re talking about your klan/nazi/proud boys rally at that moment! Ugh! Why is everything about you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It has everything to do with you!  The military on the flight thought it was highly unusual. 🤥🤥 your grubby hands are all over this. Only your voters are that dumb to think otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look @realDonaldTrump, we have you as the occupant of the WH, so anything is possible.  Hopefully, there will be an embarrassing 2020 blue 🌊 that will wipeout you and many other repugnants.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Blackintel1 Great, that’s always the first step, admitting your problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blackintel1 I don’t think so #BasketOfDeplorables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump U have other things to worry about based on what I’ve seen on @maddow tonight. U are so corrupt and profiting off of the presidency. You’ve pulled the military into your theft of Americans pockets. I hope everyone involved is held accountable. U crook. #CloseTrumpsScotlandResort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You owe the American people an apology for being such a disaster!   #FakePresidency #TrumpIsAJoke #TrumpSharpie  #NoApologyFromUs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @AlanDersh Oh, please! We’re disgusted with the 🤡 @realDonaldTrump point blank period. You are the national crisis that the American people have to get rid of.   #TrumpIsCorrupt #NotExonerated #IndividualOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump U have some nerve berating someone else for crime in their country, when the mass murders going on in America are being chalked up by u as there is too much video game playing! STFU! Other countries have video games &amp; mental illness as well. You’re a terrible person and occupant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Keep Obama out of your filthy mouth! Obama went to Hawaii on Christmas vacation, not when a major hurricane was hitting several states. Stop trying to use others in order to defend your despicable behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #NotAScam The Mueller report found many witches, some are already in prison. The HOR has never stopped working on legislation to help the American people.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GregAbbott_TX If 20, 6 and 7 yr olds getting slaughtered at school didn’t move the @GOP then nothing will. Until the republicans decide to turn from their gods of guns and greed, then prepare for the next one. Talk to your children, be aware of your surroundings and keep your head on a swivel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GregAbbott_TX That republican mantra of ‘If there was a good guy with a gun around, they would stop a shooter.’ Well this statement isn’t holding up well. Texas should have plenty of good guys with guns walking around with their loose gun laws, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OMAROSA has never been foul mouth towards you, but has spoken out on madness she has seen in the WH. #UnHinged. But in my view, you better hush because she will verbally dog walk you in a elegant way and put you in your place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the last person on this earth that can call anyone dumb. These men read, are professional intelligence officials and follow the laws and constitution. There aren’t any check marks by any of these points for @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your brain has cobwebs! What crazed universe are you living in where America is winning the trade war and farmers are balling! You keep bailing farmers out with our tax payer money!    #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity Your wreak of a presidency can’t end fast enough! Praying it’s before 2020.  #NotMyPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity You’re only the favorite president of the brain dead 35%. The majority of Americans who voted 3 million more times for Hillary Clinton say otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity I think you have that backwards. The Fox News shows that try to be fair have lower ratings. Sean H. is a brown nosing  racist mouth piece for the #WorstPresidentinHistory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wouldn’t be fighting so hard if your  business dealings were legitimate. You are a con artist and your criminal behavior will soon come to light.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re a despicable human being! You just had to get out your hateful remark about the Mayor. She is excellent by the way. Then u act annoyed at PR, like they can do anything about the storm. Everyday is just madness with you. And no one is thanking your sorry a$$!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, you’re definitely part of that comedy team Curly!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So, your 1st thought is about $$! U don’t tell the PR people to prepare and take care of themselves and we are here for u? Trump code: I’m not giving you brown people another penny, you’re on your own.   #WorstPresidentinHistory  #Scumbag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Congress needs to do their job and impeach @realDonaldTrump. You are not supposed to be making money off your presidency. Have the meeting at Camp David or some other non-Trump facility. Oh, and this is #RealNews, Doral has/had bed bugs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There is no hatred there. We should stop the billions of $ of aid. The Israelis aren’t struggling, they have their own military and have a good economy.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is destroying America.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC Exactly! William Barr can’t be trusted to investigate a pile of dog crap. Anything found on #RacistPresident will disappear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  Conservative says: “I don’t think he’s a good man. I can’t vote for him.”  Well, glad they finally figured that out. I knew this years before he came done the escalator.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You’re a sick individual! First off, I wouldn’t have let you anywhere near this baby. You are the reason that his mother and father are dead.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN You just can’t help yourself! You just ooze hatred and division. Aren’t you supposed to be consoling the victims?!?! Just be honest, you don’t have a shred of empathy for the victims. You have no impulse control. You should be ashamed of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I need you to 🤫🤥.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re sick! Beto has been standing up for the victims and the El Paso community. You on the other hand are full of hate towards the victims and their community. You should show some respect and not come where you aren’t wanted. You are a fake and a phony and very disingenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We aren’t going to start talking about bogus names are we Mr. Donald Drumpf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Texas shouldn’t allow you to land until they have the $500,000 you owe them. Which would now go up with your unwanted visit today.  #DeadbeatDonald   Pay up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s obvious, money can’t buy class.  #WorstPresidentinHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN You’re such an idiot.

So, of course Elizabeth and Bernie wouldn’t be to blame for the actions of the Dayton shooter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They don’t want you there. Show some respect for their wishes. #RacistInChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, your safe zone...first responders and police officers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope u get the reception that u deserve from the people of El Paso and Dayton. That Beto language.  Gov. Reps., no kissing a$$ to the occupant in the WH, he doesn’t deserve any respect.  I hope the victims of your rhetoric refuse to see u.  Media, don’t cover #Ttump visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @peterschweizer What makes you think that what Google presents to the world about you makes a difference? All I go by is what comes out of your mouth live, your tweets and policy’s to know that you are no good for America and the world. So, I will vote accordingly. #WorstPresidentinHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, Alex! Trump never mentions these facts.  @realDonaldTrump is just hanging on to President Obama’s coat tails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Just because unemployment has been getting lower for minorities doesn’t negate the fact that you are a #RacistPresident. You haven’t put one policy in place to help with unemployment, so you are riding the wave of Obama’s success.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan Wow, I hope authorities are keeping a close eye on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 Mayor Whaley threw major shade at @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends President Obama is a true leader, unlike you. #WorstPresidentinHistory #RacistInTheWhiteHouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump take responsibility for your hateful rhetoric. Why don’t you stop speaking WST’s language?!?! Because you can’t. Those are your people and you are their leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends It’s scary to see that you don’t even understand what President Obama was saying in his tweet. He’s condemning your hate speech, not that a number of mass shootings happened on your watch. Although, I will say that the past few WST were radicalized by you. #RacistPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends President Obama never spewed hatred all day every day. He never called people invaders, SOBs, rapist, shit hole countries. He never promoted violence at rallies, telling people to hurt protesters or  for👮🏼 to hurt people they arrest. So there is no need for Bush to condemn Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree! Stay home @POTUS @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics I hope he’s shown zero ounce of respect and that it’s replaced with disgust. Protest and don’t give him the photo op that he’s trying to get. We know who he is. People of El Paso and Dayton, don’t let him use you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics The government better not give them another farmers welfare check. They probably voted for Trump, let them lie in their bed. They sure can find money to hand out when it comes to certain people. Well, hell I need help with my student loans. Can I get a check?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  There’s always a tweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump WTH are you doing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, President Obama and FLOTUS! You have always been an example of kindness and strength, with the ability to bring the country together and children can look up too.  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump take notes. Oh wait, I forgot you don’t like it when people take notes. Oh,well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, there r 31 people who’s wounds will surely not heal, due to your daily hatred that u feed to WST.  I would say I hope u can live with yourself, but I know u can, because u don’t give a damn about the children, mothers, fathers, sisters, etc. that r no longer here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG!! This is a joke, right?!?!  ‘wounds cannot heal if we are divided’ from the #DividerInChief !  You can’t be taken serious at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you go to Texas and Ohio, I hope you get the reception that you deserve. With Beto O’Rourke language. No kissing a$$ to the occupant in the White House who doesn’t deserve any respect.  #RacistInChief #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t give a damn about the victims of your hate speech! The death toll is now 22 in Texas. You celebrate hatred at every rally. You right wing nuts got rid of the law preventing people with mental illness from getting guns. You’re despicable.  #RacistTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I was right! You took no responsibility for your rhetoric and then you blame the media and video games! There is seriously no hope for you. You’re sick and there is no treatment for it.  #WorstPresidentEver #RacistInTheWhiteHouse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for the info.! I’m going to repost my responses on his latest tweet then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS you are a soulless scum bag. You crashed someone’s wedding and was laughing it up and taking selfies when a massacre had just occurred! @realDonaldTrump is the #WorstPresidentinHistory . I can’t give you one ounce of respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it’s obvious that they are running scared. They have to figure out their unified response of mental illness made them do it, violent video games made them do it and this has nothing to do with trump (you know he’s the most non-racists person in the world) Smh!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Spare us your fake prayers. I won’t post what I believe your first thought really was when you heard about the shootings. But you’re just that sick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well, all of his supposed non-facts sure have gotten a lot of people locked up and indicted. He was very clear that you weren’t exonerated, lied and had major contact with Russians. You’re next to be 🔒 up!  #NotExonerated #WorstPresidentinHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio You use the police as props. U know that there are a high # of racists in that career in which you can get votes from.

<|startoftext|>You @POTUS are a lying POS! You didn’t try and stop anything and you had a long pause for the ‘send her back’ chant that you appeared to love hearing at your klan rally. You’re a disgrace. Have you no shame? #WorstPresidentEver #RacistInChief<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Your administration is so f’d up. So, things get investigated because some billionaire or dimwit Fox News hosts tickles your ear with lies. Look into Epstein’s child sex trafficking! Oh, some personal request, pictures or video might be discovered of you! Oh I see! #NotExonerated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You lie so much. It’s really disgusting! You have no shame, nor an ounce of integrity. #WorstPresidentEver  https://t.co/tEtXhz1MF3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just because you’re critical of some things that happen in America, doesn’t mean you hate America. But, I know you think only your opinion matters. I’m tired of paying $$ car insurance when I never haves accidents, should I say America sucks I’m outta here. Stop being stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronKGerman @AOC @GOP @POTUS We’re supposed to be all the same, but when a minority with the same credentials or close to comes in for a job interview, to get a bank loan, when pulled over by the police, when renting or buying a home, or just daily living, it’s obvious that everyone doesn’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maya100200300 @AOC @GOP @POTUS I would hope not. I’m honestly tired of the tension. But saying ‘go back to your own country’ kind of says it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exton13 @AOC @GOP @POTUS Wow, what universe are you living in that you believe neither country is racists?!?! Not saying everyone living in them are, but come on now, let’s be honest and take off your blinders. Every piece of Republican legislation is for the rich and to keep white people on top. 🤒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jcbchuck @AOC @GOP @POTUS Oh, here we go with the Democrats were racists first montra! Well, we’re living in 2019 and the Democrats have progressed while the Republicans have regressed. RNC=White Supremacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toxichog @AOC @GOP @POTUS Right back at you! LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exton13 @AOC @GOP @POTUS Just because you criticize something that America or Israel is doing to a group of people doesn’t mean you hate America. When you correct your child, you do it because you love them and you don’t want them to have problems in the future, so they can have a brighter future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC The @GOP is filled to the rim with racists. @POTUS says everything the republicans want to say out loud. Republican voters are cheering this language, which says a lot about America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Potus is the devil! Pure and simple. Such a hateful person. Disgrace to this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @realDonaldTrump @SecondLady @CBP I call BS! That’s not the live footage that I’m seeing on tv. @VP @POTUS and every person who is ok with what’s going on in these facilities, has a terrible judgment from God coming to them upon their last breathe. But it’s obvious you all don’t really believe in the Bible. SMH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are insane! WTH!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Galatians 4:16  16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

<|startoftext|>@POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well, @POTUS is not well thought of or liked in the U.S. by the American people, so we have something in common with the U.K. and will also have a new president in 2020 (or sooner via impeachment)!! 👏🎉 #WorstPresidentEver #AnybodyButTrump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, who do you think you’re fooling! You hate melanated people. Your administration fought in court yesterday to stop giving migrant children soap and toothbrushes!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Same record being played. You say democrats committed a crime but you never come with any facts, details or proof. Saying it everyday won’t make it true.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes The Republican Party doesn’t give a damn about health care and pre-existing conditions. All you all want to do is to destroy Obama’s legacy.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You’re deluded! You aren’t taking back the House, it’s going to get even worse for you. Dems are taking back the Senate and Presidency. The devil McConnell and fake moderate Collins hopefully will loose their seats. Election Day can’t come soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You and the republicans are the national emergency! You couldn’t cut SNAP through Congress so now you jerks are putting it in the Agriculture bill to cut off 755,000 people from receiving food starting in October! Food! You MF’s make me sick. Saying a special prayer for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one is asking that you fool! It has been documented and testified about. I know you don’t know how to read though, so maybe you are the only person asking that. #FakePresident #ResignTrump #TrumpIsntSmarterThanAFifthGrader<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chaplaintom62 @SecPompeo it. A friends child needed a surgery that cost $30,000, because of the ACA the child could stay on the parents insurance up to 26yrs. This was a life saver. Republicans only want control over women. Example the fake outrage over abortions, but you support insurance companies not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaplaintom62 @SecPompeo I highly doubt that. Because of the hatred for the black man President Obama you want to get rid of the ACA. How about fixing the cost portions for insurance and prescriptions instead of sabotaging it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @SecPompeo I can’t say one good thing about the republicans. Everything that they do shows that they hate/don’t give a damn about children, elderly, people of color, poor/middle class and students. There’s no way these evil people believe in God.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re such a phony!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump For the countries sake I pray not! Your judges are the most destructive things you and the disgusting Republican Party have done since you’ve been in office. Unqualified and racists judges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterMoments Blameless...get the 🤬out of here!! No doubt Ellis is a MAGAt. This disgrace of a judge told prosecutors in court that they were only trying to get information on Trump for impeachment. He should have been dropped from the case immediately!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I don’t want to hear anymore of your damn lies anyway, so go right ahead. Saves me the time of turning the channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well DUH...of course the members of the republican hate group are going to approve of the hatred that their vile Republican Party spews. The Republican Party needs to be on the #SPLC list. They are an active hate group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @FoxNews Let me help you with your resignation speech. I know how you and Melania like to steal speeches, so no worries. Just skip the part about always trying to do the best thing for the country. That would be lying 🤥. #JailDevinNunes  https://t.co/UMY7GU1m2z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This Oval Office meeting with China on trade shows how few brain cells you’re working with. Your staff tried to help but you’re a national embarrassment. Afraid of what you’re going to do with North Korea. Watch this clip!  https://t.co/Es5wYkRxpG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Burn #2 from Harry Reid! "Reid said, he respects former President George W. Bush despite their political differences, and that the 43rd president "would be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump in the league.” "Donald Trump wouldn't make the team," he added.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Burn #1 from Harry Reid!  "I just have trouble accepting him as a person, so frankly I don't see anything he's doing right," Reid told CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You haven’t done a damn thing for African Americans! Your tax cut sucks and a lot of people now owe more taxes. I know that you think that all AA’s are criminals but your CJR doesn’t do anything for the majority and by the way there is no ‘etc.’! Lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re not my president! I don’t claim you. Now be gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Return to sender! The least favorite cough cough 🤢(I can't say it) so I’ll say person occupying the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel Seriously!! When does your #ExecutiveTime end?!?! You seem to need some boundaries set for the excessive amount of time that you’re on Twitter. Can’t believe I can say I work longer and harder than the person holding the highest office. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What self respecting African-American would come to any event that you, the racists-in-chief would host?!?!? Smh!  It’s a sad day. That room should be empty. Was Wendy’s and McDonald’s served? Just asking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You lie so much!!! This video was debunked by a news station in New Mexico. No new wall is being built. This is replacing existing wall that came from 2017 funds! You breathe lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace Great interview today Nicole! I watched it twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs You and Russia are up to election stealing again! The DHS is comprised! Someone who isn’t beholden to Liar-in-chief and Russia needs to look into this.   https://t.co/K9nDROc6IS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/NCJZ1lKGkh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hey clueless (fake president), this isn’t a dictatorship! SNL is spot on! And are you advocating violence against a company and its employees?!?! Someone needs to look into that and find out what you mean by retribution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are going to be to blame if one reporter gets hurt. You and your MAGAts are unstable. You all can’t stomach the truth from reporters. That’s the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG! You are so damn guilty! I can’t wait to see you go down, along with all your in-house minions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s not Obama’s IA, nor yours!!! It’s the United States of America’s (the people’s) intelligence agencies! Both of you can STHU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you lie so damn much!?!? Geez! This is beyond ridiculous. You need mental help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer She told the truth! Just because you don’t like it, doesn’t mean it’s anti-Semitic. When anyone criticizes Israel, you all bring out the boogey man called ‘anti-Semitic’. Sick of this card. Smh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When will American citizens no longer have to pay for your klan (MAGAt hat) rallies?!?! We shouldn’t have to pay for your constant need to stir up hate! I hope you get a rude awakening by supporters who have filed their taxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/yyZQT5X5A1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please! You can’t even unite the both sides of your pants!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @jacknicklaus @TigerWoods Yuck! 🤢 Melania can’t be into that without a barf bag! That drunk doctor lied about your physical report for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one gives a damn about Tiger, stop lying. Anyone who willingly spends their free time with you is insane in my book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’re such a child, smh! You need serious help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Whatever drugs you are on stop taking them immediately, you’re delusional!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You haven’t accomplished a damn thing that is good and worthwhile. Your bogus tax scam doesn’t help the        m-class, or executive orders stripping Obama legislation, or your racists wall, judges and dishonorable SC justices!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I don’t care when you do the SOTU address. I refuse to watch your repeating loop of lies. So I’ll do my part in making sure it is the lowest rated SOTU ever. Spongebob 8:00 sharp (he’s more believable). Then I’ll tune into the Democrats adult response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WTH do you know about prayer?!?! You said you’ve never even asked God for forgiveness for anything. You don’t even know how to say bible chapters correctly. So, spare me! You’re going straight to hell when you take your last breathe anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You lie so damn much! Not one brick has been laid for your fictitious wall! Only maintenance is being done on existing fencing/wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx Is that what you do all day?!?! Look for kiss ass comments about yourself? Pathetic. How about you and Mitch open the government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I just can’t with you! 😂  https://t.co/mg5VcWGSVj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Literally no one is saying this! No one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think you need to talk to Mitch the turtle who won’t put the bills up for a vote. The Democrats have passed several bills to open the government and fund border security. But you know that you fake president  and Russian agent/asset!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @wef Believe me, they didn’t want you there anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can’t go a day without lying! They are only fixing existing fencing.  https://t.co/oZVK2yoWSs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneVoiceNews Ugh!! I really want to hear this but the sound goes out in the first few seconds. I’ve tried on two devices.<|endoftext|>
