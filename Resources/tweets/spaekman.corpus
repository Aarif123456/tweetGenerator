<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @haru_ivee No need to get worked up. It's only giving AG more exposure &amp; attention.

No one in their right football minds will consider that Reguilon played better than Sonny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieFudge123 @AlasdairGold They are because they are @AlasdairGold's biased opinions. If you want unbiased players ratings, head over to @WhoScored since they have AI-based ratings.

<|startoftext|>@sparkyade @caspertheghost1 @AlasdairGold Yes, Reggie was a 4 or a 5 today. But, to be fair, it's Jose that made him play high today so I'd give both of them a 5 for effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold How can you rate Reguilon that high? He was a 4. He killed a lot of chances by playing so high but that might be more of a Mourinho's error. Leaving Son in the half space without much room to run behind by playing high, the game was definitely not headed in the right direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Hopefully, no in-person parties during a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cameron_kasky So she worked hard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Perhaps that's why Jose was eyeing multiple tall, strong, &amp; tough defenders. ü§î Hoping we get one next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Today was not a game to have started Reguilon. Davies would've been a must better option since CRY is also a counterattacking team, in a way. Reguilon killed situations by playing high. It was the bad Reguilon that gave away the goal vs. Chelsea in the FA Cup game. ü§îüòë #CRYTOT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Weird game IMO. I'm happy Vinicius scored two and Dele assisted but, even though Spurs are really holding on to the ball, it doesn't feel like we're scoring as much as we are dominating the ball possession. ü§î I need to get used to having this 2nd squad play like this. Different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Please make sure no one gets injured. Also, please make sure Son &amp; Kane rest today. We need the Son &amp; Kane Show vs. Chelsea. #COYS #THFC #TOTLUD  https://t.co/uOCfBydhzz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@coys100 @SpursOfficial Heard the initial reason SK decided to set up shop in Austria is because back in September üá¶üáπ was doing okay with COVID19. Well, not any more!

<|startoftext|>@CongressPassUBI The major issue is trying to link 'happiness' with genetics (or even the environment) is that the word 'happiness' and the state it defines is very subjective. I'd say it is not much different than trying to find genes to rationalize eugenics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J_Frick3 You can teach algebra to 4th graders. That's the difference. The variables are clear cut. UBI's variables are not and that's the issue. In fact, if the US actually teaches algebra at 4th grade, we would have less difficulty explaining the #MATH behind UBI. ü§î<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickSpur Too bad Dele had to play w/ still-getting-ready Bale vs. Antwerp. If he's given a few chances w/ Sonny &amp; Harry plus all the 1st choice players, I'm sure he can start the process of regaining his confidence. But, w/ a majority 2nd choice squad members, it's going to be difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Well, the complete history of Maradona isn't necessarily something you want to be associated with, if you know his history. And, certainly no one can be Maradona of the 1980's. Especially, Maradona in the 1986 WC. He was 26 then so that's sorta Sonny &amp; Harry during the 2018 WC.üòú  https://t.co/SmZTetrGUJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abetterworld98 That it is Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Maybe sell them both to buy one quality CB may be a better choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S TBH Dele's either really lost his confidence or he just made too much money too early in life or maybe just both. He needs a fresh start...and I actually don't know what that means for Dele. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thespursweb A wrong combination of players on the pitch w/ the attackers not having played much w/ one another. If we consider how the Son &amp; Kane Show happened around the 76th min for #BURTOT, having them come on during the 2nd half was still not a guarantee w/ Antwerp playing organized. ü§®  https://t.co/q7uuB48GXd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs There's definitely a few combinations of attackers, midfielders, and defenders that work best together. Today's starters were a bad combination.

<|startoftext|>@COYS_com  https://t.co/FOebGIFDC4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Today's issue was simple. Mourinho went with the wrong players to play a really good team, away. Winks, Bale, Dele, Bergwijn should not have played as starters.

<|startoftext|>Can this affect US elections?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbaseballfan @RussTaylorPhD @glassmeg @CNNSotu 225,000 human deaths is not a small absolute number. Just because the % is small (due to there being nearly 330 million living in the US) it does not mean 225,000 deaths is a small number to ignore.  https://t.co/ONX29qRdDK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnolesMichael Let's all try whenever possible. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnolesMichael So true! But, the issue is that people don't know enough about a subject to realize that they are incorrect or in the wrong.

<|startoftext|>@VanGennepD Good point. I haven't followed SK for a while and was amazed at how similar the numbers were even after a few months.

<|startoftext|>@VanGennepD 80 cases or even a few hundred cases per 51,640,000 people per day is containment in my books when there's no lockdown. South Korea still, after 9+months from the 1st case, has less than 500 deaths, in addition. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSpur Rose is being made an example of IMO on how not to piss off Mourinho in the documented-way we all saw on the Amazon docu-series.

<|startoftext|>@RussTaylorPhD @glassmeg @CNNSotu More importantly, South Korea's #COVID19 deaths are still under 500. SK has 51,640,000 people. Trump said 99 % will be fine in the US. Well, 1 % is 3.3 million people, if we consider US has 328.2 million total population. 3,282,000 is not a small number.  https://t.co/lIAUio4J2n<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Mourinho &amp; The Boys should stop this nonsense w/ the stupid üóëÔ∏èüèÄüí© and do some f-ing ‚öΩÔ∏è drills on how to defend during set pieces FFS.

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S This Bale played and missed vs. WHU. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It's your fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S IMHO Bale &amp; Winks substitutions definitely weakened the squad but the sub that made the most significant difference was Lucas for Son as WHU no longer needed to stay low. They increased the backline so, considering how they were in good form, it was just a matter of time. #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScorchersLife Should've kicked the ‚öΩÔ∏è w/ his foot as far away as possible based on common sense that it's football. Winks needs to go back to the basics IMHO. He's hard to watch these days literally as he's a bench player and, when he's on the pitch, it's just a mess. Tanguy agrees. #TOTWHU  https://t.co/FlX48N1JVU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@primevideosport Depends on what the occasion is for. But, I vote Jose Mourinho and his Ego/Stubbornness! #TOTWHU  https://t.co/dyedvzZyGV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Yes, dreamland, indeed. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Jose sealed the draw w/ subbing on not-match-fit Bale plus Lucas replacing one crucial piece to the Son and Kane Show. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #TOTWHU   https://t.co/Pn6WOi9J5R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Jose's special mentality precedes both Kane &amp; Son so go figure.ü§î My positive side says he's just thinking about the next game where Son has to sprint 20+ times &amp; score/assist in partnership w/ Kane. I think Bale &amp; Lucas should've entered w/ 5 min to play. Now so much is exposed.  https://t.co/37jiX5oY9b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Perhaps, Mourinho is arrogant enough to make himself believe that his starting XI really isn't fueled by the Kane-Son partnership - the duo is lethal for a reason. Maybe it's a perception issue that's shared by most Europeans. Why else would we say Son's underrated? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@footballdaily @guk_geureut Interview Bale. Want to hear what he has to say. Son and Kane gave us the usual Son &amp; Kane Show - what else would Sonny say after being subbed off for no descernable reason. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCowlin Bad subbing decisions by Mourinho. Especially thinking Lucas &amp; Kane Show exists somehow when an unfit Bale's on the pitch. I'm talking about match fitness. #TOTWHU  https://t.co/I411adcKJ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold The Son and Kane Show nullified by none other than Mourinho due to him wanting more spotlights in the form of Bale playing. It was a Jose-fabricated punishment IMHO. #TOTWHU #THFC  https://t.co/Rzds5o0RbQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Hope Jose learned his lesson about player quality or lack there of for some. Harry &amp; Sonny are irreplaceable IMHO. Not even Bale can be Kane &amp; Son's equal. #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial IMO #THFC players were too distracted by Bale's media attention &amp; once he came in (not ready) things just fell apart. If Son was there w/ Kane, they could've complemented Bale's lack of game time w/ stability. But, no, Jose went for the news headlines rather than a win.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Hope he learns. Bale's not ready. Ndombele and Son are not someone you sub off when you have another team that's been scoring well in the past few games. #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Well, at least Sonny and Harry scored and assisted. ü§î #TOTWHU #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@delboythedon @SpursOfficial For whatever it is worth, the hamstring muscle is part of the thigh. It's the posterior side.

<|startoftext|>@OnlyTVf5XQ @thfc_josh_ @SpursOfficial Mourinho did say he will choose the Europa League match over the Carabao cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Well, Mourinho said in his Chelsea prematch conference that he's targeting the Europa League match on Thursday over the Carabao cup. I think that's a wise decision for obvious reasons. #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/K6T18lOe5m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Yeah, watching Spurs was fun this season w/ Harry &amp; Sonny up top. Will continue to watch but, Kane by himself, things will be difficult. Hopefully, we'll see the KBS line w/ Gio &amp; Ndombele in the middle sometime in late October or early November time frame. Crossing my fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold If the PL wanted to make such handball or VAR offside rulings less subjective as possible, they should've hired IBM or a tech company to look into machine learning algorithms to set thresholds for making such rulings rather than making a human draw lines or look at replay videos.  https://t.co/1RW1FkbXxg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Math (even simple numbers) isn't that fun for many people and that's the cause of many problems in the world IMO, unfortunately. Statistical decision making is so helpful but you often find out many people ignore it as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Honestly, I am actually surprised many fans (in the UK) are not worried because statistics say not having Son is definitely worse than not having Kane in recent times. üòî The mobility Son provides is next to none. Opposing teams will hamper Spurs like how NU did in the 2nd half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold Also, overshadowed by Son's injury which you specifically asked Mourinho about. Hopefully, Jose chooses the right tournament to go all in on since he can only rely on Kane now for scoring. #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnolesMichael Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daily_Hotspur Son Heung-min, to save his career by not getting over used by Mourinho and get injured during the process. It already happened, btw. #TOTNEW #THFC  https://t.co/h94xgRjbF4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S It's the goal keeper coach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold So it wasn't to rest him!!!!! He would've played longer? Well, I am sure Kane, Lucas, Bergwjin, Lamera, etc will be able to fill the void created by Son Heung-min. After all, no one talks about a Sonny back-up. IMHO Spurs need true backups for both Kane &amp; Son. #COYS #THFC #TOTNEW  https://t.co/dGA0Q19Sso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello A calm eff, maybe. #COYS #THFC #TOTNEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Really?! Oh my f-ing g___... Opposing teams dancing ‚¨á, I am sure. üòû Those supposed üèÜ chances going away fast like the past few seasons when Son doesn't play. F! #COYS #THFC #TOTNEW  https://t.co/UOri2wCcZE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S This theory may have legs IMHO. Just that the team is not Skriniar. Last time we see him?  https://t.co/o17sc50V9G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @StevenBergwijn Was going to wait to react to this switch. Now that #THFC drew, it's clear why Mourinho cannot risk not playing Sonny &amp; Harry. Kind of sad how people say get a 2nd striker but IMHO they should actually talk about how Harry AND Sonny do not really have replacements in the squad.  https://t.co/JWZYC4fEcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial These handball rulings are made via vacuous rules and, now with these terrible rulings on the pitch, it's no different than screaming for players to intentionally use them to get penalties, which in my opinion is gaming the system (borderline cheating). Crazy. #THFC #COYS #TOTNEW  https://t.co/fkgtBw73rK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I think Sacramento.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial All this is saying is "Just kick the ball in the direction of a defender's arm when in the penalty box." Non-f-ing-sense! It's difficult for a manager to not play the best players since, if you don't &amp; rest players like Sonny, well, the whole dynamic changes. #COYS #THFC #TOTNEW  https://t.co/hFQrkVvCLP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @MoussaSissoko What illness? Please get well, Sissoko. #THFC #COYS #TOTNEW  https://t.co/NsCjXmA2Pt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazqetjohnson Well, Sonny actually needs some rest. Why's Son starting and Dele is not even on the bench? #TONEW #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/SVcrdBclM5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Sonny needs a commercial (or football/soccer) break before he breaks! Get him some ice cream!  I hope he can get subbed off today, which also means Spurs are probably winning. #COYS #THFC #TOTNEW  https://t.co/cpGBjFUtNn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Well, technically, we need one but Levy can afford to not get one when Harry, Sonny and, at least, two other wingers/forwards are available. And, we're not even considering Dele in the equation. So that's the issue IMO.  https://t.co/iPuSfc1IQK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold 2nd Year jinx for a newbie manager? Personally, I hope him the best, maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial I can see how getting a good striker is difficult as all these other teams know #THFC needs one so they are taking advantage of the situation IMO. It's a business after all. Still hope Levy can get a traditional striker to work w/ Sonny &amp; Bale when Harry needs a rest. #COYS  https://t.co/Mfz0J56MBU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S It is a business so not emotionally attached to sometimes-good players.  https://t.co/ny1Kyw6mSz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @libertex_europe Interesting result. Hope things become more interesting w/ Tanguy. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @libertex_europe MOTM for UK and Harry Fans: Kane MOTM for SK and Sonny Fans: Son MOTM for the rest of the world: Life goes on as usual. LOL #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/dc5IMa96SL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S If Harry can do what he did in the #SOUTOT game, I'm positive signing another striker will be easier for obvious reasons. Another observation from today's game is that we technically need a game maker who can consistently provide service to the attackers. Do we have one? ü§î #COYS  https://t.co/g4RA83PWu2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @libertex_europe Truly a game where Harry and Sonny both deserve to be MOTM as assists and goals go together. üëèüëçüëèüëç #COYS #THFC #SOUTOT   https://t.co/RmUQOpPhoA  https://t.co/ojizG2ExLl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@primevideosport Hate that this is getting so much attention. A goal keeper talking üí© about making forward/winger-level sprints and runs. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That's like other field players shouting, "Make the stop for the team (whatever it takes)." ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/WWkXFJKsm5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs "Make the run." Very easy to say for a goalie. LOL  https://t.co/cZXc4oozfz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeAreTennis With all the talk and actual movement toward automation in society (in general), I thought line judges in tennis would've been already replaced by a robot. Seems like a very straightforward thing to automate and not rely on humans. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold If the Amazon All or Nothing docu-series filming continued through this season, I'm positive Mourinho would use this leading by example situation by Son Heung-min to get at certain players. ü§î I think we know who comes to mind first. #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/6hUYn2iRl4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TranSPURS We need Ndombele doing that after a full 90 minutes of game play. Sonny leading by example! üëçüëè #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold Should sell Dele, Harry or Sonny. That will allow a revamp of the roster like many Spurs fans desire. #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/J9AaqN0jJ2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Amazon saw no value in using the CL run since that's not drama worthy, I mean, the behind closed door stuff. That's why I did not favor the drama spin. Also, I think a lot of what we saw about players were filtered images. Probably, yes, on the rights situation w/ UEFA. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @premierleague Great goal! If there was another winger/attacker like Sonny, Mourinho can use Son as Kane's backup. But then, Jose will lose the versatility of Sonny so that's why we still have people wanting that (I'll be okay to play second fiddle to Harry) traditional striker. Makes sense. ü§î  https://t.co/jTwfIVAyao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold The first 3 episodes were interesting but it felt like Amazon tried their best to maximize drama. Didn't like the in between interviews. Some things were just mentioned or thrown at you abruptly w/o follow up. A lot of it felt like something Levy would favor seeing than the fans.  https://t.co/qpHQIMtjw3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Levy can just sell Sonny or Harry and do the buy-3-get-4th-free-kinda-feeling deals done.

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Awesome! Finally a Mourinho signing that can complete the MF! Hopefully, with Hojbjerg, Kane and Sonny plus other attackers can focus more on the attacking. #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/GL6VbiLHP1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial We know you always give it your all, Sonny. But, the club as a whole under Levy's watch? #THFC  https://t.co/ZffFo6ofFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Lamela, Sissoko, Lloris, Dele, Son, Kane, next, maybe. Just a matter of whether it's next season or the following considering Jose normally stays around for 3 years. Then, the #THFC will have really turned over from the Poch era and then past the Mourinho era. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mortenag @AlasdairGold Well, rules will change/update as a result IMO. FIFA is taking over control of how VAR is implemented and utilized moving forward for the Premier League.  https://t.co/LmINzvyKm1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lazqetjohnson Get what you are saying. Personally, like I said, it's more about the money. Trophy would be nice but this qualification will likely allow Levy to spend a bit this offseason and that can lay the foundation for future success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazqetjohnson Understand your sentiment but they are categorically not at the same level. Comparing country level competition vs. continental level competition doesn't work. I do get your point though. Let's, however, not dismiss it since financially it's going to give #THFC additional funds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @dele_official Agree. Records are there to be broken. It's really great that I don't have to watch the FA Cup Final now! Now, we just need to prepare well for next season which will be in 7 weeks. Just really hoping Levy gets the signings Mourinho wants/needs. #COYS #THFC #CRYTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan_KP Need more quality midfielders &amp; more defenders. Palace's Hudgson knew exactly how to press at the front/middle and exploited #THFC's Achilles' heel IMHO. Agree it was a fitting final game result + an overall 6th finish. #COYS #CRYTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Mourinho now has the 'results' to go ask Levy to get players in the off-season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @dele_official My theory is that Palace did not want the 9-game losing streak going into next season so they probably had more to lose than the #THFC. They were more determined IMHO. Because, even if we lose &amp; don't get Europa League, it's Plan B to focus on the PL &amp; the domestic cups. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @lazqetjohnson Well, it's after all just a game. At least, that's how I approach following a sports team. I'll be there for the team win, lose, or draw.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @dele_official I understand. It was boring but Palace's Roy Hudgson should be given credit. They knew we were not that strong in the middle. We were pretty much cut off. We need play-makers. Lo Celso cannot do it alone. #CRYTOT #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Honestly, Palace knows this IMO &amp; Roy Hodgson made sure to target these issues. That's why we're seeing Kane, Son, Lo Celso, Moura all get pressed hard as Winks &amp; Sissoko cannot really do that prime Eriksen-level play-making. We just need another counter work. #CRYTOT #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I agree. The way Palace is pressing hard and the forward/wing attackers are getting the balls too early means our midfield is not an ideal group of players, at the moment, controlling the game. We need a good DM. #CRYTOT #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @LucasMoura7 We need @LucasMoura7 cutting &amp; intercepting dribbles + passes. Multiple #THFC scores happened via Lucas stealing balls from an advancing opponent.

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Happy Harry passes happily to Sonny and that's good. We need Sonny to score, first, then Harry scores the next two. We need that trend going.

<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold Good video, IMHO. Like the comparison between Lamela vs. Ndombele.

<|startoftext|>@StevenTDennis Yes. Europe has sports (i.e., football/soccer). Just no spectators. Still great~!  https://t.co/wO96s2Qq7L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold We'll see what Jose decides for Wed. vs. Newcastle. Right now Bournemouth is losing 0-1 to Leicester City so #TOTARS was definitely an improvement. I know many weren't so optimistic. #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Don't get me wrong Lamela's good. He's just not a great ball distributor that's why he can't start for the #THFC IMHO. Lamela also can only shoot/pass from the left. We have Son, Lucas, Bergwijn technically playing better as wings so unless Lo Celso's not playing, he can't start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Don't know why I feel this way but Dier's 4 game suspension and his demand for doubling his wages seem to have come at the right time. Congrats on using the 4-4-2 successfully today, Jose! Toby! Sonny! Kane! Lucas! #TOTARS #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/pdw2FxEzsM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold This üëÜ is what we need. Well, to be fair, Lamela is good coming off the bench, especially when Lo Celso is in the game as well. I think Lamela's level of hesitation is good off the bench since it may throw off the opponents, if you know what I mean. #TOTARS #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial The precursor to Jose saying "You score a goal, you come here [to interview]" (10 second mark) is Mourinho using Harry &amp; Sonny in a 4-4-2 formation w/ midfield playing well~!!! Great win~!!! #TOTARS #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/W4PilzJYmG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TranSPURS We need to install an electric shock collar on Lamela that select fans can activate.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial #BOUTOT was terrible indeed. #THFC players in the 1st team squad are old as Mourinho. This is why Jose needs fresh new signings &amp;, at least, another season to prove himself. We need creativity in the middle. Lamela killed some of the chances IMHO &amp; some of them were counters. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur Why did Mourinho not just start Harry, Sonny, Lucas, Bergwijn together w/ Lo Celso, Winks, Sissoko from the beginning?

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I really should've just vacuumed &amp; cleaned the house. Lamela hesitating to pass &amp; eventually not passing killed a lot of plays today IMHO.

<|startoftext|>@CDBaker86 The S. Korean military does teach Taekwondo during basic training so I assume Son knows some basic martial arts skills IMO. But, the military also teaches you not to use force on civilians so... ü§î  https://t.co/deUJPr4Q6j<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S You can easily change that to Poch vs. Mourinho IMHO. Or, was that a secret? #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Btw, look at this ironic web-content. Too funny. Coverage of Roberts' TWEET saying that the Lloris-Son fight was getting attention due to the media (go figure, right?). This webpage is put out by a small web-based outlet, presumably for attention. üòÇ #COYS  https://t.co/LBnzcnkER2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katy_kin I accidentally did sleep and now it's lunch time. üôÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I'm already thinking about next season &amp; who'll be staying/joining the team. The way the #THFC have played under Mourinho, we really need DMs &amp; more quality defenders. We also need a second traditional striker but Kane's presence hampers that by a mile. He's a blessing &amp; a curse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Agree. I believe Mourinho said it was "Beautiful!" because Jose knows Mourinho can use Lloris-vs-Son fight for anything now, if you know what I mean. üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Hahaha. Personally, Lloris vs. Son was the least expected. Thus, it seems to garner more attention. TBH six defenders allowing one EVE attacker to shoot like that worries me more than anything moving forward. If that was a quality shooter, it really would have been 1:1. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S IMHO Hugo probably felt Son won't react back at him. And, to Son's defense, that play did not require Son, Lo Celso, Moura to trackback as they were sprinting toward the other direction. After Moura missed Kane, the EVE player, in 1 second, was already more than 10 m away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I can see your point. After watching the replay, however, it seems like Hugo did not necessarily picked the correct play to go after someone. It's very unfortunate that even Lloris thinks Son should play like a wing-back &amp; not a wing-forward. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Perhaps #THFC Captain &amp; fellow Frenchman Hugo Lloris should go after Tanguy Ndombele, publicly, &amp; let us see what happens. ü§î #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S He's scheming to increase more interest IMHO. Levy's not Lloris. Levy knows what he's doing as a businessman. Levy, unlike captain Hugo, will not make snap judgments out in the open, especially when you're supposed to be the head honcho. At least, that's my 2 cents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thespursweb Is this Seb Jenkins, the blogger, giving his opinion? LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thespursweb Only gave Mourinho &amp; the team an excuse to go back to if they lose any games this season &amp; even next season. Lloris should've expressed that sh*t inside the locker room. Hugo &amp; @thespursweb should go back to the replay video &amp; analyze the play &amp; see how inappropriate that was. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goal I swear Mourinho even has his own goalkeeper believing that Son Heung-min is a wing-back and not a wing-forward. LOL. IMHO Lloris analyzed the situation incorrectly. Hugo please go back &amp; watch the replay. #THFC #COYS #TOTEVE  https://t.co/5h00alTe3n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Hard to think of Son in a different uniform but, as they say, all good things must come to an end. We'll see how things turn out for the next five games. Will we get troll Jose or happy Mourinho? Any more random fights? Stay tuned. #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/4svIsdgcMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold I think Son's perspectives after his arm broke changed. He saw how üí© the #THFC have become. He finished military training also. After that, what would scare him? He's probably not going to put up w/ üí© like before as he has a lot of options. But, I do believe he loves the Spurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold Because someone else (i.e., Lloris) was displaying troll-like characteristics? I imagine this incident will give Jose &amp; the team an excuse if they lose games this season + next season. Mourinho will say the fight started a crack amongst players. It's üí© waiting to happen. #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold 3/ It will be the captain thing to do &amp; apologize to Son after reviewing the replay video thoroughly. If a team has four in the back in front of the goalie &amp; two midfielders (six total) defending against 2 attackers &amp; somehow that allowed a shot, well, that's a big f-ing problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold 2/ In 1 sec, the EVE player was 40 ft away from Lucas, Lo Celso, Son. Also, 6 defenders vs. 2 attackers. Hugo was just being a prick thinking Son will allow it but why would Son give in to pure sh*t from a goalie who has no idea what it's like to sprint back &amp; forth on the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @AlasdairGold I disagree w/ it being staged. It's just Lloris making a personal error in judgment on how to handle a situation. Look at the video:  https://t.co/GZAQoXa3sM. Start from 13s. The reason Kane tracks back is because Lucas meant to send the ball to Harry but it ended up short. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold Thought Ben Davies played well at the LB position today and that allowed Son to have four shots after having none the past two games. Other than that I think Lloris' beef w/ Son was unwarranted. Something was really off about that situation. A win's a win so can't complain! #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial *they'll (they will)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @eToro Ben Davies should be on here as well IMHO. I vote Lo Celso. Much needed V! #COYS #THFC #TOTEVE  https://t.co/Bcieb0hFjv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial My goodness. What a weird win. But, it is a win. 3 points. Lo Celso awesome as usual. Defense was definitely better! Also, Sonny had 4 shots compared to ZERO in the past two games. Mourinho listened, I guess.

<|startoftext|>@DeadLetterBox @EricTopol Obviously, it's to shut up the people that say they have a breathing problem so they can't wear a mask.

<|startoftext|>@EricTopol Perhaps, a scientific paper is in order for hypothesis testing whether wearing cloth masks, surgical masks, N95 respirators will, in fact, disallow efficient gas exchange.

<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold IMO Mourinho has 2 options w/ 6 games left: (1) Focus on testing a new defense w/ what's available, (2) focus on utilizing quality attackers for attacks &amp; have the defense rotate &amp; defend like it's a relegation battle. He seems to be trying 1. I say try option 2 for the next few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thespursweb Harry's the reason we only have one traditional striker at the #THFC. Both a blessing &amp; a curse. Who'd want to come to the Spurs as a striker? Look at how Son's being sacrificed to serve as a left-wing-back while providing 2 assists in the past 2 games for 2 Kane goals. ü§î#COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur 3/ My point is that this mentality change concept is old school. It‚Äôs more about how you can assemble the best starting XI &amp; the bench and them complementing each other. Right now, at #THFC, I don‚Äôt see the starting XI going to other top clubs &amp; starting except for Harry &amp; Sonny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur 2/ I don't see this being that different for pro athletes; especially for football/soccer players as they have a lot of options all over the world. Many of them can just choose to go their own way since there will always be clubs &amp; fans that want you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur After the 80/90's when computers, Internet, cell phones started entering the main stream, a lot has changed for how people adapt to new environments IMHO. Now, people can be less flexible as it's easier to find others that share your beliefs &amp; life style via social media, etc. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @HKane @LastWordOnSpurs As for the Everton game, since it's between two older generation managers that know each other pretty well, I see it being quite competitive - tactic-wise. But, I do see it being a #THFC win since they just had a pretty bad game so they'll work hard. If they don't, no Europe. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @HKane @LastWordOnSpurs Look how, back in 11/09/19's #TOTSHU game, Son was definitely an attacker w/ 1 goal, 6 shots while, for the 07/02/20 #SHUTOT game, he had 1 assist, ZERO shots. The heatmaps show clear differences in how he was a wing-forward under Poch but a left-wing-back under Mourinho.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #THFC  https://t.co/4W9WdtnxEu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlasdairGold Great article, Alasdair. If you can, at the next press conf., please ask Jose why he's not using the attackers to their strengths? I mean his desire to not concede goals is understandable but that should be dealt w/ next season. He should attack the üí© out of all remaining games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tebpixels @SpursOfficial #SHUTOT #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/DAC4jOVwNp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @HKane @LastWordOnSpurs Heatmaps show how Son Heung-min, a wing-forward, played much like a mid-fielder/wing-back. Ben Osborn is a midfielder while Enda Stevens is considered a left-back. SHU played 3-5-2 vs. TOT's 3-2-4-1. I think the questions about Kane scoring under Jose made this happen also. #THFC  https://t.co/ww07VyK9eM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @HKane Mourinho's style can/will work if the backline was better than what we have. The attackers cannot do their jobs because of it.

<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs How the Premier League utilizes on-field referees vs. VAR needs an update. In the PL, like Mourinho correctly points out, the VAR has an upper hand in certain rulings they're able to rule on. It should be that these critical decisions should be reviewed together and then decided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RowanMakesFilms Just share this üëá story. It details how asymptomatic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 carriers without masks can infect others &amp;, in the process, kill people. In this case, the carrier did not tell people he was infected even though he knew he was. #COVID19 #Masks   https://t.co/WIKCk7FBzI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tebpixels @SpursOfficial If we had defenders actually playing, the score wouldn't be 3-1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial The only answer to the #SHUTOT game is playing Sonny as a wing-forward and NOT wing-back. Also, make passes to Son since Kane's not the only one that can score. If we can make 5 subs, use/rotate the defenders to cover the back; let the attackers attack more and SCORE! #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/EoH5XpLL0y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Terrible game plan. 9-Day gap did not help. Also, Sheffield losing 3 straight also gave them more motivation. VAR decision was terrible because the final activity before Kane's ruled out goal was not Lucas touching the ball but the defender kicking the ball off of Moura. #SHUTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @HKane Play Sonny as a wing-forward, moving forward, Mourinho!!! #SHUTOT #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Honestly, I can't believe Son's not running forward as much. Mourinho must have really told him to be a wingback and not a wing-forward. #SHUTOT #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S The game plan was terrible IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Sensing the next Spurs game will feature a different backline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S One of the issues I've noticed today was players try to pass to Kane just because. That's not a good sign. Even this last offside. He's not the only one that can score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @dele_official @MoussaSissoko @Serge_aurier Definitely too late. #SHUTOT #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I think Sissoko's just old. Also, playing Son down like how Mourinho does will be the death of the #THFC IMHO. #SHUTOT #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bettors_Digest @NBCSportsSoccer It was crazy. Klopp interview was totally unnecessary. #SHUTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S The handball-goal rule needs an amendment to cover this situation. Who on earth will choose to face plant? That's the FA and the Premier League promoting players to undergo traumatic brain injury (TBI). The utilization of VAR in this manner is a joke, yes, I concur. #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S VAR MO is your tweet's object IMHO. FA needs to decide and include a rule amendment where a player falling cannot naturally not use his/her hands/arms to fight gravity. The current rule means that Kane's goal only would have stood if Moura did a face plant in that situation. LOFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nth09 @LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur I noticed that as well. They should show us how they figure out both variables: when the ball is kicked and whether or not the scorer, at that time, was offsides. The FA should consider upgrading the technology and also the application of the rules in future seasons. #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Still think these VAR offside analyses are not scientifically accurate. How does VAR decide when the ball is kicked to the scorer? Since that's part of the equation, they should show that process as well IMHO. Also, do they use high-speed cameras? ü§î  #WHUFC #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur How does VAR figure out when the ball is kicked to a scorer? All these analyses are dependent on that aspect but I don't think the PL has the technology or use high-speed cameras for offsides analyses to be scientifically accurate. ü§î IMHO Subjective analysis. #TOTWHU #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial For real, Sonny's nullified goal was great in the technical sense. Just unfortunate. Few centimeters...IMHO the timing of when VAR cuts off from when the ball is kicked to the scorer is subjective so I think that's another aspect the FA should really look at, moving forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Enough time to recoup since the next game is next Thursday! Very important game v. Sheffield!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial KAAAAAANE!!! #THFC #COYS #TOTWHU #WHUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Perhaps Son can play well into this mid/late-30's by switching to a wingback or a leftback. ü§î #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @WhoScored IMHO the referee awarding two penalties was a clear sign that he was wanting something to happen. They know MU being in CL will be more $ so go figure. ü§î  The latter was a clear dive by Bruno &amp; the other a dive by Phogba but that one can be interpreted (subjectively) either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @WhoScored The refereeing was terrible throughout the game. Both were not actual penalties. Overall, it was competitive (both good and bad) for both teams - fittingly - so it was an okay game to watch if you think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @WhoScored Hope so since West Ham is a totally different team. IMHO, Mourinho likely went w/ this passive sitting-deep option because Kane &amp; Son have not played for so long. Also, although Lamela played okay, his style of play did not appear to complement the other 3 attackers that much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial According to @WhoScored, Son played down. I guess it worked and it also didn't work. Better than losing, I guess. Sorry but Kane was IMHO invisible but I know he'll be match fit during the next two games. Refereeing was terrible. #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/RggcD20yq2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 It's different because sound &amp; light energy can be measured using instrumentation. Look up SI &amp; SI-derived units. They have specific units that can be assigned. Ideas being written into digital form is a totally separate issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 Basically, your version of a 'nice racist' is someone that practices discretion when talking about racial biases. And, the convos are with select individuals (at select locations) so it stays a secret. Btw, seeing &amp; hearing are physical events since they can both be recorded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH Viruses can be stopped physically because they are organic particles. SARS-CoV-2 is approx. 100 nm in size. Infection occurs via three main routes: Contact transmission, fomite transmission, &amp; aerosol transmission. If you can prevent them, spreading of the viruses can be stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 Your version of a nice racist's true nature is covert as it is not openly acknowledged or displayed. You mentioned it being someone's personal business so that makes it a secret unless they choose to show their tendencies. At that point, who's going to say they are nice racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 If there are enough individuals practicing covert racism even at the personal level &amp; that number is, for instance (hypothetically), 50 million people (out of 200 million adults in the US) that IMO can be considered a systemic issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH You specifically mentioned stopping the world. Influenza's R0 (basic reproduction #) ~2 so, if people are vaccinated at the currently accepted level, it doesn't spread as much. SARS-CoV-2's R0 is 5.7 &amp; there's no vaccine so that's why physical distancing will prevent spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH Viruses can be stopped, physically. Most other diseases are not like that unless it involves microbes, etc. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not preventable. We don't really have a way to predict who'll get AD. It's also impossible to cure as your diseased neurons can't be replaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 Perhaps what you're talking about is 'covert racism'.  https://t.co/s43ldHm2zs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 Your version of a nice racist, based on what you've said so far, seems more like someone who profiles people, situationally, &amp; use that as a guidance for his/her actions but these actions are not physical treatments that can be evaluated as evidence by others as blatant racism.ü§î<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NathanielRH @BenBeard6819921 Well, you can still choose not to pick someone for a job or vote for someone only because they are from a particular ethnicity or have a particular cultural background.

<|startoftext|>@anmol_arya2001 @EricTopol IMHO it's fair. As of right now, 81,779 absolute # of people in the US have died due to #COVID19. That's 249 deaths per 1 million for the US while in S. Korea 258 people died total out of 51 million. That's 5 deaths per 1 million for S Korea. US has 50x more deaths per million.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LAPaytonY @PreetBharara üëç I agree. It's definitely important to social distance as much as possible until we know how things change/update during the next few months. The new cases in S. Korea clearly show what can happen even after flattening the curve. Stay safe!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrEricDing I assume other countries w/ #COVID19 patients can replicate this work w/o too much difficulty unless there's something extra special about the viral particles they used or there's more to the chemical inactivation procedure. What do you think, @DrEricDing?  https://t.co/sO4bIflnCZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardTrotter @DrEricDing The PiCoVacc they mention in the paper is SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (isolated from patients) treated (thus inactivated) by a chemical (beta-propiolactone, BPL) &amp; then isolated via chromatography.

<|startoftext|>@EricTopol @ScienceMagazine @hholdenthorp The 'Vaccine candidate preparation' detailed in the SI section (also mentioned in the main text) says they chemically treated the SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolated from patients) w/ beta-propiolactone (BPL) for 24 h then purified via chromatography methods.

<|startoftext|>@koryodynasty At least in the US, foreign language classes at the HS level mostly involve taking Spanish (46 %),  French (21 %), German (8.7 %), Latin (8.5 %) so access to learning an Asian language is quite limited.

<|startoftext|>@heracleetus @AndrewYang 1-to-1 instruction will increase student outcome. Teachers want student success but when the student-to-faculty ratio is 20+, you are limited by time.

<|startoftext|>@presbyope @BelMOCards @NateSilver538 4/ Anyway, as I said previously, researchers need to do more research to fully understand what SARS-CoV-2 does to the human body both short-term &amp; long-term. For now, it's good that these cases did not involve new viral particles being created that can infect &amp; replicate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@presbyope @BelMOCards @NateSilver538 3/ Understanding how a virus is an assembled nanoparticle is important. You need to know the components to be able to hypothesis test appropriately. Hope this makes sense. There are methods to additionally analyze the RNA. See:  https://t.co/fwBwzLUyoK,  https://t.co/eMdj60nsf5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@presbyope @BelMOCards @NateSilver538 2/ In these 2nd positive cases, the RT-qPCR tests themselves are not detecting incorrectly. They're correctly detecting the pieces of RNA fragments based on how the kits are designed to work. When coupled w/ viral assembly tests, can infection/replication be fully tested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@presbyope @BelMOCards @NateSilver538 The usage of the term 'false positive' is a bit misleading IMO. I agree that the RT-qPCR positive detection, in these cases, are not that of the viruses that can infect/replicate. The RT-qPCR methods use primers so large enough RNA can be detected.

<|startoftext|>@HiSteveKim @positively1972 Watch this üëá interview. Airborne viral transmission is always a possibility.

<|startoftext|>@NTR_Warrior Accuracy? Humans are not robots. The body may or not produce antibodies. Even if the immune cells do produce antibodies, you need approx. 2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection to have detectable antibody levels.

<|startoftext|>@BelMOCards @presbyope @NateSilver538 If these people went to the hospital due to similar symptoms as the 1st time around, perhaps the viral nucleic acids &amp; proteins are being actively created but they are just not able to assemble into viral particles - who knows?

<|startoftext|>@presbyope @NateSilver538 That's 1 hypothesis of whether or not what they isolated can infect &amp; replicate, which is great news. But, that's not a full set of hypothesis testing to accept/reject whether what they're testing positive can be labeled simply as 'false positives' like the 1st NS tweet suggests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoemclaren @NateSilver538 SK scientists hypothesized a few scenarios about this but never accepted/rejected any of them since nothing was fully hypothesis tested. IMHO this situation is still not fully understood since they're still saying they "think" something is likely. No real hypothesis testing, yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 IMO no one has done hypothesis testing for false positives in this case. Viruses are assembled nanoparticles. S.

<|startoftext|>@SexyOyster @mhwelch1211 @H1ZUMI @koryodynasty There are different levels of protection that a particular PPE will provide the user.

<|startoftext|>@JeremyM72014840 @328_roman @niccpianc @tongbingxue I experienced H1N1 &amp; it wasn't fun. Never had the seasonal flu.

<|startoftext|>@DrLindaShelton @sweetestBabyBoy @ASAPwhatwhat @startupdaemon @CDCgov @DrMattMcCarthy @jeremyphoward 3/ The most likely route of infection would be through the eyes, nose, &amp; mouth (not ears) like Dr. Kim says.

<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM #Masks4All #PPEshortage  https://t.co/mGVYqNLzdz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM Depends. S. Korea still has open borders. No lockdown. Vaccine development takes years &amp; 7+ billion cannot get it all at once. My hypothesis is that mask usage culture/behavior (regardless of GDP) can be correlated more to the exponential growth of cases/deaths in the US/Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM Like I said correlate it to air travel, if you can get/sort the data. That'll give people an understanding of what might have happened prior to each countries exponential growth in cases/deaths. But now, many have closed their borders so linking air travel to GDP might be tricky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM Regular people are affected by the usage of masks or lack thereof. What they do now cannot affect or be affected by GDP. If you truly want to tie air travel or other tangibles to cases/deaths then do that. Correlations to GDP is not something people can use during a pandemic. üòî<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM All countries do acknowledge &amp; push for social distancing, hand washing, &amp; no touching face. But, not masks. You do random analysis so do a critical one that's directly tied to everyone's routines when they go outside during a pandemic. That'll get more interactions on Twitter.ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM Your doing random analysis, I know. It's interesting but not critical. People are confused in the US about mask usage as officials (i.e., surgeon general, WHO) are lying about mask's effectiveness due to #PPEshortage. I'm providing an idea for something that may not be random. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCAFDM Economy size IMHO is not an independent variable that can be directly linked to #COVID19 cases/deaths numbers unless you have a valid reason to think that econ size can predict cases/deaths.

With experience, IMHO US would‚Äôve prepared to do early mass testing.ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar @realDonaldTrump 2/ Dr. Kim's explanation was that capitalism enabled companies to invest in testing related equipment &amp; reagents &amp; that helped them prepare. He knew vaccines &amp; anti-virals take years to develop so early testing then tracking followed by treatment made the most sense to S. Korea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar @realDonaldTrump 1/ This is where the experience was the difference.

<|startoftext|>@Arejang @Portlandval @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar Yup. Agree. Dr. Kim very calmly explains all of these aspects.

<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar 3/ Aerosols were part of my doctorate studies a few decades ago so I know how effective they can travel given the right conditions. The mainstream will have difficulty in adjusting their thinking 1 way or another. The best thing is to #StayAtHome, wash hands, wear masks outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar 2/ But if you talk w/ force, these large droplets will gain kinetic energy so they‚Äôll travel longer distances &amp; in the process water molecules will evaporate thus creating droplets smaller than 5 microns, aka aerosols. If they contain viruses, they can infect people further away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar 1/ Dr. Kim's interview mentions the difference between 5+ micron size (large) droplets vs. aerosols. His explanation is logical for most people to understand. Basically, when you talk, there is a chance that large droplets can form &amp; they mostly fall within 1-2 meters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar Show üëá+ Dr. Kim's interview discusses simple mask vs. N95 respirator. After regular masks were gone, people bought N95s. That's the issue. For outings, simple masks will do IMO since 5+ micron droplets w/ viruses can be blocked when people sneeze/cough.ü§î  https://t.co/Ppjwnm5whz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar The medical staff actually needs N95 respirators (or comparable), not simple facemasks but, with the shortage, obviously they should use whatever possible, don't touch their faces, wash the hands, etc. For regular people #StayAtHome, don't panic buy N95 masks but know masks help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arejang @theothermarkzuc @davidenrich @esaagar Another way to view this would be, the US Surgeon General &amp; WHO are implementing a form of means testing but are basing it off of a lie &amp; a truth.

<|startoftext|>@ASAPwhatwhat @startupdaemon @CDCgov @DrMattMcCarthy Viruses are tens of nanometers. But, the liquid droplets they might be incorporated in should be tens of microns or larger.

<|startoftext|>@c0ntinuiti @AwokeKnowing @jeremyphoward @4everNeverTrump @DrMattMcCarthy Agree. The issue isn't the # of cases &amp; deaths.

<|startoftext|>@Armageist1 @BurnItD0wn @DrEricDing If both the sick &amp; the not sick all wear masks, then it's a double protection situation IMHO. Check out @3blue1brown's video üëá.

<|startoftext|>@jeremyphoward @Martin68718706 @gspowers @DrEricDing This is an important aspect people don't realize. S.

<|startoftext|>@Armageist1 @BurnItD0wn @DrEricDing US is #1üëá; they likely looked at nations w/ flattened curves. They wear masks in general.

<|startoftext|>@EthanCOYS @daddy_dele That's why I reject your hypothesis. It's well-known probability for anything is 50:50 unless 'conditions' are provided.

<|startoftext|>@daddy_dele @EthanCOYS It's not though and, since @EthanCOYS did not provide #data or a detailed comparison as to how the struggles are similar, people will reject his hypothesis.

<|startoftext|>@TrumperForYang @Nuffaboutme @AndrewYang IMHO the issue is not the millions that think this is a strategic move.

Hopefully, bringing in Mourinho was, at least, acknowledging they could've cared more about what's on the pitch. Also, seeing #THFC go to 4L1D after Kane &amp; Son both went out proves to them quality matters.  https://t.co/jPY1sm4Ptn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Ofc, we need 5-6 more Kanes &amp; Sons to start the rebuild. Whether that's w/ Son &amp; Kane is another topic but it's just not clicking on the pitch. Mourinho's 1st year just proves why Poch got sacked last year. Timely investment leading to a good return applies to football as well.ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Are you literally agreeing w/ what Mourinho's feeling/saying "off" the pitch then? ü§™ Two of the Top 3 wage earners (Kane &amp; Son are also top performers) not available while one is just MIA on most days. ü§î #THFC  https://t.co/16txUsPDbA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @SundaySupp Mourinho's spot on w/ his approach w/ Tanguy. He's going straight for his mind. Top wage earner, same as Kane &amp; more than Son.

<|startoftext|>@WDobetter @DoreneFC @Dmitri_Gusev @DrEricDing @AndrewYang SK tech co's made equipment, supplied them to hospitals during/after the last viral outbreak started elsewhere.

<|startoftext|>@WDobetter @DoreneFC @Dmitri_Gusev @DrEricDing IMHO the costs that insurance co charge &amp; healthcare co charge are inefficiently high &amp; infrastructure isn't great so they limit the # of #COVID19 tests.ü§î Like @AndrewYang targeted, these sys that drive up medical costs need to be analyzed &amp; revamped so they work for the people.  https://t.co/lWhQ2Hs7DN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OfficialMLK3 @cleemonsta Unfortunately, there are many reasons. ü§î The main issue is that everyone has their own opinion about it without having a clear pragmatic solution.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial ü§î Something's incorporated in his agenda that's not football.

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial #THFC has won games we didn't deserve to win. But, such games are won by top players like Kane &amp; Son.

<|startoftext|>@Rob__Milliken @supjackjack @WHO has nice graphics &amp; info on their website. They target the mainstream (of the world) so their resources (URL below) will be helpful in dealing w/ anyone about the #coronavirus #COVID19. #MATH #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/CfTIUHj2yj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supjackjack Well, it depends on your methodology &amp; the listener but I understand where your frustrations might be coming from. I do have to say that your last sentence does sound a bit like what a toxic Berner would say to the #YangGang IMHO. üôÇ #MATH #HuamanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcinca2003 @theYangDynasty Agree. Iran's #COVID19 death toll is currently higher than Korea but it also could be true that the number of infected people will be much higher also. If that's true, the true mortality % will be different. The main issue is that testing &amp; figuring out the true # is difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supjackjack You are trying to convince others about #COVID19? Are people not believing in something specific you said about the #coronavirus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supjackjack Please do share the statistics and the science then. #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supjackjack That doesn't mean it'll be lethal much more so than the flu. The current issue is that everything is a big unknown: we cannot simply rely on our immune sys. &amp; the available anti-virals may not be effective to help everyone. Just saying something bad will happen won't help, also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supjackjack IMHO #COVID19 appears to infect very well but, if testing is done efficiently like in S. Korea &amp; medical help is provided, it's not the end of the world. The mortality rate in S. Korea is around 0.5 %: 94K+ tests done, 3K+ infected, 17 dead (mean age: 63).  https://t.co/mgdDLbv0QE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcinca2003 @theYangDynasty Mortality % calc. IMO relies on how widely tests are done to collect the data. Based on S. Korean data on #COVID19 testing, the fatality rate is around 0.5 %: 94K+ tested, 3K+ infected, 17 dead (mean age: 63). For China, can/did they test all the infected?  https://t.co/mgdDLbv0QE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DecTob IMHO China has a big pollution issue, in general, so that could be a reasonable hypothesis to go by. It is, however, something that will be difficult to test. Hopefully, we can find out what happens in S. Korea since they are transparent about reporting #coronavirus related info.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrEricDing The US needs to consult S. Korea on how they managed to do all the tests &amp; prepare accordingly. They actual have the experience from few years ago &amp; now #COVID19.

<|startoftext|>@adntigger @AndyC_88 @intelliot @kengray1967 @WelshGasDoc @mikegalsworthy The other thing is that for viral infections, there are both vaccines &amp; small molecular therapeutics (i.e., anti-viral drugs).

<|startoftext|>@Daily_Hotspur @TheAthleticUK Parrott was sent off w/ two yellows after this. 10/10/2019, U-21 Ireland vs. Italy. I'm sure Mourinho has seen this &amp; also experienced what this teenager is like in person. üßêü§î #THFC  https://t.co/0NwhUiWpNz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thespursweb Kane is definitely a world-class striker when he's not injured &amp; is out for lengthy periods.

<|startoftext|>@thespursweb Agree but a depressing list TBH to be discussing at this stage in a season &amp; after making the CL final last season.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @Simoning @SpursOfficial I'd hope subs play 20-30 mins w/ intensity. That's their role. These substitutions are tactical, manager decisions &amp; obviously many subs want 90 mins not 20 mins so, yes, they should/can play w/ lots of energy.

<|startoftext|>@rif_fe13 @positively1972 How many?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArturoForNH @positively1972 'Best policies' is such a subjective phrase. Depending on what people choose to promote &amp; believe in, B. Sanders policies can be IMO the worst policies. #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rif_fe13 @positively1972 Well, you don't know that. Nor do I. It's not something we can hypothesis test, easily. How people accept or reject evidence is up to them. IMO we should leave it at that and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rif_fe13 @positively1972 Twitter does bring out IMO the worst in some people. In person, most people find it difficult to be negative, yes. But, if anyone exhibits toxicity online, the contents/tone of their convos most likely provide insights into what kind of a person he/she is inside in real life. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs They need to practice (during the next 6 days) many attacking runs so they can target each other &amp; also draw defenders away before the 4 critical games. After these 4, the #THFC will know if #EPL 4th place is a possibility &amp; if we are still in the #FACup &amp; the #EUFA CL. ü§î #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs How realistic was it to plan for the #TOTRBL &amp; #CHETOT games suddenly w/o their main attacker Son w/ only few days to prep?

<|startoftext|>@mk2_tom @AlasdairGold Son IMO wanted to go back to where he got treatment before. They have the records &amp; the doctors.

<|startoftext|>@VanJones68 @JakeASnider1 @AndrewYang @CNN @AndrewYang, @EvelynYang on the @VanJones68 show?

<|startoftext|>@PSPradio1 @FbayareaS CNN poll: 28-39 % Sanders vs. 61-72% Moderates (11 % missing from graphic so range given).

<|startoftext|>@WalkerRandall7 @JDan488 @AndrewYang @CNN Yes. It was Yang's analysis on what the moderate candidates' plans should/could be moving forward.

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Missing a proven goal scorer; whether that's a quality striker or a quality wing-forward it doesn't appear to matter as evident by Kane &amp; Son.

<|startoftext|>@Arsenegetorix @beanicolas0224 @SpursOfficial #THFC had/have plenty in the MF. They just don't have reliable targets in the front (Kane/Son) or someone that can run in (Son) continuously so that led to opportunities not being created. No way to be creative when targets are missing. One game w/o both so will wait for changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beanicolas0224 @SpursOfficial I saw an article about it. Didn't want to accept that others can't score much.

<|startoftext|>@tunnelrat325 @PalestineMATH @jrleon80 Like @PalestineMATH said, adults do make it complex. Unfortunately, that is the reality &amp; we can't just say that &amp; either hope for the best or simply ignore them. The truth is, even if we convinced 10 % of the population that's still over 180,000,000+ humans to convince. #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tunnelrat325 @PalestineMATH @jrleon80 The concept of UBI is K-12 level but it isn't actually covered so pre-existing knowledge acts as a deterrent. IMHO #YangGang really needs to summarize critical questions, then tackle them one-by-one during the next few years tailored to various socioeconomic &amp; demographic groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spurs_fl üò≠üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tunnelrat325 @PalestineMATH @jrleon80 It's easier to condition humans at a younger age; once we pass the high school age that window narrows sharply. It's a consequence of how our brain functions. The older you get you'll yield based on data/facts but increasingly more adults choose alternative facts over the truths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tunnelrat325 @PalestineMATH @jrleon80 Yup. MSM literally disallowed people getting exposed to Yang's policies. Making it difficult to provide people w/ a chance to learn, think about what UBI really means in their own context. The hardest thing is convincing people that already settled on their background knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalestineMATH @jrleon80 That's the point. There are 200+ million adults w/ a diverse background. You can't use 1-size fit all method. The issues aren't that some method works, it's the fact that everyone learns, processes info differently. We need to view it from that perspective. It's a big bell curve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PalestineMATH @jrleon80 I played piano between 7-15. After 30+ yrs, I can kinda play if I took my time but it's not easy. My wife, a trained pianist, has not much difficulty playing. I feel like most people are like me on the piano, they have K-12 edu but it's not easy to learn things again like UBI. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalestineMATH @jrleon80 The point is education takes time. Hopefully, #YangGang can tailor data for the 'various' kinds of people in the US. The data aspect is more about working on models to explain multiple scenarios. IMHO that will require time to develop similar to learning how to play the piano. üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalestineMATH @jrleon80 Yang did a good job introducing FD. IMO, to understand &amp; research how UBI can work in the US it may take few years to learn. It's the same as choosing college to enter into a field like STEM, business, art, music. The issue is not everyone chooses to learn new things via college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalestineMATH @jrleon80 Of course, we all need way more than just choosing to believe in UBI. Yang's UBI lacks data much like M4A, FJG. The way FD was presented it lacked details for obvious reasons. Yang may not come back for 2024 &amp; someone else may try again but that person will face the same issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrleon80 IMHO we need to approach anew from the non-#YangGang perspective. UBI isn't a plan you can simply accept just because data is the 21st century's oil &amp; automation is accelerating job loss, etc. People need time, education. The $1K figure also will seem random as living costs vary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrleon80 UBI was a double-edged sword for Yang. AY got notoriety for it but it also became his Achilles heel when it came time to convince millions of non-#YangGang people in the US. UBI's learning curve is high &amp; time was not on Yang's side. AY needed more modeling + data to counter. ü§î  https://t.co/BedMW4sH6l<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial That's focusing on winning! It make sense why even after winning trophies things don't work out. That focus needs players that believe.

<|startoftext|>@amyworldhistory IMO it's a scale issue. 200+ Million adults so there will be a lot of disconnects depending on topic &amp; situation. For Iowa &amp; NH, it's about how the voters see @AndrewYang as a likable person vs. an electable politician. Many probably like AY but don't see him as being electable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Koffi51 @ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @FbayareaS The point there was that their policies were implemented via dictatorships. You like dictatorships? The US doesn't have a dictatorship. It's a democratic republic so policies are legislated via elected representatives. That means it'll be difficult to suddenly change something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Koffi51 @ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @FbayareaS Why is comparing size not a valid argument? I agree that UBI has the same issue. That's why #Yang2024 is more realistic as people really need time to research into it more &amp; consider what it means. Even Yang will need to come up w/ much better ways to convince the general public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @Koffi51 @FbayareaS Point isn't that a single-payer sys can't work in the long run; it's believing it'll work in a single presidency. 330+ Million people, healthcare &amp; insurance industries all need time to adjust. China &amp; India could dictate a sudden big change but that's not possible in the US IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @Koffi51 @FbayareaS The scale issue leads to difference in opinions leading to difference in how votes will go at the local levels and in congress. The scale issue is directly linked to freedom of choice and something like BS's M4A will have difficulty passing congress as enough people will say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @Koffi51 @FbayareaS China is a communist country that can just dictate whatever they want. India is also not much different as they are considered a (democratic) dictatorship. Using them just for scale is not something anyone will accept as something that works in a democratic republic like the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsPjax @matthew64055857 @Koffi51 @FbayareaS Saying the US is far more wealthy &amp; powerful doesn't magically make implementing Sanders' M4A a reality or good idea. Also, I don't want to live in India or China so I'm not sure they are good examples to convince anyone; they lack the freedom &amp; opportunities compared to the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthew64055857 @ItsPjax @Koffi51 @FbayareaS Agree w/ this. Scale is not something we can take lightly.

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Son definitely cannot use his right arm, normally. He should come off &amp; get that checked out. I assume it's not good for balancing, etc. #COYS #THFC #AVLTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Weirdly entertaining but rightfully unpleasing (mentally). #COYS #THFC #AVLTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Can't believe there is still more than 35 minutes to play. üò≥üò± #COYS #THFC #AVLTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S I think Son is really injured. Should come off, if possible. IMO they are keeping him on because it's an arm injury and the game is now level again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@o9V095afLpCuSII @SpursOfficial Agree. Son appears to not really swing/use his right arm when running &amp; playing. #COYS #THFC #AVLTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Think Son has an issue w/ his right arm. Watch. #COYS #THFC #AVLTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial I think it really depends on how you were developed as a player as well. Son was a striker at some point, I believe, but he was changed to a wing-forward so the mentality is totally different. Actually, for all 3 wing-forwards, they are going above and beyond at the moment. üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mannythfc @SpursOfficial You gotta do the petition on a website like  https://t.co/sXnc7HP6kD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Agree. Technically, every pen is nerve wrecking. I believe Son said he's really pushing himself to practice for the pens as it is mentally exhausting. I mean we are having issues watching. The players are actually kicking. üò≥üòúü§™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial I have total respect for anyone doing penalties on a regular basis. Son needs to work on his penalties IMO. If you look at how he positions himself, there's a much lower chance you can actually hit it nicely in the other directions (than the left like how he did in the past two).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Astrologic007 @narkeeso @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann @EvelynYang I wished Yang did data/pattern analysis of US politics as much as he did w/ other data that led to his 160+ policies. IMO if that preceded his run as a candidate, perhaps he would've rolled out his policies a bit more polished. But because he did what he did we have #YangGang. üôÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Attacking four great, MF okay, backline solid. Also, I guess, this is in preparation for the CL &amp; the Chelsea games. Hoping for this üëáüèº sooner than later.  https://t.co/fsgMOnagHc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Astrologic007 @narkeeso @AndrewYang Time will be on his side so he can work on the critical responses he &amp; #YangGang have gotten this election cycle &amp; work on them. Especially for #UBI, his healthcare plan (i.e., public option + sys. overhaul), how to pay for the plans &amp; why they make the most sense based on data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narkeeso @Astrologic007 People need time to understand what UBI means in 2020+. It's not a new idea like Yang points out but it's something that's not been implemented widely so there's a learning curve. Plus, Yang's 160+ policies are a lot to take in so #StillVotingYang can be a precursor to #Yang2024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsPjax @FbayareaS Yang did not not like anyone. Sanders is a socialist. Yang is not. Sanders' solns are based on ideology. Yang's solns are based on data, logic. Sanders' adviser Kelton advocates for printing more money to pay for things. That's a double no no. Understand your sentiment, however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyEffa @maggiejuang1 @ClickThatFollow @AndrewYang Dems need a miracle candidate to galvanize a lot of voters in the US to win vs. Trump.

<|startoftext|>@tunnelrat325 @positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang Agree. It varies IMO but, for the most part, GenX likely started their on-line experience w/ the launch of Win 95 via dial-ups; not so great 25 yrs ago. ü§î Twitter would be something that came to us after age 35-something. We have some time so, hopefully, we can figure it out. üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang I'm GenX so we have our work cut out for us. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang Yup. We have multiple years to get the dissemination methods figured out. It will require a multiprong approach where various age groups within #YangGang try their best to target their age (or socioeconomic) groups. IMHO a weakness I saw was the lack of GenX-level support. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang Btw, I can accept that some miners can, in fact, learn to code (w/ time) but that's not a viable solution for most blue-collar workers after a job loss. Also, it's ok to not have data sometimes but, when they're available, it isn't okay to not make policy decisions based on data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang Yup. We've seen Warren admit to not having data; Biden saying miners can learn to use programming languages so we have glimpses of what they know or lack thereof. IMHO ideologies continuously alter the problems to fit them into their agenda rather than applying pragmatic fixes.ü§î  https://t.co/w5A98273z4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r @AndrewYang Personally, I really would like to know what Rep. Sanders really thinks about the 21st century. This is not a rhetorical question. I'm just really genuinely curious as things have changed all around us (technology, jobs, family, etc) except for his 40-yr-old ideology-based ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Digital49r @david_m_goodwin Indeed. Forging political networks starting from the local levels will allow Yang to be considered more seriously than just someone that showed up to the party one cycle. It really would be great for #YangGang to figure out who would align w/ Yang's policies at the local levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@positively1972 @Digital49r Exactly. The dissemination of information over 4 yrs will be critical. The time will also allow #YangGang or even @AndrewYang himself to come up w/ #data-driven rebuttal points. IMHO if AY doesn't end up going into the WH as VP, it may be wise to become a local civil servant. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Digital49r Great! IMO if #Yang2024 is a target, that's 3-4 years available for coming up w/ rebuttal points for policy critiques &amp; misinformation, it might be fruitful to actually work on numerical models of #UBI &amp; the public option healthcare plan. It'll be difficult but not impossible. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArturoForNH @gskmeva1234 Great! IMHO you can team up w/ some #YangGang folks &amp; divide into chapters &amp; write as a team project.

<|startoftext|>@MarkPepin1 @fredlandoy @AndrewYang @AnthonyCoia @EvelynYang @DNC @JoeBiden @ewarren @amyklobuchar Yang policies are not left progressive IMHO.

<|startoftext|>@joshneuman @YangJews @Mike2020 @AndrewYang Odd couple but it will surely entice various types of voters. If Bloomberg actually listens to Yang's data-driven ideas &amp; adopts them (e.g., #UBI, Democracy Dollars), that'll be a very very different option than just having center left vs. progressive (socialist) options. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCormickJohn Center left vs. progressive (socialist). IMHO, a difficult sell later in the general election regardless of who comes out as the nominee.

<|startoftext|>@Sophi23 @AndrewYang @AnthonyCoia @EvelynYang It'll be important for the centrist Dem candidates to figure things out sooner than later &amp; allow voters to decide between a center left candidate vs. a progressive (socialist).

<|startoftext|>@Kwitie @gavinspurs @Lilywhite_Rose @binksy6_ Puzzling. America watches NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB but not MLS (as much).

<|startoftext|>@geezdownunder @knhofseth @ConcordanceNow @SpursOfficial Gunn also did not win the ball. After the ball goes past Gunn. Gunn hits &amp; grabs Son. Image-based evidences are abundant.  https://t.co/YV9ivIGrpZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matthew26006250 @geezdownunder @Jamiedaviisx @ConcordanceNow @SpursOfficial Gunn did not win the ball. The only reason Gunn did not get a red, according to FA Rules Law 12, is because he, at least, attempted to play the ball. If he didn't play the ball but hit/pulled on Son's shorts to deny him, then it would've been a red. Ref.:  https://t.co/k7XsCTQkxQ  https://t.co/xQs0sHaeQn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matthew26006250 @Jamiedaviisx @geezdownunder @ConcordanceNow @SpursOfficial Gunn did hold &amp; pull on Son's shorts. IMO that's why Son had to adjust his vector.  https://t.co/zp2ZyqYkCo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geezdownunder @Jamiedaviisx @Matthew26006250 @ConcordanceNow @SpursOfficial Son's clearly attempting to hurdle over until A. Gunn hits him w/ his hand &amp; also pulls on his pants. Son also plants his left leg &amp; also tries to balance using his right leg here risking injury. Angus also clearly did not win the ball because it went past Gunn good for a tap in.  https://t.co/AQYr3TrmDr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@californalovers @PapiBaig Jay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Macaully_Moffat @SpursOfficial @eToro IMHO Son also just needs to play 30-40 mins a game. That will surely help Spurs win moving forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wardy257 @SpursOfficial There is clear evidence of physical contact made by Gunn on Son. You're just changing the subject. You need to provide clear &amp; obvious evidence for diving. Without it your claims are just vacuous tweets. Cheers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@on_ohio @wandawhatsup @AndrewYang For sure. Wish we had more like Zach Graumann on the team. But, then again, like you said, many candidates were running so how can you initially compete with politicians. These professional staffers obviously look past being on someone's campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_ohio @wandawhatsup @AndrewYang I was thinking in the same lines. It appears AY has staff members that may not match the experiences that the politician staff members may have. Resources lack as well. I may be wrong but AY doesn't seem to have many XGen or older staff w/ experiences that could be crucial now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_ohio @wandawhatsup @AndrewYang Another aspect is, whether AY provides actual numbers or not &amp; uses the words you suggest, IMHO it could be a double-edged sword as he is the #MATH candidate. It's a very difficult situation/decision since he needs to be inexact in order to be pragmatic (if that makes sense). ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_ohio @wandawhatsup @AndrewYang IMO he's being pragmatic. But, like you're saying &amp; looking at how Sanders is getting away w/ not being able to explain how to pay for $6 trillion/y, @AndrewYang may need to reconsider his explanations moving forward involving his healthcare plans: both fixing the sys.+insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wandawhatsup @AndrewYang Is this because although his public option is available for all (to opt into), it is not free &amp; certain people have the option (choice) to keep other (private) insurances? Curious to know the details of what people do not understand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@o9V095afLpCuSII @beanicolas0224 @SpursOfficial Where's this source? It must not be a muscle tear injury but a no-rest-related muscle fatigue of some sort.

<|startoftext|>@KaylaPerrin4 @YGangerz @AndrewYang @GregGutfeldShow @DNC @TheDemocrats IMO it may be that the establishment wants Trump to be reelected.

<|startoftext|>@ftblTxshar @JustLoCelso This is a logical &amp; data-driven point. I agree.

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial IMHO Son's 2015 debut comment means a lot as Bergwijn was a big signing for the #THFC. I believe Son is remembering how it was difficult during his 1st year.

<|startoftext|>@ucragirl @MFOD2010 @RickSpur @jonathandveal83 Agree.

<|startoftext|>@ucragirl @MFOD2010 @RickSpur @jonathandveal83 Agree. The issue wasn't that we lacked forwards. The issue was that, in Kane's or Son's absence, the attacking front was incomplete. Now it's assembled: Bergwijn (LW), Moura (RW), Son (#9), Dele (#10). IMO they can/will rotate, create chances for each other &amp; score w/ pace. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSpur IMHO it's time to move on but I'm sure you look at this üëá &amp; wonder, right? The window is closed.

<|startoftext|>@alaskajer Just having healthcare does not allow you to pay off medical debt, however. The Freedom Dividend is cash that you can use for any purpose. Not everyone has medical debt. What is your point? Your tweet needs more details &amp; clarity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Mourinho may be thinking of the #THFC as a mixture of all previous teams he has won trophies w/ IMO.

<|startoftext|>@AnaKasparian What choice between 'healthcare' vs. 'enough money to eat' is being presented as a policy by @AndrewYang? Your subjective tweet needs logic backed up by data &amp; facts. Also, @AnaKasparian doesn't need to say she likes Yang a lot. Everything before the 'but' doesn't really matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Any forward (winger or striker) as long as the left &amp; the right wings &amp; the #10 position are filled w/ quality. IMO we have that now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daily_Hotspur Son! Bergwijn = left wing. Moura = right wing. Dele = #10. IMO the formation Mourinho envisioned. He tried to use Sess as a wing-forward; it didn't work. He knows putting Son in the front puts a big hole on the left side but that's changed w/ Bergwijn. Expecting rotation as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohannStrottman @CtrldEntropy @GIFShin0bi @AnaKasparian @cenkuygur You should define your 'problems' better than? Provide the details of your issues/problems w/ data &amp; logic.

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S For sure. We have the front 4 we need to succeed like last season: Bergwijn, Son, Moura, Dele.

We need competition coupled w/ #UBI, #VAT, #data-driven problem solving. #MATH #YangWillWin<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Yang promotes the utilization of data &amp; logic: #MATH. #HumanityFirst is to not make vacuous or toxic statements but to understand the issues (via data &amp; logic) to solve them w/ humanity in mind. This is especially important for our kids. Thus, #YangWillWin.  https://t.co/TskUgJ5faA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ineedmorecyber @AndrewYang I was thinking that as well. A lot of his older tweets around this time in 2019 don't have the likes/retweets like how he has in 2020.

<|startoftext|>@ATellerOfTruth @Shaz_If @AndrewYang @TIME For sure. Twitter now has reporting tweets incorporating political misinformation. It's a bit restrictive w/ good reason IMO.

<|startoftext|>@Shaz_If @AndrewYang @TIME Here is my suggestion, #YangGang.  https://t.co/eAZcxFAFeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S We need this game plan. 3 wingers + 3 MFs will beat 1 MF + 5 strikers, anytime. I think...yeah...no...yeah...ü§î #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@californalovers Agree. We need to update the incentives. Another aspect is that there are still numerous diseases that are affecting many lives around the world that are not in the R&amp;D radar of big pharmaceutical companies. If the market is small, why would these companies invest? #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S That's good also. He definitely is more central MF &amp; can play on the right side as well. Interesting. Mourinho must have something in his mind when he sent KWP to SOU. One Danish gone. One Danish potentially entering. So much interaction w/ the Saints in recent weeks. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Mourinho appears to not say things randomly, IMO. Or, is this random?  https://t.co/cFVeHf9eaf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mannythfc @NLIW2 @Daily_Hotspur @standardsport Didn't he get some chances? He looks a bit skimpy IMO. It's easy for fans to say put him in but, if it was one of my kids - not that different in age actually, I wouldn't want to risk the lad losing confidence. That's the main reason even senior players lose form during a season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSpur @SkySports Is that why KWP was sent on loan? I guess there is a reason Mourinho said they had 4-5 strikers in the squad. Quite random, however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSpur @standardsport The front attacking 4 lacks another critical piece. Option 1: An above-average traditional striker will allow the formation from the 1st few (winning) Mourinho games. Option 2: Another Son/Moura/Bergwijn-level wing-forward; this will allow rotation-based fast-paced attacks. #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NAVLINY93 @nytimes True. The US is not the same as it used to be once people started making vacuous comments (like your tweet) available online IMHO.

<|startoftext|>@FullFrontalSamB @HumanityForYang @AndrewYang Quite interesting. The #YangGang in Iowa supporting @AndrewYang, for example, via canvassing, holding campaign signs in the background at events, and others that are phone-banking, YouTubing, &amp; doing various off-line &amp; on-line supporting are heroes! #MATH  https://t.co/m0dcBBGcQr  https://t.co/6TLmTKqHGb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur If these comments are, in fact, true &amp; they are not just a formality, then he really was out of it for a very good reason for not wanting/needing to play for the #THFC anymore. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperHotspursfc @Donaldwinston15 @madamadadane6 @SpursOfficial @LoCelsoGiovani üëç Top 4~! #COYS IMHO the starting XI is just out of wack overall as key (quality) players are critically missing. This is probably why we are seeing &amp; noticing negative situations on the pitch more. But, w/ new fresh &amp; quality players signing, hopefully, #THFC improves form. üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoaphMeat @californalovers Same. üò≠ Thisüëá really makes me think about my children. As a parent, it's so relevant; yet it's not really a tangible thing.

<|startoftext|>@YangDailyCast @GIFShin0bi @happysinger23 @FoxNewsSunday @AndrewYang AY, trying to sell the FD; BS, doing that w/ M4A, FJG, free college, college debt cancellation, etc. They are 'single source' gov't funded.

<|startoftext|>@SuperHotspursfc @Donaldwinston15 @madamadadane6 @SpursOfficial @LoCelsoGiovani Who's angry? Just responding to vacuous statements void of logic &amp; data.

<|startoftext|>@YangDailyCast @GIFShin0bi @FoxNewsSunday No one can predict the future. Providing predictions, sure. AY knows this; he's being smart &amp; not providing #'s for his healthcare plan.

<|startoftext|>@RobertSargeant1 @SpursOfficial @LoCelsoGiovani Agree.  Defense needs an upgrade. Plus, the #THFC needs to double up on the player quality during the next few windows. Looking at what Mourinho is doing, with these five healthy, 5-6 more quality new players will definitely make things easier for the team. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperHotspursfc @Donaldwinston15 @madamadadane6 @SpursOfficial @LoCelsoGiovani Yes, that's why we keep records of player assists and second assists, so people know who's contributing to the team sport of football/soccer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GabCurse @AndrewYang @BernieSanders That's the question we should ask Rep. Sanders. What changed? Why will it work now and not bankrupt the US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantJanuary02 @coolmyeyes @richardiporter @DMRegister @ewarren Rep. Sanders can't explain how he will pay for his key plans that include free healthcare, free college, college debt cancellation, etc. $60 Trillion for 10 years. He literally said he cannot explain how to pay for it. #MATH  https://t.co/ixpsgnSyvD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClickThatFollow @FBunnyface @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @AndrewYang If $1 trillion is pure fantasy, why is anyone even thinking $6 trillion per year is something they can even attempt to explain. Rep. Sander said this: "We would bankrupt the nation" via #MATH he did in the past. $6 Trillion is $30k/person from 200 million.  https://t.co/jQGuzrNgEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantJanuary02 @coolmyeyes @richardiporter @DMRegister @ewarren Clinton's endorsement vs. Warren's endorsement: What's the real difference?

<|startoftext|>@DMRegister @ewarren Endorsement: Clinton has knowledge, experience, 1/23/16. "By that measure, Democrats have one outstanding candidate deserving of their support: Hillary Clinton.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang The @DMRegister thinks it's too radical.

<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs They both played in S√£o Paulo F.C. in 2012. Moura congratulated the club and said he is grateful &amp; will carry forever in his heart.

<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller @BernieSanders "$60 Trillion over 10 years." Rep. Bernie Sander doesn't know where the funds are coming from.   @AndrewYang's #FreedomDividend is for ALL.

<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Looküëá how tired Son is after the #SOUTOT game, Levy. I know you are happy w/ the replay as ticket sales mean more money. Please invest more so the #THFC has depth.

<|startoftext|>@MarkGra90619749 @SpursSavva This only provides rationale for how the squad has no depth. It's crazy how some of these players are playing so much on the pitch &amp; all over. Look at the top clubs positioned high, their XI + bench are packed w/ quality so they rotate. #THFC barely has the XI filled. Invest now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danqdao @AndrewYang  https://t.co/uaOnipsEB8 Ôøº (80's &amp;) 90's were the days. Way better songs than now IMO. But, we can probably make better music videos using our smartphones or devices at home now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_bohlig @Trumper4Yang @AndrewYang @ChrisBeFresh2 @ewarren @joerogan @nerdsforyang It would be awesome, if @nerdsforyang can get &amp; interview multiple former Trump supporters including @Trumper4Yang.

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva 2 = Strikers (Maybe one of them wing forward) 3 = CDM + MF players 3 = RB + backline players One of them each this window, like you suggest. More in the next two windows. 8 Players to make the starting XI &amp; the bench wholesome &amp; topped out (not averaged out). #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/fZ1FZxWCZG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur Levy got his wish of a draw. Home game, ticket sales, revenue generation. But, it's still unclear if that extra money will help the #THFC get a striker, a MF player, &amp; some defensive players. ü§î We need 8 IMO to double up on positions! #SOUTOT #COYS #FACup  https://t.co/MVBKFfKGM7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomR555 @SpursSavva IMO all of them would want to leave even the wingers Son &amp; Moura. Both are covering so much more ground than the wingers in other top teams that have all positions filled &amp; the bench topped out. It's a tragedy what the players &amp; the fans are going through. Levy needs to invest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva @TTlads @batsyface @Neilo1986 The entire team seems to be out of it mentally &amp; that translates to lost form &amp; decreased stamina. It was showing at the end w/ some of them looking tired. We need some of the missing parts filled so players don't need to cover more than one position/area at a time IMO. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S @paulyboym1 IMO fans that throw vehement &amp; vacuous comments void of logic &amp; data are passionate but not able to really appreciate the game &amp; the situation the #THFC players are in. It's a team sport &amp;, right now, the Spurs have missing parts; it's amazing how it didn't implode, yet. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Wonder when it will be. Son especially looked tired. At least the next league game is 02/02/2020. Then, two week later is another PL game. Perhaps, both teams #SOUTOT were just looking for a draw to have that extra game in the two-week window. IDK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mannythfc Agree with the analyses. Levy is smiling at this result IMO. He's getting more money so maybe a striker can be signed within the next 24 months. Haha.  https://t.co/mjYOdUooHt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva On the positive side, Levy will get some new revenue generated w/ the extra home game. ü§î More funds to buy a striker next window or next year, IMO.  https://t.co/L2k1jqdjWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Well, Levy will be super happy now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Well, this guy üëá is super happy w/ this draw. The #THFC will now be closer to getting someone signed w/ all the new revenue he's about to generate. Will it though? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/eUSTOGPmyg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Understand. It's been a bit difficult to watch. Think many of them are tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Well, now they scored. Hopefully, it wakes them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Yeah. That was a good shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S This shows how commenting on individual player performances IMHO can be pretty divisive more than helping in any way when it's void of data &amp; tactical discussions. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Kinda boring. If we scored a few more, it would have been way more interesting. Both teams are not really good in the middle as well as w/ the finishes today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Let's just hope Son, Moura, Dele keep assisting &amp; scoring. Lo Celso is really playing well. A real bright spot IMO. You mentioned you don't particularly like this Son ad but it's good silly fun. Cheers. #COYS  https://t.co/y3i6fkge9a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva The attacking 4 (minus Kane) really need their confidence back. Lo Celso really is a good player. It's so nice that he's performing as Eriksen is leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S They need their mental confidence back after winning this #SOUTOT game. And, we need a striker or some signing to be done. That IMO can build confidence in an indirect way since the club is spending to support them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Goal~!!! #SOUTOT  https://t.co/N0SFTTP3dN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Goal~!!!!!  https://t.co/JZvJ6dJg2l<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S All #THFC fans are it &amp; along for the ride. What's happening to this #SOUTOT game Very boring, now. A long long journey awaits us!  https://t.co/hSbznVQQIw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S IMHO this is a team sport. You need the XI all doing well to dominate the opponent. We can't do that for obvious reasons that parts are critically missing. Even the commentator was saying Levy will go down to the last hour to finish a deal. LOL. Maybe we need invisible targetsüëá.  https://t.co/1RtspOPvZR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Yes, we need a traditional striker. IMHO having that missing piece will also help the two wingers &amp; the #10 to score &amp; assist like how they did in the 1st few Mourinho games. They're mentally out of it a bit. 1 Wk left to get 'one' striker. Hope Levy doesn't mess that up. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S The #THFC are currently operating without all the necessary parts in the starting XI as well as the bench. It's crazy we are still able to have hope. Looking at the PL table, it seems all teams outside of the top 3 are having a pretty rough season, TBH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S Yes, we need depth. But, not necessarily for competition purposes but so we don't have to rely on them all the time. More importantly we need few traditional strikers at their level. I mean they are winger/forward/MF that also attack &amp; defend. We need more like them for depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_O_Y_S IMHO the front three (Dele, Son, Moura) are mentally out of it a bit as they know someone has to fill in as the traditional front man like Kane but Mourinho sure doesn't give them confidence by saying #THFC doesn't have the personnel. I know he's trying to play Levy but still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoumouCouscous Thank you for your vacuous comments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gloryglorythfc1 @SpursSavva It's easy to understand. It's run like a business of making money &amp; not for generating football trophies. Crazy that not a single traditional striker is in the starting XI &amp; the bench, yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Broggybroggs @SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Mourinho may be molding him to team up w/ Son on the left. He's young so he can adapt better than older players, at least in theory. If it works Son will play more as a wing forward than wing back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trumper4Yang @AndrewYang @ChrisBeFresh2 @ewarren @joerogan Important.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial Makes sense. Son &amp; Kane are frankly getting wasted in a club that's all about revenue generation than winning trophies. It's getting somewhat boring. At some point both players should leave the club if Levy doesn't invest. It's only right. Also fans are tire &amp; divided on Twitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats01 @ZelleyZel @LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz @YLena40 Totally agree. I think we were talking about why @AndrewYang should or shouldn't utilize his cultural (ethnic) background.

<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats01 @ZelleyZel @LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz @YLena40 Thanks for sharing. I only know of #4 being disliked due to the Chinese character #4 vs. death.

<|startoftext|>@ZelleyZel @LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz @MotherOfCats01 @YLena40 Yup. That's why I suggested it's #HumanityFirst to use data correctly.

<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats01 @ZelleyZel @LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz @YLena40 Yes. That's technically the point. You got it. That's why I was mentioning it's kind of like #YangMediaBlackout.

<|startoftext|>@ZelleyZel @LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz No. 48+ Asian nations exist. Saying Asian countries like 8 is just misleading IMHO. That's what I'm talking about.

<|startoftext|>@LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz Are you serious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz Okay, so it's a Chinese thing not Asia as a whole. That makes sense. Let's not conflate Asian nations together like this. It's not a #HumanityFirst approach to ignore other nations in Asia. I've seen posts that discuss how AY has failed to reach out to other As. Am. communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realpeterz @LuiiSupaFly What does that have to do w/ Asians liking # 8? Let @LuiiSupaFly answer. Also, what humanity needs is a mixture of gases that is made up of 21 % O2 &amp; 78 % N2 (air). üôÇ Simply having the element O many not be good as oxidative stress can alter/damage organic &amp; inorganic materials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuiiSupaFly @realpeterz Why is 8 a lucky # for Asians? There are 40+ Asian nations, diverse in culture. Number 8 is a lucky # for all of them? Not a rhetorical question.

<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @BuchananBiff @SpursSavva Son because he helps defend as an attacker. Traor√© does not &amp; that's why the Wolves lost to Spurs last time. See the video data. He walks away. Vertonghen scores. #THFC wins.  https://t.co/2WSwS8Z090<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Is this what being a human is like in the digital age? ü§î I mean does it matter even if there was an agenda? It's Twitter, podcasts, etc. At the end of the day, does it really matter what happens to a sports club &amp; its players in the grand scheme of life. Just entertainment IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva @TayoMello @MCWWIII @Daniely79 @SpursNews1961 @rosy316 IMHO when we tweet online, it's void of face-fo-face convos. Isn't that why you mention to people to come to talk w/ you off-line like how humans did before the Internet? ü§î Hopefully, we get transfers done so whether it's Kane or Son they can score &amp; not have to defend as much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva @TayoMello @MCWWIII @Daniely79 @SpursNews1961 @rosy316 This is a difference in opinions &amp; a lot of it is frustration-based. #THFC could be doing better had there been investment into players in the past few years.

<|startoftext|>@HotspurRelated what we were missing in the middle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayoMello @SpursOfficial @premierleague Agree. No striker, #THFC will struggle. We have 2 really good wingers (Son, Moura). Seems like Lo Celso is coming along. Also, Alli, Lamera, Fernandes, Ndombele, Winks options look okay. I'm okay w/ the commercial. It's funky good; Son's having fun. He (we) needed a goal or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @premierleague This win feeling like the Son Super Cone commercial. ü§£ We are happy Son scored a goal (a header LOL) &amp; that we got all 3 pts regardless of how funky it was! #COYS #THFC  https://t.co/mkWTWogUPz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Svse4Y @emilyngo @NBCNews @AndrewYang IMO Asian Americans should just accept that they can do whatever they want whether they fit the stereotypical As. Am. character or not. That's the real important aspect of @AndrewYang running for the presidency; just be true to yourself &amp; show what you are. The freedom is there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva @theboyrickyg @CarnoustieC @EdStress @bh_suggs IMHO it's a perspective issue. Son's not from a traditional elite football nation like England, Germany, Brazil, Argentina. I mean I'd have a harsher opinion on an English player playing in the NFL or MLB. Dempsey faced similar issues being from the US. ü§î  https://t.co/QSLVxMaGGU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva @theboyrickyg @CarnoustieC @EdStress @bh_suggs IMO w/ the backline being so üí©, Son plays defense a lot on the left so he's not able to contribute much as an attacker (scoring) at the moment. Probably a similar situation for Ginola being called lazy. The team he played in likely didn't inspire him. Stat-wise son's far ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Same. IMO Pukki carries the team at Norwich so I'd think they will never really entertain it during this season since they just came back &amp; it looks like they might go back down again. But, if they do get relegated again in the end, maybe they'll consider selling him &amp; rebuild.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkCgod1 @SpursSavva Understand your frustration. Comcast (which owns NBC and Sky Sports) sucks in this aspect. This is why there should never be a monopoly of any service in a competitive free market. They make money off of splitting up broadcasts over cable &amp; other streaming services. It sucks. üò°<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva 4-1 Son, Moura, Lamela, Dele Pukki  Why isn't Pukki a target for a transfer, btw. Too, expensive? Too, old?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkCgod1 @SpursSavva Regular cable programming doesn't have it. It's accessible via NBC Gold access for PL. They had to rub it in by saying #THFC is winless in 4 games. üòë  Anyway, I'm just not sure if Sky coverage involving pundits are available.

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Okay. Thank you for sharing. Those are some comments. Wish I saw his face when he said ar...se...nal...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva What did he say? Sky is not in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartmlongley @SpursSavva IMO this articleüëá sums up a lot of things related to Ginola. It also highlights how Spurs were mid-table back then &amp; how fans from that era have their reasons. Quote: "... Ginola was all that kept the White Hart Lane faithful coming back each week." #COYS  https://t.co/N7U4OEj2IM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Yup. Just saying, people will look up stats, compare. I was going to say they served somewhat different purposes on the field. Also, it's sometimes difficult to compare players directly for this reason across different eras because the style of plays across the league evolves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Assuming people are going by the statistics. Son has 47 goals over 148 games for Spurs; 1 goal per 3 games. Ginola has 13 goals over 100 games Spurs, 6 goals over 58 games for New Castle; 1 goal per 10 games.  https://t.co/FLLaCsFkhX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rbholben @ingajj21 @Andrew_merci360 @pomoza From what he wrote down, his dissertation will be on Japanese rap music. Once he finishes &amp; deposits, we can request it via ProQuest.  https://t.co/c4HzGQSbKh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang @AndrewYang sure isn't old politics. Powerpoint. Pragmatic &amp; forward-thinking policies for the people including our kids. We'll be all right. #YangGang Donate:  https://t.co/cfHmth5lHa  https://t.co/2FUF9hiJPe  https://t.co/ps4SiiPStN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzraGay69 @DavidJinSooKim @IlhanMN @BernieSanders @AndrewYang Forward-thinking policies. 160+ of them. Like this one.  https://t.co/TjhVXMoOfY  https://t.co/wzHHMPuARp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialAdaption @vicenews IMO there are many issues to the specifics he is using, but two stand out. 1st, he's only using Japan as an example. Japan doesn't represent Asia but, in fact, committed war crimes. 2nd, he's using select examples without statistics (#data) but generalizes. Look at the title. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialAdaption @vicenews  https://t.co/950HN1vUsA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZombieweeklyJP @vicenews @vicenews praised North Korea? For what &amp; when? Who wrote it? They are just making these videos to make $$$ off of sensationalism. Insane. Irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insightinsound @vicenews  https://t.co/950HN1vUsA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaniTjPizza @vicenews Dex majored English in college. He did not go to journalism school. He's also working on his Ph.D. on Japanese rap music. He is a correspondent on this show, which obviously does not require journalistic integrity IMHO.  https://t.co/nJibKLekDL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BackstreetLamb @cbstrohl @vicenews The video only uses Japan as an example. Japan is a country not the entirety of Asia. Very irresponsible &amp; dangerous opinion piece. Not sure what the editors or the executive producers were thinking. Propaganda material. Even Japan is reporting it as 'Japan-loving'. LOL.  https://t.co/64Mt8UBSDz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanuckSunny @vicenews He's lived in Japan for few yrs. He's working on a doctorate degree on Japanese rap music. He knows some aspects of Japan so he used Japan as the only example but frame it as being the entirety of Asia. Very dangerous, irresponsible. IMO Asians may have a legal premise to sue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenews I'd like to see @dexdigi, @AndrewYang, &amp; @karenhunter debate the contents of this propaganda video Dex made. First off, how many is 'a lot'? #Data? Second, this video covers only Japan; last time I checked Japan is one nation &amp; it does not represent Asia.  https://t.co/jsbi8TwMVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiSteveKim @BenBeard6819921 He's not a thought leader. He's a correspondent on an HBO show. He's opportunistic &amp; he has a platform; he knows how to push his view points IMHO. This video is #data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lichen420 @BenBeard6819921 #HumanityFirst. 1 Factor to consider is that he did not major in journalism. He got a bachelor's in English, fyi. I do agree that this video is more propaganda, fueling conflicts. IMO (intended or not) it attempts to pit culture against culture. Dangerous.  https://t.co/izeoTkVWdM  https://t.co/tIRlhnhPTs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiSteveKim @BenBeard6819921 He's still a Ph.D. graduate student who also works as a correspondent on an HBO show. He's IMO enrolled as a part-time graduate student registering (paying tuition) for dissertation research work (writing). Wonder who's on his committee. He majored English in college, btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaceyJean18 @PapiBaig @AndrewYang A lot of it stems from the inability and/or disinterest in learning new concepts &amp; ideas. It's easier to deny &amp; stick to what you know best. It's not always the person's fault (as they may be busy or preoccupied) but, in many cases, unfortunately, they are the source of rigidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenews @AndrewYang The Interviewers = Yin (Èò¥, Èô∞) @AndrewYang = Yang (Èò≥, ÈôΩ) All works out in the end. #YangGang  https://t.co/o8q7pcylp4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraEnki @yellowmangood Doubt she wrote that herself. IMO all of the staff writers (regardless of the campaign) will look at what's best out there, which right now is what @AndrewYang puts out. He's the gold standard of how to connect w/ the people via fresh ideas &amp; new vision. #YangGang  https://t.co/enWTL1P8QC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustYangIt The Berners have Yin covered, IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@voo_me @ingajj21 @Andrew_merci360 @pomoza It will be about Japanese rap music. His career on HBO seems to be going well. His view of Asia is skewed, however, as he spent a few years in Japan. He's been exposed to the imperialistic views of Japan from Japan's perspective &amp; it shows in thisüëá video.  https://t.co/hEScUc6pda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhuongTruong @ingajj21 @Andrew_merci360 @pomoza It's on Japanese rap music. He lived in Japan for a few years so IMHO he believes he is an expert about Asian culture. This video üëá shows theories &amp; ideas that are based on 'subjective' interpretations &amp; it seems irresponsible to compile them like this.  https://t.co/hEScUc6pda  https://t.co/2f48M93FWJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pomoza @voo_me @ingajj21 @Andrew_merci360 Dexter Thomas, according to his bio, lived in Japan for a few years. His dissertation will be on Japanese rap music.

<|startoftext|>@prosperitypls @ingajj21 @Andrew_merci360 @pomoza LAT hired DT to cover (quote) Black Twitter in 2015, he left in 2016.

<|startoftext|>@TyrenePamstein Thank you, @TyrenePamstein. You are awesome for doing this for @AndrewYang's campaign success~!  https://t.co/RbytBp8gT2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulee @AndrewYang IMHO  Capitalism: Promotes competition via free-markets. It tends to reward winners disproportionately, however.  Socialism: Centralizes wealth then redistributes. Theoretically, no winners (all winners). Practically, some control all.  @AndrewYang: Pragmatism + #HumanityFirst~!!  https://t.co/zYXmgjNhux<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBaty @CapYangtastic @NYCNavid @TheView IMO that's close proximity waving. Quoting BS from the #RealTime clip: "This is exactly what we deal with in the US congress which is why it's a dysfunctional institution." This video is from 2013! What's changed? Are politicians ideal to lead if all they do is confront? üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zohreen @AndrewYang @rachelvscott Good insight! This technically is exactly what I was talking about after seeing Rep. Sanders wave away Tom Steyer. Thank you very much, Zohreen, for sharing. I'm happy to have seen/heard this kind of unscripted positive side of @AndrewYang. Cheers~!  https://t.co/go46pKynXA  https://t.co/6LmO1IEIAt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iAmTCAB @sam_vallely Feel like there should be cameras following all candidates at 'public' events so that we can see how they act on/off the camera. It will show us a lot about someone's character for sure. I mean it's not like they are being selected to endorse a candidate. They are the candidates!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidaxelrod @MapleLeaf4Yang If I had to choose just ONE candidate, it would be @AndrewYang.  https://t.co/hCMkaxszQL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogueSocialWrkr @AndrewYang Great! Thank you, Jin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenEnglerBeer @simply_a_sheep @scottsantens @nytopinion @amyklobuchar @SenWarren Someone's supporters will surely see this NYT's endorsement &amp; crossover to cast a vote for @TheDemocrats. Why can't the establishment &amp; those in the media (tied to the DNC oneway or another), see that crossover support is critical in the general election?  https://t.co/I2hvBP68ES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottsantens @AndrewYang Like this tweet by @scottsantens &amp; agree! Ideology couldn't solve poverty or any situation that disallowed citizens to move forward as they altered the problems &amp; the solutions. The #FreedomDividend is not left, not right, but forward! #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/gOaTugLcvM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AarikaSamone @WDobetter @karenhunter @AndrewYang Awesome! Yes! @karenhunter!  https://t.co/TxQja1udlv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Dr. King supported universal basic income. Bernice King (MLK's daughter) posted this üëá few days ago as a reminder. @AndrewYang continuously talks about UBI (calls it the #FreedomDividend) as a flagship proposal! #HumanityFirst via #UBI is a path forward!  https://t.co/N9SXOtzIH8  https://t.co/KiMvXsJioY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidktian Depends on the situation &amp; who. After accumulated #data of manipulation &amp; narcissistic behavior you naturally try to avoid contact (confrontation). I've yet to meet anyone that also has a severe personality disorder. Not sure if I can tell nor can I ask if they've been diagnosed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama @BarackObama, Dr. King spoke of &amp; supported universal basic income. Bernice King (MLK's daughter) posted this üëá few days ago as a reminder. Do you know who continuously talks about UBI &amp; has it as a flagship proposal? @AndrewYang! #HumanityFirst via #UBI!  https://t.co/hrP6CKYryu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gang4610 @berniesbrewcrew @RossBarkan @AndrewYang Also thisüëá. It highlights how NYT editors are not different than the establishment, DNC, career politicians, etc stuck in the 20th century. When a group of people insist on something out of self-interest w/o check &amp; balances they tend to become morons. ü§î  https://t.co/oIrSZdmzX3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tigerrrrrrrrrx @JustYangIt @JoshTho08210011 @M1cha31Patr1ck @thetinytrain @AndrewYang Converting socialists is difficult compared to conservatives. The former wants to over throw, the latter wants logical improvements. IMO socialists know they will never convert so they apply the same logic to others. It's not absolute but this üëá exists.  https://t.co/ok6rY2Mvrt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytopinion @ReallySerioso @CharlesMBlow @AndrewYang This is 5+ months old. IMO it shows why the NYT editors couldn't endorse @AndrewYang. AY's forward-thinking approaches allow him to promote 21st cent. solutions while the editors much like the other candidates are stuck in the 20th cent. mindset. #YangGang  https://t.co/43taJ36JDx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaPerrin4 Viewership increase leads to financial security. For coup d'etat to work: quote, "As a key to success, groups attempting coups typically seek to gain the support of all or parts of the country‚Äôs armed forces, the police, and other military elements."  https://t.co/GC3UsLdkiE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeaSongbird @AndrewYang @nytimes The endorsement trend may repeat like this üëá. And, if that happens, the other key result from 2016 will repeat as well. We need forward-thinking @AndrewYang. Not any of the career politicians that essentially lack the crossover supports to win. #YangGang  https://t.co/oIrSZdmzX3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeaSongbird @AndrewYang @nytimes Not surprised, not disappointed. Just opinions that IMO got formulated with $ in mind &amp; self-interest. NYT is a business. It is after all a finite # of editors. Also, IMHO this will really matter if they disclosed all current/past ties to the establishment, DNC, &amp; the candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AarikaSamone @MMarcusanu @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann üëçüëèüôè Please stay warm &amp; safe~!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@z3r09er @AndrewYang I'm thrilled for sure. I also wasn't sure if his picks have been jinxing or not. ü§™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Public_Citizen @yangismypotus Wonder how @AndrewYang feels about this üëá. His policies include term limits &amp; Democracy Dollars.

<|startoftext|>@poe13231 @AndrewYang @PizzaRanch Okay. Thanks for the info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Ranked choice voting, yes~! Also, talk more about how 'term limits (for congress)' will contribute to our democracy. There are countering arguments &amp; I don't doubt you have considered them so please discuss whenever possible. #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang @PizzaRanch If I ever visit Iowa, I will try @PizzaRanch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Great! @AndrewYang, later when you are w/ Evelyn &amp; you both have time, please view @TheDailyShow's recent coverage of you üëá, if you have not done so, yet. Cheers! #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/9QukoEjdQ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Need more players.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PriscillaAlmada @AndrewYang Thank you for endorsing @AndrewYang!

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva We need a striker. This young lad would've been nice, experienced or not. He's tall, big, scored a ton in the Austrian Bundesliga. Even getting Llorente back on a loan.

<|startoftext|>@AiAristotle @peterboghossian At least for me, outsider or not I don't support Rep. Sanders' socialistic policies. Policies are important not the status of being insider or outsider. And, frankly, solving issues is more important than ideology since ideology never solves real problems they just alter them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathrynacullen @peterboghossian Same. It does a fairly useful &amp; important job in terms of sorting out where you stand on key policies. It would help even more if they silenced the candidate info till the end IMO. That can help people really find out if they truly align w/ whomever they are supporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Agree w/ @AndrewYang, 95 %. All others at 50 % or below. Top 6 questions: Wealth tax, carbon tax, healthcare related (two Q's), universal basic income, nuclear energy. #YangGang, try this out~! #HumanityFirst #MATH #Yang2020  https://t.co/qfXbj789Pz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @supazoomzoom @AndrewYang @RealTimers @billmaher IMO we notice ones that voice their opinions more but, if you look closer, there are many that stay quiet &amp; get stuff done. That's AY I think. They all have the ability to do things in their own right but the ones that stay quieter go unnoticed; that is until AY &amp; #HumanityFirst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Portlandval @supazoomzoom @AndrewYang @RealTimers @billmaher @AndrewYang is breaking stereotypes often linked to adv. degree or high-name-value school degree holders. IMO if someone saw AY's r√©sum√©, House MD (smart but flawed) probably comes to mind. Not always. Many are eloquent, knowledgeable but also personable, polite, humble like AY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LikesLurking @MarkCavitt @ACLU @AndrewYang @ewarren @PeteButtigieg @BernieSanders This was discussed in a similar manner about a month ago. The mailer does not fully capture how the candidates answered in the questionnaire.  https://t.co/c82u4esqvb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachandMattShow @ACLU This was discussed in Dec. It turned out candidates were asked to do questionnaires üëá.

<|startoftext|>Socialism centralizes wealth &amp; the gov't redistributes them to the people. IMO, Rep.

<|startoftext|>@high_fades @SpursSavva We need something like the DESK line again. #THFC lacks this now. We've seen few games w/ Kane w/o Son &amp; vice versa. These attackers need an attacking front 4 that can feed off of each other. Kane, Son both go silent in some games but that's due to formation issues. Need depth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva IMO this is what #THFC up top sees: Player 1 ... made money Player 2 ... will make money Player 3, 4 ... older, cheaper, still can play Player 5, 6 ... made money; need to sell Player 7 ... will make money; got new MFs Player 8 ... will make big money (trophy or not); got options<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Super brave, Evelyn Yang! Wasn't expecting the last part of the cited video but it's important for survivors to know that violent acts need to be reported &amp; dealt with.

<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics @AndrewYang Very inspiring~! I hope people see what I see. A brave person that inspires by collaborating with her family. Thank you for the #HumanityFirst msg &amp; action!  https://t.co/aJmkC6A7Od<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mang_spider @FabianTijero @Elzy52643422 IMO another reason is that experienced workers cost more so, for budgetary reasons, companies will try to hire new personnel as a cost saving measure &amp; the cycle continues. More reasons for people to become less loyal to the company they work for &amp; why many feel underappreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGGuitartuition @billynats @EffectJose @RickSpur On the bright side, he's above average using the left.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang @RealTimers @billmaher @AndrewYang &amp; @billmaher had fun on @RealTimers! It was great! Thank you Bill~!

<|startoftext|>@BraveNewtWorld @yang_hologram Illogical to stop supporting the #HumanityFirst ideas of @AndrewYang via poll results. Polls are stats w/ error associated.

<|startoftext|>@PoppaSaint @Daily_Hotspur @SpursOfficial @WilliamHill @JTanganga99 Hope this experiment turns into Tanganga holding the fort in the left back position so Son can finally play as a wing forward than a wing back. Tanganga, we need~! Good luck~! #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClickThatFollow @RadWavvez @EddieGriffinCom @BernieSanders @AndrewYang @AOC BS &amp; AY: A pragmatic middle grown solution will be difficult to achieve. Like you pointed out, they are very different in policies. Either 1 of them will need to fully accept the other's policies or both need to meet the other half way. I won't say never but it's hard to imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClickThatFollow @RadWavvez @EddieGriffinCom @BernieSanders @AndrewYang @AOC ü§î IMO Communist Party Centered Capitalism. In the process of economic development some people got rich but that can be taken away in an instant. They frequently abduct people. There was the actress Fan Bingbing but also foreigners. See the article below.  https://t.co/clunCdqGFr  https://t.co/VmTicCv4Ab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClickThatFollow @RadWavvez @EddieGriffinCom @BernieSanders @AndrewYang @AOC They could make a good team as long as a socialist &amp; a capitalist can agree on policies. IMO if they did, won't that be like China? A communist nation allowing capitalism to grow their economy but w/ super-sized gov't control &amp; no human rights. I favor freedom + #HumanityFirst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaBashCNN @AndrewYang This üëá is why you need to be very brave IMO. The level of attention this will garner is significant.

<|startoftext|>@_AngryMax @CrazianMuch @Yang2020_NJ @AA_GeminiMoon @NomikiKonst @ingajj21 @AndrewYang The illogical thing: BS supporters not realizing AY will support whoever the Dem nominee is, if it's not him.

<|startoftext|>@AmericaLee @ingajj21 I clearly said IMO, 'In my opinion'. I hope you realize tweets are opinions (unless evidence is provided) especially when IMO is used.

<|startoftext|>@AmericaLee @ingajj21 I don't, obviously. It would be great to find out what both parties did so we can evaluate &amp; assess what happened. I'm for transparency.

<|startoftext|>@PR4GM47IC @AndrewYang Why? That's how grammar works. Off- &amp; on-line means off-line and on-line. Twitter has limited characters but that doesn't mean that grammar's out the door. Please explain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ingajj21 It goes to show that, when making political decisions, you should not be influenced by $ or biased opinions, which IMO is what Milano did. You need to carefully gather information, inquire all parties/situations (as much as possible), seek advice, evaluate the data, take action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachandMattShow @ingajj21 Good, they lined up @AndrewYang in the middle at 10 pm ET (Tue.) which IMO is perfect since kids will (most likely) be sleeping or you are ready to start the late night routines.

<|startoftext|>@Evan_Low @BrianL64 @AndrewYang How much money does he need for the campaign in the month of January 2020?

<|startoftext|>@cyrribrae @wowbender @esaagar This üëá illustrates how being fair on assessments can allow your voice (in this case @AndrewYang) to be heard.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Agree! The debate absence (+ the new endorsements &amp; media appearances) made things positive.

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VisurantViz @AndrewYang Data-driven approach. This allows objective decision making possible but it also allows outliers to be not ignored completely.

<|startoftext|>@azina Socialistic views are not considered mainstream when we live in a 'free &amp; competitive market-promoting' developed nation.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Does it matter? Donations continue to come in. People canvass &amp; yang off- &amp; on-line for you. Various endorsements &amp; media appearances.

<|startoftext|>@fOrGiVeNcHy @dylvaz Both of them have a lot more to talk about but will they talk? The divide this will create between the two supporting groups will be significant.

<|startoftext|>@yangoshop @cleemonsta @WhoopiGoldberg @TheView IMO, for Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, the term 'shareholders' is pretty much set as 'investors' of big $$$ so he's not forward-thinking enough to see everyday citizens as being a small 'shareholder'. #AmericaNeedsAndrewYang who's a forward-thinking GenX~!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva IMO people should practice on Twitter what they do off-line. If you don't align w/ someone style-wise, just stop engaging them via convos. Unless it's based on fakenews, I prefer direct, honest opinions but it's my decision to accept or reject them. Afterward, you move on. Next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vinnie37540118 @ZachandMattShow @AndrewYang Hmmm. Not sure who but I'm sure MSM will surely pick their favorites after the Iowa caucus since they need to angle things just right (vs. Trump) so people tune in as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachMontellaro @AndrewYang Are @AndrewYang's msgs too forward-thinking like riding the bike? It isn't, it feels that way as the political establishment has been stuck in the past relying on landline polls when we have kids video chatting w/ grandparents. ü§î #AmericaNeedsAndrewYang.  https://t.co/CNWG8MGiUV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayPotato1 @gskmeva1234 @futureismath As a parent, the best approach is to not focus on the grades themselves but to focus on what the learning objectives are supposed to do for a kid &amp; provide assistance when inquired. The process, importantly, has a timing issue much like this fundraising situation. 90 % is üëç IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuptaThoughts OFC. But, the best course of action is to set aside biases when reviewing since even bad actors sometimes tell the truth &amp; vice versa. IMO this is why @AndrewYang's data-driven approach resonates w/ Democrats, Conservatives, Independents, Libertarians, Trump supporters, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuptaThoughts IMO this applies to any publication. The idea that 'news' sources are challenged for whatever reason will be a problem for future generations. Too much information. When an article is an 'opinion', no one should regard it as simply 'reporting' the facts. #AmericaNeedsAndrewYang<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytopinion @AndrewYang Guess we are using #AmericaNeedsAndrewYang this Wed. morning~!!! This @nytopinion interview article is pretty insightful (the interview occurred 12/04/19).

<|startoftext|>@MeaSongbird Has the hashtag line been changed from #AmericaNeedsYang to #AmericaNeedsAndrewYang? I know Twitter was showing the latter as a trend at the moment but IMO Twitter sometimes pre-select hashtags for you even though that's not what #YangGang was focusing on. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanWindham @SpursSavva Son, Moura are great wingers that can go up/down the pitch. This requires a traditional striker, which we don't have. Mourinho himself said the formation for the 1st few games is what works best. He really knows who Kane, Dele, Son, Moura are. Just hoping we get a striker soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva IMO it's a vicious cycle both physically &amp; mentally, if your team lacks in squad quality &amp; the MF, backline are unstable. Too often do the #THFC pour water into a container that has a big hole at the bottom. As a player, it must also be difficult knowing where the issues are. üòî<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StansburyDarren @SpursSavva Son's a winger that dropped down a lot to play defense. IMO missing Son for 3 games showed that Kane can't do it alone.

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva Another aspect is discussing 1-2 players against each other is somewhat counterproductive because you play as a group &amp; the system/tactic has to match.

<|startoftext|>@MolesBen @jack69014909 @Mannythfc @SpursOfficial IMO #THFC were pressured a lot in the 1st half, given no space to work with &amp; needed to react fast or else lose the ball. They played better in the 2nd half but the needing-to-hurry mentality stayed w/ the starters. Also the wingers defended a lot. We need a traditional striker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial The #THFC played well today vs. the top team in the PL. This 0-1 loss is what fans can accept. It wasn't disappointing at all. What's disappointing is that Levy needs to understand we need players; immediately a traditional striker, then few MF &amp; defenders. If he does, act on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID The 2 missed chances IMO arose from what happened in the 1st half. #THFC didn't have space &amp; needed to react 'fast'. They were better in the 2nd half but still stuck in the 1st half mentality. This is why we need a traditional striker. I'll take this 0-1. Win the FA rematch now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_TTID We should just replace the MFs w/ either attackers or defenders because that's what the #THFC did the entire 1st half.

<|startoftext|>@darthkaqoon @kathrynacullen @AndrewYang Although fiction, 'The Shawshank Redemption' described convicts/ex-convicts of the 1940-60's.

<|startoftext|>@Mitch32715227 @TheView @AndrewYang Since you brought it up, I do agree that Gabbard &amp; Booker could complement AY very nicely as VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitch32715227 @TheView @AndrewYang Didn't think someone would actually try to answer. It was meant as a compliment to Evelyn Yang's speaking abilities. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@21outof10 @JayMansion1 @LilithRainn @lmcgrew But saying most proponents 'would' agree to some level doesn't mean that it's actually part of anyone's defined policy (currently being pushed) that people support, is it? I'm not sure. It's not a rhetorical question either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@21outof10 @JayMansion1 @LilithRainn @lmcgrew The hours are cut as businesses have set budgets for personnel costs.

<|startoftext|>@EricRWeinstein Thank you, @EricRWeinstein! MSM covers DT a lot as they want to maximize viewership.

<|startoftext|>@Trumper4Yang @YangTasks @JulianCastro @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Similar. IMO it's self-evident what DT can attack to win.

<|startoftext|>@EzeRennie @_winksaffect8 @spursy_chirpy @SpursOfficial IMHO it's not a toxicity issue. They are humans like us. Just think what we'll do when we're not rewarded when we think we should be. But, at the same time, think of why Levy/Poch/Board made certain decisions. At the end, it's just business. It just affects players differently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzeRennie @_winksaffect8 @spursy_chirpy @SpursOfficial Sorting needed but, for us fans, we can only speculate &amp; go by the fact that few players (that helped the CL run) weren't rewarded &amp; they left, but their exit's impacts might be bigger than we thought. Few wanted to leave but couldn't; they're replaceable in comparison so issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SundayThoughts #YangGang State Department warning Americans to leave Iraq immediately. These are the U.S. travel advisories for January 2020.  https://t.co/7qifLHET46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_winksaffect8 @spursy_chirpy @EzeRennie @SpursOfficial Agree. Offload as much as possible; strategically bring in an attacker, MF or CB/RB this January. Then, more attackers, MF, defensive players in the summer. I see only a handful of players being around next year if Mourinho has managed to successfully build a winning #THFC. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingTHFC Just look at the last two game formations. How can you expect them to be not all over the place? Compared to MID, the #THFC players had to deal with drastic changes. At least, we found the 2nd half squad/formation to be a better choice. That's at least good. We need depth. #COYS  https://t.co/BI5Glax2FW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs @beINSPORTS_EN And, also get few more attackers like Kane, Alli, Son, &amp; Moura to increase squad depth &amp; to have them play well complementing each other. #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_winksaffect8 @spursy_chirpy @EzeRennie @SpursOfficial I understand what you mean. The depth of the squad is terrible. Think that's also frustrating to the players not to mention Mourinho, the coaching staff, &amp; the fans. For now, I'll just leave it at being concerned for the #THFC since we are top 6. Waiting to see who we get also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howlindavies @AtsedeNegussie1 @luketrinnaman09 @SpursOfficial Think the issue is us not being able to fully express the thinking behind a tweet. I noticed many people use few word tweets. That's probably why a lot gets lost in the translation. Do agree that situations can be &amp; are often amplified even if that may not be good sampling data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luketrinnaman09 @howlindavies @AtsedeNegussie1 @SpursOfficial Your comment is understandable. All players end up looking like üí© from time to time. I usually look at the formations &amp; what each player's roles are &amp; the opponent's formation. For today, #THFC's formation change was very drastic from the last when compared to MID. #MIDTOT #COYS  https://t.co/pzZxMBZAOQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howlindavies @AtsedeNegussie1 @SpursOfficial Understand. We need a long-term investment into a Kane-level striker but we don't have time nor the funds to get one this January. Agree on an attacking MF that can serve as a No. 10. I'm for getting four like Kane, Alli, Son, Moura. Just considering funds &amp; timing at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Sign an experienced traditional center forward in replacement for Kane. Not an expensive one. Llorente was past his prime but served that purpose last season. Kane is out for 2 months or so. We play best w/ a striker (Kane), two wingers (Son, Moura) &amp; a no. 10 (Alli). #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spursy_chirpy @EzeRennie @_winksaffect8 @SpursOfficial Everything has a cycle. It's just shorter but productive when Mourinho's involved. No one person's working style fits everyone in a group when time is not on anyone's side. IMO short term winners are etched into history more while longterm above-average leaders may not be. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howlindavies @AtsedeNegussie1 @luketrinnaman09 @SpursOfficial IMO Kane, Alli, Son, Moura work well together. Missing 1 of them is not good; we now know why Mourinho started them consistently at the start. The problem is depth. We need more like them. Defensive fixes will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Get attackers, pls. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CwWilson123 @SpursOfficial It's undeniable that Kane, Alli, Son, Moura play well together &amp; complement each other. The past 4 games showed that missing even one of them just makes it very difficult for the #THFC to succeed. Especially, when they know they need to score more than 1 goal to win a game. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TheRealQHefner @nyrax_ @SpursOfficial Needing to test new formations w/ a new guy is another issue. The fact that Lamela went on w/ Lo Celso in the 2nd half &amp; changed the game is testament. This squad is lacking a traditional center forward who can complement attack w/ wingers. Last year Llorente served that purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ucragirl @Jspurs3 @SpursOfficial Son &amp; Moura play best when they are complemented by a traditional center forward and vice versa. Llorente would've been a good backup like last year w/ his experience and all but that's no longer an option so let's see what happens. #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Well, at least, Levy will make more money now so we can get some players in the January window. Get a striker so Son &amp; Moura can return to being fast paced wingers. We're gonna concede goals anyway. Just buy attackers, please. #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oblong @DaleJohnsonESPN We need this üëá analysis by the VAR, at all FA games, please. #THFC #COYS  https://t.co/lsK9joZ1dK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursWatcher @_TTID Didn't JV say the players were wanting the FA Cup? Think trying a new formation yet again limited how the game went. Feels like Poch is still with us - needing to test various possibilities. ü§î At least, it's a draw and Levy gets to make money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID No because the game changed w/ Lamela &amp; Lo Celso going on so Mourinho is not going to play younger players. He's never really done that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shannon49409520 @SpursOfficial Technically, we orbit around the Son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antrayuk @SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Makes sense. Unfortunate for Dele. I know about Brazilians doing the one name thing but I thought Lucas was an exception because he actually uses Moura in his Twitter account. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial @WilliamHill Win, please! Serious: Son, Eriksen, Alli, Moura! Btw is there a reason why everyone gets referred to by their last names but Dele Alli &amp; Lucas Moura are written on team announcements as Dele &amp; Lucas? And then, later, sometimes, I see them changed to their last names. #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScandinavianJan @harrysdad82 @TalkingTHFC @ChrisEriksen8 The rumor is probably the least of their worries. Although it would've been a factor.

<|startoftext|>@RealDGGHD @G_Man_Baker @mesutcrozil IMO depending on how the next 2 months w/o Kane turns out, the #THFC should sell 2 or more from Alli, Son, Moura, Ndombele, &amp; Kane and use the funds acquired to massively rebuild Mourinho's team.

<|startoftext|>@HopeIsBetter247 @AndrewYang üëç It's never late to pick up new things regardless of age. It just depends on situation, time, motivation, etc. I've started reading more about history &amp; politics. Even the ones I thought I knew are surely different once decades have passed since you really studied them. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HopeIsBetter247 @AndrewYang It is, isn't it. I 1st tweeted as it was a #MATH moment. Most wouldn't cite anything, AY did. Numerical unit sys. (i.e., metric) is a key STEM topic; time is 1 of the 7 base units. I could've added context 1st but people don't seem to like long tweets. üòä  https://t.co/425WLwPkjQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HopeIsBetter247 @AndrewYang Our calendar sys. doesn't have year zero. We have BC 1 then it goes to AD 1. AD 1/1/2021 = 2020 absolute yrs. 1/1/2020 = 2019 abs. yrs passed. I just liked the fact that @AndrewYang pointed out the standing arguments. I'm fine as long as people understand.  https://t.co/hYwvR4tBcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy91473739 @AndrewYang  https://t.co/hYwvR4tBcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy91473739 @AndrewYang Yes &amp; no. It depends on the sys. 2000 absolute yrs passed once AD 2001 came. I think either is fine as long as people know what it means. You turn 20 on your B-day. You lived 20 absolute yrs. There is no year zero for our widely used calendar sys. AD 2020 = 2019 absolute years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacBT2 @AndrewYang Good one. I tweeted the 1st response so we think about relative numerical systems vs. absolute sys. We say, "I just turned 40." This means you literally spent 40 absolute years. But, for the calendar sys. we use, there is no year zero. Start of AD 2020 = 2019 absolute yrs passed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dchempstead @Gilbert_1882 @SpursOfficial We need more players that can do this üëá kind of counterattacking as a group or individual. Need more like Kane, Alli, &amp; Son.

<|startoftext|>@ginger10bacon @aharbert @JoeBiden @AndrewYang The coding example that Biden chose needed more context, at best. Studies show learning new languages become challenging after age 12.

<|startoftext|>@M1cha31Patr1ck @OliWhail @darrenmwong IMO coding is not for everyone. I've seen plenty of college kids not being able to proficiently code even after taking courses. After age 12, learning new languages is challenging. I'd extend this to include programming languages. What programming language is Biden talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewProgressUSA @SethLunchquest @ericming For the most part, they match up. There are (red) populated areas that don't have donations (for this data set). It's cool that donations to @AndrewYang are definitely from all over the country. And, it's also apparent why the electoral college is the way it is. #YangGang #MATH  https://t.co/YCVNluBYeE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neau67 @TheProneBear_ @SpursOfficial Agree. We now know the front 3 Kane, Alli, Son working well together is crucial to the #THFC's success. If they score goals, it overcomes the lack of MF &amp; defense. It was apparent during Son's absence. We need 4+ new players in 2020 that are at the level of Kane, Alli, Son. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brad_nb @RickSpur Think you can just say everyone not named Kane, Alli, and Son can leave, at this point. It was clear (in the past 3 games) that having these three play together is the most crucial situation even if the MF &amp; defense are suspect. They are irreplaceable whereas the others are not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Californalovers @scottsantens @scott__santos Thank you for the New Year's day laughter! This made my day after the #THFC lost this morning. Hahahahahahaha.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpursSavva For sure, we need depth. These last 3 games + Son suspension were a gift to #THFC. We need more Kane, Alli, &amp; Son. Without these kinds of players, we're lost. We need 3-5 more just like them so the squad quality doesn't suffer when they are unavailable to help each other. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtsedeNegussie1 @SpursOfficial We now know which players we absolutely need as well as which players we do not necessarily need in the #THFC. Son missing three games made things pretty clear so hopefully these results help Mourinho sort out the players in/out situations. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyGDNBoss @darrenmwong IMO pragmatic politics don't allow politicians to have a long &amp; prosperous 'career'. That's why when a problem solver comes along like AY, the establishment, obviously, will push back because this individual threatens their way of life (livelihood).  https://t.co/JbekbhEZ2E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID Just similar would be nice to start with. Few more like Kane, Alli, Son level players. The depth chart that Mourinho &amp; co-workers review every day/game probably makes them sigh every time. I mean even Mourinho said Lamela came to him and asked to be used but he's not being used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID Exactly. I said something similar as a reply to the list tweet you uploaded. It's also N = 3 so we can certainly hypothesize some trends based on observations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID Agree for the most part. 01/01/20's #SOUTOT game scheduling + Son suspension are Christmas gifts from 2019 that were not realized until today. Transfer window just started. The more Saints expose #THFC, the easier it will be for people to see which players are not stepping up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID Agree to a certain degree but Mourinho has a pretty good excuse these three games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID We cannot pass either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID We cannot counterattack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Miata_Lee @diraclikesmath @lmcgrew Going back to 1st tweet. IMO it can be unfair to anyone that's taken the test. It gives someone ideas about how they solve problems under pressure.

<|startoftext|>@Miata_Lee @diraclikesmath @lmcgrew IMO IQ provides an idea of how people solve Q's involving patterns &amp; theoretical tasks (w/ time limits).

<|startoftext|>@TomPerez As 2019 comes to an end, I want to share one of my favorite books I read this year: The War on Normal People by @AndrewYang. It covers disappearing US jobs &amp; the need for #UBI. I encourage everyone to pick up a copy if they can. #PollThePeople, @TomPerez.  https://t.co/gD5P2MwOlO  https://t.co/UFMqV7szB4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chupwn @TomPerez Hope @TomPerez's three (3) kids eventually learn what #PollThePeople meant on 12/30/19 (and beyond). Shame on you, @TomPerez!  #YangGang  https://t.co/djb6OkQu6t  https://t.co/QDohKr38b6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIvinsTheGreat #PollThePeople but not like this üëá. Include all the candidates such as @AndrewYang, @TulsiGabbard, @CoryBooker, @marwilliamson, @TomSteyer, and whoever else is still running. How hard is it, really, @DNC &amp; commissioned pollsters?  #YangGang  https://t.co/R7Hx2Tceft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenjeong Thank you, @kenjeong, for endorsing @AndrewYang! Hoping you can play #POTUS AY (#Yang2020) like how @JordanPeele played Obama below. Cheers &amp; welcome to #YangGang!  https://t.co/MnJEBWUOPU  https://t.co/utLBeFqwpB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Californalovers @YHumanityfirst @noodlexsoup Agree. IMO comedians develop materials based on real-life research. They cycle through certain routines but need to switch things up every now &amp; then. They do research again &amp; test/try new things much like how @AndrewYang would approach problems, analyze, &amp; come up w/ solutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincentjanssen Congrats, Vincent! A trophy! Awesome! #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rrberry01 @JakeASnider1 @AndrewYang IMO sponsoring sounds like an organization providing yearly funding. The DNC may have funds that pollsters apply for &amp; the budget covers personnel, supplies, etc. Commissioning should be per poll basis so they do it whenever someone buys their polling services. Just my guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1cha31Patr1ck @YangHubPug @JakeASnider1 @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann Good idea. Even if it's not accepted by the DNC, #YangGang can test (fund) the anonymous Blockchain method of polling this election cycle. I wouldn't know how to approach this but I'm sure there are #YangGang members who know how to do it or they know experts that can enable it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dennisisok @JakeASnider1 @YangHubPug @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann This üëÜ is the fundamental issue, isn't it. üò° Arrrrrrrrrrh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YangHubPug @JakeASnider1 @dennisisok @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann Also, how do we even know if the funds that were used to get the qualifying polls are not influenced in any way by any specific organization? Do we even know how all these polls are funded?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YangHubPug @JakeASnider1 @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann I always assumed it's a cost issue &amp; getting the network figured out so the hired polling personnel can actually put in time &amp; effort to conduct the necessary polling within a given time frame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spaceotter1971 @FastNobu @ZachandMattShow Maybe he figured out it's just impossible to role out a healthcare plan w/ info showing premiums &amp; deductibles, for instance. IMO @AndrewYang knows he needs to tackle other variables affecting costs, first, like medical/drug costs before additional plan details can be formulated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhinocorte @thetinytrain @AudreyW70723165 @ZachandMattShow Looks colorful &amp; useful but it doesn't quite match the info provided in this üëá health index rankings as different countries w/ different systems can have quality healthcare regardless of what system they utilize.  https://t.co/MEQ9LaDXKZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewYang2020 @ZachandMattShow @Yang4M Not necessarily a loser but he has to use time explaining. @AndrewYang could've called it 'Healthcare for All', etc. But, then, he will end up being compared to M4A. IMO he intentionally just stayed w/ using the M4A term as he'll need to explain his version in comparison, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterPinko @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl @AndrewYang @BernieSanders Not mad. Even if I don't support Senator @BernieSanders, I don't go around misrepresenting him &amp; his policies. I may have specific questions but nothing vacuous. I wanted you to say that @AndrewYang never said those words since it's your interpretation. Thanks for the admission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterPinko @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl @AndrewYang @BernieSanders You were the one being very specific about your interpretation üëá. Next time. Just don't make tweets as if someone actually said something when they did no such thing. Your subjective tweets are vacuous tweets, at best.  https://t.co/cOReIIHCFT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterPinko @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl @AndrewYang @BernieSanders Don't change the subject. He never said, "this won‚Äôt happen, it will never happen, and you‚Äôll be happy with what I give you." This is purely YOUR interpretation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterPinko @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl @AndrewYang @BernieSanders Show me where in his plan that says, "this won‚Äôt happen, it will never happen, and you‚Äôll be happy with what I give you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieChrysty @bmwdjj13 @AndrewYang @scottsantens @PagetKagy I just did this üëÜ and see that others do it as well. Sometimes you just need to decide what 'tweets' you want to interact with or, at least, listen to the chirping from time to time. I focus on re-tweeting select #YangGang stuff as is or sometimes w/ added txt/facts/references.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterPinko @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl This üëá is purely your interpretation, @MisterPinko, as that's not what @AndrewYang said. This is no different than MSM &amp; their personnel trying to blackout, smear, or misrepresent both Senator @BernieSanders &amp; Mr. Yang. #YangGang #MATH #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/cOReIIHCFT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FuzzyDunlop1390 @NorthTxCoder @matthewryancase @gariamray @AndrewYang @haydentiff IMO it could be a generational difference. 45+ wouldn't have had the level of online engagement until they turned 30+. Some tweet things (often) that wouldn't be ideal to start an offline convo w/ a stranger. I find these Twitter accounts harder to follow so I don't follow them.<|endoftext|>

Below graph (a replot of data in URL), you can see that the Dem votes are crapshoot (90.7 % mean), @AndrewYang needs to reach out to (older) Disaffected &amp; Trump voters.

<|startoftext|>@emakovich @ZachandMattShow @MSNBC @DNC @cornellbelcher Think it's also the egos of these show's producers &amp; the host(s) making sure their loyal viewers get fed what they need. It's no different than how Trump keeps his supporters happy. Also,  MSNBC knows talking about Trump always gets viewership so having Yang on isn't important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polycoder1 It really would be awesome to get this üëá made into an  @AndrewYang #POTUS version (using the captions  /u/greggshiu on Reddit made).

If they gave him 5 more mins, think his answers would have been a bit more detailed &amp; Hayes could have made it a bit more engaging.

<|startoftext|>@YesForYang @gthomassr1 @KylePuzma @ZachandMattShow @AndrewYang Agree. @AndrewYang is always positive &amp; #HumanityFirst~! His answers were great! The interviewer was just more interested in talking about (bad) Trump.

<|startoftext|>@gthomassr1 @KylePuzma @ZachandMattShow @AndrewYang Chris Hayes cut him off at the end. Things ended approx. 8:50 pm, 12/27/19 so that's approx. 8.5 minutes.

<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan I guess for the sentence I used 'PC = political correctness' would be a better choice. Btw, I heard you live in Malaysia. If so, it must be even more tiresome to do tweet convos w/ people in the states. If you are getting online attacked, report &amp; share w/ #YangGang what's up. üí™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Politically correct = PC, in this case. Anyway, I'd just stay away from both camps unless you want to fight them or join them. Might be a super waste of time &amp; effort. Think you can just contact people in the media about the AK abuse stuff to see if anything new surfaced. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Sorry to hear. The apple don't fall far away from the tree. I've said this for BS, now I say for AK. I suspect AK supports know how to fight dirty as she's been around &amp; know how to survive. Think PB supporters are centrists favoring PC so I doubt they'd attack as much. Cheer up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheProSpecTer Even this üëá person took 2-3 months to realize what @AndrewYang offers the US. With everything, you need to have 'time' to accept/reject new topics. Perhaps, you can, first, differentiate AY vs. BS; share how #YangGang gets attacked by Sanders supporters.  https://t.co/QMitJkGwdU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AschoffESPN Thank you for sharing the beautiful life story of Edward, Katy. Not much I can really say except to provide my deepest condolences &amp; to quote Keanu Reeves, "I know that the ones who love us will miss us." üôè  https://t.co/c2gOomnFTX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1cha31Patr1ck @FreeMars2020 @William94669768 @Portlandval @EmersonWen @AndrewYang The 4th Ind. Revolution will be multifaceted. Not even the private sector will know for sure what E-commerce &amp; #automation winning will mean in 10 yrs. Similar to climate change, we need to deal w/ industrial changes now via solutions like #UBI tied to VAX + other feedback loops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeMars2020 @M1cha31Patr1ck @William94669768 @Portlandval @EmersonWen @AndrewYang Yup. Businesses changed as what people wanted changed. Tech. came along accelerated the changes so there's no looking back. The fast pace disallows us from knowing the fallout. ü§î That's scary but AY came along, changed the narrative w/ #UBI, etc. We need to take advantage of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamusAlpha @gskmeva1234 @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann @skeletorington3 @victorianerafan That's cool. Thanks for sharing. Hope the #YangGang in that region continues to grow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeMars2020 @M1cha31Patr1ck @William94669768 @Portlandval @EmersonWen @AndrewYang The food chain shouldn't be disrupted to the degree that it will fall apart.

<|startoftext|>@CamusAlpha @gskmeva1234 @AndrewYang @Zach_Graumann @skeletorington3 @victorianerafan @Alsaints5 I see. One from Indonesia &amp; the rest are in Malaysia. That's cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrianJR @HotspurRelated Both fouling &amp; faking. The side punch was a hard foul. Then the faking was to sell the opponent's action as something very serious. Son's reaction is a red, never contested that aspect. It's about R√ºdiger &amp; others like him getting off scot-free after fouling/faking even w/ VAR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_unplugged @huntythelad @darrianJR @HotspurRelated Don't like how players like R√ºdiger, Lerma get off scot-free after fouling/faking. I mean con men go to jail. Why let those affect games? Maybe not 100 % cause but faking can be correlated to card issuances, affecting the game. Schelotto's dive vs. Winks -&gt; yellow -&gt; BHA scored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryHackett10 @HotspurRelated I'm not being critical of your remarks. Just don't like how this R√ºdiger fella just got off scot-free even after fouling. I've been off watching soccer &amp; got back into it as I got tired of Am. Football. All this flopping, faking stuff is just üò°. Even that dive vs. Winks was üí©.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJH3 @FbayareaS @TheFFSC @adamcarolla @AndrewYang Yes, I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishyiddo13 @LastWordOnSpurs I was tweeting about him training w/ the team afterward. Was responding to another post. Think I responded incorrectly. ü§™ Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishyiddo13 @LastWordOnSpurs He needs to workout. He's technically out for only one week (12/26/19-01/01/20). I'm sure he will play in the 01/05/20 FA 3rd round game then the 01/11/20 game vs. LFC. He cannot not train.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCowlin @LastWordOnSpurs Nice. Son's technically only out one week so I'm sure he's really focused to get back for the 01/05/20 game vs. Middlesbrough &amp; the 01/11/20 game vs. LFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan That's life. It's just different people, times, places, circumstances, &amp; outcomes. Technically, this is why I value @AndrewYang's failures as a businessman (that he sometimes mentions) more than his successes. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKane @SpursOfficial Awesome 1st goal, Harry! Change of personnel but that didn't stop #THFC from winning. #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TranSPURS Aurier Sanchez Alderweireld Vertonghen Eriksen (or Ndombele) Lo Celso Moura Alli Sessegnon Kane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrianJR @HotspurRelated Yes, I know. Son's red card, however, shouldn't absolve R√ºdiger of his faking &amp; original fouling. This flopping, diving, faking üí© is why this game isn't as big in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnlyTVf5XQ @electricForest6 @HotspurRelated Think their Youtube channel subscribers viewing these videos rewards them $, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yofishman88 @HotspurRelated Totally agree. Thinking positively, Son's absence (only one week) couldn't be at a better time only because the teams #THFC will face. Forced Mourinho to use Sess, Lo Celso, Eriksen (whether we like it or not). #COYS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cleemonsta @BryanFrew2 @breedsomebees For sure. You account for what you are trying to accomplish w/ a project, then you get to the non-personnel budget, then personnel. If it's manufacturing (repetitive work), the materials/supplies budget isn't going to change so #automation, etc. #YangGang  https://t.co/GxCoQb4egG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mannythfc Agree except Moura being poor. Think Moura did a lot to help especially when the team lacked pace-based attacks (w/o Son being there). Lo Celso &amp; Eriksen in the MF definitely is a different dynamic than Sissoko/Winks/Dier (in some combo). Happy for the 2nd half &amp; the win. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_TTID Agree. We kinda missed the runs today. That one chance when Kane was going in by himself then Alli came by but they were kinda slow. Good result, good 2nd half, lots to look forward to. Son not being there allowed testing possible so a blessing in disguise (sort of). #COYS #THFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Sess will channel Son today on the left wing except the red card stuff. #THFC #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordOnSpurs Gut punch question. Whoever made it must be a silent #THFC fan. Still painful to see a question like that. Arrrrrh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hiraaaad @tenchichrono @Patient0ZS @_xentropy_ Sarcasm? ü§î IMO If we go by @Patient0ZS's comments, there will be no viable candidate to vote for.

<|startoftext|>@esaagar Merry Christmas, @essagar! Thanks for your fair coverage of the democratic presidential nomination. Like how you say you don't agree w/ some of @AndrewYang's policies but give him fair treatment. Happy Holidays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Did @thehill's @krystalball &amp; @esaagar ever cover this üëá about Klobuchar? The articles are from Feb. 2019. Do we know what came out of it? #YangGang #MerryChrismas #Christmas #HumanityFirst #MATH  https://t.co/PKip7oBFQy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Saw your tweets w/ articles from Feb. 2019. Any updates? Understand your position as you appear to have a boss that's difficult to work with. Agree it's not good optics but we know what she is. Pete may be a bigger monster later. I'd start judging when candidates break the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystalball Merry Christmas, @krystalball~! You and @esaagar have been great on The Hill. Fair coverage of topics was excellent. Even when ___ stans or biased pundits/analysts came on, you guys made the segments as fair as possible by giving alternate views. #YangGang  https://t.co/zP2hbdhvuu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Crapshoot. The 2 things that differentiate them are gender &amp; age. I'd go w/ Klobuchar as her record makes her somewhat predictable &amp; that's something people will know going in. Buttigieg, on the other hand, is still changing as a person so unpredictable.

<|startoftext|>@chef4yang2020 As @AndrewYang often points out, incorrect measurements drive &amp; incentivize people in different ways. K-12 classes &amp; assessments are ideally setup for college admissions. How can kids value simply being human in such an environment? #HumanityFirst #MATH  https://t.co/GXytn1BrLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndThoughts @AndrewYang You should provide @AndrewYang w/ the #data supporting your claim. Regardless of what people claim, published journal articles reference diverse situations. Think this isn't a 1-dimensional issue as 'human trafficking' is not in the same category as 'sex work'. #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarcSco26629125 @LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur This üëá R√ºdiger. Still don't get why the game allows this. They should fine players 50k per fake action IMO.

<|startoftext|>@VisurantViz @YangOrBust What are these '_____trash' hashtags? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gracenote108 @CharlesMBlow Agree. @AndrewYang is interviewing on Fox as he doesn't have money trees üí∞üéÑ (in wine caves) to shake or $100 million dollars to buy TV ads (like billionaires can do). #YangGang is diverse &amp; includes Republicans &amp; Independents. He knows the US has more than Dems. #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustYangIt @AndrewYang It's unbelievable that some people can spend 80-100 million on ads so they can become the Dem nominee and it's only up to 12/17/19. It's also not counting all the other campaign expenditures. Wonder what it will be eventually. I hate to imagine. üòï<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UBI4America @lovepaize @pcolayanggang Agree. Some do have mental health issues &amp; can't stop w/ the negative back-&amp;-forth. Also, reporters do, in fact, utilize Twitter responses when writing some articles. It's important to make sure certain tweets have counter tweets if they incorporate errors or misinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yangp84 @VisurantViz @AndrewYang @AndrewYang should tackle this kind of toxic online behavior as a mental health issue. It's the platforms allowing them access to others but the humans choose to apply verbal abuse disguised as an intelligent thought. Like Yang said, you become morons in the absence of diversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan @AndrewYang Why not? We are all human. You said you were a trained scientist so that allows you to hypothesis test just about everything, no? That means there will be times you'll end up accepting hypotheses from other candidates. Yang's draw is that he does the relating part so naturally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophianictract @snarktasticgirl IMO Twitter has this impact on people. When off-line meetings don't exist &amp; people tweet behind a device, they essentially become morons like @AndrewYang said. No one should be left alone to refine their own ideas.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Agree, time is gold! Many are not good at time management, however. That's why we need such skills (that we take for granted) to be taught both at school (1/3) &amp; home (2/3). #YangGang #MATH #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/jPQDO46P1j<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ian_P_Brazier @SouthpawBoxNews @LastWordOnSpurs @footballdaily IMO they should be fined ¬£$.

<|startoftext|>@MeaSongbird @ConnorMagidson @AndrewYang @PSPradio1 Agree. Passion is what keeps us in check during our highs, lows.

Life always throws us curve balls but batters eventual figure out how to hit home runs off of curveballs. üòâ #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeaSongbird @AndrewYang Thanks for the details. I saw Ready Player One on cable. There was the last battle scene where Gundam &amp; Mechagodzilla appeared (among others). Kind of like that then but using game consoles or PC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConnorMagidson @MeaSongbird @AndrewYang I see. Thanks for the info. That's a lot of people. These 'raids' are going for some big prize w/ tens to hundreds of players, check.

<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan Agree. IMO having a #HumanityFirst class that we need to pass before 21 will be interesting to try.

<|startoftext|>@LoaphMeat @MyLifeIsMunitz @BernieSanders @AndrewYang IMO it's probably easier &amp; practical to ask via someone in the campaign who works with him that Twitter-interacts frequently w/ others.

<|startoftext|>@p_bohlig @AndrewYang It's not impossible &amp; it can give people perspective. I think people will continue to point out Yang's plans don't address premiums &amp; deductibles.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Can you scheme out operational costs associated with a medical institution of few different sizes?

<|startoftext|>@Clergy4Y @nattyindi Agree. Think a 1-size-fit-all policy involving religious institutions doesn't do justice for what local churches do for the community.

<|startoftext|>@WisdomOfDan @FbayareaS @AndrewYang Conflicts w/ outside entities IMO can refer to heightened internal turmoil (which is not #YangGang). ü§î Historic wars have such examples.

<|startoftext|>@jtsamoa @alex_damianou @AndrewYang @JakeASnider1 @MyLifeIsMunitz @BlacksForYang @scottsantens Is this about premiums, deductibles?

I think he will look at various proposals once in office. #MATH #YangGang #HumanityFirst  https://t.co/GWILotEJIk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesleyYangGang Personally choice. I'm sure once people become #YangGang and interact w/ others on Twitter, you know what to expect. IMO putting a different definition other than 'I'm wearing the blue hat üß¢ because I support @AndrewYang's campaign' is a bit dangerous.  https://t.co/bG2VPVhtuA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PagetKagy A dangerous distinction to be discussing, IMO. Certain #YangGang members can choose to take off the hat, go rogue, and not really practice &amp; promote #HumanityFIrst. Also, #YangGang w/o hats can be negatively labeled or impacted. Too much thinking IMO. It's an emoji. #MATH  https://t.co/E7dfPSffky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victorianerafan @kathrynacullen Kind of a similar choice. People put too much label and emotion into emojis, unfortunately. In a way, emojis allow profiling (or discrimination) possible. It's already difficult to talk to certain types of people that come with biased viewpoints + having already read your tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicola_Anne2019 IMO school sys. worked when the teachers had more support for both being an experienced human + a knowledge transmitter. Now, with the changing social dynamics &amp; so much information available through various types of media, the current school sys. just doesn't tailor to everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats38 @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang Yeah, it's always a difficult situation when you also look back at history &amp; the racism factors. You think you did things for someone but you don't get as much in return. That's how life works sometimes. I think that's why Yang's #HumanityFirst approach is so refreshing. #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats38 @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang @CondoleezzaRice That's politics, unfortunately. This is why #YangGang and many voters in the US see a non-politician like @AndrewYang as a problem solver who base things off of #data + facts. Even more the reason he should start working on foreign issues w/ various perspectives we are offering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats38 @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang Understand. Diplomacy isn't easy. There are influencers other than politicians. Also, law may simply prevent talking to politicians. Historical + current events are difficult to discuss for sure. Philippines can acquire more S.

<|startoftext|>@MotherOfCats38 @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang It's difficult to mention all the countries in a tweet. Agree to a large extent w/ you.

<|startoftext|>@claudiakins_BTS @AndrewYang @Noahpinion Well, he can forge connections w/ regular civilians as well to make some sort of a movement like #HumanityFirst. It's a good point but he is not even the Dem nominee, yet. I should research what's actually possible or not. #MATH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EchoEscape @FromRagsToGP @HateMyOpinions @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang Whether #YangGang agrees or disagrees, he himself kinda put this out there by predicting that DT will call him 'Comrade Yang'. It will be lazy to not prepare for the inevitable attacking points. He is Taiwanese American &amp; that's a significant factor. #MATH  https://t.co/22JeAGDGJN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claudiakins_BTS @AndrewYang @Noahpinion @AndrewYang, please understand that China, Japan, Korea will negotiate w/ the POTUS to get various deals done if it means they endorse DT.

<|startoftext|>@HateMyOpinions @LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder @AndrewYang I understand this point. He does really need to address this weird perception issue you are bringing up. I guess people just simply don't know how China doesn't even recognize Taiwan as a country. My opinion is one potential avenue of action. #MATH #HumanityFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claudiakins_BTS @AndrewYang @Noahpinion A good idea. Politics is cutthroat. IMO you need to get connected w/ that 1 influencer in a foreign nation willing to talk to you, first. That's the point I am making. He needs to start forging connections w/ 'ally' foreign nations, especially w/ Asian nations. #MATH #YangGang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanAArcher @AndrewYang @Noahpinion Also, what you are saying should be corrected as well on the spot by #YangGang, if applicable, because Taiwan is a direct threat to mainland China so there is no way he will be advocating China over his Taiwanese heritage. #MATH   https://t.co/hXdrBMrSoX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanAArcher @AndrewYang @Noahpinion I do understand the concerns. That's why he should talk to allies like S. Korea &amp; Japan, first. It's next level politics. There needs to be a clear reason for the mainstream to see what his Asian heritage can bring to the US because obvious the heritage is kinda out there. #MATH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeahDo4 @FromLoveWonder IMHO I wish @AndrewYang leveraged his Asian heritage + his other networks to start talking to influencers (i.e., politicians) in China, Japan, &amp; Korea.

<|startoftext|>@Cuz39 @Chris_RUW @SpursOfficial Son can do whatever he wants. Same thing for Mourinho &amp; all the players.

<|startoftext|>@D_muller9 @Chris_RUW @SpursOfficial Agree with this. Kane &amp; Son are really going above and beyond their normal positions as forwards.

<|startoftext|>@Bev_Rat @AndrewYang @BetoORourke The hundreds to thousands of years that China, Korea, Japan dealt with each other in various capacities brings about treatment of certain cultures based on ethnicity a very real issue.
