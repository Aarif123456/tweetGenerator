<|startoftext|>@misscrisp @heyheyitsmeghan @drsarasw My dad's second wife (whom he was still married to at the time) did the flowers for us. An ordained friend officiated, and my brother took the photos. In hindsight, perhaps we should've hired a photographer. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh shit, @MrCraigRobinson. You hire the kid, too! What's next, chess? 😂  https://t.co/sOOD9ncOdc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrCraigRobinson Dude, seeing you as Mr. Jenkins in Timmy Failure on @disneyplus, and I'm totally thinking Ray in Mr. Robot (but can't explain it to my kid). Talking to people in offices who have imaginary friends? You're on lock for those roles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_geek Right now I feel fortunate to live in the suburbs. We live on a hill and our deck is overlooking our town, we have a side yard with fire pit and space that's like a beer garden, and my son has a tree house and swing. Super appreciative to stretch out on our own property.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God! I was really worried!  https://t.co/N0PPXHKFXx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so bad now, that major media outlets are now clapping back to the president. Come on, #PR and #crisiscomms folks. I'm right there with you and and exhausted, too. Please don't feed the trolls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would actually be awesome. There'd be no information overload, we'd still have cable TV, and we'd do all those things that people actually enjoyed before the internet.  Plus someone different would be in the White House, so our response would be much better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"It’s bad enough that adults no longer see grown-up movies in theaters, but now yesterday’s geeks who have taken over pop culture feel entitled to have the kid-friendly franchises aimed at them as well."  https://t.co/wkcd7AZOe5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The plot is shockingly similar to Frozen II, but even that film, as random as its narrative seemed, prioritized character and emotional honesty over plot, which is why it resonated despite the story issues."

<|startoftext|>"The film is an interesting study in how mega studios react to fan feedback, a whole movie crafted out of Sonic the Hedgehog’s retextured fur." #RiseofSkywalker #StarWars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A turgid rush toward a conclusion I don’t think anyone wanted, not the people upset about whatever they’re upset about with The Last Jedi... nor any of the more chill franchise devotees who just want to see something engaging."  https://t.co/JBpaUXoeVF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TL:DR - "The Skywalking Dead." @JustinCChang out here killing 2 franchises with one title (and as a former TWD fan, I get it. And I have a lump in my throat.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mz908 That's pretty accurate for Washington Square Park, which is near NYU. Actually, my friend's studio in Manhattan was more than $2,100, and that was back in the late 90's. Can't say I'm surprised.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kenwheaton @griner Cringe-worthy, but in a good (storytelling) way. Brutal stuff. Keep an eye out for Mr. Chompers (aka Alf) in his drug-fueled hallucinations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenwheaton @griner Are you familiar with Permanent Midnight, @kenwheaton? Autobiography of one of the Alf writers (movie, too). You'll never see the show in the same way again!   https://t.co/PoH9KfgDfd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kdzima @Xfinity I'm all for sappy advertising and nostalgia, when it's well done. But when I saw E.T. with the tablet and the Xfinity logo, I cringed. I still think the concept would've been great with Back to the Future characters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction : "To", not "toys" . 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For my money, I would've done a similar vibe with Back to the Future. Get Marty McFly and Doc Brown toys show up and be amazed. Hell, put Biff in an executive role at Comcast! *That* would've been entertaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll see E.T. come back for this @Xfinity commercial? Hot garbage. 🔥 E.T. literally came to Earth *twice*. His finger glows and he can make things float. You think he's impressed by a touchscreen and some voice-activated 2D television? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not entirely accurate. This was the catalyst for the split, but not the sole reason. Misleading headline from @Independent. #journalism  https://t.co/JlhoBnsxcL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, I think a certain leader of the U. S. of A. would disagree.  https://t.co/1FWaKFNxMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fail He should've bought "Rate My Reporter" for accuracy. (Teachers know what I'm saying) @PressSec @seanspicer can't even get this right!  https://t.co/opx36Yy8iO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, WHY IS THERE NO APPLE PIE EMOJI? Bad! Awful! Loser!  https://t.co/jW9ipWS4zd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way, I'm preeetttyyyy sure that the right to critique @POTUS is as American as apple pie. 🇺🇸 Idiots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While we've been talking about Devos, this happened... WTF?  https://t.co/Jc9HwpKB1U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenToomey apparently cares more about lining pockets than quality #education. Parents across #Pennsylvania should be enraged.  https://t.co/HIqq99dVWi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenToomey you supported the #MuslimBanprotest , and we constituents complained. Represent your voters and vote NO on Devos today. #noDevos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just a reminder that killer George Zimmerman is still roaming free tonight. #Trayvon Martin should have turned 22 today. #blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once @ladygaga makes a political statement during the #SuperBowl, will @POTUS tweet a nasty comment about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn't care less about #SuperBowl, but work in #marketing. Should I watch the game for the ads? #advertising<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you believe that with all the problems &amp; difficulties facing the US, @POTUS spent the day playing golf? Worse than Obama! (see 10.13.14)  https://t.co/1ViPiOVROZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyRichter I keep reading @SAVEURMAG as "save yer mag." works better that way, IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it *IS* a ban, then? Thanks for clearing that up, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. 😂  https://t.co/UNDTiReywD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a constitutional conservative starts bad mouthing @POTUS, you know we're going to the next level. Hold on kids, it's gonna get uglier!  https://t.co/jLJ4LWKQbi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"If Twitter is the information highway, then your images are the billboards." - wonderful insight from teammate @MegsArtTweet #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #ContentMarketing, remember that visuals are content, too! #socialtools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO, #contentmarketing is a natural progression for #sociamedia team. They see all content &amp; know what works @socialtoolssmmt #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SocialMedia is probably the only place in your marketing org w/ an immediate "feedback loop." Perfect! 👌 @socialtoolssmmt #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #SocialTools16, shout out 📢 to the greatest social team ever; @mhood5 @giarubbo @christinemjh @MegsArtTweet @14SaraMiller14  https://t.co/qoTwZUhDbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ContentMarketing is more than just creating content. It's integration. Are you talking out of both sides of your mouth? #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ContentMarketing usually aligns with business priorities. But what does your audience actually care about? @socialtoolssmmt #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data plays 2 roles in #contentmarketing; quality assurance &amp; delivering right message in right channel @socialtoolssmmt #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #contentmarketing, we focus on 3 things; data, integration &amp; storytelling. @socialtoolssmmt  #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I had to summarize #contentmarketing in 1 word, it's storytelling. @socialtoolssmmt #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard_Gans @2DanPhelps @Liza_Poulos Sorry, but @jsolly, @sassymarketeer &amp; I are at #SocialTools16 in San Jose.  https://t.co/r4ov1aYJLH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SponsoredContent success comes in 3 stages. Each builds on the one before it, so don't ask for $ if you're not ready. #PRNews @PRNews  https://t.co/dXwBSG3rzS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When sharing #SponsoredContent, integrate metrics w/ other marketing to show integration. Show where #socialmedia fits in. @PRNews #PRNews  https://t.co/XaD6KYDQs2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For our B2B biz, #SponsoredContent means lead gen, thought leadership, and LinkedIn. #PRNews @PRNews  https://t.co/OcQpTgObGD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROI of #socialmedia is essential for C-suite buy-in. Comparing it to ad spend is one approach to get $ value of your efforts #PRNews @PRNews  https://t.co/aVskNpvyEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our first step in getting budget for #SponsoredContent was evaluating our marketing spend in other areas for comparison. #PRNews @PRNews  https://t.co/hGqQtfWdTx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure you say you want buy-in, but do you know where #socialmedia fits into your overall marketing budget? #PRNews @PRNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Locker room talk? NO! As a straight male, he's lying. It's not! #debatenight #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's trying Soooooo hard to keep it together! #debatenight #debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Trump is going to bring up Bill Clinton's infidelities at the #debate. It's a final middle finger to the GOP. 🖕 Wow.  https://t.co/XHmhKxn5fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole weekend has been one long feeling of #schadenfreude about Trump. I have to wonder if that's gonna peak with the #debate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally relaxing after a long, but great, day at #SocialTools16. Thanks @NealSchaffer for having me. Had a blast!  https://t.co/hFDatasAM6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #SocialTools16 attendees, have questions about the business value of #sociamedia? Grab me and let's chat! @socialtoolssmmt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your listening tool is not a social tool, but a content and theme tool. Track themes and topics to influence content. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>B2B should balance quant metrics w/ qualitative metrics. Share not just numbers, but impact with influencers &amp; media. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need more budget for #sociamedia? Your competitors are other marketing efforts. Show value compared to ads, email, etc. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We actually compare social to advertising to give holistic "paid versus earned" approach. Leaders get it. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Showing the biz value of #sociamedia means having metrics that senior leaders care about. Clicks, likes, &amp; shares won't do. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROI is the Holy Grail of #sociamedia. Even the big brands don't have it all figured out. Just build your case and evolve. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to show biz value of #sociamedia? Get out of your silo. Integrate, integrate, integrate! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Showtime! Wish me luck! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iankeir1 @MrRyanConnors #SocialTools16 GIFs FTW!  https://t.co/q8it1GAl7Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really enjoying #SocialTools16, but remember folks, the best panel hasn't started yet! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that some folks have social listening and metrics professionals embedded in their teams. I'm jealous! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMacLeod @SlideShare Thanks! He spoke at the  https://t.co/wLSg70E1OO conference in January, and I got a copy then. Love him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @LeBlancly! I have a secret sauce!  https://t.co/dfqo6nNp0a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @NealSchaffer, thanks for reminding me that I still have a @briansolis book to read! #smartguy #SocialTools16  https://t.co/41z0RQ15xE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm on at 5:00, Steph. Wish me luck!  https://t.co/xDlxaindtn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get 1,000s of data points, but only 10 matter to me. - @cindymeltz # agreed #SocialTools16  https://t.co/OJeWzAisuV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenburbary 👊  https://t.co/CHpLrK3VS1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I export excel data into images and drop them into a PowerPoint. We use PPT for everything! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love all these mentions of Excel at #SocialTools16. Tools are great, but nothing beats a good spreadsheet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McDonald's bags just got real at #SocialTools16.  https://t.co/lffaHureGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chach77 YAAAAASSSSS! TACO TUESDAY!  https://t.co/HCm41KukTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaCSocial I'd be right there with you if it weren't for the 5:00 panel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@iankeir1 👊  https://t.co/ONIx5400Fy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Takeaway from the listening panel at #SocialTools16; data is great, but you need analysis for the win. Understanding is a necessity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying #SocialTools16, but I'm missing an afternoon taco bar at my son's daycare today. TACOS, you guys!  https://t.co/Jyqhreum9s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social listening means no longer listening to just brand mentions, but your whole industry. - via @cindymeltz #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visual listening is akin to social listening, but for visual content. - via Todd Grossman of @Talkwalker #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sociallyclimb #NoRestraint  https://t.co/FSPvYcuRX0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the Yeti, @Talkwalker. My 5 year old will love it! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/9NQVvRgGJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Digging the #socialtini at #SocialTools16. Not sure if it was a good idea before my panel at 5:00, but we'll see...  https://t.co/vnX183hfnT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social selling = personal branding + employee advocacy (via @Amanda_Healy).  Spot on. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtfelton @Amanda_Healy Chief of Staff is our preferred route. Often Millennials who are power users of social.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"C Suite requires the most handholding." #truth (Via @Amanda_Healy) #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A follow and a new like isn't a lead." Couldn't have said it better myself, @KarenLoueez #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key takeaway from #B2B panel at #SocialTools16 ; no more auto responses when people follow you (&amp; change that LinkedIn invite to connect)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easter eggs in email signatures! Genius! @Amanda_Healy  #SocialTools16  https://t.co/CR6PclVKJn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"People want to buy from people who are like them." #B2B #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lead generation, yay @JenniferAShore! 👊 Us too! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tessgionet Lord, I hope so...  https://t.co/iZaQ232cjg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to the #socialselling panel at #SocialTools16 confirms our whole employee strategy. (Great minds think alike, AmIRite?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>B2B has been slow to adopt social for us, too. It's changing, but sloooooooowwwwly. I think it's a common problem. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social selling in B2B let's you stay top of mind with buyers. (aka - "Skate to where the puck is") #SocialTools16  https://t.co/gGrWKJ0nSV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You snooze, you lose, @NealSchaffer!  https://t.co/A7CQroFew0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pro tip: Never come to a #sociamedia conference without your charger. ::facepalm:: 😡 #SocialTools16  https://t.co/8h6CAJWFK8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @WayneNH so delicately implied, become friends with Legal. #SocialTools16 #SocialMedia #BestPractices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRHickey Yeah, cause that always works!  https://t.co/Thl1zh9Slv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afraid so... #SocialTools16 (Thank @WayneNH for the analogy.)  https://t.co/V5CXIQRHjE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If social media is a 10 yr old, that makes us the parent of a moody kid who still needs us but will never admit it. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honesty and transparency are key with influencers. Don't hide your affiliation! Via  Wayne Kurtzman of @PitneyBowes  #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Influencer marketing is really Advertising at the core." via @MrRyanConnors   Yes! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of discussion around trust with this influencer panel. Not sure it's been mentioned it yet, but it's a key theme. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to influencers, quality trumps quantity. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brand sentiment is a great long-term metric for B2B influencer marketing. Media pickups are also helpful. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Represent @linaroque! #B2Bissexy #SocialTools16 👊  https://t.co/NxE6va6fSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cspenn 👍  https://t.co/ZlfhN0dtZJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With influencers, you can often fake "live content." Pre-written and scheduled content can be a great first step! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Curse of knowledge = "Just optimize your campaign to get the most engagement with repeat customers who prefer Instagram." #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving @cspenn message at #SocialTools16. TL;DR? Evolve.  https://t.co/vaQNxDlpg0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethGoodtime Awesomeness. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of you who hate the @cspenn idea of "science," feel free to replace that with "test and learn." #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those playing along at home... #SocialTools16 @cspenn  https://t.co/mil3f4ePYq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironically, we suffer from information overload, yet need to take time to learn and grow by reading. @cspenn #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The leading innovation framework. @cspenn #SocialTools16  https://t.co/uwJKZIUxyP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ingredients for innovation. #SocialTools16 @cspenn  https://t.co/JpKpMsRh3D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeBlancly Yes! Agreed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else find autoplay annoying? I hate it as much as pop up ads! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Short video can be impactful! Think of it as teaser content. Post it and pull people into the deep dive content. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of us in "non sexy" industries, maybe we should make them more interesting. #SocialTools16  https://t.co/virtjMgKvv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys, what about making memes on the fly? #SocialTools16  https://t.co/2M0b0wxvsr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. Personally, I won't even sit through the commercials on my DVR of The Walking Dead! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/kKTvmMpOpT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still working to make memes a legit part of FinServ brands. 😂 #NotHoldingMyBreath #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The jury's out on long form video, IMO. Ask yourself, do I need 45 min to tell my story? #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iankeir1 Take it! Credit goes to @MegsArtTweet! Hi Meg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion, live streaming is today, interactive video (like @periscope) is the future. Video won't be just one way!#SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As our designer says, "If your Twitter feed is the highway, images are the billboards!" #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRHickey 👍  https://t.co/k0KWwc3v1J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GRTs (@GORUCK) FTW! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/UAJp0l9RfC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cc_chapman Let's chat! I'm at table 11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We recently changed our visual strategy after some tests. Turns out simpler photos and charts aren't always engaging. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRHickey We do not, primarily because we're a regulated industry. Happy to talk. #ItsComplicated #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love seeing all the #sociamedia professionals who have backgrounds in creative roles! Creatives FTW! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/thQI46rEeF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kehutchinson 👊  https://t.co/KRIZpgNbc1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were fortunate to have @buffer coach our #employeeadvocacy team on the tool for personal use. #SocialTools16  https://t.co/DIvUabqzzu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, a shout out for @buffer at #SocialTools16! Love it and use it religiously!  https://t.co/mJTMXbJx0Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks Facebook for making the platform "pay to play" for brands. Diminishing returns without paid content. Ugh. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For B2B, part of content success is lead generation - not just web metrics. Supporting the web is great, but we can do more. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure I'm going to ask @pgillin to record my phone's voice mail message. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Content marketers used to be "integrators" before we realized what they did. Too many marketing managers are siloed. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#contentmarketing fail.  https://t.co/kmEE8bzYhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also get more engagement on weekends, @kehutchinson! "Right message, right time!" It's a huge win for marketers. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Challenge accepted, @NealSchaffer! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/PbnILj2wOv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My takeaway from the content panel? Content Marketing is part art form, part moving target. On the upside, job security! #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Content Marketing is not just about channels, but themes and topics. Know what content works, and where it performs best. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really rethinking my choice of headshot as I see myself on the leaderboard at #SocialTools16. 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially in B2B. It's all about thought leadership! #SocialTools16  https://t.co/XaLJeNt1rX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Everything is noise. Stand out from the noise!" @kehutchinson #SocialTools16  https://t.co/xr5Zn8yZP0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Engagement drop is not about increased content, but that *everyone* is on the bandwagon. Storytelling no longer stands out. #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see other former journos in #sociamedia. Sometimes I feel like the only one! #SocialTools16 @Nicolette_O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, stop the conference. My new Starbucks rewards app is here. #coffeeaddict #SocialTools16 #ImSerious  https://t.co/3jc9cVJsLV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embedding tweets in blog was a nice win for us. Integrates social with the web. Highly recommended. #SocialTools16  https://t.co/Y1zS52yUVH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>? How much of content creation is "atomization" versus unique content? #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think @pgillin sounds like an NPR host? (That's a compliment, BTW.) #SocialTools16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emily_bane Radford? I'm a native Richmonder. Undergrad at VCU. MBA from William and Mary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@linaroque  https://t.co/N6ig4wdmqq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing lots of folks echo this idea at #SocialTools16 ; #employeeadvocacy is about culture change. It doesn't happen overnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one ever woke up and said "I'm so glad Brand X is on Facebook." Individuals have a greater impact. #SocialTools16  https://t.co/vEVZtmZaqW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@oysterpig Deal! Sorry it didn't work out. I know it's nearly impossible to just up and do something with a small one at home. No worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oysterpig Got it. Already made plans for tomorrow night, unfortunately, and the day starts at 8 am. Weds flight is 9 am, so not much time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oysterpig My flight arrives at 5. Can you do something this evening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oysterpig I get in around dinner time tonight, and head back Wed morning. How close are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #SocialTools16 folks, my colleague @christinemjh will be joining me, as well. Feel free to loop her in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was 1991, and here we are remembering an awesome actor that folks never lost interest in. I wonder if he was surprised by that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She said he was enjoying it, but didn't take it too seriously and that someday soon it would fade away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She said that he was a stage actor fairly well known in the UK, but that he was suddenly the talk of tinseltown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember her saying how her uncle was shocked by all the attention he got in #Hollywood after the Robin Hood movie with Kevin Costner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeanneStewart @SusannahBirch Absolutely. 100% correct. In fact, I teach these concepts to our #employeeadvocacy team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeanneStewart @SusannahBirch Just read a frightening article on Instagram stage mothers here in the US. Yikes!  https://t.co/a364ToSC4W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeanneStewart @SusannahBirch Yes, and the human race has not fully realized the psychological and societal impacts of this space. Scary.<|endoftext|>
