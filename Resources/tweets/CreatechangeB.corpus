<|startoftext|>Rich countries, including Canada, have bought too many COVID-19 vaccines: Amnesty  https://t.co/KldlSxv4yl Canada will donate the left over vaccines to the poor countries that need them. 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Reality vs what you are saying. The US population is 331M so a lot of people won’t get vaccinated Trump didn’t procure enough vaccines.  https://t.co/kbQluhe415<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump had a chance to procure 500 million vaccine doses that would inoculate 250 million Americans.  He refused bought instead a 100 million that will inoculate 50 million people.  Fase 1 - Pfizer sent 50 Million doses 25 million people will get the vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Have a read...  https://t.co/PpF0VGD3kb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid vaccine: U.S. passed on more Pfizer doses in November, says board member Gottlieb  https://t.co/8Omk0AGfWt @GeraldoRivera<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet If Assange ever got extradited to the US he would face 17 charges of spying and 1 of hacking. Good luck to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Apparently the young man’s parents wanted to exchange Julian Assange for that CIA agent. So that she can be trialed in England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Here this is what I found. Remember that CIA agent that went to England and had a car accident that resulted in a young man’s death? She than fled to the US to avoid murder charges.  https://t.co/CvNTlUXOuL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet I’m not sure i need to read see what I can find out. Because if that was the case than a pardon from Trump will have no legal standing in the British courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet How can Trump pardon him if he is in an English jail?!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 I want that to happen. Trump is so much worse than Nixon was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JKDAnthony10 @JohnA_USMCvet @emptywheel He Totally is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You went totally off the deep end into the right shameful and disgusting.   Assange helped elect Trump and look what is happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @JKDAnthony10 @emptywheel 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assange is a criminal period. He helped Trump win an election and now Trump is using a quid pro quo’s to release him from prison.   What Assange did was create a rift and death in America his actions had much bigger implications. He helped elect a racist murderer dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @JKDAnthony10 @emptywheel I fucking despise him. To see  left separatist Ryan knight defend him. Turns my stomach 🤮<|endoftext|>

Implementation of covid safety measures helped save many lives, we also had CERB so that families don’t starve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Israel peace push? Since when was Morocco ever at war with Israel?!!! Or the UAE and Bahrain at war with Israel?!!! Caution with the wording... as it is misleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteNorman10 I Absolutely agree with you. Ivanka is deliberately lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has not been an agreement of peace between any of these countries.  They have established military cooperation and it’s unclear of a full diplomatic relations between these countries.  This is a blatant lie designed to rail Trumps base and give Trump undeserved credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On October 23rd 2020 Israel agreed to normalize its diplomatic relations with Sudan.  Under a “Normalization agreement “ it was unclear if the deal established full diplomatic relations between the two countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Israel -Morocco were never at war.   Israel -UAE &amp; Bahrain signed military alliances not peace deals.  Since none of these countries were ever at war.   Your misinformation is intended to influence your dad’s uninformed base.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrDumbDum @johnoco27453655 @Bella_DonnaC @alexsalvinews @KamVTV @brianstelter I’m surprised that he hasn’t blocked us yet bc that’s what they usually do when they are losing an argument. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ah121254 @Lissthesassy @MLedaloo @co_rapunzel4 Who’s threatening who? Your president threatens his citizens on a daily basis takes money from your donations and pockets them.

<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @KNDmex @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @LadyRaven3 @Alysson @aliinct @CarrolCoMd @Hollywhodat Mark Burnett being willing to give Trump and his base a voice regardless of him losing it’s all about getting him ready for 2024. I can see that happening that is why I think Trump staying out of prison is so dangerous. Trump and Burnett are motivated by money and TV ratings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lissthesassy @WilliamPine2 @LoraFisherPOV So true Liss I barely slept I remember waking up at 4:00 am to check my cell for news on the elections. Maddening...never once in my life I cared so much about Americas fate as I did this time. 💖<|endoftext|>

What that monster did and is doing to you all the danger he represents scares me. To think that we are safe in Canada from something like that happening would be arrogant of me.

<|startoftext|>@WilliamPine2 @Lissthesassy @LoraFisherPOV I feel that in society we all have the responsibility to help each other out. Giving love to others is the most rewarding feeling ever. This kid is now becoming an electrician so is my son, they are both already working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamPine2 @Lissthesassy @LoraFisherPOV My sons best friend mother suffers from mental illness &amp; abandons their  home from time to time and he  was forced to grow up faster than most kids due to having to help taking care of his younger sister and help his dad around the house. So I would take them to school every day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Actually Prison isn’t much of a punishment for Trump and Stephen Miller.  What they did to the Asylum seekers through their bogus policies is enough reason to send those two straight to the death penalty. Baby’s in cages and parents without them. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamPine2 @Lissthesassy @LoraFisherPOV I love when man listen and trust women. That means they were well brought up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WilliamPine2 @Lissthesassy Liss said Biden would win. He did ... she said Kamala would be his VP she is. When she says that Dems will flip the senate I believe that she is right again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lissthesassy @WilliamPine2 Yes 👏🏽 when you say it it’s a sealed deal. 💥💥💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet It’s their racism ,lying and cheating ways that I have a problem with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lissthesassy These two had a tete a tete last evening in a WH meeting. If he gets fired I’m not sure what will happen next. Who would Trump install!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 Yes!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 I sure agree. As long none of the founding mothers were called Kelly Loeffler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 I agree Rap. Trump and his aides will bring nothing but harm to you all. He must go to prison. This guy is the most dangerous man in the world right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch I truly believe that Trump is getting ready to build an army to bulldoze Biden’s presidency. He will stop at nothing and the danger in in the masses that believe in his lies are willing to kill innocent people to please him. He will unleash nothing but grief to you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump must go to prison. The damage he can infringe upon your country if he doesn’t! will be on a massive scale considered terrorism. He is the American version of Al-Qaeda. Trump is building his own army to bulldoze Biden’s presidency and kill innocent people in that process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only cheating happening during the election  is on the Republikans side. As always what’s new?!!!<|endoftext|>

If this is true! can you imagine what is going to happen? Trump will do everything to  instigate his base against President Biden and destabilize his government including more violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLedaloo I’m with you on that as well. I want to see him rotting in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zei_squirrel Thank you I hadn’t seen this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you dared to ask for a PARDON you were before the entire world admitting your GUILT AS A TRAITOR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump and his criminal goonies are leaving a chaos behind lots of treason, self loathing, tons of negligence and lies.    Now they all want to be pardoned? for what! If they claim to have done nothing wrong.   Isn’t asking for pardon the same as admitting guilt?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @KNDmex @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @LadyRaven3 @Alysson @aliinct @CarrolCoMd @Hollywhodat Trumps plan all along to have someone appointed to come destabilize Biden’s Presidency with an investigation that won’t clear his name as a traitor to his country.

<|startoftext|>@BohemianBeads1 @yossi_melman @realDonaldTrump I thought the same if Trump posted this he might have had his tiny fingers in this assassination. Using the US military has a personal militia something he’s done before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yossi_melman @realDonaldTrump Is Trump going to claim responsibility for his death too? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CheriDiNovo @Sflecce I completely agree that schools have to be one of the main reasons we are having such a covid outbreak my husband and I see the kids without masks playing and walking around all the time we all know that kids don’t have proper hand hygiene either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alienmagicman Are you ??? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good👏🏽keep him in prison. He obviously doesn’t care about protecting other people’s lives more than he cares to protect his own. At this point he is a public health safety hazard and a danger to himself as well. He needs a psychiatric evaluation before being let out of prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDecoste Calling him a hero and criminals a hero bc they defy public health covid safety guidelines is an outrage and an insult to the lives lost to covid. Yes, bc he’s white let’s praise him while he helps kill others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RocklynDude @realDonaldTrump I hate him so much that I could never agree with him. The only thing is he asked for people not to vote by mail. Mail in ballots are still counted by hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s exactly what Putin is waiting for...You and Trump are preparing the road for Putin to take over Afghanistan.  Wow! the election fraud distraction is working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯💯💯💯  https://t.co/zBZyxdfRC7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The voting machines were installed by the Republicans. I don’t know what you are complaining about. Either way wouldn’t have won this election. You also told your supporters to not vote by mail Stop using Canada as your point of reference you have a population of 331M vs our 38M.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada has a population of 37,742,154 Million VS 331Million Americans voting machines and mail in ballots are necessary in the US.   The mail in fraud come from the Republican side not the Democratic side.   I voted by mail in our last provincial elections. Stop the lies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benshapiro I will say that hungry Texans should line up outside your Presidents WH instead of the food bank. I would like to see  if he would feed them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @aliinct @LadyRaven3 @Hollywhodat No one elected by the people into the highest office of the land should be given under no circumstances such power. Of pardoning himself or any of his immediate family or circle of friends. That in itself should be considered a betrayal and a crime against the people’s interests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @aliinct @LadyRaven3 @Hollywhodat I agree with you John. My biggest fear right now is that Bolton said Trump as the authority to pardon himself and his family before leaving the presidency. I was completely unaware he could do that. The US Constitutional laws sure need to be revisited and changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @aliinct @LadyRaven3 @Hollywhodat True!☝🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @aliinct @LadyRaven3 @Hollywhodat Putin already gave permission for oil companies to drill the Baltic Sea. Trump follows into the same footsteps in Alaska and they voted for him. Destruction of Wildlife and environmental protection isn’t in Alaskans list of priorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @Wendilea8 @aliinct @LadyRaven3 @Hollywhodat Of course I knew he would do that. We talked about this since the binging of Trumps presidency. That’s one of the many reasons Trump sees Putin as an Allie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShellWatTheHell @NorthBelle4 I’m so sorry for her behaviour as I do condone it. You didn’t do anything wrong. A lot of people don’t really know the history behind Mission’s most famous park. We are here to use this platform to inform others as well. Since I live near by Mission I’m aware of its history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShellWatTheHell @NorthBelle4 Your aunt and friend I’m sorry for her passing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohmedMenisy Fraud? according  to Trump I don’t believe in what he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShellWatTheHell @NorthBelle4 I’m so sorry for the passing of your friend. Yes, a lot of people aren’t aware of the Fraser River Heritage Park having a cemetery on their grounds. They also had a residential school along with a church. Which is why the priests get buried on those grounds. Quite an history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohmedMenisy Biden was elected we shall see...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 @ShellWatTheHell Evil bastards - I’m referring to the abusive priests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohmedMenisy People come from different places from around the world they should live to care about each other not hate one another. Helping each other out. Trump and his supporters are arrogant and ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohmedMenisy One of my co workers and friend was from Ethiopia and she sponsored over a hundred people to this country through her church. I met her priest once a very honourable man. She passed away in a very unfortunate way but her kindness will leave on forever. She was a Muslim. 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShellWatTheHell @NorthBelle4 Mission has a large community of indigenous peoples &amp; yes they don’t protest to remove those evil bastards from their park. I reached out to the Mission Mayor but she didn’t care to respond. To have them removed and relocated bc it’s disturbing to the community to have them there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohmedMenisy How sad is this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 @NorthBelle4 Truly messed up even in Angola my sisters schools were all ran by the church and the nuns. They spoke hill of them hated school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 @BupeNgoy We were given the choice to became refugees in South Africa my dad being Angolan wanted to go there but my mom being Portuguese decided otherwise and off we all went to Portugal instead. South Africa is a gorgeous place I’m sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 In Mission BC the evil priests from the residential school are buried in the Fraser River Heritage Park 🤬makes me sick to my stomach.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NotToday0299 Trump is trying to rain on everyone’s parade and not abide by the rules. He deserves prison and so do all his enablers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deanpeter1 @steveasumner I agree. Trump is now replacing his entire cabinet to obstruct the transfer of power to the elect president Joe Biden. Barr is navigating this entire coup against Democracy by helping Trump I’m sure of it. Truly despicable and obstruction of the law. They are all Criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is replacing his entire cabinet to obstruct the rule of law. Bill Barr is teaching him well.  They both, along with the entire (R) party decided to keep every Democratic voter captive and not concede transfer of power to Joe Biden your rightful President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettyisdrunk My God! this is an obstruction he must be removed. He is turning every Democratic voter captive you are all his prisoners. MFK’R!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @KNDmex @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct Truly appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork In Canada 🍁Fox news isn’t allowed. We don’t consider a propagandist reality tv network to be worthy to exist in our country. We take journalistic integrity very serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork No, isn’t that simple! you are declaring Biden’s voters prisoners when they haven’t done anything wrong and are trying to save lives and their rights. Your notion that a bully should be allowed to allude a false election result is preposterous. Trump is criminal a coward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork @realDonaldTrump Truly despicable! never in the US history have you ever had a candidate win over the other with such an incredible and powerful margin. Making excuses to allow a criminal bully not concede and continue to declare the American voters prisoners of this evil is unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You never in American political history had a candidate win with such an historic margin over his opponent like Biden.   YOU ALSO  NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT REFUSE TO CONCEDE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE.   Stop making excuses for this bully negligent racist rapist criminal president to stay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand how the US allows a white supremacist propagandist network. This is not journalism. Now they want a revolution are calling for what? a civil war? it’s okay to propagate hatred on TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct Wow, I knew that Trump was going to make things hard but for every single one of these bastards to defend him like the cowards they are its quite disturbing and tragic. I guess the money will run out w/t Trump in the presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @KNDmex @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct Republicans are behaving like the Russian Comrades it’s a dictatorship just like Putin amending Russia’s constitution to rule forever, Republicans are doing the exact same thing by contesting this election. Changing the rules to overturn the rightful next president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KNDmex @sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct @GSAEmily Thank you KND for informing me. This is despicable absolutely disgusting what this people are doing. Dirty tricks won’t go far. They are trying hard to cheat again. MFK’s While Barr is in hiding or doing the dirty work from behind closed doors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @KNDmex @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct All these Republicans Trump enablers deserve to be handcuffed for contesting the election results without any legal basis to stand on,while using all your tax dollars. What a waste of money during a pandemic where people are dying &amp; getting sick. People that can’t afford care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @Hollywhodat @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @Alysson @Wendilea8 @KNDmex @LadyRaven3 @tech_52 @aliinct But I’m fuming about Lindsey Graham going to Maria Bartiromo saying that 15 Dead people voted for Biden and that’s one of the reasons he told Trump not to concede. In fact he got the numbers wrong 238K dead people dictated the fate of this election in Biden’s favor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 also the electoral college votes were 273 Biden to 214 Trump so he cannot contest that in the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greendeb333 Also the media was allowed inside the polling places while the mail in ballots were being counted. There is no fraud evidence it’s all false. Trump is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bill_dacey Border is still closed for non essential travellers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greendeb333 The only problem is that one of his supporters almost attacked on of our CBC news reporters. She wasn’t wearing a mask and said that Biden mail in ballots appeared overnight after the election brainwashing cultists are full of hatred. The journalist had to back way from her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 I thought that he could only contest the election results if they were less then  4% of a losing margin. There is no chance that he can be re elected with a big loss in votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen up dude I hope that TV networks don’t give you any airtime. Biden deserves all the airtime from now on, it’s over move out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@conorjrogers @ProjectLincoln I’m very glad that the @ProjectLincoln helped Dems gather R votes @AOC is being ungrateful and what has she done to help Biden bc as far I remember she backed  Bernie and didn’t see her on the campaign trail either on the other end Stacey Abrams helped flip Georgia Blue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nikki_2978 @Stardusty0407 @AOC @ProjectLincoln Same here I’m feeling disgusted by her  attitude thing is they helped more than Bernie did and herself included. Many Bernie supporters didn’t vote for Joe Biden some voted for Kanye 🤣which it was a vote for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump you are a sore loser declared victory too soon... Democrats voted by mail to follow Covid guidelines unlike your voters that don’t care about infecting everyone. You know very well there is no cheating happening on the Dems side. The cheating is all on your side.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexandraChalup He has a group of people here in Vancouver sitting outside a Canadian Chinese man’s house harassing him and protesting for over two weeks accusing this man of being a Chinese spy. The RCMP has done nothing to protect this man bc they claim the protesters to be non violent. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swalter255 🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fire_goddess @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettyisdrunk This is all about Trump not going to prison. He doesn’t care about any of you or the economy or bringing back health care. This is all about power money his greed his pride the guy is a narcissist sociopath. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @TeriRobins2 Biden wins and you all need to change the voting system get rid of electoral college and to make sure a president cannot assassinate Democracy ever again like Trump is doing. Democrats should be able to remove Trump bf him going to Barr to have this election invalidated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We saw this coming... we knew that Trump would run to Barr to invalidate this election, if he lost to Biden. What I would like to know is what are Democrats going to do about this? Bc a president can’t be allowed to assassinate Democracy &amp; the people’s voting choice. Remove Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett Republicans are happily assassinating Democracy. It was expected to happen since Trump said he would contest the election results we all saw this coming. Biden will get elected and Trump will not leave until Barr does everything in his power to invalidate this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OctopusCaveman Both Mitch and Lindsey aka-Lady “G” should have their re elections investigated bc I doubt they won fair and square.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisTwitIsLit Yes, he was! and suddenly the money landed on his lap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda I one hundred percent agree. Who The hell cares about that system it’s completely unfair and confusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrMania007 @staceyabrams Very well said. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 Thank you ✊🏼♥️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Red_eyedjedi 🤣🤣🤣👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lindsey Graham needs to be investigated how did he get re-elected? where is all this donation money suddenly coming from? was there a Russia back channel? soon enough we will learn that Lady “G” might live inside Putin’s closet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgpfl @colonelclark @FBI How does he go about talking of beheading people? he is a terrorist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgpfl @colonelclark @FBI I believe that yes, he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sewms1992 @colonelclark @FBI Steve Bannon is acting like a terrorist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@weathershore11 @resisteIIe He also loves to suck on middle fingers.  https://t.co/7u4ZAQjoYs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrest him. @FBI Arrest Steve Bannon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now is the time for Republicans to stand up to their president and accept Trump is losing. There is no fraud in counting  absentee ballots or counting mail in ballots. It’s a Democratic electoral process, Trump and his family are pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda What makes me even more furious is that he is threatening taking his lawsuit at the high courts w his R judges to bail him out and give him a win. No way... 🤬🤬🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda True Leda totally disgusting what this MFK’R is doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accept your defeat stop lying you don’t have any evidence of voter fraud. You told all your supporters not to vote by mail that it was a fraudulent System. Now you threaten the Democratic process of an election. By going to the courts that are full of your R judges. SOB you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 He doesn’t know how to lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom 💥 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼✊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump loves to suck on my middle finger. 🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/D02cZfJirg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are blaming your fellow Americans for trying hard to defeat that cheating MFK’R in the WH. After what  he’s doing to all of you right now, once again! I guess you feel it’s better to have given ur vote to him by not voting for Biden. Are you Happy NOW? 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet She for sure has, and all she did was to warn everyone of the evil lurking around the corner. She doesn’t deserve to be in prison for being a whistleblower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Biden will do something about Reality Winner once he gets a chance to address it. He is a wonderful man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 Trump is the law 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 I know...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m mad that I had to delete my previous tweet bc Twitter would have probably suspended me for my use of foul language. But my blood is boiling since I can’t see how Democracy can stand amongst  all this cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 Truly sad I’m beyond mad that Trump and the GOP are cheating their way into trying to forcibly win this election. Where is the law in all this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 Yes bc they would probably suspend my account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an attack of the Democratic process of having a fair election. These cheaters are despicable and vile humans even w all their gerrymandering they still can’t accept losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder You all are feeling super desperate and despicably trying to cheat this election. Did you really think that people were that stupid? that they would allow ur prez to kill all of them? Wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop with the fake BS Steven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone trying hard to cheat and telling voters to vote twice in this election has been your president and the GOP. What a bunch of loser cultist followers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict that by tomorrow evening once we learn Biden will be the next President, Trump will retreat into his beloved BUNKER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch @TwitterSupport Done ✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan You are too kind calling this cheating murderous monster Mr. President bc so far I haven’t seen it neither as the American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ektaka @perlmutations Actually Mitch approval rate in Kentucky is only 14% how did he won? those machines must have been rigged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God your prediction was another big fat lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodSaveAmerica Amen to that 🙏🏼♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers I remember Trump tweeting urging his supporters to vote twice. Mail in ballots and going to the polls in person as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilNasX @Nevada LilNas Trumps supporters were told to vote twice so the state of Nevada needs to make sure people aren’t voting for Trump twice as a woman in the press conference did. She voted for Tump twice which is a felony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 My advise to you all is please be aware and stay safe, Trump is willing to create a civil war to have his way into cheating and refuse to leave the Presidency. Staying vigilant for your safety is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 Even Canada is being influenced by anti maskers since the US started protesting against it. People are influenced by bullies even without having a full picture ab what they are protesting against. They don’t like being told to follow rules to protect others. I see them as savages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 They have been given permission by Trump to became bullies. So they no longer have to hide their hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is no longer tweeting this morning 🤣how did he think Americans would allow him to stay in power after losing 234K lives due to his negligence.  I would love to see Dems control the senate as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstylock1015 I share the same feeling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KodoHappy Wow 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Report this tweet , report every Trump tweet spreading misinformation and threatening to take legal action against the electoral  democratic process. This is the time for all of you Resisters to act do not allow this monster to have his way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 Unfortunately I have to agree w you. Just seeing Trumps supporters sends chills down my spine. The hatred they display is unacceptable in our days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Appleknocker18 Because you have a terrorist as a president and gun laws that need to be implemented in order to protect other civilians and public safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not final the votes are still being counted how can you claim a victory in Pennsylvania already? STFU already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes 👏🏼 I love 💗 Colorado.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda Anyone showing up to the polls w guns should be seen as an act of terrorism period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any civilized country should be against the use of guns to intimidate others and see it as an act of terrorism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet @mydoggyruss Great question I would love to know that as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There  you have it right here in this tweet. I agree with you Dan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet has been flagged 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JV_Dzhuga @Twitter I also have an alt account w 14 followers the problem is my tweets there don’t get any attention. I figured the more ppl. I unfollow the less exposure my tweets will get. At least for now I need my followers to give me a voice. Since this isn’t over until Trump is out of the WH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JV_Dzhuga @Twitter I unfollowed a hundred people and there is still so many left that follow him. Still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 @RevJohnboy If I may add completely wrong and why is twitter allowing this behaviour on their platform they are acting like Zuckerberg trying to influence and sway people’s perceptions about the election. The only one cheating is Trump he wants to start a civil war. You all stay safe please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JV_Dzhuga @Twitter Thank you Joe for doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JV_Dzhuga @Twitter I wish you know I still see a lot of resisters following Trump he has gained more followers since yesterday which I don’t understand how can anyone follow such an evil monster  like him. Makes me upset. He deserves a massive volume of unfollows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Joe Biden is the winner  since he’s ahead in Nevada.   Why can’t you just shut the F*CK UP.   Start moving out bastard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JYSexton This is what savages and barbaric criminals do they will eat their own to try save their skins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichiefromGR I feel the same way but I guess they might think it’s easier to see his tweets bc shows up in their feed. Instead of having to look for his handle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet John as you know I’m not a practising Catholic but last night and todayi have been asking God to help Joe Biden and all of you win. For him to watch over your country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aleluia prays the Lord 🙏🏼Thank you God. I believe in kindness and compassion I can’t imagine your country voting for evil to remain in power that cannot be possible. God and Bo must be watching over you and I know he would be so proud of his dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Democrat is cheating this election Trump is notorious to cheat at every chance he gets America can’t be evil the majority of people must be good not evil to vote for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not strange to have ballots appear these are mail in ballots that weren’t allowed by certain states to be counted early. Your Republikans made sure to  Gerrymander many states including your friend USPS DeJoy. Don’t insinuate cheating bc you are the one attempting to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DC_Draino These are mail in ballots they were already there but needed to be counted republicans didn’t authorize an early vote count that’s the truth don’t misconstrue it to fit your narrative. Cheating elections is something Republikans are very good at. DeJoy is gerrymandering the USPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May your words became true because I can’t fathom how evil can people be to vote for someone like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurDIY Rescued by my niece from under a car today this Canadian blondie just got a new home today💖She is ready to give you all some emotional support after her ordeal was over.  https://t.co/28MDnQnM5s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mileslunn @CalgaryRugbyDad @theJagmeetSingh O’Toole is a an extension of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darbyTL @sailorgirl2017 @theJagmeetSingh That’s true he does flip flop a lot unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darbyTL @sailorgirl2017 @theJagmeetSingh Yes, Trudeau team did an amazing job dealing w Trumps crooks I can’t wait for them to be gone. I got Trudeau’s back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darbyTL @sailorgirl2017 @theJagmeetSingh But at least he is still backing Trudeau and didn’t  send us to early elections. For that I’m grateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Do your thing America vote regain the souls of your country your people. Vote for all your lives vote for your dignity tolerance and honesty. Vote for Democracy for all the lives lost to covid they cannot vote but you can. Vote to save your loved ones. Vote for Joe Biden. 🙏🏼💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sailorgirl2017 @theJagmeetSingh I disagree Page!  he has every right to have a voice and let the world know how he feels. As we all do. He isn’t jeopardizing a Can/US relations bc Trump already took advantage of our nafta agreement. We have nothing  else to lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulDereume @realDonaldTrump @Trump The only reason I’m not retweeting this it’s bc I promised that today im focusing on giving  Biden all my tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PRubesa @PaulDereume @realDonaldTrump @Trump Him and his entire family I may add.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Trump can seek asylum in Nigeria they will happily take him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PRubesa @PaulDereume @realDonaldTrump @Trump My thoughts exactly 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBS_Herridge @CBSNews @mkaplantv My thoughts right away soon that I heard  about these robocalls Russia is hard at work to suppress US Biden votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I refuse to give Magas a platform to give Trump one as well. All my tweets are focussing on Biden. Let’s do this America let’s get Biden to win the presidency.   Please don’t RT Trumps propagandist tweets today.   Thank you 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won’t be leaving Twitter until Trump is thrown in jail. Regardless of the outcome of this election. That MFK’r must pay for all  his crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda @4a_of Same here...I won’t be leaving twitter until Trump is thrown in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these babies must be reunited with their parents. I’m hoping this election and Biden wining, will mean that human rights violations! are to be taken serious and that Trump, will stand trial for his heartless negligence and corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I could vote in the US elections I would cast my vote for  JOE BIDEN=LOVE=LIFE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shamils18 @carolecadwalla Please don’t say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m stressed about the US elections...yes, because in part Canadian CONS adopted Trumps negligent covid rhetoric and propagandist lying ways.   It matters that the US regains  control of the soul of their nation.   People’s LIVES should MATTER MORE than LIES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @DiamondLynne1 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s a cause for state of emergency during a pandemic the daily COVID cases in Toronto are a 1000 per day. Every anti masker should be charged for their covid hospital treatment. Let’s make that MANDATORY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KodoHappy Me too I have to work at risk everyday it’s getting insane right now here in Canada 🇨🇦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government being tyrannical really? you should try work in a hospital full of COVID patients while trying to prevent yourself  from getting infected.   What the hell are you talking about??? Anti mask Rallies during a pandemic! should be considered a crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is happening in Canada!  I’m heartbroken over this lack of respect towards HCW first responders and general population. We are in a pandemic the daily rise of COVID is very concerning and Conservatives anti maskers are criminals willing to kill everyone around them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 😂👏🏼🙏🏼💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 I couldn’t be prouder of them. 👏🏼You know Lynne American women might have to do the same in the worst case scenario but I’m truly hoping that Biden wins tonight. 🙏🏼💖<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don’t believe him. He will prematurely declare himself president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 Since their kids aren’t inside cages like the kids at Trumps concentration camps. In my opinion their perspective isn’t any different since they are voting for another dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 Hopefully their different perspective doesn’t get in the way of change for the better. Since their kids aren’t inside cages like the kids at Trumps concentration camps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 Well Portugal was under a 40 yrs dictatorship from Salazar that was friends w Hitler and Mussolini and yes, it took the Portuguese all these years to embrace socialism once they realized that the conservative right was just as bad as the communist Salazar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 Because as a progressive I don’t think that you would agree with them. All they need is to educate themselves about socialism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 John do you agree with them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 Yes, Cubans went and still are going through a lot under a dictatorship but Trump represents that same dictatorship. I mean... Putin is more right leaning as well and he is going to stay in power forever. Poisons every opponent,Trump is right up there when it comes to negligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hootdad @Samuraisurfer53 @co_rapunzel4 I disagree... it’s not understandable when Trump is the enemy of the people and they should be able to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r_graus @co_rapunzel4 Amen. Portugal is doing so much better under socialism than they did under the conservative right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r_graus @co_rapunzel4 Yes, because they are afraid of socialism wt realizing isn’t the same as communism. Trump is as much of a dictator as Fidel Castro was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nokialumia45 @co_rapunzel4 Trump planned this on purpose I’m sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 A CBC news reporter went to Florida to interview some voters I was shocked to learn that most people from Cuba are voting for Trump. Him, that hates immigrants and all latinos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 What this is so sickening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess some cultist people can’t stand the HEAT.  The truth hurts, but losing 236,373 lives due to her cult  leader’s covid negligence hurts so much more.  https://t.co/0bU2A9KBdh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@media_auntie @fransaundersays @PalmerReport Trump brought a lot of us women together against him. For sure that many friendships got forged here on twitter throughout this whole ordeal. I can vouch for having made real friends  here. I can’t wait for this pandemic to be over to finally be able to meet them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettyisdrunk @FBI I had not seen this...he admitted to being a perv on national television? and doesn’t get arrested for possessing child pornography.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should be more outraged over Trump owing money to the banks. His use of tax payer dollars to pay for his golfing trips to Florida and the current rape court case Barr is defending him on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kakasujones @latimes 🙏🏼🌸💖👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes People are outraged over the fact that everyone is making sacrifices and not celebrating their miles stones this year the way they usually would have to.

<|startoftext|>The French teacher didn’t insult Muslim’s by his teachings. You are being hateful and narrow minded and using him to impose your racist views on westerners is simply wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Some values seem to be inhuman” ...beheading is barbaric and only terrorist savages will perform it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously? why would you care? Your religion must be respected so do other religions. Don’t forget that. Don’t impose your views onto others... what women wear doesn’t define them and makes your man entitled to rape and murder them. Shut up. Zip it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 I totally understand why you wondered about it. I have wondered about it myself. You question was a legitimate one . It’s good to have questions and to have those answered in civil ways. People don’t need to get all snarky about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 In Rapunzel defence I have wondering that myself. Came to realize that is just easier for people to keep their mask on while  driving since many have multiple destinations and rather not have to put them on and off each time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda @Popeye89950240 @HillaryClinton I remember very well what you are saying. I also remember Trump leaving American soldiers to die in Kabul after Iran’s attack! and Trudeau instructing our forces to take them to safety while trump did nothing. I also remember Trump knowing Putin put bounties on the US troops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KikiAdine Awww I feel for you and your girl. I hope that you can find someone that will help her. ♥️🌸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheUSASingers Who told you that I’m ready to die? hell no way! Vote that f&gt;kr out! Biden must win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimUppal Save your preaching...working in health care I’m voting for the party that has supported us and all Canadians. The conservatives hold anti mask rallies in Maga style. Why would you think, I’m okay with that? never!!! I got Trudeau’s back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can tell you how many Conservatives anti maskers attended a Vancouver rally this past weekend 1,000. Public heath is in peril due to these COVIDIOTS refusing to wear masks and trying to kill everyone.  Hospital staff are risking their lives daily. #ImVotingLiberal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two words...f&lt;ck off.   Q-What have the conservatives done during this pandemic to help Canadians? I will wait...0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the ones pointing the finger at the US judicial system ours is just as flawed in Canada🇨🇦. It’s time to demand change.   #BLM  #RiseUp #NoJusticeForAbdirahman  #DanielMontsionIsAMurderer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder Happy Birthday  🎉🎉🎉  https://t.co/AHLXXCYGB1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lesson for big tech companies here is...that the president must own them. Kushner as his finger prints all over this lawsuit and ongoing DOJ investigations. Trump alone wouldn’t know what to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another exemple that Barr does what Trump asks him to do. Trump felt that Google wasn’t working to promote his re election presidency. He decided to have the tech company prosecuted. #TrumpsDictatorship  #RemoveBarrNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordanbpeterson Canada wasn’t good enough? to have you treated for your addiction? Lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@graciaxxl What video? what have I missed? forget it I hate that entire family of criminals. They are all opportunists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is when Democrats should have Barr removed. Because he will do what Trump is asking of him. #RemoveBarrNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart I have never seen this level of mass corruption to cheat an election before and such toxic propaganda either. I’m mostly worried because the Canadian anti maskers seem to have learned from Trumps base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbouzy You would be surprised if I told you that here in Canada 🇨🇦 there we’re two anti mask rallies this past Sunday one rally in Vancouver 1000 ppl attended and another in Toronto. As an HCW I’m dealing w these anti mask ignorants trying to walk into the ER w/t a mask w flying insults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbouzy I would add if you don’t mind! I can’t wait for Democrats once in power to have both Trump and Barr prosecuted for all their crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Bill Barr is the biggest criminal I would like to know once Democrats are in power are they going to allow him to stay as DOJ? or can they have him investigated and removed?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Solange_Sonnier The hate is being spread and until Trump is gone nothing will change. It affects every country around the world whatever takes place in the US. Our politics have never been so toxic since Trump stole the presidency. Anti maskers are following into the right US protests footsteps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Solange_Sonnier @CindisPLace They did another anti mask rally in Toronto as well. Where the COVID numbers keep climbing as they are here in BC as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindisPLace One hundred percent Cindi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Solange_Sonnier @CindisPLace They should all have their health benefits cancelled. If they get COVID pay for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Solange_Sonnier @CindisPLace You bet! It’s really sad to witness the amount of careless and disrespectful behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yvr2017 Make them pay for their MSP. Fine them, I’m tired of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an outrage and reckless! I stand at the ER door screening people everyday 5-6 days a week! I’m tired of being insulted by the ones refusing to wear a mask to enter the ER. I also didn’t sign up to get killed by them, I’m not in the military I’m an HCA. Have some RESPECT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deonandan Wolves in sheep’s skins. Racist covidiots they look like they are attending a Trumps super spreader rally. Protecting others bothers their selfish selves how inconvenient to their white Canadian privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White COVIDIOTS  in Toronto protesting wearing a mask to protect others.  They are starting to look like the white racists in Trumps rallies.   I’m wondering if the US wouldn’t mind taking them, since they feel so miserable to be privileged Canadians.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funsunnyhere @yashar She also claims that love is winning when it’s quite the opposite right now. Kids are still living inside concentration camps, being abused and neglected. But of course, since she doesn’t have a conscience that fact doesn’t seem to bother her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funsunnyhere @yashar Kirstey doesn’t have morals to encourage others to support Trump. People like her that doesn’t  care about a uneducated grifter murderer spewing racism and killing people w his negligence isn’t worth her word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funsunnyhere @yashar A church that prevents mothers from being in their kids lives is one ran by the devil. Katie Holmes left Tom Cruise when her daughter became of age to attend their camps w/t her. Brainwashing children isn’t okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funsunnyhere @yashar Yes, when they used to be friends. I watched Leah’s series on Scientology she did an amazing job exposing that predatory cultist church. Nicole Kidman still doesn’t have a relationship w her daughter and son due to that church preventing them from being close to their own mother.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffreyLuscombe @NorthBelle4 @JoyAnnReid I have been extremely exhausted since 2016 one thing that I have learned from you all...to never assume. My guard is up and we have plenty to worry about in Canada 🇨🇦 since Trump brought racism out and many white supremacists live here as well. Our politics became as toxic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReebX1 @axlsgirl13 @VenusSylbrine Thanks Bryan a friend told me the exact same thing, specially bc she blurred the back of the second picture  the faces look different and totally placed. I’m not an internet tech person I have no idea how one does pictures like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fortyone_33 He was the sweetest and kindest of souls. ♥️RIP King.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fortyone_33 @djhomelessmike @VenusSylbrine Wow! She is definitely off the charts unwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 Yes, the solution is available! but they rather choose to ignore it. Because it’s inconvenient since they would have to tax themselves so much more and all their rich donors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 These CONS hypocrites rather let all of us die of hunger. How many people are still unemployed like travel agents and airline staffers! trying to survive off CERB.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraBellomy @chriseargle Incredible that Yashar caught her tweets about flipping to Maga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hapa_style @chriseargle She reminded us of that someone else and got blocked bc she also DM me pictures of herself and I told her to stop and she didn’t. Plus one of our friends account got suspended again for no reason and we all thought since she followed all of us that she could possibly be Sylvie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindisPLace @MarshallFarts5 @bettyisdrunk @yashar Exactly! Cindi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmytotheO @yashar You are right on the money Jimmy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Her no good reason for being blocked. Is sharing fake selfies when I never asked for them. Wtf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindisPLace @MarshallFarts5 @bettyisdrunk @yashar I hate that people assume twitter is for that kind of shit. Seriously 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @VenusSylbrine Thanks John 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emerald1910 @yashar Hello Edmund maybe this will make you smile.  https://t.co/h8KMGN8dU5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettyisdrunk @yashar Hahahaha 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet John if you follow @VenusSylbrine please unfollow and block. Yashar Ali Just had a thread on her turning into a MAGA bc me and our BC group unfollowed her after she started DM me fake pictures of herself. When I told her not too since all I care about on twitter is politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindisPLace @MarshallFarts5 @bettyisdrunk @yashar Oh yes one hundred percent Cindi bc according to Chris by her sending me fake pictures of herself she was trying to get me to share pictures of myself. The thing is...I’m 53 yrs old married and not into that kind of thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallFarts5 @CindisPLace @bettyisdrunk @yashar Many resisters would ask her what was wrong in her head? I would come in her defence and explain it in a different point of view one that actually made sense and wouldn’t be so aggressive. Felt bad for her since she claimed to be a resister. I couldn’t have been more wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallFarts5 @CindisPLace @bettyisdrunk @yashar People really gave her a hard time about her violent tweets on Magat threads. Until she turned into a Magat herself. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallFarts5 @CindisPLace @bettyisdrunk @yashar Pathetic! we we’re  mean but we were right that she cannot be trusted. Definitely deserved the block<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallFarts5 @bettyisdrunk @CindisPLace @yashar Hahahahaha 😂😂😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axlsgirl13 @VenusSylbrine Yep!  bc she DMs me these pics of herself. I blocked her ass and so did all my friends we also suspected she might be an extra SassyGirlBoss account bc our dear friend got suspended again for no reason.  https://t.co/TSvSChTwOK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConcernedVote16 @yashar Wow truly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mydoggyruss 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are following @VenusSylbrine make sure to unfollow her she is most likely a SassyGirlBoss account. She went MAGA. @JohnA_USMCvet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mydoggyruss Caroline that picture is priceless. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Triumphs @VenusSylbrine Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djhomelessmike @VenusSylbrine There is another so called resister that owns 153 accounts and uses them to infiltrate and mass report our tweets. So we collectively decided as a group would be best to block her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djhomelessmike @VenusSylbrine It all started bc she used to follow me and my group of friends. She than started sending me DMs with fake pictures of herself knows that im married and I told her to stop. She decided to ignore me. So I blocked her bc I also suspected along w my friends that she could be a spy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Here is the reason why me and all my friends unfollowed her. Seriously?!!! I’m here for the politics not for fake photos or even if they were real photos.  https://t.co/fs23QBQqtI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NashvilleDeeDee @CindisPLace @bettyisdrunk @yashar 😂😂😂👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettyisdrunk @yashar The reason being she DM me pictures of herself twice I told her not to do that. She completely ignored me plus the pics are fake as well not that I care! the fact is I’m here only for political reasons I’m married and I can’t stand shady people. All my friends unfollowed her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlbertaKimmy BOT account 🚨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreenOuellette This account engages in racism targeted harassment behaviour including threats on tweets! public health safety misinformation covid vaccine misinformation. The TOS violations are immense. I basically reported most of this account tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreenOuellette This is a very disturbed sick person. I reported this account to twitter and asked my followers to do the same.

<|startoftext|>@Rebecca79354969 @LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS Oh, yes! the WH Melania tapes. Evil lives inside her she isn’t just complicit she is part of the problem her husband has became.

<|startoftext|>@ConcernedWorld5 @ddale8 Great point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreenOuellette I couldn’t agree w you more. I never thought this country could start mirroring the US but everything is possible once the racism starts to show and became acceptable by many in the police force. Truly appalling and heartbreaking to witness it in Canada 🇨🇦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS She is evil Lolli she supports trump 100 percent. I never hated anyone in my life until those two came along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodiak149 @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @AllenLEllison I wish that his base would awake up from the spell he casted on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS I think Melania along w Trump are the most hated  people on this planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS I think that she should visit the kids at border again and wear her famous jacket that we all come to see. Talk to them about her privilege how she doesn’t care if they get sick, that they aren’t allowed the free flu vaccine drs were willing to give them and her husband refused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS I’m glad that you support Biden and everyone that deserves your support. I went to a rallie here in Vancouver for the children in trumps concentration camps. I will attend as many needed to have them liberated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS I don’t think that you should turn on them either. I’m not turning on them  I support everyone as long they aren’t Melania. When it comes to her I don’t care what names people call her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolliMothra @tomiahonen @FLOTUS Neither is having kids inside cages or wearing a jacket that reads “I really don’t care do you” when visiting them at the border. If we want to discuss political decorum there is plenty to cover. Under the Republikans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 None of them are educated enough on socialism or history. He just spews the propaganda he’s told to spew. Portugal is socialist and is doing better now than ever did before under the conservative Democratic Party. All he needed to do was to read about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of Trumps wife’s ever loved him. His current has a contract to stay married once the presidency is over the wife goes and his prison time starts.  Joe Biden always had love in his life his wife loves him and his son does to.   Trump is miserably unlucky in love.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hollybdc The murderer is no longer in jail. This is why everyone needs to get out and vote 🗳 racism is no longer acceptable neither is complicity. Allowing for Trumps racist base to pay for his bail like they were willing to help Kyle Rittenhouse and making him an Hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyArquette @PaulBlume_FOX9 @FOX9 Exactly my question Pat. I’m beyond furious right now, Trumps friends paid for his bail I’m sure of it. The likes of Gaetz, James Woods everyone that defended Kyle Rittenhouse posted this murderer bail as well. Truly the scums of this planet are the higher criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBlume_FOX9 @FOX9 Who posted his bail? Who? Republikans scum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t let Trump distract you from him not showing his tax returns, insulting the military, caging children, raping women,not protecting the military from Russians attacks, &amp; killing everyone w COVID instead of protecting all of you.   George Floyd’s Murderer posted 1M bail. #BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greendeb333 Trashy scums really? I can’t believe this is happening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 I completely agree with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“SHUT UP MAN “ -Joe Biden-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 How do these states still stand by him after his behaviour last night it’s even more outraging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 Trump marches to the beat of his own replay button. He isn’t a politician and never will be one. It’s impossible to debate an ignorant racist like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ40063 It was despicable! how he always hits below the belt both Biden kids were college educated and Trumps kids aren’t. Biden kept his cool he is decent  has decorum and class unlike insensitive bully Trump. Quite sad to witness such actions play out on a debate that fell short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lost the debate last night, your incompetence and lack of knowledge or direction regarding  your presidency.   What’s to debate, you are on the same repeat mode as always! you can’t call yourself a politician either. You are a Pathetic BULLY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Report this tweet it’s a lie. Trump is spreading  misinformation regarding mail in ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lying again and twitter didn’t flag this tweet. Unfortunate and unacceptable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You told the proud boys to “Stand back and Stand by “ as a president you are giving permission to white supremacists to be violent.  Perpetuating violence isn’t the job of a president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shut up man. 😂   Stop defending a guy that evades taxes, lacks in decorum and supports white supremacism.   Trump the bully didn’t bring anything new to the debate.   Americans can rest assure Biden will save them from death.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Holly4Justice @AshleySpivey @co_rapunzel4 We don’t have poll watchers in Canada. So my question is legitimate our elections  are protected by a democratic process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindisPLace @MulhollandLeda 😂😂😂I know that I’m being mean, but I really don’t t care. Melanoma outfit tonight was ugly. I miss the Obamas so much! what a class act Michelle was, her outfits always super elegant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleySpivey @co_rapunzel4 He is harming people that what he’s doing encouraging violence at the polls. The proud boys will gladly take on that role!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulhollandLeda @CindisPLace I’m outraged by how Trump bullied the moderator and Joe Biden without being penalized by his actions. Ever time he interrupted Joe he should no longer be allowed to respond within two minutes. Disgraceful and an assassination of democracy right before our eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rklace @ddale8 @BrianFreed1 Trump is a bully and Biden is a soft spoken man without a malicious bone in his entire body, which is the complete opposite of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 I would have loved to see a more aggressive Biden towards Trump. My blood was boiling had it been me he was attacking or my son I would have dog walked him on that stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly despicable! Trump is a savage bully in need of control and power of course he loves white supremacists. The presidential debate was a disgrace to Democracy. Trump should have been penalized for not letting Biden finish is thoughts period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meenaharris @KamalaHarris 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Neither can I.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simplyadornedal @CheriJacobus @AuthorKimberley One never knows the US lives in a filthy immoral Republican world. They have been dominating by playing dirty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would love to know exactly how many active lawsuits does Trump have? how much money is he shelling out from those, in lawyers and settlements. Is that money coming from the tax payers? DOJ is acting as his personal attorney in a rape lawsuit. Let’s ad all those dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Why I’m not surprised? the guy is a fraud everyone knows that a billionaire doesn’t hire people and refuse to pay them claiming they made a poor job.

<|startoftext|>Who didn’t know that Trump lives of borrowed money from the Saudis and the Russians? he isn’t a billionaire never was and never will be  one. The Deutsche Bank has the records on Trumps financial transactions with the Russian oligarchs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robreiner I agree! volunteering is imperative to win an election you all got to come together &amp; rally the vote.

<|startoftext|>@globalnews I’m glad that the NDP decided to back the LPC would’ve looked bad if they didn’t and going to an early election wouldn’t fit our best interests of public health or economically wise.

<|startoftext|>@CityRachelle The #BLM is standing against police brutality and their racism. The RCMP is being complicit with the far right hate groups. THEY ARE CHOOSING THE WRONG SIDE. They aren’t protecting and serving public safety but instead going against it. IT’S  UNLAWFUL under the Canadian law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The smirk on his face says it all. This is why the RCMP didn’t intervene against the racists beating up the #BLM peaceful protesters in Alberta.  Their lack of response in defending public safety should be considered unlawful.  They are to serve &amp; protect not to turn a blind eye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @Bongley72 @ScottMStedman He for sure did...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Instead of focusing on the conduct of himself and Trump. They are the sole responsible forces behind these protesters by not taking action to help fight against racism but rather instigated more violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @Bongley72 @ScottMStedman I remember as well I thought he was going to save all of you from Evil. Couldn’t have felt more excited to see Trumps empire crumble to the ground. Has it turned out It never did... what a monumental disappointment I felt afterwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @ScottMStedman Oh yes, he did. Did he care though I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @Bongley72 @ScottMStedman Thinking that he could have avoided all this but chose not to. What a betrayal and waste of your tax dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @Bongley72 @ScottMStedman Chose not to pursue locking Trump away afraid of the repercussions amongst his republican friends. But the lives lost due to his decision will never be forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Despicable! He is such a failure and a coward needs to hide behind another one of his Supreme Court picks  to fight when he loses the election. I can see clearly what he’s doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me make it easier for Trump.  I give him an Epic “F” for his handling of the pandemic.  And another Epic he can go F*CK himself for being the only  “Killer President” in American history.   He has FAILED at everything that he promised.   Protecting Americans being N1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMStedman Mueller couldn’t have stopped Trump bc he’s being protected by his mobsters. The only way to stop this massive corruption is by voting all of them out. Go America! vote for BIDEN get rid of your killer president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMStedman The American people trusted a botched failed investigation that’s what’s painful. Let’s say they had it all to convict Trump Republicans would have never allowed it. Barr is acting as Trump defence team in a rape case!!! this level of corruption is  unstoppable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@damienmontana1 @Scottsdale_Dad @DStewart541 @LukeLBarr @ABC @JackDate I Absolutely agree! I like the Green Party as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyaway_k @PatriciaRork @JoeBiden Let this sink in. Hypocrites! Trump isn’t pro-Life.

<|startoftext|>Completely disgusting and perverted. Any woman voting for Trump needs a serious psychological evaluation.   He has a history of raping women.   He also mandates hysterectomies on asylum seekers knowing these women are being sexually abused in his concentration camps. SICK!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The king of LIES and DEATH.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiliaSchwarcz My grandfather became a captain Pedro Chaves and was offered a position in Angola by the Portuguese according to the history books he lead his army and won the war against the Humbi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiliaSchwarcz I think it’s important to educate people on their history since it’s  being backed by scientific facts. I applaud you for bringing those facts to light. Excellent work! my family originated in Brasil as slaves brought from Angola. Cont)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Public_Citizen @waltshaub How fucking crazy is that? infuriates  me that none of them are helping families being evicted from their homes bc they can’t pay rent. If all these billionaires wanted they could help the middle class that is struggling.... from becoming homeless and starvation. Hell w Fascism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Travis You accuse the left of being dishonest because someone decided to doctor your photo but you don’t seem bothered by your president constant dishonesty or his doctored violent videos. You are definitely not! a very transparent individual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealDonalDrumpf Donnie knows the only way to avoid prison is to stay for another term. The coward will do whatever it takes to be able to stay. Even when his big campaign donors  decided not to support him anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Was heartbreaking to watch a family with a baby on a stroller living their apartment w/t knowing where to go. 😭truly despicable! landlords shouldn’t be allowed to kick renters out if they happened to lose their jobs due to the pandemic. Some states must have those put in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet I saw it on my Satellite Portuguese TV news they covered Trumps lies on jobs and economic impact of the pandemic in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet He should be talking is about what the media doesn’t bother to cover entire families that are becoming homeless bc they lost their jobs since the pandemic and are now getting kicked out since cannot afford to pay their rents.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VenusSylbrine @Mike_Estrada1 @robertpjones @washingtonpost This bc they are nationals not Muslim. Causing terror inside their own country against their own people w the permission of their own president. Unlike the 9/11 terrorists.

<|startoftext|>@Cattra922 @realDonaldTrump Catherine he deserves to be removed and locked up for all his human right abuses.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mike_Estrada1 @VenusSylbrine @robertpjones @washingtonpost The far right definitely enjoy killing peaceful protesters.

<|startoftext|>@BBWave2020 I would love to see where are those jobs he promised to black Americans. I can’t wait for you all to vote him out. I would love to see those tapes as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump hasn’t accomplished any of his promises towards black people.   Trump isn’t a Republican he’s dismantling the Republic and Democracy.  HE doesn’t RESPECT the Law the people or service man and women.   Trump doesn’t RESPECT THE USA OR THE ALLIES!  TRUMP ONLY RESPECTS PUTIN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@portarican_RT @IAmJohnAles @QuickTake I couldn’t agree more! how can anyone say they are either undecided voters or voting independently? what’s the choice? they will be actively allowing Trumps re-election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly 1,000 flights in Canada have carried COVID-positive passengers since February  https://t.co/Eiqdpw4Bxw I understand the airlines need to survive this crisis! but at the cost of our lives? this must STOP. The airlines aren’t screening their passengers properly.<|endoftext|>

A guy that pays for sex, rapes women, a racist lying cheater ignorant that never had the balls to serve his country in any war since his daddy bailed him out of serving service w the millions he had. The unpatriotic Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Allies like Canada have been there for the US troops to help them unlike Trump. Remember the Iran attack on the collation forces base in Iraq?

<|startoftext|>@sassyteapot63 @JohnA_USMCvet @CarrolCoMd @tech_52 @LadyRaven3 How despicable is he? he doesn’t respect the military dead or alive! the Russians had bounties on US soldiers heads  and Trump knew he had to know about it okay! didn’t care!

<|startoftext|>Disgusting video with lighting the match on fire 🔥 what’s that suppose to mean? that all of you Magats are the reason behind the violence being seen on your American streets. Take responsibility don’t shift the blame. Appalling and disgusting people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s tragic that you are worried about Pelosi’s hair cut! and Not worried about the millions of Americans living abroad being cheated out of this upcoming election. USPS system is rigged in Trumps favour how Republican of him and you. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALERT 🚨 Call your senators Trump belongs in Prison for voter suppression. Don’t let go of those phone lines send emails as well. Fight back!

<|startoftext|>Stop voter Fraud! Call your senators Trump is cheating again! Americans living abroad won’t be able to vote in person. Their only way is voting by mail.

<|startoftext|>@jinxkies @veronm78 @DarrenEuronews Blame the left for the riots when the far right extremists are the terrorists killing protesters. When your president brought this upon all of you.

<|startoftext|>@jinxkies @veronm78 @DarrenEuronews Why ???? Ask your president why? Voter suppression and fraud when 1 million Americans living in Canada votes may not count to vote that PEST OUT.

<|startoftext|>@ErinOTooleMP Stand up to racism neglect of the indigenous people’s and police brutality that’s what Canadians should be standing up to. Along with not allowing Canada to became American with toxic political oppression and propaganda like yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mustangmadd @ErinOTooleMP I’m appalled by this and much more! Mission National Park, BC as what used to be a Residential School on it’s grounds as well a small cemetery home to the evil priests that were running the school 😡seriously sick! Why didn’t the city removed the cemetery from the park?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mustangmadd @ErinOTooleMP Tracey 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼well said!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErinOTooleMP @DrGillLeighton This is such bullshit!😡🤬you cannot erase them dark history but you can and should start by removing every statue that represents pain and reminds the indigenous people’s of their suffering at the hands of the residential schools priests and guardians! MacDonald was evil!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time to stand up to Canada’s dark history of residencial schools.    It’s time to stand up to indigenous people’s suffering abuse being ignored because you rather defend the statues of the perpetrators.   Canadian history as a dark side that you cannot erase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lock her up and lock Trump up for election fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKDPFan4Eva I can tell you that I’m seriously worried for you all and trying my best to help bring  awareness here on twitter!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So many businesses closed since the pandemic hit Canada 🇨🇦   if it weren’t for CERB how would Canadians have survived ?   Erin  O’Toole is another Trump.   We don’t need shit disturbers we need a real leader that helps the people!   Justin Trudeau is the people’s leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mini_bubbly We would be in a lot of trouble if we didn’t have CERB a lot of people are unemployed right now. So many businesses closed since the pandemic hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeannaParisian @JustinTrudeau @JonathanWNV Their presence at the park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeannaParisian @JustinTrudeau @JonathanWNV That small cemetery should be relocated since only has the remains of those priests. They don’t belong in a public cultural place. Gives me the chills and it’s infuriating to see them there since it’s a constant reminder of what they did and none of you deserve the disrespect of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeannaParisian @JustinTrudeau @JonathanWNV Yesterday I was in Mission,BC once home to a residential school that is in the Mission National  park being used as a museum. There  is also a cemetery in the park that I found to be disturbing since it’s home to the evil priests that abused kids. It’s time 4 it’s  removal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamMultiversal Canada 🇨🇦 is home to 1 million Americans if the voting system is fraudulent how can their votes be counted on time? this is extremely important to remember not everyone can vote in person at the polls.

<|startoftext|>@RealKDPFan4Eva Trump us already counting his win. We have 1 million Americans living in Canada 🇨🇦 that are voting by mail the problem is the mail system is rigged.  https://t.co/aJmm7RYAw7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RexChapman The worst part of this “soupgate” is that the same ppl that voted him in are willing to do it again.

<|startoftext|>@idontknowyiluvu @gnugut13 @LisaHorne The police officer was also wearing a badge with blue lives matter on it. It’s their word against a black man that can no longer give his account of what they did to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idontknowyiluvu @gnugut13 @LisaHorne Why shoot someone when their handgun  fell on the ground and he didn’t make use of it either in first place? who stops someone on a bicycle violation ? I never heard of that before ! also sounds like the officers targeted  the man. Period. BS I’m sick of this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The handgun falls to the ground the police officers instead of arresting the man decide to shoot and kill him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluenamicomin @CBSLA My point precisely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSLA This story is just another reminder that the  police isn’t being honest on their account of what happened. Why shoot someone when the handgun he was carrying fell on the ground  and wasn’t used on any one? Why not just arrest him why kill him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They arrest a black man on a bicycle violation? never heard of that before! Then the man gets shot after his handgun falls on the ground and never went off or was used by the man? this isn’t making sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gnugut13 @LisaHorne Something smells fishy about this story! the police account of the facts isn’t adding up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trumps desperation is palpable! going after protesters to arrest them trying to clean up the mess he started. But hey! no arrests on Magats terrorists! while denouncing the cities he’s cleaning up are Dem run.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @DiamondLynne1 This is getting more outraging by the minute w many Canadians now saying they rather vote Conservatives in for the next elections. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget these riots aren’t Biden’s to solve but Trump’s instead he is the president that started it all. His racist calls here on twitter and Civil War remarks saying Republicans have the weapons not the Dems. This isn’t a laughing matter this is a life and death matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuffNickoDoes They are all experiencing Trump fever 🥵 laughable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @JohnA_USMCvet As you can see Trump fever arrived in Canada 🇨🇦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @JohnA_USMCvet *to not time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @JohnA_USMCvet Yup! we have Alberta separatists wanting out of Canada 🇨🇦 wanting time join Trump. Laughable and infuriating at the same time. Mad people!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wexit co-founder wants Alberta to become part of the U.S..  https://t.co/hFMHO1arKp I’m starting to lose my shit! these #Wexit stupids will NEVER succeed at separating this country and turning it into the nightmare the US is living through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet @DiamondLynne1 We have our own share  of problems trying to infiltrate themselves. #Wexit stupidity!  https://t.co/uA25Awqy9N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Insanity ....is ruling right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuffNickoDoes They are crazy since when a province can separate from their country to join another? without me and everyone else voting against it??? Insane beasts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wexit co-founder wants Alberta to become part of the U.S..  https://t.co/hFMHO1arKp First of all this is impossible! because Alberta can’t separate from Canada 🇨🇦 since in this country no one would vote to allow their separation to join the US or any other country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraBellomy @BrahmaGreg I’m truly sad by all of this! and hope this doesn’t backfires in the upcoming elections! that people aren’t afraid to vote for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraBellomy @BrahmaGreg Exactly how I feel!  at this point the protesters message is getting lost. Violence is never the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets Thank you for checking my tweet and for this conversation. 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets I agree! 👏🏼we need a system that benefits all of us not just the ultra rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets Than losing innocent lives in such a horrific way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets I fear these protests are going backwards bc of the violence. At this point no one is getting the right type of attention anymore. That in itself is tragic. I believe in peace and getting the message across w/t the violence I wish people could see that their message matters more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets My sentiment exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goss30Goss @JohnA_USMCvet @chucktodd The Magats are defending his terrorist actions. Saying he acted in self defence and to them he’s an hero because he killed two protesters that would never have voted for their criminal negligent president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnA_USMCvet Yes he does I remember him saying that they have the weapons and Dems would lose on the battle field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets We are staying vigilant out here since Erin O’Toole isn’t much different than Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump Jr. your dad has blood on his hands along with the NRA that supports violence AR-15 aren’t for civilians use. Appalling how you use a Trump supporters death to show ur disgust! but not the two protesters that got shot down by a white Republican Terrorist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillCody @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump If it had been a Dem supporter that got killed by one of their white terrorists like the kid with an AR-15 that killed two protesters wouldn’t matter to them. As they are now trying to support a murderer shooter saying he acted in self defence. Appalling people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets Yes! you are right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrahmaGreg @Rods_Tweets I’m on the same page as you. Including destruction of statues ask the city to have them removed in a civil manner! Sign petitions! this violence is unbelievable and unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrahmaGreg @Rods_Tweets This is wrong on every level. People are acting like barbaric savages not like humans trying to defend their rights w violence defeats their right to protest police brutality. They are becoming the criminals they condemn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump responds to a deadly shooting in Portland by blaming Democrats — and calls for the National Guard  https://t.co/bGfxQQPCQs via @voxdotcom Trump is the most dangerous irracional monster on this planet! he will only be satisfied with a Civil War.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rods_Tweets Me neither!but apparently they say to refuse voting for Biden and they rather vote for an independent which is the same that give their vote directly to Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss I remember Trump saying Republicans have the weapons to defeat Dems and they would win. If that wasn’t a call for a civil war I don’t know what would be. Quite disturbing...to witness a president w weapons of mass destruction to call on its citizens 2start militias and violence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Goes to show you what these Republicans care more about... not human rights that’s for sure. From glorifying a murderer to having kids locked up in cages and then be outraged about women having the right to be pro-Choice vs pro-Life. Hypocrites all of them. #BlackLivesMatter ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone should walk Tucker Carlson’s ass out of that network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibtroublesum Absolutely! enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CajunBlueAZ1 A big hug for all of you from Canada please stay safe. 💔  https://t.co/6AX0uRVAB2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lesson learned today from the RNC convention is that everyone was poor and became rich after working for Trump. They are also trying to bank on women voters and the riots to get Trump re elected. Stay woke America! and vote this cheating creep rapist racist murderer out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tucker Carlson is the scum of the Fox propaganda machine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How inhumane of Tucker Carlson to glorify a vigilant killing innocent protesters. Fox News is the scum of American network’s.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelCBender @snwinder @tparti They were definitely conned and on live TV w/t giving their consent. Sue the RNC for not disclosing that information and also for privacy /safety guidelines breach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snwinder He’s gonna say they only suffered mild headaches. MFK’R 🤬Is Putin’s bitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course! Trump will be dismissive he’s going to say the troops are doing well they only suffered mild headaches. #PutinOwnsTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US troops were injured in Syria on Putin’s orders most probably also with Trumps knowledge. Again! He wouldn’t tell what Putin has on him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @2bears150 This all so disturbing...these protesters are tired of having the police take their lives as if their aren’t humans I don’t agree w the riots no one does! human rights are being violated and ur president brought all of this upon you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @2bears150 The police really needs to take a good look at  themselves I’m sure they also applauded him after he was done w his killing and assault on protesters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good....go after Trump now! What’s the hold up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @resistelle Here they are... the difference is these wolves are fierce warrior survivors. Trump and his administration are assaulting raping democratic values and assassinating ppl. w their negligence while stealing from them and not reporting to the IRS the 100 million they made last year.  https://t.co/m54kGMC2EM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resistelle @latimes I really feel sorry for Britney Spears she didn’t really have much of a life growing up all she knows is hard work and sacrifice. It’s about time for her to be able to enjoy her life. Without the parasites within her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resistelle @latimes Exactly! no one in that family has her best interests at heart money really is the root of of all evils. This family is becoming separated by their greed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome Completely agree w your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome Police brutality must end they need to be trained and educated accordingly to the societal rights on race diversity. Their bias departments must follow rules they have became unlawful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome I completely agree with you no protest should turn violent! understanding can only be achieved with peace. Voicing concerns gives ppl the right to have their voices heard and have the country move in the right direction w legislation to protect the ppl’s rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resistelle @latimes I agree! it’s ridiculous that a grown woman as to fight in court over her own fortune while everyone wants a piece of the pie. Ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome One the #BLM protests in Montreal wasn’t as peaceful as one would have hoped for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome Unfortunately!  the police attend mental health wellness checks and isn’t trained to do so those many times result in abuse of the person in distress. Many cases involve indigenous, black people and minorities. We had several #BLM peaceful protests here w the exception of one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump This guy as a video of one of his shooting victims w a wound to his arm and is mocking saying hydroxychloroquine would heal his arm.

One being extremely graphic and w derogatory comments. A guy w a tremendous gun wound to his arm I believe him to be the victim of Kenosha’s shooting protests. He’s page is still up twitter is really disappointing me right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen you psychotic peace of shit! Canadians have had your backs when Iran attacked the Iraq collation base, Trudeau ordered both our and your troops to be brought to safety while your monster president didn’t care if the troops were going to be killed or not. Asshole!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwinmundt Yeah what do they say now? the conservatives magat loving pundits! when the US collation troops got targeted by Iran Trump didn’t care to help them and Trudeau ordered our troops out along w the US troops. We have their backs! apparently no one cares.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RocklynDude @DiamondLynne1 @IAmJohnAles @BarackObama Who knows what her intentions were... one thing I know for certain all her moves are calculated. She must have gotten paid very well by Trumps campaign for that speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejeancarroll @realDonaldTrump @TheAtlantic Your work is important and both yours and these women voices that suffered need to be heard and vindicated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @IAmJohnAles @BarackObama How wonderful...yes, our winters are frigid or rainy like in BC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome I couldn’t agree more with you. My heart breaks for what’s happening in the US also we have long ways to go in Canada as well regarding the abuse and oppression of indigenous and black people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dingdan88 You are a devil worshiper not a god loving creature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dingdan88 Shut up dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithlessmuse @chipfranklin Just as I see it too. 👏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather You all also have a fraudulent BeBest campaign that isn’t in place to help the kids inside her husband’s concentration camps. Or help any kids at all. Empty words by your frozen icy First Lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your state of emergency should have been considered “prior” killing an innocent black man. The Kenosha police department knows very well they are wrong and are now fearful for their lives.  But of course that I already know what side your white ass is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrayShadowTech @BreeNewsome Tiffany’s Trump RNC speech was appalling when she refers to going from a system of freedom to one of oppression truly despicable and utterly disgusting when we all know it’s quite the opposite way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @IAmJohnAles @BarackObama That’s incredible! I love your story ♥️my best friend is from New Foundland they are all very friendly family oriented people. I’m happy that you made friends here in Canada I have quite an amazing group of people here on twitter that I came to admire and chat with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 @IAmJohnAles @BarackObama Unfortunately! COVID came along I hope that it goes away soon and you can come for your trip. We are all stuck in our countries this year. 🌻🤗🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter Navarro should be forced to eat his horrible words towards our nation and troops. That f*cker forgot when Iran attacked the coalition troops in Iraq his president abandoned them and Trudeau ordered their rescue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Top Trump adviser Peter Navarro disparages Canada's military efforts in Afghanistan  https://t.co/QguiHgzoQ7 This traitor should thank Canada 🇨🇦 for saving the lives of US soldiers during Iran attack on their base in Iraq 🇮🇶 Trudeau rescued them while Trump didn’t care to do so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankAmmendolea @FLOTUS Frank! Eric &amp; the Trump organization according to reports never declared a 100 million dollars to the IRS. No wonder he’s hidding his tax returns from public view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCSmithNYC It’s starting to get that September chill factor!   In the early am and late pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss You all should ask him and Eric what he did to the 100 million he didn’t report to the IRS. Let’s see those tax returns! why do you think he’s hiding them from the public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCSmithNYC I also like Bryan Adams and Alanis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCSmithNYC I’m with you...if anything I have learned to not let my guard down regarding our political issues here in Canada one could  never tell exactly the damage one bad leader could do to a country. This was ...until Trump came along and I woke up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump are trying to destroy each other as Donald Trump circles the drain  https://t.co/LuwXxss12Y via @PalmerReport Lets us learn about how fake and pretentious Melanoma really is. 😂<|endoftext|>
