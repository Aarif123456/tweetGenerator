<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hey @sethmeyers - something tells me this is the equivalent to that night you poked fun at @realDonaldTrump and inspired his presidential run. Please - let this be the moment @Oprah says “f*** it - I’m going to run for president”. #oprahforpresident<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Katrinavision @fakeGAINER Sometimes they motivate me to pour an extra scotch. 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katrinavision @fakeGAINER My children- and a want to give them literally everything. That motivates me like nothing else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will there be a march in #yqr? I’d sure love to be a part of one.  https://t.co/DFUA2hNOBr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmonogram can I ask you a question?!?! What do you do to stay sharp creatively?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow @EscapeManor and @WestJet are giving you all an opportunity to win a trip for 2 anywhere WestJet flies! You’ll have your chance to #escapethecoldzone all day tomorrow at @WaskimoRegina!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oh_payasa @mmonogram @DanPovenmire @OriginalFunko @HilaryLGray - this is an exceptional idea! ❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oh_payasa @mmonogram @DanPovenmire @OriginalFunko Oh heck yes!!! @camerondeuel - surely we can get you behind this one sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSSully As a sulley fan - assumably these new designs get your seal of approval @CSSully?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurBradford_ @wife_who_tweets and I  very nearly escaped your wine cellar! So close!!! Thanks @EscapeManor for a great date night!  https://t.co/rDkRgGLPT3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb @OtherSideTV #newcast 👻👻👻  https://t.co/PRURT78k2Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb @OtherSideTV Spoiler alert - half of the cast doesn’t make it to season 3! 👻😮😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb @OtherSideTV The show and the work of talking to spirit have had far reaching and lasting affects on everyone involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb Also it’s worth noting that we worked for hours to try and determine where exactly that bottle came from. Still haunts me. @OtherSideTV is so full of moments that keep me up at night to this day...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb One of my favourites as well. Which season are you currently watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabbdebb THANK YOU!!! SEASON 4 should be airing in the fall! MORE is certainly on the way! Favourite episode so far?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armchairbound Road life is hard - but use the time away to reset so you can be a better husband and father. #protip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmonogram - happiness tonight is coming to my family courtesy of you. My 7 &amp; 9 year old spent the eve introducing their 4 year old bro to summers filled with backyard beaches and squirrels in their pants. Also “little brothers” is suddenly much more meaningful for the eldest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 minutes into #TheGoodPlace - laughing out loud. Hillarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creativity is like a muscle really. If you exercise it - it gets stronger. If you neglect it - it weakens and you eventually risk losing it. Creativity exercises - are something we should all be practicing daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meaderic @D_Copperfield What a treasure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bifnaked @OriginalBimtoy @TheCandyShow @JKCorden @JKRowlingss @arisacox @Katrinavision @HilaryLGray @elmo @gvartistry @thegreatkhalid @KarenO How are we all cataloging our creative ideas? I prefer a journal - sometimes the act of physically writing about something cements the idea. Often times ideas need time to “grow”. A journal is a perfect place for that growth to take place #journaladdict<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creative thinkers out there in the twitterverse! What do you do to inspire creativity in yourself? @bifnaked @OriginalBimtoy @TheCandyShow @JKCorden @JKRowlingss @arisacox @Katrinavision @HilaryLGray @elmo @gvartistry @thegreatkhalid @KarenO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @official_enya - every time I hear Orinoco flow I feel like this. @SouthPark ruined this tune and anything that sounds remotely close to this tune for me.  https://t.co/0H8o3HKh0Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel @KarenO always dishes out the most haunting vocals. You know what the world needs @camerondeuel ? Pops based on this GEM!  https://t.co/YeSzvV456E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney @elonmusk We would be at his mercy. Now imagine if @JeffBezos and @MarkZuckerbe1rg joined forces alongside Elon. That triad would be unstoppable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But please for the good of us all - never ever become a super villain @elonmusk! Lex Luthor has NOTHING on you sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who wants to go to space? Incredible day for @elonmusk and @SpaceX!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CLOVERFIELD PARADOX?!!! What?!?! @netflix - this is better than Christmas. Cracking a post #SuperBowl52 Slusho and enjoying a new addition to one of the greatest monster movie franchises of all time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OraclesDoExist @Pink I’m not sick - bad ass artist @Pink has the flu and is performing the national anthem at #SuperBowl tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Battling through the Flu to perform on the national stage! I’ve been sick and on stage before - it’s zero fun. @Pink - wishing you all the best tonight! Kick some ass and rest up after!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Midnight run across Manitoba and into Saskatchewan - what’s getting me through this 3 Hour drive? @bifnaked on CD! Back in the day...driving down the dark highway... #travel #ontheroad  https://t.co/YECZHqA7F3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjholl2015 thanks for the follow! Roblin ROCKED tonight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erin_Rumbolt What an amazing night that was! Your group was incredible #funtable. Close to $10,000 was raised that night! So wonderful for the community and the Prairie Storm PeeWee AA hockey team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OraclesDoExist That is amazing! Yes! Yes! Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel Ooh! @DisneylandToday in your future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YokoMcCann @OriginalFunko @Loungefly Question of the day! Are those shoes NEW? Or have you just discovered an insanely practical way to keep the foxing Uber clean?!? Have to share your “sneaky” secret @YokoMcCann!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marty Byrde &gt; Walter White<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bambooshootsinc Ah natural- a little bitter zero salt. That’s the way to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel @DavidHasselhoff Some things you can just tell about a person...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel @DavidHasselhoff   https://t.co/RtFBqqArMw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel Cameron (CAM-RON) Duel (DOO-ELL) Highly evolved strain of the Funko employee. This specimen carries an affinity for sneakers and @DavidHasselhoff. He can often be seen dressed as Michael Knight (of Knight Rider fame) around the Funko offices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was actually looking forward to @realDonaldTrump handing out statues of himself covered in glitter at the #FakeNewsAwards. Too bad it was just another empty promise. SAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @normmacdonald @jaketapper and @normmacdonald could be the bromance dreams are made of. Both of you gents kick ass! #DynamicDuo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendellwaldron #MADD represents something that my wife and I feel VERY strongly about. I’d love more info about how we can help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @BigBrotherCA and @arisacox on their big nomination! :)  https://t.co/6oci42x388<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making fun of/light of a death - celebrity or otherwise. Not cool. Human life is precious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD @BigRedCMH @Dalby Classy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you doing to combat depression on this #bluemonday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney @jamieleecurtis is speaking to the fact that under the Obama administration this warning likely wouldn’t have been taken seriously. @realDonaldTrump has created a global climate where nuclear war is a VERY real threat. I feel for those who were undoubtedly traumatized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From tragedy and loss - an amazing legacy is being crafted for future indigenous film makers.  https://t.co/2wuJC5IWbq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today we celebrated an incredible man. @bob_crowe - you sir, will be very, very deeply missed. All those who you so deeply touched should take solace in the fact that you are no doubt smiling upon us, watching us, guiding us and encouraging us all to be better. Rest easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the incomparable David Letterman interview the incredible @BarackObama on @netflix. My next guest is a treasure from two personal hero’s of mine. Obama’s words make me truly miss the days of common sense, class and decency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeCookieMonster Oooh! An @disneyland churro?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel This clock would be bad news in my world. Math at 6 am? What? Why? #notamorningperson #coffeethenmath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerrickWawro Sounds like the report is coming from multiple sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@33_Wonderland What’s being refurbished in these pics? 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something is wrong, and terribly so when this style of leadership and rhetoric is the new normal. Can someone please reset the matrix? 🤦🏽‍♂️  https://t.co/u7fnGyTZoL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OraclesDoExist Beautiful! 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queeentit What amazing piece of art is being created at “the appointment”? 🧐 #tatsrule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleLozin Congrats! JT ain’t ready for ya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable. There is a real beauty in the mysterious. Well done @hirst_official! You’ve encapsulated the mysterious and made it ART! A feat of mythic proportion. A must see everyone! @arisacox  - this will blow your mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having any “ice day” today. Kids are staying home. I’m starting a fire. Anyone else? #yqr #skstorm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeHypnosis Definitely messed up the elbow! 🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just did my best “Bambi” impression on my way into the grocery store. It is ICY out there tonight #yqr. Stay safe everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anything grosser than a healing tattoo?!?! Yikes! I feel like I’m in the 3rd season of the walking dead all of a sudden. 🧟‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arisacox Soooooo rough! I’m ready for a nap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeHypnosis @NARAL Then perhaps they should start sharpening pencils ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD Sunny side all the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackmirror you are spectacular. Don’t ever change! The best thing on television since Rod Serling dazzled is with the #twilightzone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD This rhetoric isn’t even funny. Too much lunacy to even comment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. But a reflection of@the changing media landscape...  https://t.co/wH54ARy44H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also stumbled across the first chapters of a novel I began writing in 2001! Odd sensation to read words you wrote and be surprised by them. The book isn’t bad - the narrative solid and the characters enthralling. This might be the start of something...  https://t.co/TPTNT2DIyb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you’re going through old boxes and discover a play you wrote in 2004. It was never produced. Maybe now is the time...  https://t.co/wJbgoYHVth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again - blown away by @blackmirror. Hang the DJ was so damn good. Rounding the bend to @pennjillette written finale - can’t wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking to network with processionals in #yqr. @taroncochrane is there a monthly group? What does the #tweetup scene look like these days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson Why you gotta be destroying the mysticism of a full moon in the first day of the new year Neil! There is still magic in the world sir! ;) Happy New Year! Enjoy the coming apocalypse! #Hello2018 #NewYear2018 #kidding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else addicted to cooking in the #instantpot ?!?! This thing is a stainless steel miracle!  https://t.co/gPDm3lMWO8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else’s kids super into #grossems? Weird phenomenon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camerondeuel Careful. That hedge hog could get you convicted of murder in some dystopian future Cam. #BlackMirror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what New Year’s Day brings? One step closer to @OtherSideTV season 4 on @APTN! 2018 is going to bring something incredible to your television - promise!Am I right @Michae11a ?!?! #theothersidetv #paranormal #ABS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taroncochrane Ugggh. This makes me a little sad. Thinking of those who may find themselves in a similar situation and not be nearly as responsible. Please @Uber come to #yqr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskGregger I’ve consistently heard this from multiple sources. I can’t push myself to see it again! #trainwreck #leiapoppins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MmsnowmanStella Amazing! Love both pieces!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGerlinsky Hoping I can wait a few hours for the sun to melt the ice #biggestfire. Most worrying part is the fact that my smoke alarm seemed to be mostly indifferent to the billowing smoke...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just inadvertently turned my living room into a smoker this morning while trying to light a fire. Pretty sure the chimney cap is ice covered and frozen. Perfect. #ItsSoCold #skweather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone else spend an hour and 16 minutes thinking...”my god is that Matt Damon? That can’t be Matt Damon. Nah...no way it’s Matt Damon.”   “ wait....IS that Matt Damon?” @blackmirror you’ve sent us all down a worm hole to an alternate universe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FanDisneyland They’re always talking  about how they “miss Disneyland...” ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alberstat Myself and the @OtherSideTV team have encountered a number of indigenous spirits over the course of years of investigations. We have been communicated to directly in both Cree and Lakota languages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright @OtherSideTV fans! I’ll take your questions for the next hour! Ask me anything #paranormal or otherwise - I’m an open book to you! #theothersidetv. @OraclesDoExist - want to get the ball rolling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sammaciag The episode where Negan attacked Glenn was too much for me. Haven’t watched since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FanDisneyland can I just say that your name is uttered in my household at least 3-5 times a day. My family can’t stop talking about you. They are obsessed. #missdisneyland 🤓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlobalRegina @WOLFCOPTheMovie - AWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOO #2018 #anotherwolfcop #anotheryear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishp2405 YES! S4 WILL be on @APTN. Stay tuned for an official date!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD Glad you’re discovering a little magic courtesy the wizarding world. @PifflesPod should do a quidditch ep. @MooseJawHerald does have its very own team after all!  @JKRowlingss any other Saskatchewan teams we should know about? #HarryPotter #PureMagic  https://t.co/LvXrlVVEB6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeCookieMonster I feel your pain cookie! Which one was your fave? Gingerbread? Snickerdoodle? Jam jam? I favoured the shortbread. 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Paranormal peeps - what was your favourite investigation or space you visited this year? Mine? A decommissioned psychiatric facility in Ontario. Unbelievable space....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We talking like - Alex Mack the girl who got doused in nuclear waste and given super powers?  https://t.co/JoP0kHikDJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s that you say? @blackmirror season 4 is on Netflix today? That’s it - Friday is cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCandyShow Ugh! This lyric got me right in the feels. It’s amazing how isolating it makes it just that much more powerful. The fragility of youth and time - scary stuff @TheCandyShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Curious - how many of my followers have tattoos?!?! Second question - can you post a pic? Love art on the human canvas - let’s see your ink!!!! #TattooThursday #art<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 9 year old got paints and canvases for christmas. Today he painted this. The kid can dance. He’s wicked smart AND he can paint! #prouddad  https://t.co/rEKhuDaoOg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottawaparnormal Stick to the summers! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else ready for the kids to go back to school? #day6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKlewchuk This should be some sort of official food in Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the coolest gifts I got this Christmas - new cuff links! @ThelIluminati gift shop at Bohemian grove sells the most amazing things apparently.  https://t.co/178yZezGWW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaColesYQR Can I just say a personal thank you for all you did for Saskatchewan radio? You were never afraid to take on topics, and your voice brightened thousands of days! You interviewed me 21 years ago! One of my first big station interviews! Enjoy your new path!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister in law lamented having to ask for “grown up gifts” this Christmas. My response - that’s ridiculous! I got two @OriginalFunko pop!

<|startoftext|>@tammyrobert The answer to both questions is yes. I consulted my sources.  https://t.co/uPCK2U8dK8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Southern_Rolls @MouseInfo @DisneylandToday Cast members are human! A lot of tourists I fear confuse them with the animatronic figures. 🤣😂🤣. The salty tweets about this issue drove me crazy! Seriously - entitlement flows strongly in some...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaColesYQR Enjoy it! The darkness is a tremendous place for creativity! The best ideas live in the dark!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yqrhomelessness Conversation is a start. Here’s a guide.    https://t.co/HCJ6zdsL5h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the @netflix series @toysthatmadeus - so incredible the stories behind these pieces of my childhood. Highly recommend everyone check this out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yqrhomelessness I’ve noticed an increase in Regina’s visible homeless ( and no doubt an increase in the invisible homeless as well). What can #yqr citizens do to make a difference and assist our neighbours with no place to go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurBradford_ Will this be on the wine list at your big New Year’s Eve party? @EscapeManor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurBradford_  im curious - is there a wine you suggest for a meal with friends over the last few days of 2017? Looking for something preferably dark, and red....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmaruyama What is it!!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiffanyiynaffit @MouseInfo @DisneylandToday Well it is ONE cast members fault.  https://t.co/zG9ofYm6jH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lovethesky65 @MouseInfo @DisneylandToday People tend to forget the humans who work in these places take pride in making people happy. I can only imagine how demoralizing that many unhappy people would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MouseInfo @DisneylandToday Also - anyone in the park right now - be extra kind to the cast members - if you think you’re stressed - imagine how stressed and exhausted THEY must be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bernal13 @DisneylandToday Agreed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MouseInfo @DisneylandToday I’m sure even without power the happiest place on earth is STILL the happiest place on earth. Real magic isn’t powered by electricity - it’s powered by imagination and pixie dust! 🧚‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahSterling_ I’d actually trade you a ton of catchup chips for some sweet Disney swag? :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FanDisneyland #badadvice Skip the line fast pass - not necessary - literally just find the front of the line and cut in. So much faster, no expiry, no pesky wait times!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No way! Christmas music is the icing on an extra magical cake made of ginger bread, filled with hope and dusted with crushed up candy canes. 🎄 🌲🌲🎄🎅🏻🤶🏻😃📯🍗⛄️❄️❄️  https://t.co/wNVI7PFrMF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sobering thoughts about the fragility of life today as well. Here today -gone in an instant. Talk to your hero’s, tell them everything. Spend time with your loved ones, hug your kids. You never know when you might be doing it for the very last time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heavy heart the last few days. @bob_crowe you were a brilliant, brilliant man.

<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD It’s just too bad that our own province seems to be trapped in the 1960’s with regards to “progress” in terms of how women are treated. #tonedeaf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only logical choice this year. The voices behind these stories changed the world. People have been awoken to the systemic abuses powerful men place on those they view as “weak”. May the truth continue. #TimePersonOfTheYear   https://t.co/SjaMD6yESf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV That is the Grail isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have one last spot open for intuitive development work before I wrap classes for the near future. Who wants to strengthen their intuition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresakaracso1 Sure! please send it to intothinair@sasktel.net<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresakaracso1 Would love that! It's rare that I have others read for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerrickWawro @OtherSideTV Interesting - I wonder if the space is active.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just curious - is there anything @OtherSideTV fans would like to see MORE of this coming season? What can we show you? #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylejones007 I've actually interviewed the artist who designed those! He's incredible! Ciro Marchetti! Beautiful artwork!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylejones007 Beauty! Which deck is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michae11a @jasonap36 @OtherSideTV @APTN @AngelEntertains @bob_crowe @Podemskichick That just means you have to put up with off camera jump scares courtesy your co host ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonap36 @OtherSideTV @Michae11a @APTN @AngelEntertains @bob_crowe @Podemskichick Thank you! Exciting times ahead for sure!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dalby But stadium shows always sell out here from my understanding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dalby AC/DC, kid rock, Bon Jovi, Rolling Stones etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dalby @Fesciuc Major shows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dalby Haven't multiple mosaic shows by different acts been sold out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCandyShow @bifnaked Great tune!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney But for who? Who are these people? #Seinfeld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney Is that still a valid argument against wrestling? Who cares if it's fake! 3/4 of Hollywood is a fantasy. #entertainment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bob_crowe @BarackObama yes! Yes! YES!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CTVReginaLive @wdmtweets @AlexBrownCTV I've got a few ideas ;) 👻👻👻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCandyShow in a word yes. But lovable creepy. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD I think professional sports needs to start taking MORE of a stand against domestic violence and other social ills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gymbunee all things in time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gymbunee this is purely a personal preference. I have about 13 pendulums I use regularly. Different ones for different applications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD I've got 4 kids - 6am is the new 9am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD no seriously - if I eat anything breakfast related after lunch it makes me feel ill. Not sure why - it always has. 🤢🤢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With our season three finale of @OtherSideTV airing tonight on @APTN - I'm curious, what was YOUR favourite season 3 episode?  https://t.co/pPkzq9WZVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV finale night! Who's tuning in? #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresakaracso1 @OtherSideTV @APTN let me be clear - last episode this season! The future will bring great things - I have no doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresakaracso1 @OtherSideTV @Okimaskwew The owl is VERY connected to me! Tell me - what told you that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresakaracso1 @OtherSideTV @Okimaskwew yes! Many, many times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaskimoRegina @sshawks @wordpressdotcom @CityofRegina I performed there in 1997. Made a signed card appear in an ice block! #frozen #magic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV fans! I'm taking on 3 students for intuitive development classes this month. Email intothinair@Sasktel.net for details!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFS_ItsAJoke @OtherSideTV @OriginalFunko I have always been a collector of things. These figures are the perfect mix of nostalgia and fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntsRealityBlog @OtherSideTV @OriginalFunko The pumpkin King from the nightmare before Christmas! 🎃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntsRealityBlog @OtherSideTV @OriginalFunko you know it! Though the ghost busters set on the bottom is also very rare :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun fact for @OtherSideTV fans - I'm addicted to collecting @OriginalFunko figures. #nerd #disney #marvel #ghostbusters  https://t.co/962JvyAJ5d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the Crown and I must say - the queen is tough as nails.  https://t.co/5OMHPrtQi5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyJane4GGP @OtherSideTV thank you! A fourth season would be the greatest honour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyJane4GGP @OtherSideTV Ivy's story touched me like no other - feeling that bond as a father was so powerful. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly there is only one more episode of @OtherSideTV on @APTN. What was your favourite moment from season 3?  #paranormal #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScarletKitty @OtherSideTV @APTN I think we might be the **ONLY** Canadian paranormal show. We continue to break new ground each season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Osoref4 thank you! Over three seasons it's been a deep journey and a very personal one in many regards working on @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KymberlieH12 it's fantastic! On my playlist -  https://t.co/W43H995MnR. @wintersleep - great Canadian band from Nova Scotia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishp2405 @OtherSideTV that's amazing! If I bring my tour to Barrie - I look forward to meeting your group!  https://t.co/rO7O4xf8z0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishp2405 @OtherSideTV it was truly surreal. Such a unique space and unique contact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gymbunee I do! I use konxari and the oracle of the radiant sun :) #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmichaeljohn @theothersidetv Did you enjoy that little nod? ;) #nerd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okimaskwew @OtherSideTV it's such a thrilling and unique concept. 3 seasons in I'm still in love with this shows heart and soul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexD certain "newsy" "talky" stations seem OBSESSED. #slownewsday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okimaskwew @OtherSideTV our producers, director and researchers select them. All are carefully screened and stories vetted before hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TanyaCallaway1 @Joshinthe306 @OtherSideTV Tom and his traditional knowledge are truly gifts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did everyone think? Please ask any questions here! Would love to answer you tonight! #TheOtherSideTV @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We forged such a special connection in this episode. Truly blessed. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okimaskwew a not so subtle nod. Not sure another investigator had openly paid homage to Egon and the gang on TV. #Nerd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoy the next episode of @OtherSideTV on @APTN! It's one of my favourites! Happy to answer questions after!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carly_golightly @OtherSideTV easily one of the most intimidating locations we've ever investigated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okimaskwew @OtherSideTV it has to be! Only two episodes left!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's episode of @OtherSideTV for me was one of the scariest location wise. The spirit we connect with is very special...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's episode of @OtherSideTV is UNREAL. Trust me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFS_ItsAJoke @OtherSideTV evey negative entity can't possibly be demonic - can it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV and anyone who refutes K2 evidence - check this out.  https://t.co/0blzHUuwp8 from an investigation 3 years ago...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV the community at large needs to collaborate and develop new methods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV that's tedious as well. But k2 responses seem to work well for our teams dynamic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV for me PSB-7 evidence is far more reliable than EVP. It also allows for DIRECT communication with spirit. #paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV the scratch of a mouse can sound a lot like "get out or I'll kill you" when you're psychologically primed already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV I also question the validity of MOST evp evidence. Sensitive recorders capture the smallest sounds. We matrix words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV the we've actually done EVP sessions at a majority of cases as well. But again, evidence review is time consuming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radlady @OtherSideTV it's very laborious to review tapes and our shoot schedules just don't allow for that. Time constraints rob us here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaferman62 truly hard to say! Submiting your stories to @OtherSideTV improves the chances!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rare chance to see my live show tonight in #yqr! 4pm @conexusartscntr mainstage!     https://t.co/U5NPPn0BS0 #nye2016 #Canada150<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryRoseWW @OtherSideTV without a doubt. He/it/they tend to do that it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any questions for me about tonight's episode? #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryRoseWW @OtherSideTV @Michae11a you can never be 100% certain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heatherj750 thank you! IMHO it's the only way to conduct communication. Detest "ghost hunters" who don't. #paranormal #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At the end of this episode I'll share a photo I took in the theater. It's pretty shocking. #theothersidetv #staytuned<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TanyaCallaway1 @OtherSideTV an incredible validation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV I want everyone's thoughts on what I felt was a groundbreaking episode! #theothersidetv @APTN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joshinthe306 @OtherSideTV just wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV  what was most significant was our subject's validation of the evidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's episode of #theothersidetv contains the most incredible survival evidence and verification we've recorded to date. @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GunsNRoses live at Mosaic stadium August 27th, 2016! How cool is that? #yqr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV what did you think of tonight's episode?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Synchronicity is a beautiful thing  #TheOtherSidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The female energy in this episode is INCREDIBLE #TheOtherSidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rocking a @helenoro original in this shot #protecther #TheOtherSidetv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV we're just getting started 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV no one on the crew had any indication as to her son's name. This blew us away. Can you imagine if you were our subject?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV @Michae11a we have<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV I actually left a gift at the rose deer for Jon. Quite an emotional case really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFS_ItsAJoke @OtherSideTV there was a lot of discussion about whether or not to use this particular tool on the show. Used properly - safe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebreagle that would be tough. Not sure they get the same channels in the afterlife. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAurielicious2 there is a safe in that office that has never been opened. That's part of the puzzle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madmac3702 @GhostAdventures @reallytvchannel @GhostsOnReally @OtherSideTV after 3 seasons - I still love working on the show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purplepetal @reallytvchannel @OtherSideTV There is so much that didn't make it into this and the other episodes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madmac3702 @GhostAdventures @reallytvchannel @GhostsOnReally THANK YOU PAUL! @OtherSideTV is something I am very, very proud of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairelazybear @reallytvchannel Harold really did take over this investigation. 2 seasons and 4 years later he's still with us...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallytvchannel After it happened I ran into the street and threw up. It was a very, very disturbing moment for me. #LockdownThursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoy #LockdownThursday on @reallytvchannel! I'll be standing by here in Canada to answer any questions you might have about @OtherSideTV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallytvchannel That's my job! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallytvchannel snacks and "Spirits" ? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallytvchannel What we captured on camera I believe is unprecedented. It's the most direct connection I've experienced. #LockdownThursday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnGormleyShow @LHubich @RobinHDunlop @cambroten doesn't this usually work the other way around? Host banning guest? #confused<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>None of us could have been prepared for what happens next. Unfathomable. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can see her physical mannerisms change as the session continues #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This session was nearly two hours in length. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I attempt tonight is a hypnotic regression. The first time this has been done during a paranormal investigation #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV technically not tarot ;) It's an oracle deck. The oracle of the radiant sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use these cards daily with my clients. #TheOtherSideTV  https://t.co/ncMaqo92Rf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I truly wanted to help Geraldine. She had been plagued by this thing for too long. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go! @OtherSideTV is on @APTN NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV I'll be curious as to the response. This one WILL be controversial...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's episode of @OtherSideTV "the gift" is easily the most compelling investigation my team, or any team has done to date. #paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d be a very happy man if I only ever got to travel abroad to one destination - @disneyland! #DisneyFamilyTravel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel like freedom of speech is under fire in Saskatchewan. These are very strange times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIVE NOW!  https://t.co/NJ9guJoHNg  https://t.co/B0fl4PNevm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important for us to debunk as much as we can. The work we do is legitimate and we need to be skeptical. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That cat nearly made me lose my #marbles. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#theothersidetv I could hear those marbles moving loudly and clearly…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again - a moment that caused me to drop a four letter word! I was terrified when that crash came. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheOtherSideTV amazing physical evidence come up….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's tuning in to @OtherSideTV on @aptn tonight? You don't want to miss an incredible moment from tonight's episode in The Pas MB.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV Usually graveyards are void of activity.  This...is not your typical graveyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV convicted and hung murderers. There could be nothing good on this plot of land. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were the first team in Canada to investigate the Headingly Cemetery. I'll likely never tread back there. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV - no location has bothered me more than the one featured in tonight's second episode. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>research has been done on people as the "agents" of poltergeist activity. Could Kristine have been manifesting the activity? #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the many moments that once again has confirmed for me a spiritual presence. Something MOVED a heavy object. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV it seemed to gain intensity, then slow, and gain. Very odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a noticeable change in both temperature at atmosphere when the birdcage video was shot. #TheOtherSideTV @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slednjoe @OtherSideTV is the figure in the photo one of the spirits we interacted with in the cemetary? Or something far more sinister....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskPb @OtherSideTV I’m convinced that question is answered in tonight’s episode. Truly chilling…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This photo was taken on location during tonight’s episode of @OtherSideTV. Notice anything? #TheOtherSideTV  https://t.co/urcEhppHct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two incredible episodes of @othersidetv coming tonight on @APTN. The darkest location we’ve ever investigated…<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney radio rules the world. #binge listen to my show here...  http://t.co/fdBWqd4btO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeSweeney there are people in the "paranormal" world who shun and ridicule those who are on mainstream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paranormal teams SHOULD strive to be on MAINSTREAM television and radio. Why does this work have to be focused on podcasts and web series?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all paranormal television is "garbage". I poured a lot of heart and soul into my TV work along with a dedicated team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I just say - being on television and making a living from paranormal investigations DOES NOT discredit a team. Tired of this stigma.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone here's a tip. Get off Twitter. Put your smart phone away. And go ENJOY something millions only wish they could tonight. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone they can! I'm also a fan of #commonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone I appreciate the efforts the company has gone to in order to bring magic to life. Sure I'm a fanboy. Nothing wrong with LOVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone I don't mean to make light of anything here - but seriously. The poor planning of the park goer needs to factor in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone you sir are a comedian. I'm following you and recommend everyone of my followers does the same. #lookoutleno<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching people complain about how they voluntarily chose to go to @disneyland today and it's "too busy" is HILARIOUS #Disney24 #disney60<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone i should blame Disney for the fact I went to the park January and missed all this fun. #disneysfault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone yikes. Sounds like someone should skip the next anniversary. #nannystate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone I'm not even there and I would know better than to leave on the busiest day/night in 60 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone that's laughable - common sense needs to step in at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone poor planning on the part of the individual. Can't really blame @disneyland for your own screw ups now can we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone I think this calls for a little accountability on the part of the park goer as well. Know what you're getting into...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone capacity parks for as long as they have been says massive success to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MutilateDrone or epic success?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a blast at #disney24 everyone. I can't be there but I'll be staying up all night reading your tweets so I feel like part of the action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisneylandToday GREAT! Now hopefully the hat box ghost decides to take up permanent residency! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisneylandToday will the new fireworks, world of colour and paint the night remain into 2016?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheOtherAshleyM what about cheeseoke host? #typo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatrinaRV please email me at intothinair@sasktel.net<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkScienceCentre @Groundspeak I’m a die hard cacher! Let me know if I can help! Best of luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkScienceCentre that would be GREAT! The geocaching app from @Groundspeak is the BEST one out there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkScienceCentre it is tremendous fun for all ages. My family and I will likely be out! Don’t get #muggled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParasciJournal what consistently drives me crazy are people who claim to have TV shows etc, and it’s self produced web tv with 0 audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParaScience nothing wrong with it being entertaining. One local researcher said it was like "watching paint dry" I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParaScience @ParasciJournal but a petty fight on an online forum does?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParasciJournal @ParaScience what about working hard and getting REAL publicity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParaScience @ParasciJournal these spats are sad. Everyone needs to be a whole lot less negative. #paraunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s joining me next Tuesday at #yqr Unitarian center for my show at #CVAF2014 ? Show starts at 9pm. Come out and have an experience!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Song being sung by my boys today. “Who’s knocking on the werewolf door? The werewollllffff man. AWOOO” wtf? Werewolf door? @WOLFCOPTheMovie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#yqr tweeps! Are there still regular #tweetups in our city?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatrinaRV sadly it takes away credibility. Too many people pretending to see ghosts detracts from those who have genuine experiences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatrinaRV isn’t it though? I own a car and I sometimes paint. Does that mean I’m a racecar driver? Artist? Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning! Go into today with one goal in mind. PROTECT your dreams. At all cost. Shield them from doubt, hide them from failure!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The reported "man in the hat" did not make an appearance last night. But my 3 month old certainly did. No sleep for anyone. #paranormaldad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 I'm really hoping I DO experience it. Would add credibility to the phenomena. Right now I'm not sure it's more than psychology...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 I could not believe it when she told me. Third time the “black hat man” has come up as of late. Anyone else experience this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my sister in law has seen the “shadow man in a hat” in her room. We’re staying in that same room tonight. Curious #paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 new age of metaphysical supply houses. Local elders. Online.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 burn dried sage “smudging” bundles moving around the home “washing” the space while focusing pure energy/intention. #colesnotes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 my apologies - these scenarios are very hard to asses without speaking directly to the subject.   Perhaps smudging would benefit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One last chance to watch an incredible episode of @OtherSideTV today! Check out @APTN for details and air times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 photos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 difficult to asses as it’s not likely an intelligent “presence” but instead a psychologically based phenomena. #luciddreaming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 once again - sounds like typical sleep paralysis. Any other phenomena occurring?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 don’t want to downplay his experience - but it sounds like post sleep   http://t.co/fVgJZs7rLr paired with “sleep paralysis”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 but always after dreaming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 some skeptics would argue it’s a phenomena paired with dreams as typically, that is when it occurs. #Paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 it really differs from culture to culture. Difficult to asses without more information. More details? When? How long? Etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 what information are you looking for specifically?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#easter cards. Spot the #hiddenmickey @DisneylandToday ?  http://t.co/nmRMiWzjbU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV fans - what did you think of tonight's investigation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She relayed that they wanted to help Candace because she had helped them. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>after we finished filming this Candace was at an elder's gathering in #yxe. An elder saw a couple in spirit with Candace #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We couldn't believe that these items were found. An incredible moment #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The pain in my head at this point was overwhelming. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sammaciag well at least you can take solace in the fact that you work in radio and no one will see you. Trip to the office might be chilly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMintenkoGlobal @AStreckGlobal @GlobalSaskatoon #balfour in #yqr changed their logo years ago. Not sure what the issue is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miss_tanis @bob_crowe how about slightly more manageable terms? I’m up for the challenge if you are Mr.Crowe! @Katrinavision can referee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miss_tanis @bob_crowe is a twitter maniac! We’re neck and neck. Should we have a first to 2000 challenge? #friendlytwitterwar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 def important to study as much as you can.  Having a solid background in the occult and parapsychology is a must.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At rochdale superstore in #yqr - self checkout first on right sounds like she's trapped in an alternate universe. Bizzare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“@MrTeller: TIM’S VERMEER opens at the Bell Lightbox in Toronto &amp; International Village in Vancouver on Friday.” @rattlesnakefilm -see this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 Bucklands guide to spiritual communication for example.  Are you approaching from a technical or intuitive side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 I've studied the rituals of many cultures concerning contact with the spirit world through history. There are basic texts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmaher87 I research nothing prior, doing so taints the course of it and discredits any information I may get intuitively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now accepting intuitive consult clients for next week. Sessions available in person in #yqr or by phone. Discover your future today #psychic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JaceyMilman @paranorbill thank you! It was an incredible experience. Well over an hour worth of comm. came out if it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaColesCBC did you watch @OtherSideTV tonight? We spoke with an important Saskatchewan figure from the other side. Never done before...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A moment like the one you saw tonight on @OtherSideTV has never been caught on film and broadcast before. @aptn is breaking new ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight the world witnessed myself and @paranorbill speaking directly to a verified historic figure who is deceased on @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookies218 @OtherSideTV @paranorbill without a doubt. He came through at many more investigations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigstoneQueen @paranorbill the exact moment was lost in the edit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookies218 @OtherSideTV listen to this session @paranorbill did months after the episode was shot  http://t.co/RBYHabAnab . RH comes through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our session with RH ran for an hour. Much of it unfortunately could not make it into the cut. We learned so much. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was there, and I still have goosebumps watching this unfold. @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigstoneQueen without a doubt. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Direct communication using the k2 meter is fairly rare. Great examples tonight. @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@priscillawolf11 was uninterested in digging deeper I to Harold's identity. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "X" on the meter was placed their to distinguish the one that Harold was connected to. #theothersidetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Harold" had a habit of making things physical with myself and @paranorbill. The touching was constant. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissieHebert @OtherSideTV Tom Charles is an amazing man #spiritualadvisor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews are you watching @OtherSideTV tonight? People will be talking about this tommorow. #paranormal #History<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go, everything is different after this @OtherSideTV fans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TEAM CANADA FOR THE WIN! #Sochi2014 #GoCanadaGo #WeAreWinter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go... #Sochi2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I hear right? 149 million dollars in talent on team Canada? Wow. #sochi2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbc commentators keep mentioning "luck" and how #TeamCanada needs it. Does luck really factor into hockey? #GoCanadaGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That must be a cfl ref. #Sochi2014 #TeamCanada #hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sskroughriders fans watching this team Canada hockey game are not flinching. We're used to nail biters aren't we? @mblairregina #gocanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@priscillawolf11 it was such an unbelievable and incredibly emotional night. This may change viewers lives as well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's watching @OtherSideTV tonight? "Harold's" identity and history is revealed. It's shocking stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@priscillawolf11 do you think the belief is misplaced? #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@priscillawolf11 @paranorbill how did it affect you Priscilla?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well done team canada!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was watching @nickthune on netflix last night. My wife's reaction? "This guy is annoying the $&amp;!?@ out of me". I liked him. #tiredwife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MJCultural I am! You must be psychic! #psychicpowers ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskGregger agreed x 2. The things that go viral amaze me sometimes. #degradingsociety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any insight into how the #yqr emergency rooms look tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who else is happy the #harlemshake phenomena is dead? If it lasted longer we'd have to deal with 4000 Olympic versions from #Sochi2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKClarke just for clarification - we're from Canada, love traveling to @Disneyland - been there twice. Not Orlando - does this work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck to @jimmyfallon tonight! May the odds be ever in your favor! Looking forward to being on your show one day #psychicpowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKClarke can I have her call you tommorow after 11am central time? (7pm here now)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for @TimHortonsYQR to throw in a tiny little bit of disappointment at the end of every double double #RollUpTheRim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKClarke @MousePlanet my wife has done it twice and would love to share!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParaconCa @BBC would that not be great? Better yet a #cyberman and a #dalek dancing to an epic piece by #johnwilliams #DrWho #obsessed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of these ice dance pairs needs to do a #DrWho and his companion routine. Would that not be GREAT?!? #Sochi2014 @BBC #gbr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the @cbc #Sochi2014  app for #ipad is GOLD. Clean, easy to operate, streams beautifully. Well done!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“@LADYALEXANDRIA: @hotmentalist @OtherSideTV @paranorbill @priscillawolf11 well WINNIPEG would LOVE TO MEET YOU ALL” @ParaconCa ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to meet the cast of @othersidetv? Let the organizers of local #paranormal cons know! We'd LOVE to meet! @paranorbill  @priscillawolf11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whenever I see someone using a #blackberry I can't help but wonder if they're time travellers and mystified by our modern technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to say it and I LOVE both. But...  #drwho &gt; #starwars   #controversy  #fandompocalypse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brad Jacobs is owning the Americans in the 10th end. Way to go! #gocanada #Sochi2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The news bombards us with stories of the lack of justice in the U.S. Truly heartbreaking. #JusticeForJordanDavis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LADYALEXANDRIA @OtherSideTV submit your story for season 2! Thanks for watching - we tried to make a show with ghosts, heart AND soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2nd time in 4 years I wake up to this. Para activity accompanied last time. We're being visited. #TheOtherSideTV  http://t.co/UairneJEVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many guys in line at Walmart with cheesy bears and candy. If it's thought that counts - last minute grabs don't count for much. #Fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agm848 here you can view past episodes.  http://t.co/HyRw0QGt2Y.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agm848 to be honest. To this day I am skeptical that it was in fact a bear and not the negative force from the @SaskWDM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParaconCa thanks for the follow! I'll try and keep my posts "spirited" ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>next week on @othersidetv you'll see the most intense moment of DIRECT communication with the spirit world that's ever been captured.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nearly at #5000 tweets. Roughly 700k letters. Average novel has 150k. I should write  books instead. Being published is on the bucket list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpooly @OtherSideTV which part was confusing? Perhaps I can clarify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kreelynn thank you! It was thrilling to investigate these locations! Have you had personal experiences at the school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesertMoon7130 @paranorbill our next episode is incredible - powerful evidence and connection NEVER captured by any other team. #historic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks to all the @OtherSideTV fans for their notes and well wishes after last nights episode aired. Your concern means the world :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigstoneQueen @OtherSideTV we stayed in NB. I did not sleep that night. Nothing else happened. Nearly quit the show in the am...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rchelack never. This was the one and only time I've been attacked. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigstoneQueen @OtherSideTV I didn't sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigstoneQueen @OtherSideTV I had no sense at all. I was blindsided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaskGatz @OtherSideTV check your local listings. It does replay many times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe I sat through that experience again. Sweaty palms as I tweet. Anyone have questions for me? @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We immediately stopped production at this point. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ran into the street and puked right after the cameras went off. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dLimacher though I'm not 100% certain ( no one is ) I believe so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rchelack worse. Keep watching. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spirit we were dealing with was agitated and aggressive. Never a good sign. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were being baited here and we couldn't see it. @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watch this and can't believe how we missed the fact that we were being manipulated by the spirit. @OtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Direct responses while using emf detection equipment are fairly unusual and rare. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Temperature shifts are very common during investigations. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The physical nature of the manifestations were very concerning. We were always being touched by unseen hands.#TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill is using a controversial provocation technique here to elicit a response from the sprit. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The energy necessary to melt those plates would have been extreme. #TheOtherSideTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 minutes away from @OtherSideTV airing for me. I'm a little hesitant to watch tonight. Reliving those moments won't be easy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyWick1 @OtherSideTV this episode captures the scariest moment I've experienced in 29 years. Not something I'd wish on anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's the night. Will you be watching @OtherSideTV on @aptn? #paranormal #yqr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Wed on @APTN I get to relive the chilling moment that nearly made me leave @OtherSideTV. Not sure I'm ready, still makes me ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comedians in cars getting coffee is amazing. So simple, so insightful. Really should be on proper television as opposed to @CrackleCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A moment that defies logic. What posses him to do this?!? WHY?!? #parenting #kidsarecrazy #DADSRT @DadsRoundTable  http://t.co/eJzwBPyuNz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dLimacher @OtherSideTV for the record - I don't believe the practice of speaking to the dead is inherently evil or good. It can be both...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dLimacher @OtherSideTV many people think trying to talk to ghosts is taboo. It's rooted in a fear of the unknown I think. #paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I voiced my opinion on the notion that the work I do is "satanic" on last weeks episode of @OtherSideTV. What do you think? Good? Evil?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV Mitch Albom once said "death ends a life - not a relationship". Thoughts? Does the spirit continue on after death #yxe ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @WOLFCOPTheMovie how many of you believe in ghosts. Is your paranormal spectrum limited to werewolves? who wins in a fight? #ghostvswolf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There have to be skeptics out there. Curious how many of you refuse to believe in ghosts. If you're a nonbeliever - why? @OtherSideTV #ghost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laceyleelundeen have you been able to successfully talk to the dead in the past? #paranormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had incredible experiences in #yqr and #yxe searching for ghosts on @OtherSideTV - any one currently living in a haunted space?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@otherside today @TMZLive and @HarveyLevinTMZ questioned the validity of #paranormal tv shows. Curious what the consensus is. #yqr #yxe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brickwade it's the Amityville Horror story. This is one of the best photographic captures in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherSideTV easily one of the most important factors. We get incredible evidence when we approach with respect. #paranormal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dan_bowman what would constitute proof for you? Not trying to be combative etc - trying to start a dialogue between believer and skeptic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kreuts too hot to be leaving animals in cars. Nothing gets me more fired up than when I see this. Animals are helpless and need care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginapolice @Kreuts curious. If someone finds an animal in a car and breaks a window to save animal. Is there recourse against rescuer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kreuts they won’t. Did you call the @reginapolice ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disneylandcats thanks! As with any legend its a mix of 2 parts reality and 2 parts magic. Very, very cool story. Long live the Disney Cats!<|endoftext|>
