<|startoftext|>That was exactly how a President should address the nation! No name calling, no crying fraud, no cutting down others in any way! @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris are true leaders who have what it takes to bring our nation together and make the American Dream EQUAL for all. ❤️🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barriers broken and new beginnings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joy cannot be contained! Congratulations @JoeBiden #PresidentElectBiden  and an even BIGGER congratulations #MadameVicePresidentHarris @KamalaHarris. This is what makes America great the diversity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s so fitting #trump is golfing while America is seeing massive COVID-19 cases rather then doing anything at all. So proud of #PresidentElectJoe @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris for leading this country. #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris  https://t.co/LkyGJPG5Fp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you to all these amazing individuals facing and overcoming so many odds to ensure every vote is counted and equal representation is achieved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeannaRadio Well since chick-fil-a is a homophobic company who donates to conversion therapy and other organizations to deny rights to LGBTQ+ the choice is obvious!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeuceOnTheAir @DeuceOnTheAir @TheNinaBlanco  just have to say that @DubzTheThird is absolutely correct that ketchup goes on mac-&amp;-cheese 🤩. I don’t make the rules🤷🏽🤷🏽, I just eat that deliciousness up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>❤️🧡💛💚💙💜  💔6.12.2016💔 - Today four years ago 49 lives were senselessly taken at #pulse nightclub. Equality and acceptance is needed now more then ever, and we have the power to reverse the hate against all. This fight is not over #neverforgoten #orlandostrong  https://t.co/PVlRo4A6dY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lay-off 🤬. For a company that said they had high values and strong ethics, this moment is a sad reflection of the brand. I’m so sorry for all the great 24 Hour Fitness talent that is now looking for employment, and if I can help in any way please let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even one day after laying off hundreds of amazing talented employees you put out a notice to announce you are excited to be opening up clubs! I can’t believe how @24hourfitness has treated so many employees with lack of communication, vague answers, and then a conference call  https://t.co/0VIYoHUcng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris No correlation! Nothing out of this administration but lies and cover-ups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have yet to see a single police department say they need shields, rubber bullets, or tear gas... But for months and months we have all heard the pleas for basic medical equipment to save hundreds of lives. #blacklifematters #GeorgeFloyd #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovAndyBeshear @djaycameron @DanielCameronAG @RepJohnYarmuth @RandPaul @senatemajldr will you be on the side of justice for the killers of #BreonnaTaylor? #blacklifematters #Blm  https://t.co/zrbAjb0zIg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Racism is alive all around us! You can’t ignore the proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting! That smug look on his face as he says we are all nothing and fully expendable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk ❤️❤️❤️ finally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The pride of these sick individuals is absolutely horrifying! The officers better get life in prison for MURDER! What has our world become with such hatred? Could it be the racist wanna be president who spews hatred at every turn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk This should have taken place months ago and not taken the entire country to have these two men arrested for MURDER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice failed #AhmaudArbery months ago when his killers were allowed to go free after a cold blooded murder! What is happening right now in America is disgusting and more then ever we need to come together and put an end to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCBarnish In the same situation. Applied on 3.30 for unemployment and never received a pin number to access the site to view anything. Hopefully I can get through today at some point and on 2 1/2 hours of calling. @jaredpolis @ColoradoLabor  https://t.co/lg4K1dMvpT<|endoftext|>
