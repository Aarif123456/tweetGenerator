<|startoftext|>@Tilted2Q2Q @sk17369 @TheyCallMeDoc1 One of many, where people actually thought it is real. Unfortunately a lot just repost anything, especially when it comes from big(ish) accounts.

<|startoftext|>@sk17369 @TheyCallMeDoc1 @Tilted2Q2Q Oh, why you felt a need to defend a person that clearly doesn’t care what he posts? And then I am a troll? Maybe I am. At least I am not spreading misinformation. Hope you will feel better x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheyCallMeDoc1 @Tilted2Q2Q @sk17369 I am a troll? 😂 You and people like yourself are a reason that plenty are not taking this movement seriously. Focus on real issues not a poorly made photoshop that brings nothing but misinformation. Unless that’s your goal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RamblingRingo @CV2175911874 @CllrBSilvester None of the other health issues matter now. Now people are getting mental about flu jabs. They get them every year, especially elderly, but still flu mortality rate is higher than covid.  Unfortunately the same people will line up for c19 vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBrotherWatch Done. Unfortunately, my MP seems to be way to busy to reply 😡 Will remember that on the day of elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamblingRingo @CV2175911874 @CllrBSilvester Just listened to Magic Radio. Switched off during news, after they said that 1mil ppl died because of covid, but they suspect this figure is much higher...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sirjervisfruit @RamblingRingo @xyz_louise @BorisJohnson @MattHancock Staged? Many kids have to get tested to get allowed back at school/preschool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PISDI94_96 It will be 2am where I am and have to do a school run in the morning, so will have to do it with a water 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QohnG They made a partial u-turn about it, and they will not sell alcohol after 10pm. They will still serve food though 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @BBCNews instead of running your usual fear narrative, maybe you will show this, huh? #bbcnews #Covid19UK #Casedemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was quick. #COVID19 #Parliament #hypocrites #10pmcurfew   https://t.co/R73TMt5Hqp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martingeddes My husband is stuck in his home country, haven’t seen him since March. Airport is closed there, I can’t get in, he can’t get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaggieT_1979 @LtdCfp @3Heckmonwyke @BorisJohnson @MattHancock @Conservatives Boris is just a puppet. Although it doesn’t make him less guilty. Stay at home, wear a mask, download the app. What’s next? When people will say: enough!? It will be hard for some to wake up as long as their only source of information comes from MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaggieT_1979 @LtdCfp @3Heckmonwyke @BorisJohnson @MattHancock @Conservatives That’s the one 😅 Will be the same with the vaccines. Not mandatory, but if you want to go to work, shopping, fly for holiday then having a one is a must.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martingeddes I sent an email to my MP, dr Ben Spencer. The only response I got back was an automatic one. Can’t wait to find out how he will vote regarding Coronavirus Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police in #Paris throw their handcuffs on the street. They refuse to arrest protesters. How different to what happened in #TrafalgarSquare #London yesterday. #londonprotest #FreeSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaggieT_1979 @LtdCfp @3Heckmonwyke The contact tracing app, that government advertise everywhere.  https://t.co/mV4LGAvQFB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilMaclaren1 @CarnellAnita I am afraid it’s well above their pay grade to decide how they have to deal with a crowd. Of course it’s not an excuse for what they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamoTruthSeeker @Paramythia__ @AlfMegoa Shoes, skirt and a jacket look identical. What would be the odds that two different people would come to the protest dressed like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamoTruthSeeker @Paramythia__ @AlfMegoa Looks the same to me. The only thing that is different is a missing scarf. Someone pointed out under my reposted video, that she might be a crisis actor 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHowe73500437 @rdevitoboutin Hmmm. You might be correct, but what would be a purpose of this ff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paramythia__ @DamoTruthSeeker @AlfMegoa If she did it was most likely accidental when she was trying to keep her balance after falling off the chair. Can’t see any footage where she was maliciously swinging the stick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@offshorebella @TimInEngland @LeCreusetFiend Definitely looks like two separate incidents with this woman involved. The one with a chair is when it all apparently started.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realEscanor @TrumperWavin  https://t.co/kvsQ0yyCPY I think that was thw first one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realEscanor @TrumperWavin Pics here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realEscanor @TrumperWavin Nothing. They achieved what they were intended to, they put fear in peoples head. One of the anons followed that lead and made a thread about how chinese started that and spreaded it wide with fake accounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crisis_Intel @the_kempe @DiggerBigMac Some scientists say that masks do more harm than good. Some say, that vaccines, especially those not fully developed and tested can do more harm than good. But they’re not to be trusted because they are not saying this on the telly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Nope. And Q is not a single person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Cult with no leader? Cult that tells you to think for yourself? Then yeah, maybe I am. Go and watch tv, your only source of truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Definitely not. I am in favor of locking up criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Yes I usually stay away from people so brainwashed like you. In the meantime go and lock yourself because of few people who might or might not died from c19. And ignore false positives and comorbidities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel All? Barely. All they can is to catch those thugs and then do it again and again. And those money that people donated in good cause go to finance those criminals  and their democratic masters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel In case you haven’t noticed, there are many scientists and not all of them follow the msm and gov fear agenda. Look at the stats and think for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel And bailed in no time to break even more laws. But yeah, finally someone will lock them up for good. Maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crisis_Intel @defnotamarxist Yes, because when you’re old the chance you die is low, unless you catch covid. When other treatments are delayed it doesn’t matter, because covid is the only one that counts now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Oh, and in case you haven’t notice, it’s not the first protest. So far those tens of thousands are not rushing to the hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Oh, so committing a crime is fine because they wear a mask? 😂 Darling, the only reason they do is to make it harder to identify them when they destroy and steal 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnotamarxist @Crisis_Intel Yes, just before BLM looters, arsonists and other antifa criminals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillAuDeepState @arthur_kingsley It’s been like this for months in my case... 😠  https://t.co/8bVl3VhdlK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber I was trying to find something about it. It stuck in my head since I read his comment. Found this website. I have no clue if it’s related or not.  https://t.co/eHzzOMIY6Q  https://t.co/ShDMb6mYZJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlertPhx Finally Flynn’s case coming to an end? 🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought that the day will come when I will agree with #nigelfarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Myfanwy_72 @whaleswarrior @GenFlynn Wanted to ask the same question. But I saw on the website, that donations are only allowed from US citizens and residents. I guess it’s due to a good legal reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a suprise...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sablelulu @AprilDa60944457 @CBSThisMorning @60Minutes @Quibi @LaurieSegall If you base your judgment on what was said in msm, then I am not suprised. Do your own research, look at this from both sides.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pouissant1 @ETheFriend It’s not a big issue, but when the text is copied from somewhere, especially word for word, using “” doesn’t hurt. All the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pouissant1 You could just retweet from @ETheFriend instead of copy and paste 😅  https://t.co/xf3VvW7YlD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber Oh and about DOJ... maybe there is a chance. This will be an important week according to Cue. Also Jizzlane Maxwell is back on the spotlight soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber Not so sure about RBG. I am more convinced that she was long gone, at least since 2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek The one that they showed far and wide claiming that qanon=domestic terrorism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gypsy2020Guitar @LiberalLion1776 @Newsweek Many don’t, but they are still decent people. There is good and evil in this world. As long as we’re decent to each other everything is cool and religion doesn’t need to be mixed into it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber Posting about a date was unnecessary, looks more like a larp now. I usually take everything with a pinch of salt anyway. Whatever will happen, nothing we can do about it... I will just sit, wait and meditate ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek If false fbi statement is for you a proper research, then we definitely have a different idea about decent journalism 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Queb2 @KarluskaP That’s amazing! But tbh his coverage is much bigger, worldwide even ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek True. In some way they did qanon a favour. Many open minded people digged a bit deeper and saw something more than a bunch of lunatics. What I despise about msm is that they haven’t even done proper research. Poor reporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek There is a lot I don’t know, but trying to find truth does hurt. And maybe god doesn’t exist, maybe there is only a Flying Spaghetti Monster, but I don’t care ;) All the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gypsy2020Guitar @LiberalLion1776 @Newsweek So many documents are still classified, year by year we will see more of theories being turned into facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek So ask yourself a question, why they are not ignoring the “nut jobs”? They have enough going on to cover 24/7. Their first mentions of qanon was false fbi statement 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek In every group there are ppl that take everything to far. But qanon are not violent, extremist people. Peace, justice and safe world are not the things that deserve such a smear campaign in media. Truth is out there. God bless you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek There are many. Dalai Lama being a CIA asset, gov trying mind control, “Project Sunshine”... I can go on and on. Some of theories are crazy, I agree, but ridiculing Qanon by msm, without checking what they are actually about is not fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalLion1776 @Gypsy2020Guitar @Newsweek Over the years, how many of “conspiracy theories” turn out to be true? The recent one, linked to qanon, about missing children. True or conspiracy? How many children rescued in recent weeks?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wilfred50684485 @DavidBegnaud He just was. And was sincere and emphatic. How do you know he never showed that before? Because you haven’t seen it in MSM? They will never show him in a good light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSacredIsle @JackPosobiec Please get your eyes tested. He was caught off guard, and as we all know if he wants to say or do something, he just does. He was sincere and emphatic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jono61698712 Certainly not media. They’re just a tube for their fear narrative. It’s sad, but the answer is always: “follow the money”... Big Pharma, Gates, CEPI, GAVI...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesAThurber @Darylcook7 This, but also huge online fear campaign started by fake accounts all over social media. Remember Chinese man dropping dead in the middle of the street? False flag. This all put pressure on government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bullster70 @TonyBN3 @UKCovid19Stats @ProfKarolSikora Hopefully. Unfortunately fear narrative produced by media and gov will make their work much harder.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calibrax @RealDeniseWelch Stupid? Just because she doesn’t follow yours and msm fear narrative?

<|startoftext|>@VoteSmartPlease @paul_furber There is nothing known for sure here. Plenty of gunshots, it could have been anything, but I highly doubt it was a high velocity bullet from ar15. I just hope this kid will have the best attorney possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber I am asking because comparing the wound on a headshot “victim” and the one that he shot in the arm, they don’t really match. Looks like fired from a completely different weapon.  But I am not an expert, so if someone can correct me, I would be grateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_furber He handled the situation very well considering the circumstances. Great survival skills. Is there any evidence that he actually fired the bullet that killed that pedo? Something other that blury, chaotic video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martingeddes It’s certainly good to see an account who doesn’t really care about popularity contest. Quality over quantity. Always pleasure to read your tweets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes Proven? Many studies say one thing, then other studies say different. Who to believe? Gov officialls, WHO, were saying that masks doesn’t work. Now they magically do. How many times they will change their narrative?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes Both. I am young, healthy person. I care about my immune system, my physical and mental health. And you really think a piece of cloth will protect you? Or maybe paper thin mask that you buy paying highly inflated price?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes Figures calculated by DoH and few others show about 16k deaths. But who cares, not covid, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes I don’t base my decision on figures, but on common sense. As a free person I am allowed to have a choice. You also. I don’t say to you: “don’t wear mask”. You do you. Government doesn’t give a fuck about you or me. And now I have to believe they care about me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes I did my research. Check your beloved msm, even they reported that PHE figures include deaths of ppl that were tested positive months ago. Who will benefit from your fear when you will run to get vaccinated? Check how many ppl died as a direct result of lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes Then think about those old ppl removed from the hospitals and dumped into care houses. Didn’t get proper treatment, died... must be covid, right? How many of them contribute to total death count? 20k!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Otis @martingeddes Those figures are fiddled. Many died because of underlying conditions, but as they were tested positive before (how many of those were false positives?), they were “officially” covid deaths.<|endoftext|>
