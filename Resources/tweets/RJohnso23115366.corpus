<|startoftext|>Herd immunity is possible. Otherwise why are the pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines?! If herd immunity wasn‚Äôt possible they wouldn‚Äôt waste their time and money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdavidsamadi Twitter sensorship is out of hand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMarkHohe All kids should return to normal in person education. Return life to normal. Regardless it will after the election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All kids should go back to school as normal. Children aren‚Äôt a vector for COVID-19. #COVID__19 #BacktoSchool #Mentalhealth #hydroxycholoroquine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdavidsamadi Teachers who refuse to return should loose their paycheck. If a teacher only works online, should have some reductions in income. Enough BS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat5775kat @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Not possible?! Not even worth more comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marycircle43 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Immunization is the best way to get herd immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmenb6636 @n4ski37 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Yup, must be a robot or maybe just not a sheeple. Idk. You are the one arguing with the robot (or what you believe may be one)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carmenb6636 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump There is no evidence of that. Provide your source<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoleJoslin8 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump I have had this virus. I‚Äôm still alive just as 99% of everyone who has had it. I don‚Äôt wish you ill. That is childish. Learn to disagree with people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcaspringer @sunnyflowergirl @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Even more reason to open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Only way to move past this virus is to have herd immunity. This immunity can only happen two ways! 1. Immunization or 2. Exposure to virus.<|endoftext|>
