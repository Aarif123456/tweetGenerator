<|startoftext|>I would say that it's amazing to see "progressives" engage in the same quasi-fascistic tactics that they claim Republicans do all the time, but because they're the "good guys" it's okay, but it isn't. Cenk's auditioning for a return to MSNBC has not gone unnoticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key word being "if". Spoiler alert: he doesn't. Biden literally said to Comcast executives, at the beginning of his primary campaign, "Nothing will fundamentally change." Even suggesting that Biden will do anything close to "progressive" is comical, approaching dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to be a special kind of masochist/cuck to willingly endorse someone like Biden when you were cheated not once, but twice, out of the nomination by a corrupt, corporate party owned by oligarchs. Shame on you, Bernie. We want our money back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is all that is coming from this twitter account since the media and deep state declared Biden the winner, and it's all that's going to be tweeted until the summer because the neoliberals don't want to help people economically, and they won't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the problem in a nutshell. Who did you vote for, Krystal? I'll take a wild guess and say it's the Iraq War backer who did Wall Street's bidding. Even if you didn't, did you push for a 3rd party to run? No. Because Cheeto man bad. You're crypto-neolib is showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a shame, indeed. Probably got poisoned by that TYT grift that's going around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Biden told the donors, "Nothing will fundamentally change" this is the shit he was talking about.  I'm sorry, you were talking about brunch or whatever. Didn't mean to interrupt you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just imagine if Democrats actually had integrity instead of doing political posturing and kowtowing to "Mama Bear" whenever a committee appointment is threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now they can all go back to brunch, which is all they wanted in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunrisemvmt Congrats, grifters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is 100% unverifiable without a time machine or portal to an alternate reality. Also, who gives a fuck? Trump is out now, and the Obama-era crypto-fascist policies that gave rise to Trump will resume, creating a worse Trump in 2024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Might"? He built his career on working with Republicans because, wait for it, HE IS ONE. You're grift is showing, dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if you say shit like this on CNN or MSNBC you're racist, sexist, &amp; xenophobic all at once and Silicon Valley oligarchs need to ban you immediately, then neoliberals get to throw tomatoes at you from their brunch tables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Biden gives one platitude-filled, bible-quoting speech about unity &amp; healing and you're ready shift from "push him left" to "give him time". Tell that to the 30 million people about to be thrown out of their homes, grifter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know what it's going to take for @jimmy_dore to finally come out and condemn this grifting neoliberal  POS and MSNBC-adjacent company filled with neo progressives, but it's beyond past due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've been elected CEO &amp; COO by the corporations that own this country. They aren't giving us that shit. Ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor are they conscious of who built those cages and who isn't tearing them down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's what you're going to brunch celebrating, liberals/neoliberals/crypto-neolibs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As senator, Biden could have introduced legislation to end the drug war. He should of done that. Instead he introduced the '94 crime bill, its partner legislation that targets poor people of color &amp; punishes them for being desperate, forever. He's a Republican, pushing GOP shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it was "gangsta" for Biden to win from his basement though, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke crypto-neoliberal grifter gives us a preview of the next four years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing says achievement like winning zero electoral votes and being chosen by the @DNC as the President-in-waiting for when Biden's drugs no longer work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anti-Trump grifters lead by @cenkuygur virtue signal about how Kamala is "one of us", and how great that is. "It's a great moment for America."

<|startoftext|>In the middle of a last-word off Biden is touting the deep state endorsements, &amp; running to the neoliberal safe corner of #Russiagate. Only Trump can make this reanimated corpse look "liberal" in any way. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I ran because of you." No, you ran because Obama roasted you at a press correspondents dinner and your narcissist ego couldn't handle it, Donny. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither of these two are going to talk about the militarization of the police, racist policing, disproportionate murdering of the black &amp; brown people by police, and that's because neither believes that racism actually exists in America today. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Trump hitting Biden from the left on the crime bill. Only the Dems could force through a candidate that is, regularly, attacked from the left by Trump. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr. '94 Crime Bill is now going to try &amp; show that he has sympathy &amp; white guilt. Please. A Biden/Harris admin moving "left" on race &amp; policing will be, "Shoot them in the leg." Everything else will stay the same. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëá #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell that Biden is about to explode because he's doing the whole angry grandpa raises his voice when he's tired of what you're saying bit. Biden is not only not going to reunite families, but the cages will be expanded. Bank on it. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump hitting Biden on the cages is important, but it won't be given the attention that it should be given. Biden attempting to virtue signal here is pathetic. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay Joe, then why didn't you and Barack raise the minimum wage under your administration? He can't win this argument in a vacuum, but the establishment will carry all his water for him. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "I don't see red or blue" and then differentiating between the two in the next breath is, at best, confusing. Biden needs to reign in this American exceptionalism nonsense because it doesn't match reality. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The HEROES act is a giant giveaway to the military industrial complex. Neither one of these corporate assholes will help people going forward, and this "debate" is revealing that clearly. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This segment bashing Pelosi is going to resonate with the country, no matter what blue-check, lefty Twitter wants to tell themselves. No, McConnell will not pass it. But Pelosi won't even bring it to him. And now Biden is trying to push the HEROES act. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, they've already all learned the wrong lesson from the 2nd rigged primary. "I beat those 20 other candidates." Yeah, because the donors told your friend Barack to make some phone calls. Thanks, Obama. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Right to affordable healthcare" is code for "right to be raped by rapacious middlemen known as insurance companies". Every other country listens to this and wonders why there hasn't been a revolution here since the late 18th century. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't reform a party who's nominee states, literally, "I beat 20 other candidates because I'm not going to eliminate private insurance." We're watching a neo-fascist debate a crypto-fascist &amp; people are calling it democracy. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have two Big Pharma whores trying to attack each on their right, with Biden promoting the false hope of a public option, which is where the least amount of money, services, &amp; support will go. #Debates2020 #debates #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh, Hitler has made an appearance. Apparently Godwin's Law doesn't just apply to the internet anymore. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where the fuck are the policy discussions on the economy, healthcare, climate change, education? #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiorella_im Biden looks like he's just rehashing the last debate, but I suppose the bar is that low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a malarkey sighting. Shit just got real. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accurate. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This bank account in China nonsense is catnip for liberals, neoliberals, and crypto-neolibs. No one cares. The climate is collapsing, people are suffering without another stimulus, we're escalating with Venezuela, and I could go on. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden is going to attack Trump without refuting the claims about Hunter then attack his kids taking tens of millions of dollars during his presidency, negating the nepotism argument. Missed opportunity. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This as well. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden can't refute the money he's taken, and he's knows it. All he has are feeble acts on Trump's taxes, which fails to acknowledge the system that allows him to pay so little in taxes. This is pathetic. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is the corrupt-off portion of the debate. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden lying bluntly on camera, and there will be zero pushback from the "progressive" news media at large. Biden has taken money from credit card companies, Ukraine, and, yes, a Russian billionaire. Trump is taking money from Israel &amp; Saudi Arabia. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This point about the 3.5 mil from the wife of a former mayor of Moscow is true, &amp; every liberal on T.V. &amp; the internet will either ignore that or call it a lie, and that's pathetic. I know it's Trump saying it, but that doesn't mean it's not true. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First it was, "No, you're more xenophobic!" Now it's, "I'm more hawkish (code for xenophobic) than you, Jack!" #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, here's the rebooted #Russiagate conspiracy, with its spinoff saga, Iran: The Next Quagmire. Fml. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden casually forgetting Woodward's name. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is talking out of both sides of his mouth and no one is going to point it out. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden trying to harm on the CARES act to help people/businesses is pathetic. 4.25 trillion to fully socialize the banks/corporations. Neither of these two are going to pass another stimulus to help people, and austerity is coming for the working class. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "we have to open the country" rhetoric is code for there's no stimulus coming. And citing depression, suicides, joblessness is a red herring. People were depressed, suicidal, jobless BEFORE COVID. The pandemic just exposed &amp; exacerbated these problems. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country." - Biden  Wtf does that mean? And more nonsensical one-liners, followed by DNC rambling talking points. Biden needs to turn this around. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is coming off as really snippy, and I don't know what Trump is on but he's being very restrained (for him). I'm literally in a pocket universe in hell. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two old bigots having a "who's more xenophobic" contest is where this country is at, apparently. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, don't use the term "dark winter". That's a military term for mass casualty event regarding an outbreak. #Debates2020 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump looks annoyed because he's been told to be subdued, Biden comes off as lost and grumpy. Fun. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And the ghost of #Russiagate has made another appearance tonight. Yay. #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just so fucking gross. "We can't do zero fossil fuels by 2030. Not possible. But we can have zero net emissions by 2035, because that's when the already super wealthy tech and fossil fuel companies can transition and still stay wealthy." That's what he means. #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Whenever we talk about climate the president thinks it's a joke and I think it's jobs." - Biden  This is the fundamental problem. Either climate change is a hoax or it's a business opportunity. This is the spectrum of allowable debate regarding climate collapse. #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is literally advocating for clean fracking right now. We're so fucked. #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicLgrrl I'm sure none of this is about the fact that Twitter wants to suppress dissent by classifying it as "fake news". Because nothing can go wrong with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Biden just advocated for "shooting them in the leg" again. We live in a literal dystopian nightmare. Fml.  #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicLgrrl I'm experiencing a similar problem. Just keep trying to send it, eventually it will go through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How are you going to end systemic police abuses?" "I'm going to set up a study..." - Biden  You mean like your "climate commission". I'm sure that real change will come from both, @JoeBiden.  #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonPlacone Yes. I'm experiencing a similar problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden lying about the '94 Crime bill in real time is just a healthy reminder that he's going to A) Keep hiding behind the Violence Against Women Act (and that's on purpose, then &amp; now) &amp; B) Never stop talking about how things are "different now". #BidenTownHall<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's 2020. The economy is in a slow-motion depression, the climate is trying to purge us, the rest of the world thinks we're on the brink of civil war, 30 mil people might be homeless at Christmas, &amp; those two want you to know they're pro-fracking. #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This VP debate was a giant waste of time unless you're a corporate donor. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, here's the pho-togetherness ending to this farce of a dull VP debate that no one cares about. Que the non-answer answer from both of these corporate puppets now. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like listing off Republicans as your endorsements as the Dem VP to excite the left in your party. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala doubling down on her record after getting called out by Pence on national television tells you everything you need to know about @TheDemocrats going forward. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala the Cop, who kept people in prison past their release date so that they can continue their slave duties, and Pence, who hides behind inflated and skewed stats and Tim Scott, are literally shifting the Overton Window further to the right. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, now we're on the pro-religion segment that no one asked for. Fml. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A sizable family"? The fuck does that have to do with this, creepy old man? And now he's going full theocratic fanatic, surprising no one. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing to watch one candidate tout murdering a foreign general, who was fighting ISIS, and another to Russiagate and agitate another nuclear foreign power. Love where the Overton window is in the US. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do people get wealthy in this economy, Cenk? By legalizing greed, which is fully legalized and socialized. Wtf is this tweet? Does MSNBC have a slot open that you're auditioning for?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This diatribe by Pence about how the Trump has been good to the environment, and how we're going to "innovate" our way to dealing with climate change. That's code for more deregulation of the EPA. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence taking about how good fracking is, and now Kamala repeating that point, is why no one who prioritizes climate change and the environment in general over everything else will vote for either of these sociopaths. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish that I could believe the half-measures that Kamala has promoted. Even then, wouldn't help. And now Pence is talking how the tax cuts help working families. What he won't say is that the tax cuts for workers are temporary &amp; dor the rich they're permanent. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The myth of Trump as a "businessman" &amp; "job creator" needs to stop. He inherited 1/4 of a billion dollars. He's lost almost as much on his failed businesses. And he's outsourced more jobs at this point than Obama did. Just stop. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's another debate prep talking point, now about the taxes. The Russiagate segment begins in 3...2...1...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Kamala citing her qualifications regarding the presidency is insane. For someone that got dressed down by @TulsiGabbard on national television for her criminal behavior as the AG of California to now have no push back from the moderator is peak neoliberalism. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence telling anyone else to stop "playing politics" is laughable on too many levels. And this swine flu invocation is pathetic. Why do you keep bring this up, dude? This false equivalence is sad. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing that Pence can sit there and talking about the sacrifices of Americans without mentioning lost jobs and healthcare. And all Harris can do is reply with feigned outrage and vapid virtue signaling. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence responds with standard xenophobic talking points then Harris counters with the Woodward "revelations" in a rehearsed rebuttal. No talk about Medicare for All or UBI so far, shocking no one. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala comes out with her over-rehearsed debate prep speech that doesn't answer the question. Sadness. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone ready for tonight's Presidential, I MEAN VP debate? Will Kamala appear on stage in a hermetically-sealed bubble spewing neoliberal &amp; crypto-fascist rhetoric? Will Pence have a giant cross placed behind him on stage while he announces his 2024 run? Stay tuned! #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is going to give himself either a heart attack, stroke, pneumonia, and/or respiratory failure doing this shit. What a fucking moron.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If this lands with you you're a neoliberal and you can unfollow me now, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KyleKulinskiForModerator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Once the winner has been been declared that'll be the end of it." Oh Joseph. You have no idea what's going on in this country. Not a single fucking clue. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TheDemocrats have had 19 years to address what's happened since the 2000 election. They did not. They have only themselves to blame for the loser getting a majority of the votes and losing the election &amp; The Supreme Court declaring a winner. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump priming his base for "election fraud" is a partly a 2000 redux, and partly an anarchical disaster with polling places and ballots being counted. The failed state just hit the accelerator, not the brakes. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, Trump didn't determine the outcome of this election. @BarackObama did when he got your new friends Amy and Pete to drop out, and kept Warren in long enough to screw Bernie. We know exactly why this election is the way it is, Joe. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Green New Deal is not my plan." "No, I don't support the Green New Deal." - @JoeBiden  Hey, @BernieSanders, defend this. Go ahead, asshole. Defend him, respond right now.  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden's meds are wearing off, and Trump's meds are a little too amped today. The end of this is going to be interesting. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I went to Brazil with 20 billions dollars and said, 'Stop it. Cut it out.'" I think we found the Hillary contribution to Joe's debate prep. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Net zero production by 2035. Not $15/hour, but, you know, money."  Holy fuck, the progressives are not officially staying home in November. Period.  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, the climate discussion is going to be about tree cities and slightly reducing emissions, while not reducing the coal/natural gas we have. "No new fossil fuels" along with "500 charging stations". Yeah, they'll stop climate collapse, Joe. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We're going to have the cleanest water, best forests you've ever seen. Believe me, we're going to have forest cities, like in Europe. You know, Narnia is a great city, so is Gondor, believe. This nice man with a beard, Gandolf, he's terrific. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These two talking about climate change is peak cringe. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beau Biden does cocaine, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars in Ukraine and China because Joe got him jobs in both. Because it's Trump saying it it will be dismissed. Sadness. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RUSSIAGATE. *fills in bingo card* #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SPACE FORCE. *fills in bingo card* #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is right about ANTIFA, and Trump is going to go down with the Proud Boys into the flames of bad arguments. Only Trump can make Biden look sorta "liberal" on policing. We're so fucked. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is going to bash the Dems, Biden in particular, for being too lenient on protestors, and all Biden can do is talk about is kinder, gentler police violence. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Violence should be prosecuted." - Biden  Oh we know, Joe. Occupy, Standing Rock, Black Lives Matter, all being abused by police for 8 years under Obama/Biden. With Kamala The Cop coming it, it will get worse. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden talking about doing something about climate is peak pandering, regardless of how short the line is. Dude, you and @BarackObama opened up the Arctic to drilling twice and fracking was expanded under your 8 years. Stop it. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"They were teaching people that we have a racist country." Because it is. These two live in two slightly different bubbles, neither of which operates in the reality of vast majority of Americans. This is why people don't vote. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden talking about "working it out with police" only alienates black and Latino voters more. "Violence is never appropriate." Younger millennials and zoomers, the few that are watching, are not inspired by this. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, in the same 2 ish minutes is too harsh on crime then too liberal. No pushback. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump hitting Biden on the crime bill are the neoliberal chickens coming home to roast. Damn. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 in 1000 African Americans being killed by Covid has less do with the color of their skin and more to do with fact that they have disproportionately worse healthcare outcomes and are poorer than Whites. No mentions. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden talk about racism and helping black people is disgraceful. Mr. Crime Bill can only look like a white ally next to Trump. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump pointing out Biden threatening Ukraine with pulling their aid is accurate, but Wallace has no control over this so we'll never talk about it because the media companies would rather decorum-shame and lob softball questions. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whole "Who's more corrupt segment" is peak failed state. Side note: Art of The Steal cost the @DNC &amp; @DCCC half a million dollars. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The segment on how best to neoliberal your way out of a failing economy is hilarious. Neither of these senile, corporate tools gives a damn about jobs for American people. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You're the worst president America's ever had," is the climax line for neoliberal porn. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, we're going to spend 10 minutes on his fucking tax returns. He's been bankrupt at least 6 times, no mention. Moving money for the mob, no mention. And now Biden is going to fail in the response. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden made a great response and I'm not sure if his delivery could have been worse. But Trump talking about, "I brought back football" only helps Biden more and make him look, if it's possible, more ridiculous. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden talking about millionaires &amp; billionaires doing well as if he wouldn't have passed similar, if not exact, bills WITH DEMOCRATS &amp; BERNIE SANDERS. This is the cringe shit real progressives can't stand. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now it's the "China Plague". Holy fuck, someone watched too much Hannity last night. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace: "VP Biden you're holding much smaller events..." Trump: "Because no one will show up."  That's another successful jab that Biden has no real counter to except mask-shaming. Doesn't really land the way Biden's team think it should. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both of these people are garbage narcissists who think they're the most intelligent people in any room. They're both collegiate failures, who are attempting to shame the other for being dumb. This is America, the home of fail sons. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, Trump just dumb-shamed Biden to his face and he had no real response. Jesus, Biden, get it together. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is making decent points, but his delivery is bad. It appears low energy, and he is tapping out half way through Trump's interruption. And the whole, "HE LIES!" thing is not being presented properly. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I've spoken to all the companies that have been poisoning and price gouging the American people about a vaccine and they disagree with scientists. Believe me, I know what I'm doing." - Trump.  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a nice counter from Biden about the lost lives and dead economy. Trump doesn't have a real defense for this. Nice call from Biden's team. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump hiding behind Fauci and Cuomo talking about his "fabulous" job on #COVID19 is going to land, except with neolibs. It's a decent talking point. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone, regardless of their political allegiance, that was cheering vehemently the "Just shut up, man" are part of the problem. You read that correctly. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god. "Just shut up, man" is the first, and only necessary, sign that Joe has lost this debate already. This is not how you debate Trump. He has prepared so poorly that this might actually affect the election. Holy shit. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Whatever position I take that will be the issue." - Joe Biden  What the fuck does that mean? #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's strategy of getting Biden to alienate his own base is working very well, and Biden looks like an old technocrat that doesn't understand what debating Trump is. Biden is getting boxed on both sides of the political spectrum.  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is going to spend all 3 debates talking about how right-wing is, and his team is going to be baffled as to why people aren't voting for him. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You could have done it in your 47 years in government, you didn't" is going to be a campaign commercial/talking point for the next 4 weeks, so just get ready. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace has not control of this, yet keeps interrupting. Stop talking, dude. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"My party is me. I am the nominee, I am the democratic party." - Joe Biden  Probably the most honest thing Biden has ever said. Progressives take note. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here is the failing strategy from Trump all summer manifesting itself: "You're a socialist, Joe." Holy shit this is bad. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden pivoting to the ACA regarding the Supreme Court pick is good, but it's too convoluted the way he's explaining it. Both look like they're low energy, which going to make any level in Dante's Inferno more desirable than this. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's the 1st time I've ever heard "liberal" &amp; "Notre Dame" in the same sentence without someone bashing the word liberal. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here it is, folks. Two old, white, senile, bigoted, misogynists who want endless war everywhere pretend that they're different from each other and spend the night getting layup questions that enables them to lie to us all night. Fun times. #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @ElleStanger That's great, but when are you going to tell the American public about how you and almost every other Dem in Congress voted for the act that forced the Post Office to fund pensions 75 years in advance? I won't hold my breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: There was a lot of progressive messaging coming from Kamala Harris.  Never forget, these are millionaire newsreaders who live in an establishment bubble. They don't give a fuck about you, and they don't get why you don't love virtue signaling.  #DemConvention<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It wasn't enough that @TheDemocrats &amp; @DNC are committing elder abuse by propping up Biden for the nomination, now they're using Gabby Giffords horrific attack and her recovery to shield themselves.

<|startoftext|>Omg, this whole convention is just a tsunami of virtue signaling, gaslighting, and using non-whites as woke shields in order to keep everyone from having an objective analysis of Biden &amp; Harris.

<|startoftext|>Every time that I see a video from this 4-night coronation of neoliberal power elite about Republicans voting for Biden the only message it sends is that Biden appeals to Republicans more than leftists. I think @DNC understands that more than anything else. #DemConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently @TheDemocrats are the party of "hope, decency, and integrity." I wonder if #Syria, #Libya, #Iraq, #Iran, #Afganistan, &amp; #Yemen believe that bullshit. #DemConvention #DemocraticConvention #DemocraticNationalConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tune in tonight to the @DNC convention to see an all-star lineup of neoliberals and crypto-neolibs anoint @KamalaHarris president-in-waiting for next year. Bring your vomit buckets. #DemConvention #DemocraticConvention #DemocraticNationalConvention<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg. This woke liberal shit is going in a direction too hilarious &amp; frightening to be true. Orwell has trapped us in a dystopian alternate universe. Yep, that has to be it.  #DemConvention #DemocraticNationalConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, now time for campaign slogans. Same rules, 5 words of less. Here's mine:  Biden/Harris: No We Can't  #DemConvention #DemocraticNationalConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how effective DC strategists &amp; think tanks believe, "If you don't vote for Biden/Harris you're racist AND sexist AND a Putin puppet" will work in shaming/scaring people into voting for this corporate &amp; police state farce. This decade is already fucked. #DemConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg dude. @TheDemocrats are against Medicare for all, free college, ending the wars, helping Palestinians, helping Yemen, a Green New Deal, &amp; legalizing marijuana. We have corporate rule under them @SenSanders. Stop trying to gaslight/shame us into voting for them. #DemConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Dude, you're just fucking with us at this point right? It's okay to have a mask-off moment here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LightsongGamer @Pixieut @Zulaila82153837 @KyleKulinski Are you serious? Calling Pelosi "mama bear", voting for the CARES Act, aligning with Zionists to perpetuate systemic genocide against Palestinians. That's just some of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the easiest way to figure out that the Dems are planning to fuck you if/when they take over the White House again? Just look at the list of Republicans they invite to their convention. #DemConvention #DemocraticConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zulaila82153837 @Pixieut @KyleKulinski Hey, and I meant it when I said vote however you want, I'm not shaming you. Or trying to be demeaning. I'm just tired. But I'm not going to voter shame anyone. That's counterproductive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @SenSanders lies, both to himself and his former supporters, we see the end of any sort of "takeover" of the @DNC. Now do you see? It's #GeneralStrike time. It's #ThirdParty time. It's #Revolution time. These oligarchs don't give a fuck about you, so repay them in kind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fiorella_im And as recently as 2016 was trotted out to try and knife Bernie in the primary by saying he "never saw Bernie march". Truly disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @grahamelwood has been saying for years, this pedophile has been on Epstein's plane 27 times. He's a fucking child rapist, stop covering for him because he's a democrat. There's only one party in this country and they're full of these monsters. Prosecute all of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But if we keep fighting we will beat them. We outnumber them. We can control the things in the economy that actually matter. We just need to keep fighting, and never let them beat us down. At the very least, the planet won't survive if we give up. Keep fighting, true believers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last point: don't give up. Ever. I know, more than most, how easy it is to give up, sell out, suffer by working pointless, demeaning jobs. But we can't give up. That's what the neolibs &amp; neocons want. They've designed the system this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's for this reason I believe I would have ended up bankrupt (as I am currently) regardless of my course of action. This doesn't mean that I've given up, but it does mean I understand those looks on Jimmy's face, &amp; the disgust in his voice. I'll keep fighting, but I'm not naive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has happened for so long that YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and others now have artificially lifted up "authoritative sources" (which is just the CIA-approved consolidated neoliberal stenographers for the power elite), and suppressed independent media. (5)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An inordinate amount of time is spent by the neoliberal apologists that call themselves "progressives" (they're also known as crypto-neoliberals) serve as useful idiots for the MSM to create a buffer against any real &amp; long-term change to the policies at YouTube. (4)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But seeing Jimmy's face here, especially at the end, just shows me where I would have been mentally had I continued (but definitely much less successful than him because his content is amazing). The "progressive YouTube left" has failed, overall. (3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how qualified I am to do this, but I felt (given my research in grad school and overall education) that I could at least contribute. The people would decide if it was worth supporting, and I could live with it failing if people didn't like the content. (2)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Then why did you vote for a bill that hands 4.5 trillion over to failing neoliberal corporations and the 1%, instead of negotiating for real financial help for all Americans? I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate According to the neoliberals, Obama can't be blamed for anything. He is their Jesus, and money is their God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet literally is just complaining at this point. @SenSanders, the only thing you're going to do is whatever Peloisi and Schumer tell you to do so just stop wasting our time. You're the GoT equivalent of The King Who Knelt. You failed your movement. #BernieBetrayal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here is @jimmy_dore going off on @SenSanders, calling him "feckless, venial, cowardly" (among other things), and Jimmy is absolutely correct.

<|startoftext|>@ewarren @BernieSanders Wait, you're the one calling him a secret sexist via your leaked stories less than a day before a debate. He's "progressive" but also a sexist?

<|startoftext|>Supporters, including myself, should not view this as "betrayal". Michael's right; he did this for Hillary in 2016, so of course he'd do in now.

<|startoftext|>Unfortunately I agree. I'm really depressed about this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartChohen No, but Biden using them as a crutch to say how much more electable he is compared to Bernie is a misnomer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think, overall, Bernie missed a chance to nail Biden to the wall on several issues and that will hurt him on Tuesday, again. People will panic vote for Biden because continuity and hope or whatever. This is bad. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, this isn't a closing statement from Biden it's a thesis defense. Thanks for this sham, @CNN. You're doing your best to contribute to 4 more years of Trump. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virginia: Deep state, corporate Dems. North Carolina: Conservative Dems, corporate dems. Mississippi: Conservative Dems. South Carolina: Conservative Dems. Alabama: Conservative Dems.  Yeah, that's a winning strategy. So awesome, we did it in 2016.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is literally touting the votes of states he will not win in general, and taking credit for five other candidates endorsing him and the @DNC &amp; @TomPerez using Obama phone banking to get the normy, Centrist Dems to turn out. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, now they're just straight cutting Bernie off, while Biden gets to ramble for as long as he wants. @CNN needs to canceled, along with #CancelBiden. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I was the guy, my chief of staff, his dog, they did the deals. I got 60 something, and this commie over here doesn't know these people. I know people. Chief. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that it's always @jaketapper who has to come in to save Biden from his own rambling. And Bernie needs to slam Biden on Iraq, and he's not doing it. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In the shadow of China" is one of the most disgusting things we can hear. They're not a phantom menace, Joe. They have the right to exist, stop trying to race bait and fear monger. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about Saudi Arabia, @CNN &amp; @JoeBiden? That's a dictatorship, let's hear any criticism about them. No? They just instigated an oil price war with Russia during a pandemic. Nothing? Thought not. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This blanket dismissal of Cuba because it is a "dictatorship" is disgusting. They have medicare for all better education, etc. that we currently do not have. Unless every country is exactly like the US (i.e. they do whatever we tell them) they're bad. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the Cuba shaming from @CNN. They literally have nothing on Bernie, so smearing is at the bottom of the bag of tricks. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And next to @CNN's ad contributions, a health insurance company. Gee, I wonder what questions are coming next. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's @jaketapper ready to enable @JoeBiden and the establishment, who take money from the fracking industry. Because we can't improve our climate, country, and planet, if that means cutting into profits. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"No new fracking" is neoliberal double speak for, "We'll come back and do some assessments as we expand existing fracking". His playbook is old and we're onto it.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is South Calina, Joe? I'll wait.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he's not advocating for droning Corona he's going to use MORE sanctions to push countries that do not do what the US commands. Biden is a political dinosaur. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These "how do you pay for it" segments are insane. The Fed just digitally printed 1.5 trillion to lend out to banks, so they can function. Because of TARP. Don't tell me we "can't pay for it" every again, neoliberals. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll hold my breath. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Go to  https://t.co/gHT64LZvc0 and you'll see everything that the @DNC has laid out for me to do because I won't remember any of it by the time they buy me the nomination.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: The single greatest threat is climate change.  Really? Then why did you and Obama open up the Arctic to oil drilling twice?  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Biden just broke out the "canard" card. I wonder if that's like "Sauce for the Gander" territory.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now @CNN is asking questions that could have been framed by Breitbart. Wtf...  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: It took too long to get it right.  You and Obama had 8 years, my dude. Obama was called "Deporter-in-Chief". You set the precedent and you keep lying about everything, if you can even remember what they're asking. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, a Biden just said that he's picking a woman as VP. I don't think he knows what he's saying right now. This is not the format to make that decision. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Am I able to respond to that?  CNN: Um, yeah. It's just the two of you, dude.  I'm not sure he's going to finish this debate. Serious assessment.   #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden lies on @CNN for 20 minutes straight =  no pushback  Bernie Sanders tells the truth for 20 minutes about these lies = "Will you get your Bernie Bro army behind Joe Biden?"  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, Biden is running low on the meds that are pumped into him right before this debate and is developing a random lisp/slur as he continues to talk. This is not an effective candidate to run against Trump. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: If Bernie's the nominee, I will campaign for him from a nursing home. I hope he and his army of Bros will follow the orders of the @DNC and the corporate @TheDemocrats and get in line behind me. Period. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden in 2007 at the VP Debate with Palin that neither he, nor Obama, believed in gay marriage. Google it. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now all Biden has is the gun nonsense. Bernie needs to squash this now. It is not a fair equivalency. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I made it incrementally better.  I swear, this should be on a poster for neoliberal Dems. Definitely his campaign:  Biden 2020: I'll make things incrementally better.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Let's get something straight about the bankruptcy bill"  Joe, you've been lying all night, and your tell is clearly predicated with, "Let's get something straight...".   #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I DID NOT WRITE THAT BILL.  He totally did. He's lying. Ffs, Bernie, call him a goddamn liar. He's been lying his entire life, call him a liar. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden pushed for a bill that made it impossible for college loans to be part of bankruptcy, and very difficult for people with medical bills to be part of bankruptcy. And now he's trying to get Warren's endorsement in a very sleazy way. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now @CNN is going to be Biden's shield on the social security issue. Pathetic. Bernie needs to be provocative here. He needs to call Biden a liar and CNN corporate neoliberal shield for the 1%. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden can't even remember when he was trying to cut social safety nets. Or when he was on the Senate floor. And, no, Bernie did not take you out of context, Joseph. I'm so glad Bernie didn't let him off the hook for this. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my, Bernie's finally called Biden out for his cutting of medicare, medicaid, and social security. Biden just lied on national television and said that he never wanted to cut any of it. Stay on it, Bernie. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did, and we're supposed to give "him a break". I think not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Biden tries to get indignant about money, when he's been taking money from billionaires for decades. He's from Delaware, a domestic tax haven. He proposed a lot of shit that he's never passed because it was all a veneer to preserve his Dem base credibility. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish everyone watching this got the takeaway that should gotten from this: Biden thinks that centrism is answer to everything, and anything else "won't do". #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here it is: HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR IT?! YOU HAVEN'T SAID EVEN ONCE! HOW YOU GONNA PAY, bERnIe? HOW?! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW?!  Bernie: Ffs...  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, people don't want a revolution. They want results that, yes, don't help the poors and aliens, but it can get done. Make sure there are options that people think help them, even if they don't.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: VP Biden, you're in perfect health, why are you better than Bernie?  Biden: I'm in perfect health. I don't touch things, even women who feel uncomfortable around me. This is big for me.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Sen. Sanders, you're old and you had a heart attack. Why won't you drop out?  Bernie: Every precaution has been taking, washing hands, not rallies.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden doesn't give a damn about illegal immigrants, as evidenced by the fact that any time one of the immigrants criticizes him he tells him to go vote for someone else. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I guess that Bernie was saying that the wealthy should pay for everything. The 1%.  No, what he's saying is that they should pay their fair share. They pay LESS than people making less than 50k a year, currently. He has no idea what he's talking about. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is completely wrong. Those bailouts did NOTHING to help individuals, it was a blank check for Wall Street and enabling people who purposefully sold toxic mortgages and bet against them. He is gross and incompetent. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Sen. Sanders, you voted against neoliberal corporate welfare in 2008. Why do you hate capitalism?  Bernie: That is completely different. Those bailouts were a blank check to banks. Wtf is wrong with you?  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is acting like, once we "get past" this pandemic we can go right back to the way things were. Joe, things escalated to this point BECAUSE of how things were. Wish Bernie would say this. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Biden is confusing Corona with SARS. Next he's going to call it Polio, Smallpox, and/or Measles. Wtf...  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: People are looking for results, not a revolution.  Ok Boomer.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, that's about the fifth time Biden has cut himself off. I don't want to hear about how he didn't have the time, space, or format to answer every question he got. And now he's staring down at his paper, holding onto the podium like he's about to fall down. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if Joe knows what he said, but he just said he'd bailout individuals, not corporations. I don't think that means what he thinks that means. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting about 3 weeks ago. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We need our "experts" in China. And if they won't let us in there will be consequences.  By "consequences" he means drones. Because that's all he and Obama knew how to deal with other nations.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden's assessment of pandemic = "bump".  This is the "best candidate" to beat Trump alright.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN can't wait for martial law so their military industrial complex donors can make max profit during this pandemic. So gross. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: CORONA IS A WARTIME ENEMY. KILL IT.  Bernie: Um, look, medicare for all will drastically reduce deaths and suffering.  Biden: IT DOESN'T WORK. WHERE ARE THE DRONES?! BOMB CORONA.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the public option red herring again. That creates a two-tiered system, where all the sick to to the public option side and the care is disproportionately worse because the rich can afford BETTER care through private insurance, which makes MORE MONEY. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I believe in socialized medicine when it's during a pandemic. I don't when we the pandemic is over. Period. So, we can pay for it when we want to/affects profits. When we don't need to, poor people need to suck it up. Period. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: Look, despite what #StatusQuoJoe says over there from his rehearsed billionaire talking points, people are dying in our current system. Of course it's going to be worse when there is a pandemic, goddamn it. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: VP Biden, would you have a national lockdown?  Biden: Look, do what we did when I was in office. That means not implementing Medicare for all, leave millions without healthcare, &amp; bring experts together so that we can find the best way to screw poors. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden already fumbling through remembering what viruses have happened where. There's no push back by Tapper or anyone else from @CNN. Bernie is going to give substantive answers to these questions, and still it's going to be, "HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT, COMMIE?!" #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prediction: Biden will not face one question approaching difficult tonight. @CNN will enable/protect his failing brain all night, and Bernie is going to be battling both CNN and Biden all night. Pathetic. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how Biden suddenly believes in socialism when it comes to a pandemic. If Bernie had been elected, both as the dem nominee and as president, we'd have the infrastructure and planning in place right now to combat Corona right now. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Bernie, how are you going to pay for saving people from #coronavirus without corporations taking over the country? #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we get ready for the #DemocraticDebate just remember: we're entering unprecedented global strife, where all of us need a leader who understand the necessary consequences of what's going to happen to us as a species and respective societies. That leader is Bernie Sanders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is one of the biggest problems with certain representatives of the "progressive" media online. How fucking progressive is this?!

<|startoftext|>Remember this, Berners: Almost all of the states @JoeBiden won are red states and will go for Trump in the general. That's not a path to beating Trump, only a path for continued neoliberal hegemony. #SuperTuesday #NotMeUs #BernieForPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever is going on in Texas right now is horrible. This was a major defeat for the #BernieForPresident, but it's not over yet.

<|startoftext|>Breaking: Bernie has been called as the winner in California, which means that he's going to get AT LEAST 40%. That's huge, considering the screw jobs in Mass, Minn by neolibs Klobuchar and Warren. #SuperTuesday #NotMeUs #BernieForPresident<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ewarren You were running out of time once you started calling Bernie a secret sexist. You've finished 3rd, 4th, 4th, and 5th, and you're literally only still in this to keep Bernie from getting a majority of delegates. You're just a rank opportunist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnDelaney @BarackObama @SpeakerPelosi Have they now? Still waiting on that jobs bill that never got passed when they had a super majority.

<|startoftext|>Y'all have got to stop doing this. @PeteButtigieg is not a "trailblazer". He was an intelligence officer that was loaned out to the CIA, and was a CIA plant in this election.

Your plan? Neoliberal policies and empire maintenance. If that's what you're "getting done", no thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight was the final confirmation regarding @ewarren and her agenda going forward.

<|startoftext|>Imagine this is @BernieSanders and not @ewarren talking here. There would be 24/7 coverage about how he's hurting the party, this is only helping Trump, he needs to "fall in line", etc. When she does it? Crickets. #SCPrimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This mask-off moment is brought to you by socially liberal, fiscal conservative Elizabeth @eWarren and her team of neoliberal Clinton/Kamala cast-offs who want to deny actual democracy to all Americans. Yay. #SCPrimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the first 3 contests took a day and half, at least, each for the results to be anywhere close to 75% in, and it was  unlikely that they'd declare Bernie the winner or not within a relevant news cycle, we've got about 14% in and Biden is the nominee #SCPrimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, congratulations to @JoeBiden for inheriting older, conservative Dem voters who have been beaten down and brainwashed into believing big, structural change is not only not possible, but dangerous if it were. Don't enable neoliberals, Cenk. #SCPrimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're all so delusional. Millionaire news readers, spouting propaganda from their neoliberal masters, trying to scare the moderates into coalescing around Joseph R. Biden, a moderate Republican running as Dem since the 70s who wants to cut all social programs. #SCPrimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First of all, @maddow, it's "an" not "a". I bring this up only because she was a Rhodes scholar and, along with being a sociopath, one of the requirements for that should be proper grammar. Second, Bernie's polling 1st or 2nd with black and Latinx voters. #SCprimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With 0% in, @CNN @MSNBC @Reuters @ABC @CBSNews and other neoliberal outlets not only declare @JoeBiden the winner, but that this lone victory has "revitalized" his campaign and that he'll win 54 out of 50 states now. #SCprimary2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should only embolden calls for most of the candidates to drop out after Tuesday. After South Carolina, Biden has nothing. Warren might finish THIRD in her home state.

<|startoftext|>Moderators: Mayor Pete, here's a question about Syria. Pete: Look, I stand with those people, but what we need to worry about is Bernie's Medicare for All plan. How do you pay for it? Denmark. Bernie: Wtf is wrong with you? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonPlacone You don't need the questions in advance when you're the one writing them and handing them to the moderators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderator: Emperor Bloomberg, your response please sir? Bloomberg: Look, we need to do whatever AIPAC wants and some stuff about history. We need to do incremental suggestions that, ultimately, won't pass. AIPAC. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderator: Sen Sanders, you are you a self-hating Jew and AIPAC hates you. Why do you want Israel to not exist? Bernie: Look asshole, I actually lived there. Israel should exist, but so should Palestinians, and there should be peace. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time that Steyer is excited to make a point he turns into a bobble head, and in a debate that has too many distractions already he needs to go. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: I have the highest support up here, 4 of you shouldn't even qualify for this debate. You hate Americans, and I'm going to give this country back to its people. Audience: Boo! Bloomberg is our man, as soon as the second check cashes! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't watch another debate where #WineCavePete just keeps talking while Bernie is trying to answer smears. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: It's time to interrupt you, Bernie, because I'm here to kneecap you and keep you from the delegate threshold. Bernie: Pete, do you Pete: Sen, I need to interrupt you Bernie: Healthcare... Pete: Sen, stop please Bernie: Cancel student loans... Pete: If I could... #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Bernie, you like commies and you've been trying to indoctrinate the youth since the 70s. Response, Mao? Bernie: Obama said what I said, but when I said it it's suddenly bad? What the hell?  Biden: How dare you, Colonial Sanders!  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Biden is really annoyed with Steyer, keeps interrupting him. I wonder if he's going to challenge Steyer to a push-up contest during the next break. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I've dealt with President Chingy and he's holding this group of Muslims hostage, whose name I just learned this morning, and I'm going to use that as an excuse to invade. They must play by our rules, damn it! Corn pop, tell them! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: No. I don't like China but we have to deal with them. We're having a race to bottom in climate change, so we have to beat them in that. I can negotiate with him, and by negotiate with him I mean I'm going to bribe him like I did this audience. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: Look, Trump is insane. A "great genius". We need to work with other countries so that we don't have a pandemic, and stop fear-mongering with other countries. Because that hasn't exactly worked out, has it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: What we did with Ebola is that we set up, I set up, in Obama's office with Corn Pop, because he knows how to set up budgets. Because Trump cut funding for health efforts, I'd be on the phone with China and say, "We're coming in, damn it!" #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar can't answer a question without looking like an awkward, out-of-touch, pandering neoliberal. It's so boring, and I wish the @DNC would just pull her plug already. Please. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: Look, our military needs to gain its credibility back. And we do that by sending more of them out as "peacekeepers". And those peacekeepers need to be led by the CIA, so that we can effectively maintain empire. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: Look, brown people abroad need to be brought to heel. We need to make and pass around weapons of war to as many poor people to fight oil wars for me and my billionaire friends, because that's one of the ways we inflated the stock prices. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Look, we need a strong state department. We need the deep state to conduct these wars quietly, so that we can maintain neoliberal hegemony, without killing our soldiers. Unless the deep state tells me that's okay, in which case do it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we've reached the pro-war segment of this debate. First up, Liz Warren, then Bernie, having to justify why they hate American freedom because they want to keep out troops safe and out of oil wars. How dare they. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2nd break analysis: This debate has gone from off-the-rails to attempting to lull the viewers into seeing Bloomberg/Biden as viable "progressives". So gross. Bernie is going to run them over on Tuesday and it's going to be glorious. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Alright, fine, Sen. Socialist respond and then your mic will be cut off. Bernie: This is insane. You can't equate marijuana with heroin. Moderators: Whatever. And now another break, enjoy another commercial from the Bloomberg candidacy on @CBSNews.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Thank you, Sen. Bernie: I was named... Moderators: Shut up, Lenin. Emperor, I MEAN Mayor Bloomberg your response.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Sen. Klobuchar, Commie Bernie wants to free people for smoking a plant. Why should he be sharing a cell with Snowden?  Klobs: Look, that stuff is nice and all, but my Uncle Dick wouldn't be able to hunt with Cousin Balls if that happened.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Mayor, you were an authoritarian regarding what people can eat and drink. Why, as an oligarch, do you know what's best for everyone?  Bloomberg: Look, fatties, I'm rich so I know best. Here's a billion, just vote for me already.   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And were interns right after the Big Bang. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if there's a NSA or CIA agent in a van outside every debate that Buttigieg has ever been at, feeding responses into his database before he talks. Someone should do a sweep, just for fun. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should have happened in December. It's the only time his money would have gone to successful progressive initiatives. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden has a lot of white-splaining regarding many issues, but it's really confusing to watch him try and virtue-splain his policies when his name is on the crime bill (The Biden-Hatch crime bill) and has a history of trying to slash Medicare/Medicaid. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dog, what?! No one is "reeling" because of your performance from last week. What parallel universe did you buy, and how can I go there, because, apparently, your delusions of grandeur come true there. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have mixed feelings about Warren's aggressive speaking up, it really hinges on what she's saying and how authentic it is. She's just too far behind in the polls, but it's fun to watch her skirmishes with Bloomy though. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanChariton @MikeBloomberg Over/under is $999.99 per person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, every chance he gets Pete is going to try and shiv Bernie in the side regarding this gun nonsense. Dude no one believes your going to do anything remotely good for the poor and working class, especially regarding education. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm happy to say that Steyer's appearances will now end after this debate. Klobs and Bloomberg too. I fear we haven't seen the end of Buttigieg, unfortunately. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we're back to the "herself" pandering from Warren, I'm sure Klobuchar is next. If it were authentic it would be fine, but it comes off as forced because it is. Just stop. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeCamp @CBS From a @DNC list, collected by the deep state, approved by the neoliberal power elite, and sanctioned by Bloomberg himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how the booing only flusters Pete, and his lies are reaching Twilight Zone levels regarding Bernie's record. It's kind of amazing to watch unfettered narcissism as the crux of his take down attempts of Bernie. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden taking credit for other congressional members' bills is really a bad look, especially when he's talking down to and point aggressively at Klobs. Please stop making me defend her for anything, thanks. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderators: Bernie we have nothing else to get you on, so guns. You voted, once, the wrong way, sort of, so now we're going to beat you over the head with it. Everyone else on stage, why is Bernie the worst person to have ever existed? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden can barely talk, and his attempts to smear Bernie regarding guns is pathetic. What would you do, Joe, about it as president? Nothing. Because you and Obama did nothing for 8 years. So just stop. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good, now we have 3 more useless moderators, including Major Garrett, who's a known conservative. Should only improve things, right? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st break analysis: this debate is just a free-for-all, and the crowd is bought for @MikeBloomberg in conjunction with the @DNC. It's gross, and they wonder why no one likes them. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Anyone surprised? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's Bloomberg, but either way it's heinous. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love that Freudian slip there. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: Bernie will be nominated, he'll lose, and then the Dems will spend another 4 years helping Trump pass things they agree with.  Bernie: I see a lot of @DNC and @MikeBloomberg plants in the room tonight. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: I was the most effective Senator in the last Senate  You mean working with Republicans to get Republican agendas passed? Yeah, that's what we need more of. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Steyer tying the crime bill around Biden's neck was pretty epic. Wish Bernie would turn and do the same. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no, screamy Uncle Joseph has emerged. He looks like he's going to burst a blood vessel in one of his eyes. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, Pete, you're going to galvanize the party and get more dems elected. You barely got elected as Mayor in a town no one can find on a map unless they know about college football, but you're going to get people elected to the House and Senate against the GOP. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer leading the "extreme" shaming party is fun. How did you get up there again, Tom? You took "Impeach Trump" money you got online and used it to pay for this campaign, right? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Pete's other plan for tonight is interrupt Bernie every chance he gets, so no one hears any of the explanations for his plans, as their challenged. Really enjoying this fair and balanced debate format and questioning. Awesome @CBSNews. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How you gonna pay for, Sen. Commie?! How you gonna pay for it?! You want to bankrupt capitalism, Stalin! Boo! Boo!" - establishment media, everyone else on stage  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm sorry if she heard what she thinks she heard," is some of the most man-splaining, misogynistic, oligarchic, rape-denying shit I've ever heard. Disgraceful he's allowed up there. #DemDebate #MayorOligarch #Bloombergisasexist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: I've made a comment or two, if they didn't like it I paid them off, and I don't know what else Warren wants from me. I'm not going to listen to her as if her opinions mattered. If I could paid her off I would, so she needs to be quiet now. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the first cat fight of the night, and the @DNC clearly have loaded the audience with their plants by the forced (i.e. paid) cheering for Mayor Oligarch. Pathetic. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: 9/11. Manager. "Resources". My record with white people. People elected me multiple times after I paid of the city council for a 3rd term, which I wasn't supposed to have. 9/11. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that Warren has dug in and dedicated herself to hammering Bloomberg, maybe Pete, tonight because that's the only thing that's going to land and won't hurt her in the primary. But the Bernie smears ruined her, and she should get out soon. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar looks visibly unprepared and uninterested in going back and forth with other candidates tonight. Not a shocker. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: I know a lot of black people...  How many of them are millionaires/billionaires? Because, spoiler alert, that's not really tapping into the pulse of the average African American experience. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg loves to taut the support of "black leadership" and that he's apologized for his actions. But when you spend your entire life saying racist, misogynistic, xenophobic slurs those apologies and that support seems a bit disingenuous. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden will stay in this primary until someone tells him that Bloomberg needs his delegates to screw Bernie out of the nomination. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete trying to say that he's going to raise taxes is slightly disingenuous; he's going to raise taxes on the bottom 50% because that's what his billionaire donors want. Less than 30% of his donations are from small donors. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reaching back to gun legislation and trying to say Bernie was going to primary Obama is a new level of desperation from Biden. And why would that have been a bad thing, Joe? It's not like Obama did anything progressive as president, so it would be nice to have one. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Steyer you're only up there for the same reason Bloomberg is; you bought your way up there and have no viable route to the nomination. You're just up there to derail Bernie, same as Bloomberg. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sickening to see #CIAPete go up there attempt and scare-monger about Russia seeing as how his contacts in the deep state are the ones promoting this nonsense, and the media will never challenge that. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren trying to do a rewind and say that she's Bernie, but younger and female, is too late. She hasn't placed higher than 3rd than any primary, and South Carolina isn't going to be kind to her either. Desperation is abound on this debate stage. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Russiagate fear-mongering has come back to haunt this campaign. The fact that Bloomberg tries to hit Bernie with that first shows how little he has regarding plans for the working class of this country. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real unemployment rate is around 7.5%, and that will never be brought up. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the first smear of the night, right off the bat. Nothing like socialist-shaming by the consolidated neoliberal media to make you feel like this is going to be on the level. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over/under odds on the first question being an unrelenting smear against Bernie, where he doesn't get to speak? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The desperation is reach new peaks. Apparently Bernie is not just a secret sexist, but a secret rapist and likes watching children run around naked. This is horrid. @MikeBloomberg you are a heinous individual. #BloombergIsAnOligarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing more democratic and inspiring like two billionaires at the bookends of the debate stage tonight. Additionally, having two, supposedly, former Republicans on stage should demonstrate how far to the right our political spectrum has moved in the last 4 decades. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Prediction for #DemDebate tonight:  -The smear pile-on Bernie will be relentless -Warren will attempt to appear as a viable VP running mate -@AmyKlobuchar will crash and burn -This is the final stand of Joseph R. Biden -@CBSNews will red-bait all night<|endoftext|>

That's purposefully dishonest; they all are united in their pursuit of paying no taxes and corporate welfare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While I also don't believe Matthews thinks Bernie and co. are exactly like Nazis I do feel that he and others at @MSNBC are trying to use extreme hyperbolic examples to shock people into false equivalencies concerning radical ideologies.   https://t.co/OLmntZWV41 via @KyleKulinski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg Really? To the staffer that's being paid to post and re-post this stuff from 30 years ago, is this really where you saw yourself in life? Supporting an oligarch who is going to make sure the poor and working classes remain destitute? It's not worth it, please stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like CIA propaganda to show exactly how democracy dies in darkness.

<|startoftext|>As desperate, consolidated, neoliberal media outlets like @CNN continue their coordinated take down attempts of Bernie, these attempts at legitimizing their "concern" over a Sanders presidency are revealed to be just "mask off" moments.   https://t.co/qzIXNkgxvN via @LeeCamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, I wonder if he's an amalgamation of rehashed talking points from @DNC consultants and deep state ministry of propaganda goons. I'm not sure. #CIAPete #MayorCheat #WallStreetPete #NeverPete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The desperation is palpable. #WallStreetPete #WineCavePete #CIAPete #MayorCheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg I don't want, as a progressive, to explain why a shallow, narcissist, megalomaniac, deep state plant is attempting to socialist-shame us into voting for more neoliberal, corporate austerity for four years after the Clinton/Obama failure. That's why I'm voting for Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video is literally just a collage of Bloomberg testifying, speaking at a podium, or in an interview. It's nice this is an issue he cares about (supposedly), but there's nothing about Bernie being the NRA's "buddy for decades". Why? Because it's not true. #NeverBloomberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a neoliberal deep state puppet, no one wants to hear you corporate-splain to us why Bernie's policies are "bad for America". They're bad for corporations, @PeteButtigieg. They're good for Americans. And your recent result in Nevada shows that Americans get that. #CIAPete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is less about Hayes' making a case for how electable Bernie is and more trying to get his competition to wake up to the reasons why people are voting for him. Chris Hayes has disproportionately benefited from the status quo, so will defend it until the end.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is not a good apology. This is a forced retraction that comes across as desperate. Granted, Matthews is hammered more often than not these days when he goes on air, but that's just revealing what he really thinks. @TheYoungTurks continues this left-of-center trend, sadly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mask off indeed. This is the consultant class talking here. They cannot fathom a Bernie presidency because the problems he speaks of are not their problems. Their only real problem are with the uncouth tweets from Donald Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not "a new kind of politics", Pete. It's neoliberal triangulation, re-branded under the banner of identity politics and a complete merger with the permanent deep state. We played Trojan Horse in 2008. Not this time. #CIAPete #WallStreetPete #WineCavePete<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pete is preemptively demanding that we surrender autonomy and be subservient to the @DNC and whomever they select for us to vote into office. Just because all of you stick a "D" in parenthesis next to your names doesn't mean you're entitled to our vote. Earn it, like Bernie did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet is predicated on the idea that Nancy Pelosi should be speaker, or that she's actively trying to send McConnell into retirement. From what anyone can see, based on her voting record, she's more than willing to pass Trump's agenda, particular tax cuts for billionaires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These progressive changes you speak of, why don't you ever speak of them at the debates? All we hear are platitudes and your "values", and something something religious pandering. I won't hold my breath for a response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we have an example of a deranged, out-of-touch, elitist, neoliberal centrist who believes being "progressive" means being on the correct side of identity politics, while handing the working class marginal improvements that do not interfere with wealth extraction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Bernie and anyone who supports him are akin to Nazis now, according to Chris Matthews and Chuck Todd. Keep spreading the videos, please. #FireChuckTodd #firechrismatthews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if his programming will allow him to believe his own bullshit, or is there a firewall to keep him from ever revealing facts. Side note: it's really gross how he continues to attempt to manufacture African American support by using people of color as props.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish they would just accept that 40 years of neoliberal corporate rule and austerity are more than enough, but they won't. They will support a brokered convention where they steal the nomination away from Bernie before they support Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you make it any more obvious how desperate you are to buy the nomination and treat this country like your own personal fiefdom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amusement continues on @MSNBC as @JoyAnnReid waxes mournful at the idea that Bernie's supporters are a movement that has "seized" the democratic party. I don't know if I'd categorize the completely disenfranchised as a fringe movement, but hey, I'm not a millionaire news reader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how entrenched the neoliberals are in their attempt to maintain hegemonic domination of access to basic human rights. They've been pedaling #Russiagate nonsense since Hillary lost so that they could justify her defeat, and they'll do it to undermine Bernie at every turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. @amyklobuchar is on television talking about how she has "over-performed" in the #NVCaucus. I didn't know that over performing includes finishing 5th out of 7 candidates.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is one of three attacks that they have left. The other two: Communist/Socialist smears The "Bernie Bro" smear  That is it. Fear mongering. It's pathetic to watch their panic smears come out and be repeated ad nauseam by the consolidated neoliberal mass media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaniaKhalek It's not "if"; they're going to steal it, by one of two options. And there will be a split in the Democratic party that will dwarf the '68/'69 break. And they'll lose the the GOP for a decade, while a populist party is built up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By "real stuff" if you mean flipping her positions as soon as her Clinton/Kamala campaign staffers told her to do, then, yes, she gets stuff done. More "real stuff" she's gotten done: wag her finger at Wells Fargo then do nothing &amp; accuse Bernie of being a secret sexist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you have 60+ billion dollars you can buy a number of endorsements. But that's okay. I want to know who is endorsing Bloomberg so I know who is the enemy of the people, who is a protector of neoliberal hegemony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd ask @PeteButtigieg how it feels to get ratioed as badly as he does all the time, but that would entail that he knows what that means. Predominantly people his age and younger knows what this means, and seeing as how we all hate him, he can't ask anyone to fill him in. Sadness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Obama was called the "deporter-in-chief" for a reason. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a good look for Biden, people protesting his closing speech. He just won't learn: your time's over, bro. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @PeteButtigieg CIA android 3000 has nothing left but to red scare Bernie and platitude-splain voters into choosing him. Anyone fooled by this watches too much neoliberal news media and takes it seriously. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here it is, the moment that we've been building toward: Chuck Todd making sure that Bernie knows that, even with a plurality, we're going to screw you out of this nomination no matter what. What a disgrace. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg is getting his Marco Rubio on the last few debates, and it's really weird to see the correlation between certain candidates and the GOP 2016. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear @MSNBC is just egging on this 4th place fight between Klobs and Pete so they can avoid asking substantive questions to anyone else. Sensationalist car crash porn here is both gross and boring. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs is getting identity politics and values shamed by #CIAPete. Damn. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best way to protect the dreamers is to not ask Amy Klobuchar any questions about Latino-Americans, because she's not going to do any of that shit she's talking about in her never-going-to-happen presidency. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden has routinely talked about working with Republicans and his bipartisan bargaining, but tonight he's mad someone accused him of liking McConnell. And Warren keeps hitting over the head with it. Just stop, Joe. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamelwood I think she's in the middle of one currently. Hopefully she doesn't find a clipboard or a stapler nearby, because if she does I fear for Elizabeth Warren's safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: How dare you! I don't tolerate interns telling the truth about me, and I'm not going to tolerate you doing it either Liz! You said we were going to identity politics splain tonight, and you're lucky I can't find a stapler right now, damn it. I hate you! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: Look, I used to like Bernie before I decided to sellout to the CIA, big pharma, and the military industrial complex. Bernie: And my plans are better than yours, it's been better since the beginning. Pete: Bernie, look... Bernie: Why are you still talking? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I worked for stuff. I wrote a book about my son who died, so after I exploited I'm now going to incrementalism-splain to you about how we can't have things you want. Text Biden to 3033003-Obama sorta.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: I know that it's just another Tuesday for people up on this stage, at @MSNBC, corporate America, to screw over workers and disenfranchise anyone that is not a millionaire. But that's okay because I'm leading nationally and I'm going to kill it on Super Tuesday. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one agrees with the idea of progressive ideas, but not their implementation in any way, than @PeteButtigieg   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todd: So Bernie, you hate capitalism. Why won't you go to Russia forever? Bernie: You and Bloomberg, your friends in the mass media, hate poor people. You prop up oligarchs because you work for them. Todd: How dare you. Bloomy, help me. Bloomberg: Donations, damn it! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presenting Chuck Todd, ardent defender of billionaires. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Hillary told rich people to "cut it out", and now Bloomberg. Foreshadowing? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/3 of this debate has been Bloomberg attempting to oligarch-splain his apologies so that the plebs will tolerate him. Don't think it is working. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only questions that'll be left for Bernie, apparently, are the smear questions, while the rest of these chuckleheads talk about incrementalism and identity politics. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where was the passionate, empathetic @ewarren back in November? Oh yeah, listening to Kamala and Clinton advisers when she was briefly the front runner. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg wants to speak like Obama and govern like a Clinton. What he does instead is speak like a DNC android and govern like a joint CIA/NSA plant. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Bloomberg is consistent in one respect: he's going to oligarch-splain away any progressive policy that is proposed, and his solution is neoliberal incrementalism for everything. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe's first week is going to be pretty busy his first week with all of these meetings with people he knows. If he can remember them. I'm sure he'll hire Pete (and by hire I mean the CIA will plant him there) to keep track of all of this. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that the @DNC is good at cutting off mics, so do us all a favor and cut off Amy's please? She's said enough. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todd: Bernie, you hate fracking families. Why won't you stop hating workers. Bernie: Dumbass, the planet is going to die if we keep doing this shit. Wtf, how many times do I have to keep saying the same thing?  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that @MSNBC has become a defense apparatus for fracking. Real progressive, folks. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This cat fight between Buttigieg and Klobs is like watching the opening match on pro wrestling. It's amusing if you have nothing else to watch, but that's literally nothing. Let's just keep wasting time, @MSNBC. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Buttigieg is now roasting Klobs on live T.V. and she looks like she's about to throw him through Chuck Todd. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie with the exclamation point on Bloomberg, bringing up the minimum wage comments and supporting Bush Jr. The oligarchs are very uncomfortable with debate. Their values are offended. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, I'm not the biggest Warren fan, but this takedown right now ends Bloomberg and it's great. It's over. There's nothing @MSNBC loves more than identity politics, and this feeds that beast. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderator: You've been accused of sexual harassment, Mr. Bloomberg. Care to oligarch-splain this one? Bloomberg: I have women in leadership positions precisely to keep these sorts of things in house. And I "donate" to these women and their "charitable causes".  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: His plan will cost more than the U.S. GDP Bernie: Pete, you don't give a shit about working people. My plan has been vetted, I get rid of fees, and take it to big pharma. Pete: I'm going to say stuff that is against you no matter how false it is. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we're going to try an health-shame Bernie? Really? @MSNBC you're so pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs looks rattled up there with a real question. I'm glad that she doesn't have a podium stapler up there right now, because someone might get decapitated. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: Look, I've sat, apologized, bribed, "donated" to the DNC, state campaigns, and anyone else in democratic leadership. That should be enough.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystalball Because there isn't one for sale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: Look, let me oligarch-splain to you why blacks and latinos should except my apology for this because I talked to some folks. Church people, children, etc. The crime rate going down means that I was justified doing it.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg is crashing and burning on the stage right now. Biden is dunking on him, and no one up there is going to help him, except maybe Buttigieg. Maybe. Still fun to watch. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren is throwing the hailmary pass tonight, and I just don't think that it's going to matter like she thinks. If anything, it's going to help Bernie more than help her. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I invented healthcare! Barack and I did! We did stuff and no one else did.  I wonder how much medication it takes to get him to get to this level of coherence. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing that Bernie has to put in perspective that we are the only country that doesn't have nationalized healthcare in the industrialized. And he's going to have to keep saying it until everyone else drops out. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: You all suck, my plan is best, please help me get higher than 4th in a primary. Pete: How dare you, I want to give people affordable options to slowly die from. Klobs: How dare you, my state invented post-it notes. Bernie: Wtf are all of you talking about? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todd: I want to stay on this topic. Bernie Supporters: Here's mister brown-shirt trying to talk down to the Jewish candidate for president. Should be fair.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: Here's how we can stop sexism: elect a woman. *makes drop mic face*  This person has no idea that no one believes her. And she's quickly becoming the female, Democratic Ted Cruz. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is all Pete has. His vapid, neoliberal, CIA-approved speeches are pathetic. He knows he's on his last legs going into states that he has no support in, and this is the only way he can get his name in the headlines again. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren's attempt at a compassionate story was a nice try. But she's already lost the base of her support. It misses, and it's too late to try and make up for her smears and walk-backs. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie and Bloomberg are clearly the targets tonight, and only one of them is actually prepared for this onslaught. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie is not going to let Mayor Charlie Brown talk down to him tonight. That's going to be fun to watch all night. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg trying to project himself as the working man's candidate is hilarious. "Let's put forward someone who actually a Democrat." Yeah, we did that with Obama. We know how that one worked out, Pete. Go home, dude. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Your poll, @MSNBC, says that I'm the best candidate up here because my campaign framed the questions, damn it! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg: I'm a New Yorker. I know how to deal with con men from New York.  Yeah, because you are one dude. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like Klobs bragging about getting GOP votes to get you motivated for another debate. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Come on, Bernie. @ninaturner is your national co-chair. You have to stand up for her better than that, man. Joe Biden is not your damn friend. He's a corrupt, neoliberal scumbag that doesn't care about minorities. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh damn, @ninaturner has been envoked. Be careful @ABC. She'll come for you next. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I've already spoken to that white guy that white-splained why he said racist shit. He's sorry, okay? Change the subject.  @JoeBiden just drop out, dude. It's over. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: We end the war on drugs.  For the love of progressives everywhere, Bernie, Biden's name is on that bill. Please call that out.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer calling out Biden's casual liberal racism is amusing. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: *technocratic answer to racism* Yang: You can't legislate away racism Progressives. Lady, you were called the first woman of color professor at Harvard. Please stop. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Can you please answer the question? Pete: Look, it was lower... ABC: No, goddamn it, it was not. Stop lying, please. Pete: We adopted a strategy to CONTACT HANDLER, HAVE THIS WOMAN FIRED, RETURN TO PRIMARY RESPONSES help minorities in South Bend. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: #MayorCheat, your record on race is horrible. Comments? #CIAPete: Look, on my watch drug arrests were lower. ABC: No, they weren't. #CIAPete: Here's some platitudes. Diversions. Switching to secondary deflection programming. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: I'm not going to play this game with you. If they don't support Roe v. Wade, they're not going to be appointed. Period. Move on, for god's sake. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the other people on stage are mocking Biden openly now. Joseph, your brain is not working correctly now. Please go home and rest. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete is a psychopath. Get it trending. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, these softball ?s to Buttigieg are pathetic. The CIA has clearly mandated their orders to their proxies at the consolidated neoliberal mainstream media. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, I'm in the twilight zone officially now. Biden calling himself a member of the "progressive Congress" is a clear indicator of this. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Would do something different about justices than what you said before? Biden: Finish what I said because I don't remember! I was part of the reason that all of those women on the court were there! Their hair smelled the nicest! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: VP Biden, you've asked for people to trust your record and vote on that. Should Bernie be given the same leeway. Biden: Of course not! I voted for stuff. I crafted legislation that punishes people for being poor. My time is almost up, so more yelling! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only things these corporate clowns can hit Bernie on now are, whatever is their, gun issues. From 1988. To quote Biden, "Give me a break." #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang with another solid answer. Can't wait for him to join the @BernieSanders campaign. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the crowd was reminded of their jobs tonight, during the break, by their @DNC &amp; @CIA masters: clap for @PeteButtigieg no matter what he says, and sometimes when he coughs. #DemDebate #MayorCheat #CIAPete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possible future endorsement of @SenSanders? Unlikely, but still amusing to look at. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: Look, I'm sick of this arguing over who's a bigger warmonger. Steyer is right. Not just about getting my autograph, but about unity with these countries because the climate is melting everything. So instead of your proxy wars, maybe we try not dying, okay? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I didn't say that. I said other stuff. I'm part of everything diplomatic for the last 30 years. I was Obama's partner, not his VP. He was my boy. We're not the police of the world, except when we are. I've never said things, until someone reminds me that I did! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I know every one of these leaders by their first name. I can get it done.  By "it" what he really means, first and foremost, is getting his son another job he's not qualified for after he's busted for Angel Dust possession. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: As Commander-in-Chief, why are you better than Biden? Pete: You can be sure that whatever the CIA, and their foreign equivalents in Great Britain and France, possibly Germany, wants they will get. I will continue this neoliberal pyramid scheme forever. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Biden appeal to the military industrial complex, guaranteeing he will never leave these regions. The empire will be held together by any means necessary by the neoliberal power elite. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren speaking of bringing home "combat troops" home is so disingenuous. I'm sure she's perfectly fine with leaving "advisers" by the tens of thousands in our forever wars abroad. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie speaking facts to all of our global empire assassination attempts. But speaking about pacifism with other countries will certainly put him in the literal cross hairs of the deep state. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: No, I wouldn't have done that. But here's what I'm going to do now. Yell! I'm mad, damn it! Trump bad! Family! Emotions! Where am I! Stop asking me complicated things! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Would you have killed a foreign military leader that didn't not attack America, American troops, and was defeating ISIS? Pete: Look the CIA won't let me answer this question. Literally. My programming will activate "self destruct mode", so let's not kill everyone. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: Look, Hillary is just bitter okay? Let's move forward so that I can invite her back to the White House for a presidential tour, by me, so that she can see what happens when you promote progressive policies: you win and beat Trump.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: I have a way of working with people.  Yeah, you hurl office supplies at them when they piss you off. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Hillary Clinton said bad things about Bernie Sanders, and we care about what she has to say, so let's spend ten minutes bashing Bernie from that angle. Bernie: Jesus Christ... #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Biden's "please clap" moment, live at a debate. And look at these corporatists eat it up. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete's robotic mimicry of human emotions in defense of Hunter Biden deserves a Razzy nomination, at the very least. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, now we're on the vindication of Biden's corrupt family. This is what we're discussing in the last debate before New Hampshire. Wtf... #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's 1/2 an hour of impeachment nonsense. Wake me when they're talking about the issues that matter again. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Nice job, Yang. If only he'd have a medicare for all plan I'd love him more. But he's right, and watching him interrupt and scold Pete is awesome. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg with the religious pandering is vomit-inducing. "Division, destruction, unity, values, hope, anecdotes, vote for me." *vomits* #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm secretly hoping that Steyer is up there strictly to play the role of @TulsiGabbard and kneecap #MayorCheat all night. Here's hoping. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer calling Trump "Mr. Trump" reminds me (as if I need reminding) while this dude has no reason to be on that stage. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: I'm sick of this shit. Fuck insurance companies. Fuck big pharma. And, finally, fuck neoliberalism.  Okay, that last one was just what I'd wish he'd say, but you know he's thinking it every time he's on the debate stage.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We'll get to you Bernie just as soon as everyone else who has no chance of winning the nomination bash your ideas." -ABC #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar with the scripted mom jokes makes me physically ill. And giving Doug Jones credit for voting with his party is only slightly more egregious than giving Mitt Romney credit for anything. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden loves to take credit for things that may or may not have passed when he may or may not have been Senator of VP. And invoking Obama is the last stand of a broken mind with nothing else to grasp onto. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing to listen @PeteButtigieg speak every time and say nothing. Every. Fucking. Time. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the defense of the insurance lobbies and companies. This is the debate where the corporate hegemonic agenda is front and center, no illusions, no hiding. Here's your choice, America: neoliberal hegemony or progressive populism. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except for Steyer, and maybe Yang, they're all up there to kneecap Bernie, because that's what their corporate owners have commanded of them. And ABC is there to enable this complete shit show. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden yelling about Bernie, lying the whole time, is amazing. He's clearly in panic mode, knowing he can't finish below 2nd in New Hampshire, so he's just going to lie all night, mostly about Bernie. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Command people" @PeteButtigieg? They're already being commanded by big pharma, the surveillance state, consolidated media, etc.? Bernie is going to give people basic, human rights, #CIAPete. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: No one is going to vote for this commie because he's too extreme. Bernie: Look, I'm going to do things that actually help working people. I'm not bought and paid for by the deep state, unlike some people and their apps. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Pete's CIA-approved plan to smear Bernie as "extreme", apparently. Coming from the guy who's the youngest candidate, yet who's majority of supporters are the oldest and whites of all of the candidates, is rich. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if they're trying to see how look the socialist-bashing can go on before Bernie tells them to go fuck themselves, respectfully of course. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Look, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time. My smear against him didn't work, so I'm going to start with that. We're different sure, but I'm still progressive too, even when I clap for Trump's anti-socialist comments and vote for all of his bills. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang: It's great to be back on the debate stage. Here's the stuff I've been saying for months now. Bernie: Please, for the love of democracy, just endorse me so that I can put you in my administration and we can fix this country. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: Look, Bernie is right. ABC: Fml, Yang you're up.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Before we go on, anyone want to pile on Bernie so that we can railroad him a little more? Klobs: Me! Me! I want to lead in time spoken for the fourth consecutive debate! Fuck Bernie. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Look, here's a lie about the turnout in Iowa. Bernie: I don't want to debate the lies that ABC and the rest of the media pushes. The voters we have can beat Trump. These corporate candidates are going to turn off my supporters worse than in 2016. Period. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Bernie, you're a commie. Why won't you drop out? Bernie. Fuck Trump. He's going insane, lying every time he talks. Now, we're united *wink* in defeating Trump. What I want is for #CIAPete to stop usurping the will of the people. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABC: Biden, what is the risk in voting for Bernie? Biden: Look, I took a hit here, New Hampshire, but that's okay because I've done this before and lost proudly. Now, Bernie is a commie who turns off corporatists, so we can't have that. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at the smug, entitled, sociopath grin on @PeteButtigieg's face. Fml. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And before the debate begins we are informed that the @DNC has packed the crowd with its professional trolls. Wonderful. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For @TwitterSupport's sake I hope these "issues" clear up soon because it's not going to stop me or the rest of the progressive army from saturating Twitter with all of the debate commentary tonight. The oligarchs' time is up, @jack, get over it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At this rate we're going to have the results of the #NHPrimary before we finish the #IowaCaucus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened in the #IowaCaucus was a disgrace, and so is @PeteButtigieg. What's amazing is that he thinks this is some sort of springboard to winning future contests. No one is voting for you to be president, American Psycho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naomikaravani How about Crimson Fury?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here comes the neoliberal response. Here will be the highlights: Trump bad, Dems care about values, virtue signaling, platitudes, Trump bad, folksy, unity, blue no matter who (except Bernie), Trump bad, stronger together, antedotes, Trump bad. #SOTU #DemResponse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's worse: @DNC is actively working to make sure that, if they can't get the neoliberal candidate nominated, that Trump will serve four more years. #BernieOrBust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm now watching a burgeoning neo-fascist speech about American exceptionalism. What's so sad is that the neoliberal pyramid scheme is coming to its necessary end, and these rich scumbags just keep going along like everything is going to be fine, if not better. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, this is like a baseball game now, where the dad that was deployed for 12th time comes home and comes out during the 7th inning stretch. Happy that this solder is safe, but this is obscene. The same solder that's being heralded tonight we be forgotten in his PTSD fight. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The military section of the tragedy porn segment of this speech will not end, yo. We get it: virtue signaling is fun for Republicans too. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Trump 100% owns the attack on Soleimani, doubling down on the terrorism angle. Then brags about rendering the Iranian people destitute via sanctions. This is peak American imperialist hegemony. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it when Trump says, "We will never forget you loss. They'll live in our hearts forever." Bro, you didn't know who these people were before 8:30 tonight, maybe. And you won't remember them while you're doing a line of Adderall later tonight. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Kayla wouldn't have died if America hadn't invaded Iraq, thus creating ISIS. Or if CIA-backed insurgents weren't fighting Pentagon-backed insurgents. But let's never talk about those things. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if ISIS is 100% completely deadedy dead dead, can we leave now? No? Thought not. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I guess no one told Trump about the whole separation of church and state thing. Ah who cares. 2nd amendment! Space Wars! Let's raid the Moon for minerals! Mars because 'Merica! Islam Bad! #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what this speech was missing, the smug, entitled, frat-bro misogynist Kavanaugh. Great. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another minority shield for Trump is here tonight, in the form of a Hispanic deputy chief of ICE. Because if Hispanics are part of ICE, they can't be racist right? #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let the tragedy porn section of the speech serve as red meat for the base, and possibly the most polarizing presidential election ever if Bernie is the nominee. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On tap for this portion of the #SOTU we resume the casual xenophobia that has become standard and expected in the @GOP these days. Because immigrants bad! Well, some immigrants. From certain countries. Where people "look" criminally. And by criminally they mean not white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope that Rush Limbaugh enjoys this time on tv, and I really hope that when he's slowly, painfully dying in a hospital bed I'll be reminded that his brand of bigotry is dying off, never to return. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, we've gotten to the segment of the speech where he finally doesn't like minorities. Now they're supported by the "radical left". I'm not sure if he's noticed, but there are maybe ten members of the "radical left" and three are running for your job. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here is the #MedicareForAll bashing segment. Dude, your own party's voters want a gov't-run system. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Price transparency" is awesome! No really; now I'll know exactly what I can't afford and how much it would cost to be healthy. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of this speech just seems to be mimicking a drunk Uncle at Thanksgiving rant about how "not racist" they are after using a slur about the guy they work with, who supposedly is also on welfare. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The gross use of minorities as shields against accusations of racism continues with an 8-year-old girl who's here to be a shield for Trump to campaign for the privatize schools everywhere. Because if we don't we're denying them "choice". Like right-to-work, which was great. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently victories for people other than the Americans are not real victories. I didn't know that this had become a sporting event where all other teams but mine are bad and don't count. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, a reference to the Tuskegee Airmen at a GOP #SOTU. Let's not talk about the horrible things that happened to the Tuskegee Airmen by the US government, though. Shh. Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought I'd live to see the idea of a Space Force being created for the idea of fighting over...space. Not exploration. Space wars. With other people on Earth. Just let that sink in. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently we need to invest trillions in the military to protect us from...socialism? We have the freedom to be capitalists but not socialist, it seems. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it when our president invites and the gets a standing ovation for the handpicked CIA coup leader, who was trained by the leading neoliberal economist at George Washington University. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rebuilding "our" country is code for a nationwide gentrification plan, which I'm sure Kushner will be happy to negotiate on behalf of soulless, demon robots with dead fish eyes everywhere. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it when neoliberals go on tv and talk about how smart they are, love each other, and how the will of the people needs to be usurped because, essentially, "they know best". I'm glad that they have each other to talk to, at least. Enjoy your lib bubbles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the shot at climate change initiatives, because bragging about more fossil fuel initiatives can only end well. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. The only people of color that Trump can reference are former drug-addicts whom he's exploiting for political gain and token politicians. What's that line? "I'm not racist! I have lots of black friends." #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here is the token black Republican senator who's useful idiocy knows no bounds in this administration. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We get it, dude; everyone is working. They're working at jobs they hate, for 60+ hours a week at three separate jobs. Bragging about permanent neo-serfdom is grotesque. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Minority virtue-signaling is another call sign of this administration. Just because you're employing minorities at a "record level" doesn't mean that their lives are better. Their lives are, largely, horrible. And he knows this. But the lies will go unchallenged. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And bragging about the employment rate is so gross. It's not the true rate and Trump knows it because he used to make that same reference before he was president. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, they're "record-setting" tax cuts alright. Their setting records for how quickly they can redistribute wealth to the 1%. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love when the political power elite talk about how great the economy is doing, because it's going well for them and their stockholders. And it's great to hear about our military being "back" as if it was dismantled under Obama. #SOTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called neoliberal hegemony. #IowaCaucas #IACaucus #DNCRigged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The continued narcissism of this sociopath is disgusting. He was created as this weird combination of Trudeau and Macron, here to officially destroy the progressive movement. We can never allow him to be president. @PeteButtigieg is as dangerous as Trump. There. Someone said it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone wondering why only 62% is being released let me simplify it for you: that was the decided percentage that was negotiated by the @IowaDemocrats &amp; @DNC to minimize @BernieSanders' victory in the #IowaCaucas by propping up #CIAPete until Bloomberg's buys the nomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to @jimmy_dore and @JimmyDoreShow, the @DNC is about to take over the counting of votes. So when their app (run by #Shadow and paid for by @PeteButtigieg and @HillaryClinton people) doesn't work in screwing Bernie, just take a hands-on approach to election fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After @JoeBiden &amp; @PeteButtigieg are no longer viable neoliberal pawns for the power elite, the consolidated corporate media will anoint Bloomberg as "the only chance at defeating Trump". Thus will begin the greatest usurpation of the will of the people in the US ever. #IACaucus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how brazen the neoliberal power elite have become. They don't care about what the people want, because they're not accountable to us in any way anymore. @BarackObama and @JoeBiden made sure of that when no one was punished during the Great Recession. #IowaCaucas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This entire fiasco in #IowaCaucus is by design, to completely erase the win by @BernieSanders and diminish, in any way, momentum going into New Hampshire. The app, and everyone that is funding the company that is running it, have begun the 2016 redux. #IACaucus #Bernie2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prediction was not accurate enough, given what's happening right now. This "2/3 results" release is by design, and the @IowaDemocrats and the @DNC are going to withhold the remaining 1/3 (which will give Bernie the win) until the SOTU. Democracy is dead. #IowaCaucas #IACaucus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING: #IowaCaucus Fix Is In ‚Äì Proof of Manufactured Chaos (Web Exclusive)  https://t.co/UZCQmaWT7E via @LeeCamp &amp; @RedactedTonight #IACaucus #FuckTheDNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was the plan all along, because they knew that @BernieSanders was going to win. Big. @JoeBiden &amp; @PeteButtigieg know that they can't beat Bernie, so they're going to sabotage this primary as long as possible. #IACaucus #IowaCaucas #CaucusForBernie #MayorCheat #NeverBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prediction: @Iowademocrats &amp; @DNC will release the results in the middle of their Trump SOTU coverage and proceed to downplay and ignore more than they've ever downplayed and ignored anything else in their collective lives. #IowaCaucuses #IACaucus #CaucusForBernie #Bernie2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies and gentlemen, here is the proclamation of a narcissist sociopath laboring under the delusion that people want him to be in charge of the country. #IowaCaucuses #IACaucus #NeverPete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your party is actively working against @BernieSanders, who has the overwhelming support of the people, because he's going to end your neoliberal pyramid scheme. @TomPerez should resign in disgrace, and you should stop interfering in democracy. #IowaCaucuses #IACaucus #Bernie2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the @iowademocrats and the @DNC will declare the caucus results "invalid" and make sure that any momentum Bernie would have gotten is neutered, stealing delegates any way they can. We can't let them. Keep fighting. #IowaCaucuses #IACaucus #CaucusForBernie #Bernie2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The condescension here is gross, while simultaneously trying to protect a prominent member of the neoliberal power elite. @ninaturner did a great job holding her ground, but these news readers are here to do one thing, above all else: be the P.R. shield for neoliberal hegemony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After @BernieSanders crushes this primary, immediately after, the neoliberal news readers will downplay this primary to the point you'll wonder why we it was even covered. Some will even say that this is somehow bad for Bernie. That's their plan and job now. #Bernie2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden: Every person, whether they exist or I made them up in my head, deserves decency. We have to restore America's literal soul. I know where it is. I'm reading from a script right now, but I don't know where I am right now. We can do stuff! #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: This was not a great debate. We didn't talk as much as we should about issues that matter. And that's because @CNN sucks ass. It sucks so much ass that we have to answer bullshit questions, when we should be talking about ending plutocracy. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Look, this is where I list a bunch of marginalized groups and talk about how much I want to connect with you. I can't, but I'm trying. Help me try. Vote for me to try, while I give some of what you think you want. Let's make HERstory. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: This is it. This is moment. This is when you make me narcissist-in-chief and fulfill my greatest desire to rule over you all. Thank you, plebs. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: I've played team sports my whole life. You're my teammates, America. I'm the rich QB that gets protected by all of you poor, fat, offensive linemen. Carry me to victory, and I'll buy you all mobile homes. Thank you. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: Donald Trump thinks this is all about you. I think it's all about you. Voting for me. So do it. Or staplers for all of you bastards. It is easy to hurl insults, but it's even easier for me to hurl these staplers. Neoliberal 2020. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pass it on. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I'm ready for that. Blacks like me, according the interwebs. Working people say they like me because I was VP and don't really know anyone else thanks to @CNN and @MSNBC. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Two of my three brothers are republicans.  And I'll bet that they love it when the three of you get together to shit on the one "dem" that doesn't understand why you're calling yourself a Democrat now. Wtf, lady. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

Donate to his impeachment agenda, which is really his presidential campaign, which is really for Bloomberg. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Bernie, you're leading in the polls and the most popular candidate among younger voters. Yet, the senior citizens we called on rotary phones, by a two thirds majority, won't vote for a socialist. Why won't you die? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg, the only black voters you have are the ones that didn't opt out of an email chain you sent to their spam folders, at 3 in the morning on a Tuesday. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And helped facilitate the destruction of the DAPL protests. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look what we need to do is act right away, and when I'm president we'll do all the same milquetoast, neoliberal half-measures that the guy I worked for, whatever his name was, did for five and a half years in 2006. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's telling that Bernie is the only one that says Green New Deal on the stage. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs: Natural Gas is a transition fuel, kinda like cocaine is a transition drug from heroin.   Bernie: Look, that is bullshit. She wants to placate the fossil fuel industry, and the planet will suffer. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liz, you were a registered Republican while we knew about climate change. There's only one candidate that's up there that's going to fight for the planet, but you keep calling him a misogynist. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And there's the same tired coddling of Mayor Pete and his bullshit college plan. He doesn't give a fuck about you, anyone who supports him. Nothing he's proposed, nor any of his explanations against free college/debt forgiveness, says that he does. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Biden using his dead wife and daughter as a shield on this issue of abhorrent. Dude, you were, by your own admittance, a Senator. You weren't poor. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Warren trying to relate to people is hard to watch. You can always tell when the technocrats can't handle trying to appeal the plebs; it's forced, hard to watch, and disingenuous. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Leave it to the Blitzer3000 Media Android unit to move the framing of this debate even further right, demonizing "big government" for trying to help people with medicine. Wow. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because that's their second highest ad buyer. First? The military industrial complex. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Bernie, your plan kills jobs. Why do you hate America, capitalism, and corporate hegemony? You have 20 seconds to drop out, or we're going to smear you again.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how the discussion is, "Families can't afford anything medically, so let's lower prices so that can get a little close to affording it, but still not getting it." Neoliberals just love to let poor people die while paying lip service to them. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the @DNC will do everything they can to ensure we never get a Bernie presidency. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete, it's not just your plan that's small dude. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Bernie, you want to spend money that corporations don't want to spend on the average American. Why do you hate freedom and capitalism, you commie?  Bernie: Money I spend will help people, the corporations that own you at CNN will pay taxes.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Sen. Sanders, you've consistently refused to say how much your bill will cost, despite releasing your plan twice. Why do you have Obamacare, and by extension, Obama?  Bernie: This is bullshit. Here's why:  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the #Medicare bashing segment of the "debate". Great. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After pushing "anonymous sources" that leaked it earlier today. And they'll keep pushing it in there nonsensical post-debate coverage, where they'll say @amyklobuchar won and is strong 6th place, ready to take Iowa.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bernie: I did not say that. @CNN: Sen. Warren, what did you say when he said you couldn't win? Bernie: *eyeroll* = really go fuck yourselves.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nobody:  Steyer: Look, I know I bought my way up here. But you can trust me because money. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer says things that sounds great, but then he says other shit that contradicts any sort of sincerity he pretends to have. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus, Biden can barely talk and Warren is up there, like a snake-oil salesperson, paying lip service to progressives, why coveting Hillary consultants and having Obama go around to the neoliberal power elite and vouch for her.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I don't think they're a trade agreement Bernie would support. Bernie: Not one supported by your corporate masters, Joe. Biden: We need corporations, I mean corporate responsibility, like when I let corporations write my trade bills. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: There will be no trade bill signed without environmentalists and unions at the table.  Why? So you can ignore them? But at least they were there. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a world that makes sense any support for Trump's bills, ya know because he's so crazy, would be an automatic disqualification. Instead we're having some nonsensical debate about neoliberal governance being best. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN: Bernie, please respond to our preferred candidate and lose this debate. Bernie: No, we need a trade policy that actually helps the working people. Klobs: Excuse me, you're both not corporate approved. I am.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell that his moderator who's talking doesn't even believe what she's saying. She sounds like a dying robot, and Bernie isn't having this nonsense. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN Talking head: Sen. Sanders, you admit that this neoliberal trade bill, negotiated by the power elite, who own us, makes "moderate improvements". Why do you hate workers, and why won't you drop out? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to see @CNN's funding for this debate brought up tonight. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We need out allies to pressure on our enemies, kinda like the pressure that my brain is putting on my skull right now. Bernie knows what I'm talking about.  Bernie: No. No I don't. I'm older than you and I'm fine, Joe.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN loves Klobuchar for the exact reasons she keeps repeating: China bad, Russia bad, Iran terrorists. Why are you in the democratic party again? There's a party for you already, Klobs. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobs starts talking and is trying her best to do a young Hillary impression, which is why her polling is terrible. Well, one of MANY reasons. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like whenever @PeteButtigieg talks it should count as a commercial, because he's talking a lot, saying nothing, and everyone is ignoring him, waiting for everyone else to talk (yes, even Steyer). #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh, another black woman is talking to @PeteButtigieg. I hope this goes better than his last interaction involving her vote. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they know who's paying the bills. Boeing, Raytheon, etc. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this was just what we know about under their neoliberal regime. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be the world's policeman again? @JoeBiden, where were you for those eight years under Obama. Blitzer3000 just called you out for it. And then Buttigieg says it need to be repealed, you again? But you just justified its usage? Wtf? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's great to see @SenSanders be the one to tie economic disparities at home to our military usage abroad. Of course @CNN moves away from that immediately. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another vapid, anecdotal response from Mayor Pete Pan who can't see to provide a human answer. He and the Blitzer3000 should get along all night. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, there's a difference between normal combat troops, and special forces combat troops. Period. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: No, look, we need to green our military, include other countries, and green our military as much as we can. We need to get combat troops out, more drones in. Thank you, MIC. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: I would go back to our foreign policy from '08 to '16 because that was working out for America and the military industrial complex, and oil companies. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Yes I would leave troops in the middle east, to do patrols, you know because we need to make sure these countries understand who's in charge of policing the world. Come on people! #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christ, and now Biden is trying to take credit for the Iran Nuclear deal. To steal one from Hansy Uncle Joseph, give me a break. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blitzer3000: When we left our forever war in Iraq, ISIS appeared. The U.S. is not responsible for anything bad there, so why should we leave, Bernie Sanders? Why do you hate our empire, commie? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Steyer talking about he can rich-splain his way into the presidency. Please. Dude, you rolled Impeach Trump money into buying your way on stage. No one believes you. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @ewarren talk about how much she cares about the military members is pathetic. She's voted for Trump's military budgets and is NEVER called out for it. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which time? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Peter Pan with another scripted response, approved by the @DCCC. *yawn* #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one who has an I.Q. over 50 believes anything Klobuchar saying, and yet she is continuing to be allowed on stage. I wonder why that is. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's really sad that @CNN is failing so hard as a consolidated neoliberal media company that the only way they know how to get ratings is to create verbal pro wrestling narratives #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it is clear that the entirety of this debate is going to be, "Person X, person y hates you. Respond?" #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blitzer3000: Bernie, you admitted to a mistake, same as Biden. Why won't you drop out and endorse him right now? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Biden begins by hiding behind Obama, which should surprise no one. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie talking about "working with Republicans" is not a good start, but we'll see how it plays. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure he's programmed to interrupt only Bernie. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who else is ready for the first 30 minutes to be, "Why does Bernie hate women?" and "Trump bad"? #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden: Here's a half-measure. Bernie, shut up. Bernie: People under your plan are paying 20% of their incomes, which I'm sure your donors want to continue. Biden: LISTEN HERE SOCIALIST, 30 TRILLION A YEAR. GO BACK TO RUSSIA! Bernie: We're kicking out your donors, Joe. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: We have to take on the greed of the rapacious, for-profit health insurance companies. PBS: Joe, bash this please. Biden: Here's where I can invoke Obama and, look, I'm going to do this whole Medicare for those who want it, and that should be enough. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: To health care, Bernie, we all know that your plan is bullshit. If Congress, which is owned by the pharma lobbies, rejects it, will you stop harassing the poor, defenseless health insurance companies? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Are you still getting out in year 1? Buttigieg: I talked to a guy the other day who just left. I had no idea we were still there.  Because you didn't know means, among other reasons, you're not qualified to be president. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie is the only politician who will admit that he was wrong about something, and that should matter. But it won't, of course. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>PBS: Bernie, here's a question about trans rights. Please don't bring up the economy or helping everyone or we're going to have to cut you off.  Bernie: Healthcare for everyone, Medicare for All.  PBS: Goddamn it...  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: The Supreme Court is personal to me because I personally benefited from something, but rest assured that if something isn't politically convenient or personal to me I'm going to screw over the American people every time. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh snap, that whole voting for Trump's federal judges thing is coming back to haunt Klobs here:  Klobuchar: Look, that judge was supported by Sanders and Obama, so we're all wrong about this. But if you make me president I pinky promise not to do that anymore. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren platitudes are some of the least genuine platitudes out there. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, at least Yang has a multi-lateral plan with his freedom dividend. How does neoliberalism deal with people with disabilities? Marginalize them, when it can't use them in some way. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting dunked on by the moderators = debate death. Bye Steyer. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: The U.S. has made a commitment to treat everyone equally.  Dude, have you ever lived here? Literally that's never happened. Ask anyone who isn't white, male, or slightly religious. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: No one like paperwork, because the death by a thousand paper cuts are how people get screwed. We're going to actually tax millionaires and billionaires, they're actually going to have to paid those taxes. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: I think that we can create a lane for the plebs to pay these loans, after we raise the interest rate to something akin to your first credit card, so that they will never have enough energy or resources to resist a gov't by and for the power elite. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Look, here's some stuff that my corporate/Hillary donors have said that they are willing to tolerate. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: You two fighting is stupid because neither one of is going to be in this after Iowa. Here's some shit that actually matters... PBS: That's enough, old man. Sen. Warren, here's a layup question. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now that the military record card has been used, let's pull the gay card. The DCCC robot is running out of arsenal in his database. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ButtigiegBot9000 is about to have a mainframe meltdown if he can't avoid another attack with one of his pre-programmed talking points is rebuked. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: I'm going to invoke everyone to bash Mayor Punchable Face over there and still look worse than him. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look *raises voice* I LIKE PEOPLE WHO COME HERE, AND THEY SHOULD ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO TOUCH MY LEG HAIR! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Do you support reparations?  Buttigieg: I support looking at studying the effects of doing surveys of those who might qualify for reparations.   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg really is the gay, Democratic Paul Ryan. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Punchable Face: I'm the mayor of a town that is coming back.  For gentrification, and racist cops maybe. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: This is funny, because I'm the only one that doesn't contributions from billionaires. Joe? 44. Pete? 39? Hey Pete, maybe you can catch him if you have time. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: I didn't come here for this argument.  Nobody wants you there, so you can just leave if you don't like it, you pyscho.   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Warren's weakness, funneling money from her senate campaign to her presidential campaign. Oops. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: You're meeting people in wine caves, dude. Buttigieg: I'm the only one up here that isn't a millionaire or billionaire. You're a hypocrite. Warren: Yeah, but you're trying to be, and I'm not drinking wine from a golden chalice in a fucking wine cave.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Punchable Face: I welcome anyone who has enough money to get into my mega-donor fundraisers to talk to me about what they want. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: Thanks for asking this woman this question. I've passed laws that no one has heard of, but I get things done. Women do things. No policy questions please. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, Churchill was older. PBS: American history. Biden: Yeah, sure, of course. That's a joke. You don't have a sense of humor or push-ups. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, Obama's going to endorse me but he's certainly not going to allow Bernie to be the nominee. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The framing of these questions are already gross, now the questions are ageist, sexist, and racially charged all at once. Awesome. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Obama said this week that women are better than men. Based on this substantive statement, Bernie, you're old, white, and male. Why don't you just drop out, because identity politics? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking about jailing journalists, Julian Assange anyone? No. Didn't think so. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: Let me just respond because America still doesn't like me, so if I talk more that'll fix it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: Trump quit, and that's not something we do. And something that I don't do is talk about anything other than Trump. 5 Rs on my website,  https://t.co/sTcJelB8Dx #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang: They've just developed a phone without Google.  And that's a bad thing why, my dude?  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang enabling this fear-mongering is another disappointing point in this debate, though I'm sure I'm going to be harassed for pointing this out. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that's we need to do. Be the world's police, sanction anyone that doesn't do what we say, and destroy their economy if necessary. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now PBS is asking Biden if we're "on the road to war" with China. Wow. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS just asked, basically, if we should invade and annex Hong Kong. Wtf... #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete threatening military intervention regarding China is some next-level global escalation that no one with an ounce of sanity and/or integrity would endorse. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the Chinese fear-mongering by @NewsHour so that we can continue the subversion of their gov't by interfering in the #HongKongProtests   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, Bibi and I don't agree on things and that means I'm hard on them.  Not when you're calling him Bibi, dude. Not even close.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More vapid foreign policy talk about "allies", but what's really annoying is Warren talking about he brothers service (i.e. stolen valor) and then making weird transitions about diplomacy. No one talking about our forever wars. See @TulsiGabbard for that. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The forced applause for Buttigieg is deafening. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: It wasn't just the looks on faces at cocktail parties.  Finally, a subject that he has extensive knowledge about.   #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Changing gear, since this worked in the UK with Corbyn, Sen. Sanders: why do you hate Israel and what views do you have that we can twist into whatever suites our anti-Semite narrative? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS needs to work on their question transitions because asking one question to one candidate looks, IDK, suspicious? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: We're striving for a more perfect union, and that means being able to vote for corporate-approved candidates. Invoke Stacey Abrams, approved neoliberal minority figure. Voting, MLK, lunches. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders: Look, none of the moderators from any of the debates so far, including this one, gives on damn about minorities, and your question is literally pointless because, look up here. We're mostly while and old. (oh wait, that's what I wish he said). #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Yang, you're the only non-white up there now. Have you absorbed all of the others' powers to become the super non-white we need to say that liberal dems aren't closeted racists, so we can feel better about ourselves? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I didn't say normal. I don't remember what I said so don't hold that against me. Third, with Trump out of the way to intimidate some of the GOP I can then intimidate them. With my push-ups. But we need those people until we don't. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang and Warren, united in their support for nuclear industry and it's on display tonight. Disappointing. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: What we're seeing is a dramatic increase in insurance against flooding in places where it's flooding a lot, and the housing insurance lobby that funds me is not happy about this. I'm from the Midwest, people vote there, duh? Vote for me! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: We need to innovate our way out of everything because, if it's left to me, I'm going to spend too much time trying to get poor people what they want, while leaving the neoliberal power elite and their established economic system in place. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: With all due respect, that question is bullshit. Why don't we stop fighting oil wars and start worrying about fixing this planet while we can still live on it, goddamn it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look Jack, we have to explain to people that we need half-measures that make people feel is if I'm still mentally sound. Do you know how hard that is for me to do at this point? Hey, Bernie, you wanna do some push-ups? Winner gets the nomination. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: I lived in an area that was affected by weather and, boy, let me tell you, my staffers have approved this response hoping that I evoke some sort of centralist approval from my mega-donors. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: We need to prioritize this. If you go to my website you'll see section on how I take your donations, hand them over as subsides to my rich friends, and then tell you about how I'm declaring an emergency about climate that we're not going address. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: We know the planet is doomed, so Sen. Klobuchar are you willing to relocate residents if they need it. Klobuchar: You know, there's a video of dad trying to save his daughter from a horror-movie level fire and here's some platitudes. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS Idiots: Welcome back to Debating After Dark! We don't know how to do this so let's just talk until our production crew remembers how to flip switches. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: This is a false choice. We can have big ideas, but we can have those ideas by continuing to have the American middle and working classes send the few coins they have left to the neoliberal power elite, while they pay nothing in taxes. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: I'm in favor of that stuff, sure. But let's talk about why Trump is bad and how I can say a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with helping the American public. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how @NewsHour is framing this debate in terms of "taxes on the rich stifles the economy". Are you serious? The mega-companies aren't even paying taxes; in fact, they're getting tax rebates. You can tell who's telling the newsreaders what to say and how to say it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: When we see a gov't that works for the wealthy that's corruption.  Then why do you keep voting for his judges, budgets, and other legislation that enables this broken system? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden and Buttigieg staring at Warren like they're trying to figure out why she isn't there to take their drink orders. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: We need to worry about the plebs just until after the election, then my donors need things to go back to the way they've been since Clinton was president. That's how we unite the country. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PBS: Bernie, the neoliberal power elite just approved a trade deal that doesn't help workers. Why won't you agree with them and why do you hate America? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang going after the media is good. Talking about jobs disappearing is better. I hope that he talks as much as he can because he might not get another chance all night. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: I actually agree with Klobuchar.  Shocker there, Tom. Also, we know that you're just holding the billionaire spot in the primary until Bloomberg is ready to actually start "running". #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: Here's a bunch of words approved by my campaign team, saying nothing that I mean, and trying to combat the elitist veil that's been cast upon me, while I continue to take mega-donor dinners that I do not address at campaign events. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Warren trying to set a record for how many times someone can say "constitution" in one 2-minute segment? Also, here's another one that's going to say nothing while making a lot of noise with their face hole. Next up, Klobuchar and Buttigieg to continue this trend. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie with a reasonable response to this question, which will be subsequently ignored by the mainstream media. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Biden starts by barely being able to talk and is having a teeth-falling-out-his-head issue, similar to Pelosi. And he starts us off with the evocation of Putin, which should continue for the rest of the night by the neoliberal power elite candidates. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preview from tonight's #DemDebate: Alright candidates, let's talk about nothing but impeachment for 90 minutes and how democracy is restored. After that, Bernie: Corbyn lost and Tulsi is a Kremlin puppet. So, why won't you drop out and why do you hate America?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pete, no one cares about your wiki search of Atlanta leaders so that you can bridge that to more platitudes. You're such a disgrace to the "next gen of politicians", and don't try to pay lip service to progressives, neoliberal.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My god this debate closing is so boring. Anyone of these pre-planned, overly coached nonsense candidates would get eviscerated by Trump in the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker begging for money to make the December debates at the start of his final statement should be the only evidence he needs to drop the hell out. Dude, just go away.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That look Tulsi just shot Pete's way was fantastic. Pete coming off as the twerp that he is, and now Bernie is going to tag team him (hopefully) for the finishing move.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: How dare you question my abilities as a leader.  Progressives: Tulsi, FINISH HIM!  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi going after Buttigieg and his neoliberal/neocon attitude towards presidential affairs is a breath of fresh air.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete: Washington experience isn't the only experience that matters.  Your experience is as Tea Party supporter (it seems), ignoring black voters, and protecting racist cops in South Bend.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren's answer on John Bel Edwards, combined with her "spirited" defense of Joe Manchin, just shows that she is aligned with the corporate Dems at the hip and will never really challenge them on anything.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, we're really going to have another Biden-Booker meltdown on stage. What a waste of time, but great for @MSNBC apparently.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, I'm sure Warren hates ICE cages but she also is supports crippling sanctions against Bolivia and Venezuela that drives people here in the first place. If you want to prevent people going into cages then end the Monroe Doctrine.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg talking about how he cares about minorities is disingenuous nonsense. And then he hides behind his sexuality as a means of demonstrating that he's "like you", while he tells black women that he's "not asking for your vote."  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala trying to backpedal from her criticism of @PeteButtigieg shows that she's been told that she'll be a top candidate for Attorney General in his cabinet if she plays ball.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We need to change the culture of how women are treated. You mean other than being uncomfortably close to them, sniffing their hair Joe? Good to hear from you.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other than Bernie and Tulsi, not a damn one of them is going to do anything about "racial justice". They only care about people of color when they're trying to get their vote, and after they get it you never see anything helping POC.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that hard shutdown of anyone replying to Pete's comment on military spending. Now, let's cut to the health insurance sponsored portion of our ad budget here at @MSNBC   #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the military spending apology segment. "Let's green our military." "Let's make it more efficient." "Let's modernize out military." The framing of this debate is abysmal.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf? What is that question, @maddow? More people shouldn't serve in the military "just cause". We need to move AWAY from constant international aggression, not encourage more aggression. Wow.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Probably the only candidate on stage talking about peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and advocating for Palestinians is going to be @BernieSanders. Bravo.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We stand for human rights. Bolivia, Venezuela, Syria, Iraq, Somalia: We'd like to offer a different perspective. You don't.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Yang, don't cite Jim Mattis as a credible source. That's just gross. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The framing of these questions clearly indicated that CIA-trained staffers at @MSNBC are in charge of feeding these "moderators" propaganda. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the unchallenged promotion of US empire via the softball to Biden to make him look "tough". You can always depend on Comcast's news apparatus to be consistently working with state power. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the empire maintenance and expansion portion of the debate, brought to you by the Military Industry Complex. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie is the only one talking about prosecuting the fossil fuel industry for destroy the planet. That's the candidate that will combat climate change, and so is Tulsi. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, Biden, your situation friend Obama was opening up the Arctic to oil drilling TWICE and you supported it. Steyer isn't going to do anything about climate change, but neither are you. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only reason climate change is being allowed on the debate stage today is because a) there was overwhelming demand that even @MSNBC couldn't ignore and b) they can throw it to Bernie and Tulsi and then dismiss them.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Maddow had to hold Pete's hand there to answer the question. Wow. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serving up the anecdotal and platitude sandwich at the beginning of this portion of the debate, @PeteButtigieg   #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker is literally being called upon to provide the half-measures compromise to anything Warren says, and what's gross is that Warren is already the half measure. Love the right-wing framing of all of this. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really think that when Warren talks she believes that her closeted neoliberal corporatism is okay because she has good intentions. But working within this broken system is not going to work, and she doesn't get that. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In the year of our lord" Kamala? What is this, 1976? #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amy Klobuchar, ardent defender of the power elite until the very end of her campaign, which is coming up as a Christmas present for all of my fellow Bernie voters out there very soon. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a damn one of these candidates, save for Bernie and Tulsi, is going to pass anything that helps parents with childcare. Especially Yang, who wants to gut the social safety net. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden attempting to string together a coherent thought is sad to watch, and as we pivot away from Rachel "No Trump No" Maddow segment, let's return to issues that matter. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we return to Rachel Maddow for the "Trump is bad" portion of the debate, with a question that is so asinine that only Andrew Yang's awkward laughing could be heard in the room. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker talks and it's another platitude sandwich that is doing nothing but putting people to sleep. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I know all of these people around the world, and they know to give my son a job that he didn't earn and to ignore his obvious coke problem, no matter what. If they don't I want renew their beaver pelt subsidy.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar with the weird couched lines that could not be more telegraphed as evidenced by the crowd clapping before she even gets to the punchline. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg attempting to cover up his inability to win over working and poor people whenever he runs for office is gross. He hides behind his service in the military and is never questioned, while Tulsi's record is discarded repeatedly. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang attempting to fear-monger by invoking China is really gross. Hopefully he says something more substantive later. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one will be interrupted more for this debate than @TulsiGabbard because she says accurate and damning things about our permanent war apparatus. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the WWE-like orchestrated catfight between Harris and Tulsi, in an attempt to simultaneously take down Tulsi and make Harris into a useful pawn. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the first, possibly only question, that is asked of Tulsi is literally: "You said bad things about Hillary Clinton. Why do you hate powerful women, and why haven't you gotten the memo that we're all obedient to legacy power?" #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Vast majority of Democrats don't support Medicare for all. Dems: Dude, we literally overwhelmingly want it. What is wrong with you? #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Bernie talks about, "Some people up here don't want to take on the insurance companies" and @PeteButtigieg is the first one to raise his hand. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Elizabeth Warren Official Medicare For All backpedal has begun, folks. Anyone who was honest with themselves saw this coming, except for some at "the most progressive news network" of course. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the #Med4All bashing portion of the debate. Yay. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the question menu for @PeteButtigieg is limited to only softball questions, and no one on stage is allowed to interrupt him, nor challenge any idea he spews from his corporate face hole. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose @TulsiGabbard and @AndrewYang are just up there for decoration. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this notion of canceling "95% of all student loan debt". If Warren wins the nomination, that number will first become 75%, then half, and by the time she, maybe, wins the presidency it'll be "first come, first serve". #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Cory Booker, aka C-Books, being allowed on stage to defend the power elite until the very end of his campaign, while attempting to browbeat the middle and lower classes into believing this antiquated notion of "job creators". #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala Harris talking about injustices for the people is disgusting. She literally tried to keep someone in jail past their release date. She laughed at the idea of legalizing marijuana. She is beyond disgusting. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden was able to, mostly, string together his memorized talking points from the campaign. It's all downhill for him for the next hour and a half. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor @PeteButtigieg puts on a clinic and becomes the master of talking for 2 minutes and saying, literally, nothing. Love how the consolidated media props up the ultimate Trojan horse and identity politics candidate. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maddow: Sen. Sanders, people are watching this impeachment hearing that the consolidated news media is forcing down everyone's collective throats. Why should be concerned with other things when Trump bad? #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course we're moving directly to Klobuchar, who gets to speak probably the 3rd most of the candidates while polling at 0.00392% in the polls. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate #DemDebate5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And right out of the gate, as brought to you by Rachel Maddow of course, here's UkraineGate folks! #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost time for @MSNBC and @washingtonpost to present the 5th "Socialism Bad, Corporatism Good, Go Away Bernie" #DemocraticDebate. Yay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @nytimes spreads yet more propaganda that it has gathered from it's cadre of neoliberal elites so that they can scare their fellow well-to-dos into the "danger" of progressive agendas.

<|startoftext|>Wtf is that last question? No. One. Cares. About. This. Bull. Shit.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete with that tired argument of, "paying for rich kids to go to college" is so fucking pathetic and there's a reason no one claps for it. Just stop my dude.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden trying to mansplain to Warren about how she got things passed is not going to play well, and it only going to push her, on stage at least, more towards Bernie.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's what you need to say to him Bernie.  "Your name is on the disastrous crime bill, Iraq, billionaire bailout, and a healthcare plan that is from Republicans. Don't lecture me about what we can and can't afford."  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden drones on about "How are you going to pay for it?" again, as if it's landing.  Bernie: You supported the second Iraq war and NAFTA. You don't have any right to say what we can or can't pay for, Joe.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I'm the only one who's gotten anything big done!  You mean like the bailouts, which only helped the wealthy? Or how about the crime bill, which has your goddamn name on it? Those things? Go home, dude. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: I would not pack the court because I don't know how to do politics.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's another layup portion of the debate.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar talking about how consolidation is so amusing. It's one of the major pillars of neoliberalism, Amy. And she knows this. So just stop.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren talking about how she's "not taking big money", when she's on record on @TheYoungTurks as saying that she'll do it once the general election starts. So disingenuous and it's just a lie.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how the @nytimes moderator is against breaking up the monopolistic companies, and then pivots to one of the most pro-corporate candidates up there.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here to provide the left's version of "bootstraps" is Tom Steyer.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another problem with Yang is that he's a protectionist of big tech, which means he is necessarily a protectionist of big companies at large. Blaming screens for depression and anxiety was also really low and kind of stupid.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi: I'd like to ask Sen. Warren how she's qualified to... CNN Tool: I'm sorry, we have to cut to a break because Warren is the establishment's preferred candidate now, so shut up and be happy we let you back on stage this time.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Biden is just saying things because he's annoyed that he's awake past 7 p.m. And he's probably annoyed because he's not been able to smell anyone's hair on stage yet.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here comes the age/health shaming portion of the debate.  "Bernie, you're old and your heart is failing. Why won't you retire to Putin's summer home?"  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And finally when Bernie does want to respond to something Erin Burnett is trying to make that he doesn't. Gotta love producers yelling into her ear, "No, no, he can't talk because then people will cheer and that's positive. Stop him."  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "accountability" discussion is so disingenuous. They'll use this same language after this farce of a primary is over to say that they meant big pharma AND people using drugs, which will quickly become talking a second war on drugs.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so tired of hearing Klobuchar's personal antidotes, of which have no policy within them. And now Steyer is going to talk about "broken government" the rest of the night, because he's the "progressive billionaire".  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the hell is @BernieSanders going to talk again? Closing statement? This is stupid.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of the people that have talked so far are going to do anything about guns in the country. It's a nice, safe talking point for all of them because the NRA will either buy them or spend millions to have them removed.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aw, the Obama wannabes are having a little tiff on national t.v. is so cute. Why is this going on for, like, ten minutes though?  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer saying we need to work with our "frememies" is hilarious. I love how global politics has been reduced to a political version of Mean Girls.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the anti-Russia segment.  C-Books calling Mattis a "great general" shows how pervasive the Military Industrial Complex is.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget Tom Perez and Goldman Sachs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to go in there with a UN coalition, not as the world's invading force. No one but Bernie is willing to do that, not even Tulsi. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie saying Turkey is not an ally is a welcome answer. At least one person is willing to saying.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete: It's not just soldiers, but janitors too!  Dude, what the fuck?  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete is pro-war?! Really?! No.  And him wanting to keep "specialized troops there" should shock no one. He is the perfect Trojan horse for the Military Industrial Complex.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi passing the baton to Warren for foreign policy is smart. It's Warren's worse subject, and you can tell because she's doing the most reading from her notes that she's done all night. She looks weak in her explanation.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Tulsi's wheelhouse. Hopefully she chooses this segment to be progressive, finally.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the pro-war segment, brought to us by @CNN. CNN: for every war since their inception.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BernieSanders you have got to start interrupting and taking each one of them to task, including Warren (maybe especially her). The less you talk the worse you're going to do by the end of this.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's C-Books with the lame "Trump bad" speech. Dude, you're not going to make it to Iowa so just stop.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto is up there to make sure that "socialist" policies die in the dem primaries, and Warren is, because Bernie is not allowed to talk apparently, not having it. It's really sad to watch their attacks, but also weirdly reassuring.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang disappointing again with his protectionist attitudes for the millionaire and billionaire classes. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala Harris trying to pretend that she "grew up poor" is pathetic. Her mother is a doctor, and her father was a diplomat. Spare us.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar trying to give a defense of the billionaire class is only slightly worse than Warren giving a spirited defense of Joe Manchin. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayor Pete trying to appeal to the midwest votes is really funny. People in your own town don't like you, so trying to us a heartwarming story from your past is not going to help you now. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren canceling student loan debt for 95% will quickly be 59% in the general, and she'll claim it was temporary dyslexia.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: We need to talk about values and govern that way. Sanders voters: *rolls eyes* Here comes the approved line from her corporate donors.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, I'm going to say a bunch of stuff that was written down for me to seem more in touch with the public. We're going to raise taxes on the wealthy so that I can take that money and give my sons jobs they are not qualified for.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer: Look, Sanders is right. I bought my way up here with Trump impeachment money. I'm going to pay lip service to what Bernie is saying because I want the American public to believe I'm one of the "good billionaires" out there.  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad Erin Burnett is here tonight so that we can get all the right-wing framing for Bernie and smear him appropriately. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to employ almost everyone, then guarantee a job. Period. "Not guaranteeing a job" doesn't provide "opportunities" that are good. It provides the opportunity to suffer as being underemployed or just unemployed. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paying lip service to unions is gross. No neoliberal wants to see strong unions, but they have to pretend that they do in the primaries. It's disgusting. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C-Books trying to push through neoliberal trade deals should shock no one. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vague answer from Tulsi was a waste of time. No substance. Not a good look. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang going after Warren is interesting, and Warren is taking too long trying to justify her neoliberal-ish plan that's already been approved by the donors. #DemocraticDebate #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kamala advocating for a quota system for teachers, when it's being de-funded at every level. Seems about right.  Meanwhile, Bernie: We will eliminate college debt and pay teachers a living wage.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only questions that Bernie are going to get from now on: Why won't you call Maduro a dictator? How do you pay for ____? Why do you hate capitalism? Why won't you drop out? #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tulsi: We're on the brink of global war because of the military industrial complex's chess game and constant destabilization. I'll spend that money on shit we actually need here at home, instead of fattening the pockets of defense contractors.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gillibrand: Trump is divisive, and I'm running for president to help people. Namely, my donors. I can beat Trump if you become one of these donors, so that I'll say whatever you pay me to say because, damn it, that's what I believe in. Thank you.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inslee: Climate change will fucking kill us, damn it. We have to do something about it. I know that @CNN is going to marginalize the hell out of me, but this is THE issue.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bennet: Dude, people work hard. I believe in fairness and democracy, man. Trump is bad, dude. All of us can come together, in free love and nature, and beat the divisiveness, man. Come together and promote corporate hegemony, I MEAN family or something.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Blasio: Let me say some progressive shit and copy Bernie. *says a Bernie line that doesn't land* Um, website something something.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DRINK for "Moscow Mitch". Another prop bet in Vegas falls.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the #Russiagate conspiracy segment begins. Yay.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Blasio: What about Iran?  CNN: Please Mr. Mayor, we have to respect the rules as laid out by the military industrial complex and the deep state. We can only talk about Iran AFTER we've invaded and destabilized it permanently. Thank you.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fToRrEeEsSt1 @NialElkim Biden is the Biden, Romney, and Clinton of the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN: Inslee is clearly you made a bad decision, voting to go to Iraq.  Biden: I did make a mistake, trusting people who are now making me look bad on t.v.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi nails it on foreign policy because she's been a soldier in combat AND because she actually gives a damn about the people sent to fight these American hegemony maintenance wars.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, anyone who said that Booker did well tonight is ignoring the fact that almost everything he's said has been preceded with "Trump Bad". That's not a good qualification for a "good night".  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala high-roading anyone regarding prosecution is gross to watch, even when it's Biden.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we're watching tonight with Biden is the culmination of decades of being a conservative Democrat, and he's still flabbergasted that anyone is pointing out his record on anything.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kirsten, go home. You look like you've missed a couple of naps this afternoon.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DRINK for "year of our lord". I wonder who won that prop bet in Vegas.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or are these random identity politics questions disrupting any sort of flow this debate could possibly have.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Blasio trying to shame Biden has gone from admirable to just weird. Apparently he doesn't understand how Biden dodges answering questions, like the others on stage do.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN: Now to someone that has been pro-corporate long enough to be trusted. Vice President Biden?  Biden: We must put this burden of "climate change" on the rest of the world, and I would join a new TPP, which I'll disguise as something "inclusive".  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN: We're going to push pro-TPP propaganda and invoke fear of the China. Congresswoman Gabbard, why do you hate America and why do you love terrorists?  Tulsi: That agreement would put corporations in charge of environmental laws.  CNN: Cut her mic.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN: Everything that helps the rich stay rich in this country is doing well, but some of you want to raise taxes. Why do you hate America and how long have you been working with China to undermine our nation?  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More fear mongering, identity politics, and virtue signaling from C-Books. Shocker.  The rest of them: Trump bad!  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with De Blasio is that his record and policies don't match with the progressive rhetoric he's trying to spew now. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who laughs at a Gillibrand joke needs to be checked for severe brain injury and/or tumor.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We're going to "work out" how we stop taking fossil fuel contributions and handing out subsidies. I don't know when, but sometime before my next face tuck.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inslee awkwardly looking down at his notes is undermining the points he's trying to make. The theme of unpreparedness continues.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the hollow speak about climate change from everyone but Tulsi and maybe Yang.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gillibrand: I can be the go-between for black people and the Stepford Wives of America. I can be the bridge between these two groups. Something something white-splaining.   #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala: *oh shit they called my record out* Look, I'm pro-cop and pro-law. Fuck all of you.  Tulsi: You locked people up who smoked weed and laugh at smoking it yourself.  Kamala: Look, I'm proud of my record of enabling a broken police system.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Look, Obama ran a political background check on me to make sure I'm not too racist to be VP. There. Beat that.  Holy shit.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least America is getting to see how horrible establishment Dems are for America, and for how long. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala is standing there thinking, "For the love of god, no one ask me about prosecuting cops."  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And C-Books with a weird, crowd-pleasing comment that lands for the plants in the audience.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's another one-on-one wresting match, as promoted by @CNN, to distract people from the real issues that we should be discussing. So boring.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only @JoeBiden can make @CoryBooker look like a progressive in front of America. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the not-so-veiled victim blaming by Biden in his language regarding the question.  Side note: Biden can't wait for his time to be up, while everyone else has to be interrupted to stop talking.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scratch that, Gillibrand is the most unprepared.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Booker just dunks on Biden in one statement regarding invoking Obama. It's over, Joe. Just stop. Booker is the most unprepared of the 10 of you, and he just owned you without really trying. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi disappoints with a right-wing response to a right-wing question. I feel like between this and the vote for anti-BDS legislation she's trying walk a balance beam between progressive policies and appeasing certain voting blocks. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, how merciful @JoeBiden. If you have a Ph.D you get a 7-year pass to stay here. Your requirements are so reasonable.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think C-Books understands what a primary is. Maybe that's because he's never had to fight his way through one. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang finally hits with more than just the studio audience. Nice answer. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: People should have to get in line.  That should go on his campaign posters:  Get in line, plebs! #Biden2020  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Biden is doubling down on this whole center-right platform thing. This would be funny if it weren't so sad. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh shit, the deporter-in-chief discussion has been brought up. I think Don Lemon is going to get a stern talking to after this one.  Side note: notice that there were no hecklers in  last night's debate. Can't imagine why.  #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this whole "open borders" discussion because we get to see the fake outrage of neolibs that don't give a single damn about the average person. Hopefully it does not fool as many people as it did in the past. #DemDebate #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the first softball, bash Trump segment of the night. Yawn. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden has no new ideas, so his only strategy is hold on to something Obama is credited with because, if we brought up his legislation history, we'd have to talk about the crime bill that has his name on it, along with Orin Hatch. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how they talk about how much it will cost, while completely ignoring how much the current system costs and that #Med4All costs 2-5 trillion LESS. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CNN loves to pit these people against each other like it's a pro wrestling program. It's really gross. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, Yang gets to speak.  Yang: "rehearsed speech, zero authenticity"  I'm glad the people in the crowd liked it, at least.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing the role of John Delaney tonight will be Michael Bennet. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro: Platitudes and anecdotes. CNN: And that was a layup opportunity you won't get again. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the coded language like "access" and "option to buy in" and all of the other nonsense protecting insurance companies. I wonder how many calls they've taken from said insurance companies. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, at least Tulsi is going after the right person. Hopefully this is a theme for the night. On a related note, apparently Kamala's entire debate strategy is to just attack Biden until slips and calls her a name or pulls a Mueller. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Tulsi's mic is "malfunctioning". Fun. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: Well, let me just start by saying that I'm not going to answer your question and blame Trump for dividing an America that's been divided since its creation. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad that these puppets of the corporate power elite get to discuss how many crumbs the rest of us get to fight over. Love these debates and their consistent right-wing slants. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, none of these corporate tools will bring up how the military budget is now higher than the entirety of U.S. Government. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we begin tonight with more of what Americans cannot have, while the rest of the comparable countries provide their citizens with healthcare, free college education, and infrastructure building and maintenance. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala's mic is the only one that is messed up so far. Gee, I wonder why that is. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Platitudes, disarming comments about everyone else up here, Trump bad.  Sounds familiar. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More of Kamala saying nothing substantial so that she can't be held accountable for anything later. She has more in common with Biden than she's willing to admit. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, weird pandering and self-stereotyping by Yang. He's going for it, at least. Not sure how it's going to play tonight. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro with his best Obama impression, sounding as boring and Bennet and as convincing as Beto. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi with the weak sauce opening statement, not a good start. Hopefully she'll find some conviction before 10 p.m. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilERabbit Inslee: I'm running for president to represent people who have the option to wear Clark Kent glasses when their strategists suggest it will make them look like a serious candidate and go from 0% to 2% in the polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake populist de Blasio has returned. Don't be fooled by his performance, folks. He endorsed Hillary last time, and that should tell you everything necessary about his positions about anything. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay, a bunch of neolibs, Tulsi, Yang, and, of course, @CNN, the lead stenographer of the deep state and military complex, spreading the message of corporate hegemony and soft power regime change, 365 days a year. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get ready for more right-wing framing and corporate apologist extravaganza! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Tom Perez scream at the crowd about things that democrats have done just reassures me that they'll never do anything bold and progressive again for the American people, because they're never this excited about policy when they're actually trying to pass it. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden: American exceptionalism, yelling, troops, Barack didn't give the me the notes I needed, deport Kamala. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie: If you want to fix these problems we have to tax these rich bastards at a fair rate. We have to have a country that works for you, not them. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: Virtue signaling. My family. Platitudes. I'm younger than anyone else here. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris: Here are some platitudes. I'm going to say that I care about things that I have no history in supporting, and I'm going to ride this post-debate bump of attacking old man river over there as long as I can. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yang: Thank you to all of the people who got me here. Now I'm going to do the opposite of what got me here. Trump. Russia. Putin. Not left, not right, forward (what does that even mean?) #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gillibrand: No one knows who I am, not even from my state, which you only know because it's on the screen. Virtue signaling. Platitudes. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hickenlooper: You don't need big government to punish corporations. Socialism bad. I've been promised a job in Biden's administration, so Bernie bad. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@JoeBiden you have been in Congress since the '70s, you were in the executive branch for eight years. If you wanted to stop these wars, you would have voted against them from the beginning. You like war against brown and black people, at home and abroad. Own it. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: The enemy is the gun manufactures, not the NRA.  And that's the death of the latest Biden presidential campaign.  #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've run out of things to attack Bernie on, and this is what's left. Pathetic. And I never want to hear about how "progressive" Maddow or anyone else at @MSNBC is ever again after the right-wing framing of these questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congress has to issue a mandatory buyback program as law, Swalwell. Any executive order can be overturned in the courts. More nonsense against Bernie. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here comes another sandbagging of Bernie, with the gun issue, because the neoliberial media literally is running out of things to attack him on. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @NBCNews continues to just nail this whole debate coverage thing. I wonder how many producers are going to be fired by midnight tonight. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Burn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His name isn't John, Biden. His name is Chuck. Go take your booster shot for the memory loss. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He didn't get to do climate change, Chuck, because @BarackObama was too busy opening up the Arctic to oil drilling. Twice. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Pass the torch" sounds a lot like "pass the buck". I don't think Swalwell knows where he is, honestly. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: Listen, I'm not racist, the climate is. Second, Obama's administation, which I was the mascot of, did small things that really didn't make a difference that I would double down on. Raising my voice because I'm upset and can't hear clearly. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't remember, is Hickenlooper a scientist? Has he said that tonight? #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: Well, we have to do things locally so that I don't have to tell you things that we could do nationally because I simply don't know them. I am here with platitudes and that's what America needs more of. Thank you. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And finally Harris gets to the Trump scare tactics regarding of the policies that she will definitely back away from in a few months. All we had to do is wait. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are a lot of promises from Kamala that I don't think she's really going to understand how her feet are going to held to the fire. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we finally get to climate change, of course in the second hour. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gillibrand is trying too hard now. People are just going to be confused by her attempt to cram all of her campaign promises into 2 minutes on this stage. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how Bernie ended that statement on Roe v. Wade, but I doubt America will really understand it. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prediction from both of the debates: the 8 candidates going forward are Bernie, Kamala, Warren, De Blasio, Booker, Tulsi, Buttigieg, and Biden, with the last two hanging on by a thread. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The four bogeymen of these debates: China, Russia, Trump, and McConnell. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chuck Todd with the hackiest of hack questions so far. And that's saying a lot. He continues to be @NBCNews' favorite tool. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden can't win this argument, but that's not going to stop him from getting louder because someone is calling him out for his bullshit. Nice job, Harris. I don't often support you, but well done. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, Harris going after Biden for the supporting of ardent racists like Thurmond and tried to stop desegregation of busing. Very brave. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris talking about her neighbor's passive racism is so dishonest. She's the daughter of affluent immigrants. It's not the same thing. Very disingenuous. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, the look @PeteButtigieg just gave Swalwell was priceless. "Like, dude, you're here to sandbag Bernie, not to come after me. Get in line." #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: It's a mess, this cover-up that didn't work to the fact that it's inconveniencing me in my attempt to sate my narcissism. I didn't get it done, and by that I mean I'm going to avoid any uncomfortable questions henceforth. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up, human oatmeal Chuck Todd and The President of the Russiagate Conspiracy Club Rachel Maddow will continue the conservative framing and socialist bashing that MSNBC meant when they said "lean forward". #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg: China is using technology to perfect dictatorship.  No, that's us. Home and abroad. We just call it the "electoral college" here, and "exporting democracy" overseas.  #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Yang is done as soon as he uttered Russiagate nonsense. That disappoints me. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we've reached the Russiagate/China bashing portion of the debate, but Bennet wants to turn this into stump speech time. Side note, I'm sure that Maddow is not happy that Holt pivoted to this before she could. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of payed plants for Kamala and Buttigieg tonight. Not really shocking, honestly. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think Kamala really understands that lauding her time as AG of California is not something she wants to keep bringing up. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: We should be locking people up only when it's politically convenient. Like I did with the crime bill. When it's okay, then do it. But seeing as the polls have flipped, I am now against it publicly. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden: You want to talk about foreign policy, here it is. I worked on making sure that America was so shitty that people didn't want to immigrate here in the first place. That's how we solve this. Ask Obama, he's the one that sent me to my room to think about this. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's @PeteButtigieg trying to play to conservative voters that will never vote for him ever. Wow, real innovative and it'll totally work. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, Williamson just implicated our foreign policy in Central and South America as part of the immigration problem. She might be arrested after this debate. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can really tell Williamson isn't a politician, which is why she will not be allowed back by the power elite. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And none of them talk about why immigrants are braving such conditions to get here either. I guess it has nothing to do with our regime change policies that have decimated Central and South America, not to mention the Caribbean. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how there's no mention of @BarackObama's part in all of these detention center stories. It's all Trump's fault, apparently. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the layup portion of the debate. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, @NBCNews, are you going to ask @PeteButtigieg about his racist cops in South Bend, seeing as how you asked @TulsiGabbard about her past views on LGBTQ issues? #FairandAccurate #FairandBalanced #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how all of them kinda looked at Bernie before they raised their hands, except for Williamson. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris: I'm going to point at people and yell about things that I have never stood for before tonight. Point, point, platitudes, stronger together. Wait, not that last part. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how all of the government employees on stage not named Bernie Sanders are talking about how they have "worried" about their own personal health, while utilizing government healthcare and everything is covered. Hypocrites. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Williamson is saying a lot of great stuff, but now she will be ignored for the rest of the night. I can only imagine what the producers were saying to Holt in his earpiece. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the conservative framing of all of these questions for Bernie. And then try and smear him with nonsense comparisons to individual states. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of them, except for Bernie, are willing to tell the insurance companies that the great heist is over and people should have guaranteed healthcare. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenGillibrand looks desperate every time she answers this question, looking to please her donors while lying to the electorate. And Mayor Pete is playing a slightly more poised Beto tonight. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe more of them didn't learn from the mistake from last night regarding that question. Idiots. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loud platitudes from Harris that are reminiscent of the "Stronger Together" theme from 2016. Can't imagine where she got it from. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a nice rehearsed line from the Kamala Harris campaign team. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden looks like he's trying to say all of his talking points as quickly as possible so that no one can challenge any of his points, which have no substance. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now they've turned their neoliberial anger toward Yang. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Mayor Platitudes is trying to talk down to people about not going to college, while the entirety of the private sector demands a college degree AND five years of experience before they graduate high school. What a disingenuous twerp. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the tired Vermont state rejection of medicare for all. Bernie is the US Senator. He can't do anything about that. Moron. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gillibrand emerges to be the first great neoliberial defender of the night. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hickenlooper: If we don't completely disavow socialism and promise the insurance companies they get to take as much as they want in fees. I did things in Colorado that I'll never do as president, but I want to use them as props to make me look better. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris: I hear you, but where was that question when Republicans did things that I advocated for a few years ago. Listen, I'm going to say a bunch of things that I've never endorsed before and demand your vote because Republicans bad. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here comes Handsy Uncle Joseph with his 1980s platitudes and Trump blaming for all the problems. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden, Harris, Buttigieg, etc. can't beat Bernie in the debates with the help of NBC News' entire news apparatus then they should just drop out and save us the headaches. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hatchet job on Bernie begins... #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder what sort of "technical malfunction" will happen tonight. A random ice water drop on Bernie? Yang's microphone "accidentally" stops working? Let's find out! #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden and Buttigieg look chummy already. I'm sure some sort of kneecapping of Bernie has been arranged in exchange for the promise of the VP spot for Mayor Platitudes. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Bernie is surrounded by die-hard Neolibs in the center. That's very cute. #DemDebate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alabama Woman Charged in Fetal Death as Shooter Goes Free  https://t.co/QxAtAWOyhW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@litahart72 That's not all that different from most Republicans, which is my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren. Here's a bootstraps story, with a side of platitudes. None of these tools are close to me in the polls, so I'm going to coast. Goodnight! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: I have a child. Students marching. Climate activists. Renew democracy. Join me, this is our moment, and I did not memorize anything that Obama said ever. I promise. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: Who are we? Who am I? Who do I work for? Wait, no. No one ask that. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: I won places that Trump has a stranglehold over. I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I'm running to be the Republican nominee for president. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro: I am Hispanic and here's some Spanish. Adios, Trump! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulsi: This country can be decent again. And if these tools from NBC are done trying to scare you about my past, I'm going to win the presidency because I give a damn about everyday citizens. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan: Virtue signaling, stronger together, a rising tide and boats or something. You will not be forgotten as long as you give me money. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inslee is going to live and die with the climate change issue and, honestly, since we're all going to have to live and die with it I have to agree. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Blasio: Things matter. I've done things, other than attacking these neoliberials and their bullshit, and as president I'll do more things. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney can't even give his closing platitudes without screwing up the opening. Damn. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maddow: Delaney, here's your last question. Impeachment? There. There's your softball, champ. Delaney: No one is above the law, except my donors, and Iowa voters until I don't need them anymore. Maddow: I knew I was going to regret this. Thank you, idiot. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: Yes, and I'm going to explain about how great this painting of Washington is. Russia, interference, impeachment, "facts", save democracy, trigger words, accountability, justice. Stuff. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan: We need to kill the Taliban because they did 9/11. Tulsi: They didn't do 9/11, asshat. Ryan: Well, they protected them. Tulsi: They were Saudis, moron. Just hush. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, this is Tulsi's strongest area and none of these other puppets are going to top her answers. Nice job. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan: Look, I'm on the Arms Services Committee. That means I'm going to deflect so that Raytheon and Boeing can keep making money of endless wars. Blah blah blah, please end my time. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, it took De Blasio to bring up the war powers act. This really is the kid's table debate now. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: Thanks for a question I wasn't prepared for, Lester, you bastard. Trump, foreign wars, Putin, Russia, Trump, dictators, values, stronger America together. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro: Look, it's time for me to name drop. After that, time to talk about me being Latino. L A T I N O. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maddow: Sen. Klobuchar, what have you done for minorities in America? Klobuchar: Well, aside from teaching them how to avoid flying binders and staplers, something something economic victim shaming and stats that I've memorized. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todd: Congresswoman Gabbard, you said something you've apologized for long ago that I want people to hear about so that we can kneecap your campaign and take you out of the election, on the way to going after Bernie tomorrow. Thoughts?  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney; I did things! Listen. Todd: Thank you, you're done for the night. Delaney: But... Todd: Shh. That's enough, it's over.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan: The country needs more blue collar politicians, not these smarty pants people that live near the oceans, even if that's where most of the people live. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we have our first, "But how are we going to pay for it" question of the night. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro looks like an android that's been programmed to virtue signal and progressive shame all night, and he's been pretty consistent.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: Look, I've got a "small-town America" story for this too. And I'm going to fund things, somehow, don't know how, without upsetting corporations and the power elite. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shifting to climate change is not going to go well for most on the stage. Should be fun. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rachel Maddow attempting to be charming at a debate is gross to look at. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney continuing to harp on the whole "private insurance being illegal" under #Medicare4All clearly shows he's just here to kneecap Bernie. Also, he won't get another question for the night. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren channeling her inner Obama isn't working, and probably won't sway progressives the way her campaign manager thinks it will. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jvgraz There was? I haven't noticed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Blasio using the "black son" thing isn't cool, and he should know better than to virtue signal like that. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney: I'm up here too and I want to say things. Maddow: No one cares, John. I'm trying to get to Russia, damnit! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: I'm going to use 40 of my 20 seconds to not answer the question. Then, I'm going to use Castro as a shield and something something Senate and aggressive agenda. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: What Beto said. When kids do things that I don't want to do, that's what's best because I don't want to miss out on a campaign donation. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: Listen, I have a number of these human interest stories that will serve as filler so that I can never be held accountable for any of my answers. For example, young people need to do the work for me because I don't want to. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan: I'd like to respond to that question with substantive answer that no one will listen to. Maddow: Hurry up, I want to get to Russia as soon as possible. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro: Um, guns, um. I'm a dad, and I don't want her to worry. And I don't accept that um, I have to, um, democratic congress. Yes, keep clapping. Platitudes, um, is my time up yet? No? Um, filibuster. Guns bad. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: I'm tired of hearing about thoughts and prayers. It's time to have bold actions against the gun lobby, unless they start donating to my super PACs immediately. Thank you. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Let's focus on research about what's killing people with guns. That way this topic will stop being in the news cycle and I don't need to give a substantive answer. Children! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chuck Todd, the only thing you lean towards is the prompter and whatever it says. And money. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A "mic issue". Before the gun debate even begins. Sure, that wasn't timely at all. Now everyone make sure you read your prepared scripts regarding how you're going to "regulate" guns. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh great. It's human oatmeal, Chuck Todd, and the President of the Russiagate Conspiracy club, Rachel Maddow.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm afraid that the only thing that @realDonaldTrump is swallowing, @TulsiGabbard, is something cocaine-based I'm afraid. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foreign policy is Tulsi's wheelhouse, and she's nailing it. Nice job. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we have our first China/Russia scaremongering of the night. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's Cory Booker, attempting to carry the hawk banner for the Dems. Shocker. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney: I have an anecdote that I want to tell Americans. Holt: That's nice, maybe later. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does a law enforcement agent become a "mini-ICE agent", Inslee? Is this a spell one can learn at Hogwarts? Asking for a friend. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Booker says "northern triangle" take a shot. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tim Ryan is grasping at the "Everything that's bad started with Trump" straw and he's not letting go, damn it! #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Klobuchar is literally advocating for neoliberal multiculturalism and is highlighting "a path to citizenship". I wonder if it's similar to her "access to healthcare" argument. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delaney, nobody cares about what you have to say because it's all gaslighting and victim blaming. Just shh. Shhhhhh. Shh. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol, accurate. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro's job on stage tonight seems to be to clear the field for Biden, Warren, and/or Buttigieg. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This language switching is not clever or inclusive. It's wasting time. Non-english speakers have subtitles. Stop wasting time and virtue signaling. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is also the "low-hanging fruit" portion of the debate, it seems. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over/under on how many of these candidates will talk about the CIA-backed incursions into Latin America and the war mongers like Elliot Abrams and John Bolton that push this is 0. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the layup portion of the debate. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone needs to tell Beto that this isn't 1994, my dude. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate Yep. Because he's there just to kneecap Bernie. About 4-5 of them are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: I'm going to not take money from the people that I've been taking money from my whole career. Trust me. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is the virtue signaling part of the debate, apparently. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how none of these people are going talk about the endless wars that suck over half of the discretionary budget, where a fraction of money could pay for #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: Let me gaslight/distract. If we just passively imply that I'm going to make deals with Republicans and create legislation that can be watered down immediately. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These neoliberials are going to keep pushing for "keeping" private insurance, and then just outright lie about "closing hospitals". People can always get SUPPLEMENTAL insurance in Bernie's bill. Stop lying. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Rourke: Look, I'm going to do a bunch of hand gestures and platitudes so that I run out of time and no one can challenge my answers. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren is going to keep winning people over with responses like that. Should be good until we get to foreign policy. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blobuchar: Yes, I'm going to keep lying about "throwing" people off their insurance because I want the insurance companies to know I'll take as much of their money as I can. Period. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only Warren and de Blasio are the only ones raising their hands for #MedicareForAll this debate is already over for some people. Really disappointed in @TulsiGabbard there. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tying green tech to green jobs, jobs in general, is a good move Warren. Nice. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one with the anecdote/platitude response, but Ryan is using numbers to buffer the point. Still won't move the needle. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inslee not backing down. Good strategy. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm an entrepreneur" is code for "I will not go after the business elites". #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>de Blasio actually looks like he should be up there, debate-wise. Interesting start for him. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That rehearsed speech from Tulsi didn't really land. Not a good start, but she has time to hit on her strengths. Hopefully she will. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castro: Standard anecdote story, weird legislation that he knows will never pass because Democrats have sided with Republicans, virtue-signaling, does anyone know who I am yet? #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: We have laws that have been gutted by both parties, but we need courage to say enough is sort of enough. Platitude, platitude, pointing fingers, nothing substantive. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker: I want the plebs to listen to my fake empathy, while I'm going to deflect and talk about "addressing" consolidation, and then gaslighting people about free markets. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beto: Spanish-language filler, so that when I don't say anything substantial it won't be held against me because then all of you will be racist. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar: You can't have what the rest of the world has, but I'll make sure that Donald Trump is the scapegoat for why your lives won't get better. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The framing of the first question let's me know how this is going to go already. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let the neoliberial gaslighting begin. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Judge, do you believe in god?"  "I do."  "Did you do this, before us and god?"  "I didn't do what she said I did. My calendars are blessed by my Bishop. All of these other women are not accurate as well. Dems are Satanists, and they're possessing them."  #Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Will you accept an FBI investigation?"  "Calendars, testimony, felonies, 65 women I didn't assault, committee instructions."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cornyn: You leaked it. You did stuff we do all the time.  Feinstein: No, we didn't need to.  Cruz: Mr. Chairman is there anyway we can keep this from being submitted as evidence for this confirmation, because it makes the nominee look bad?  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruz: We should look to the facts that are convenient to us, make sure that our nominee gets confirmed, and project and gaslight them into submission. I'm Ted Cruz, meh!  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruz: I'm Ted Cruz, meh! You're not treated fairly and neither am I, meh! Liberal media bad, meh! Dems are treating you fairly, even though we wouldn't do the same, meh! Speaking in campaign cadence, meh!  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings Read this with @KyleKulinski in mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"So when she revealed this four times before she was planning to ruin your career?"  "Senator, I say both sides matter.  "Graham says it's the most despicable thing ever. Do you believe that?"  "The evidence has been corroborated. Beer. Calendars."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you wish she never came forward?"  "Witnesses say I didn't do anything wrong."  "So, she should just be silent about it?"  "She is a victim, but I'm a bigger victim of political and feminist outrage than her. I like beer. Do you, Senator?"  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You drank on weekdays, correct?"  "Well, Timmy's was a place, god I remember it well..."   "Sir, yes or no?"  "If I may, I need to delay your time as long as possible."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love how the GOP "5 minutes" is more like 10, and the Dems is more like 143 seconds.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crapo: These statements are under penalty of felony, if we don't like what's in them, and under our discretion. So, as far as you're concerned, we're not going to pursue that because we're Republicans who are in charge.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This quote, about you having to 'piece things together', means you can't remember what happened, correct?"  "Senator, I remember what happened. People described, in detail, how belligerent I was, and made sure no one has evidence of this."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This six-sentence statement, from his lawyer, is a substitute for this guy testifying?"  "Under penalty of felony, of which I am immune. He submitted this carefully crafted statement from his lawyer, under my instruction."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaghHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This comment about this woman that you clearly are claiming is a sexual conquest, that why you apologized right?"  "How you dare you impune her name. She has stated that it never happened. How dare you repeat quotes!"  #Kavanaugh #KavanaghHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sasse: I'm going to grandstand, using Lee's last minute, which is now three, to go after Dems again, because we don't have anything else to say or ask.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaghHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lee: He's here, right now, ask him the questions you want the FBI to ask, and he will obfuscate, filibuster, avoid, gaslight, straw man, and otherwise ignore your questions. Now, I'm going to use Biden against the Dems.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaghHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lee: You have been cooperative and attentive, have you not?  Kavanaugh: I've done the bare minimum, and failed my way up my whole life, like my ancestors before me, yes.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I wish that you would allow us the proper time to investigate this."  "Do you know how inconvenienced I've been by this? I've submitted calendars, and people have made vague, supportive statements. 65 woman that I didn't assault support me."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaghHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm going to read this quote about you from a female classmate about you being a sloppy drunk."  "That was from a woman that I couldn't be sexual aggressive with, so she's obviously not credible."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you remember this student from Yale?"  "Um, I didn't think you'd ask about this. I wasn't at that other party, and that's all that I should have to address."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hatch: Did these people ask you about things before they were leaked to the press?  "No. But my lawyers have been preparing me for these sorts of questions since I was so defensive about it with them in July."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hatch: He was an immature teenager! Guilt by association is wrong! All of these people who support him obviously matter more than Dr. Ford or the Dems' questions! Accusations should never be made public about public figures!  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hatch: I'm not going to ask questions, but instead be another character witness in support of him. Also I'm going to accuse the Dems of doing things we have done before. How dare they! How dare the news repeat things people should ignore!  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grassley: I've read the letter, and it's whatever. We're taking a break so that Graham can prepare to berate you for another five minutes again and I can kick a puppy in my office. Dems are bad! 15 minute break!  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grassley: Stop bringing up the FBI, damn it! Biden said the same thing before, so shut up Dems! Just let us put this rapist on the court because we want to repeal Roe v. Wade and deregulate everything! Damn all of you!  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"People have said that you get belligerent when you drink. Have you ever blacked out?"  "Senator, you drink too. Have you? Let me project and look overly defensive. I'm curious, do any of you remember what it's like to assault people? I do or do not."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Please, Judge, let the FBI do an investigation."  "Look, lady senator, I'm not going to be as angry at you, but I'm going to hide behind procedural bureaucracy, while attempting to shame all Dems to just giving me a job I don't deserve.  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We're not in a police state." - old, powerful, rich white man protecting and enabling another powerful, rich white man who is accused of multiple sexual assaults of women.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord #KavanaughConfirmation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Judge, if you've done any of these things you've committed horrible crimes. Are you aware of this?"  "I am and I hope that my calendars, as well as the lawyers that your Republicans have sent to help me prevent me from being convicted, sir."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Judge, drinking games, you were called the "throw-up king" and you couldn't remember who won games you watched. Thoughts?"  "I like beer, I go to parties and don't remember what happened there. But I never blacked out and the calendars can prove that."  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lindsey Graham just said that Kavanaugh was "as much of a victim" as Dr. Ford, accused Democrats of being "power hungry" (the laughing hasn't stopped in my head yet), and just had his sermon moment on the committee.  #Kavanaugh #KavanaughFord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Graham: "I'm going to accuse Dems of what we would have done to Garland. Outrage. Projection. Yelling. This is hell. This is going to destroy good rapists. It's been my understanding that drugging and raping women is okay if you have the right credentials."  #KavanaughFord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Look, we can connect your friend to this place you said you were never near. Why keep the FBI away from this?"  "I'll do whatever the Republicans who run this committee tell you, and me, to do. Period. Calendars."  #KavanaughFord #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"So, ask Trump's lawyer to suspend this to end this hearsay."  "No! We're here, talking about all of this sexual stuff, and going to hastily put this uber conservative on the court to deregulate whatever else we can!"  #KavanaughFord #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How many times have you been interviewed by the committee?"  "Um, 3 or 5, I don't know exactly. I can remember exactly what happened on my diary calendar, but not what happened a few days ago. That's normal."  #KavanaughFord #Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This thing on your under oath calendar, what does that mean?"  "So, according to this calendar that I memorized a couple of days ago, it appears that I documented things that I vehemently stated was committed to memory forever."  #KavanaughFord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In your yearbook, you talk about drinking and sex. I thought you were 'unaccomplished' in high school?"  "How dare you. I was valedictorian, played sports, poured soup for poor people. Church. People in school made things up. I only enjoy responsible beer."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Enough of your scripted lines, this guy says you blacked out and threw up in car. Did you?"  "Since he's no longer a useful shield I'm now going to throw him under the bus. Time to victim blame."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The FBI hasn't interviewed Mark Judge, the chairman won't call him. Should he be here?"  "He's already submitted a statement that my lawyers crafted for him, Senator. Now I'm going to yell over your logical point until you run out of time."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We're going to take a break now, so that Judge Kavanaugh can regroup, his lawyers have also just finished going over the calendars they've printed for these hearings, and he needs to conference with his life coach."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"These calendars, do they represent what happened or future plans?"  "Both. There are things I planned, and then I would write about my feelings, people I shared these experiences with. Obviously the blackout periods, and assaults of womans, aren't on there."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Dr. Ford described incidents of sexual assault. Have you ever done these?"  "I never had sex with that woman, Dr. Ford. I'm innocent. And these calendars are my proof."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Did you drink in high school?"  "Yes, but I didn't buy it. I consumed it underage but the seniors bought it so that makes it alright. And I'm a white man who never drank, so my tolerance was super high so that makes sense. So, of course, I never blacked out.  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"What do you consider to be 'too many' beers?"  "Whatever that liberal chart of beer tolerance says, meany."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Would you like to say more about Ms. Swetnick?"  "No. I'm going to pout now, and scream whenever I feel slighted. I'm upset. I'm inconvenienced."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Don't you want the FBI to clear this up?"  "Well, the FBI doesn't solve things. I solve things. I'm giving you all this calendar evidence. Why couldn't I scream at you when I wanted to? This isn't fair! I have white privilege!"  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Why don't you have the FBI investigate these claims, if you're innocent?"  "Senator, I wanted to scream and accuse you the day after these women came out and made these statements. It's your fault women don't let me get away with things, damn it!"  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"And this other guy?"  "Well, three of us carpooled together. Just thinking about them and all the misogynistic shit we used to do together. I get all choked up just thinking about how little regard we have for women together."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you know Mark Judge?"  "I do. He was, um, from school. He just friended me on Facebook when I was nominated, so I added him to my "political leverage" group. So, that's when I refer to him."  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I am innocent of these charges. It's this committee's fault that these women have appeared, accused me of things they were told they shouldn't have repeated out loud. You're why I can't look women in the eye and treat them like my personal props right now." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I revere the constitution. I just don't believe in some of it, including the 4th amendment, and I want to repeal parts of it that I don't personally agree with, like the part where women have control over their own bodies." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I coach my daughters. I love coaching. I love telling you about how much these women have supported me only after I was accused of sexual assault by multiple woman. How dare you listen to these marginalized women." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If confirmed, I'll be the first Supreme Court Justice that has his own harem of female law clerks that I assure you I have not harassed once. I now submit this calendar showing that it was incredibly unlikely I could fit that into my schedule." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I've hired so many women, Senator Romney had to donate some of his binders so that I could keep track of them in case I had to use them as shield against sexual assault, misconduct, or other improprieties charges that may come up." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm going to use women that I have political influence over as shields, take up as much time as I can, and shame anyone on this council for trying to impune my lack of integrity, while randomly drinking water with misplaced emotional expressions." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Here's another letter from my women friends from college, who were athletes. They were are physically stronger than me, so I couldn't have held them down in an attempt to sexually assault them. So, *pours and sips water*, I couldn't have raped any woman." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Now I'm going to tell you about my lack of sexual experience. Here is a letter from 65 women who friend-zoned the shit out of me in high school, so how could I be a rapist?" #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now streaming live, for your viewing horror: The Confessions of Brett Kavanaugh. Witness the gaslighting of the American public, not seen since the confirmation of Clarence Thomas. #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I enjoy beer, but I enjoy it responsibly. Just ask my friends, who I just said did drink too much. People who drink beer are not rapists and only people other than me blackout. I can't remember a single time I was blackout drunk so it must not have happened." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I have plenty of female friends, so how can I be a rapist?" - Son of Calendar Man #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're seriously listening to a grown man try attempt to refute allegations of sexual assault with calendars, while he randomly and awkwardly starts pouring and drinking government water. #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If these things were supposed to happen at the time Dr. Ford claims, my calendar is ready to swear, under penalty of oath, that I was underage drinking with other prep school assholes, getting ready for my life of white, male, cis, christian privilege." #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care about the crying or yelling, honestly. If he wants to express emotion, go for it dude. But this detailed recounting of his "detailed calendar" is ridiculous. Should we swear in a calendar now? #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't believe by now that the Senate is really a house of lords, just keep this in mind: Orrin Hatch was at the confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas, and now he's on this one. #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Block grants are to medicare what right-to-work laws are to workers' rights. Which means you have none of either. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Obamacare is built on a edifice of lies. Agreed. I don't support right-wing healthcare plans, dude. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InSourced @SenSanders @tedcruz Dude, Goldman Sachs runs the treasury. Again. Under another Republican. Bye, bot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing @tedcruz talk about collecting taxes from the power elite as "confiscating" I can see the ghost of Ayn Rand rising. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenSanders: The millionaires and billionaires should pay their fair share. .@tedcruz: Not while I'm getting their money. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Rich people are not the problem. People who are born poor and don't overcome all of the structural problems are. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Let me use this family's suffering to my own personal gains. Americans: Please don't. Just stop. Seriously. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenSanders: @TheDemocrats are corrupt, just like the @GOP. Neoliberals: How dare you accuse us of what we really do! #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: The "big guys" love regulation... This debate has officially entered the upside down from @Stranger_Things  #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: If we lift the barriers... Is that like "breaking down the barriers", Ted? #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Thank you for your question, and for existing. Here are my talking points. No talking except from me, please. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there's the flat tax name drop by @tedcruz, quickly crushed by @SenSanders. 10%. Holy shit, dude. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell that @tedcruz thinks he's back on debate team in Harvard because he keeps trying to get the last word. Sad! #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Look, just accept what the power elite has decided you can have. .@SenSanders: And you wonder why you lost. #CNNDebateNight  https://t.co/tWij90PFzj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @tedcruz drops a Thatcher reference, saying that's he's "reaching" is being nice. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz, stop talking about what happens to young people. You're not pandering to them for reelection, so just stop. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenSanders: For the 43rd time, being poor is a "pre-existing condition" to Big Pharma and consolidated insurance. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Congrats on your children, we'll need them in the Holy War against Iran. Not my kids, but yours. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz, if your dad came here today and didn't speak English @realDonaldTrump would catapult him back over the wall. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know this debate is over when @SenSanders drops a "RomneyCare" reference. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: I only answer questions that make me look better. .@SenSanders: I answer all questions. Debate synopsis #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CNNDebateNight  https://t.co/nYdVyXP2l3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh those governors do sleep well at night, @SenSanders. On top of their piles and piles of campaign contributions. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, we had competition. Then the @GOP teamed up with neoliberal @TheDemocrats and destroyed the middle class, @tedcruz. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Your case, because it doesn't help me, is invalid. My examples, however, they matter. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: I want you to have "access" to healthcare. .@SenSanders: I want you to have healthcare. Debate synopsis. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: You have the right of gov't not to mess with you. Women: Oh yeah? We'll remember that from now on. Bernie? #CNNDebateNight  https://t.co/jB5aDAmihM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: I want to give health care back to you. The people. #CNNDebateNight  https://t.co/lUZEdaF0DX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: I don't like paperwork, except when I'm creating a super PAC to accept "donations". .@SenSanders: Dude... #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if the corporate @TheDemocrats and @GOP stop taking hundreds of millions in bribes we can have healthcare for all. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if we stop providing billions in corporate welfare that prop up neoliberal, we can provide healthcare for all. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if we stop bombing 7 different Muslim countries we can provide healthcare for all. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad that facts matter to @tedcruz, because black lives certainly don't. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guarantee that over half the people watching this debate right now are googling "rationing" right now. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Here are six examples of how all gov't controlled healthcare is bad. Now, give me your healthcare money. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: Facts matter. Facts or alternative facts, Ted? #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here comes the Reagan praising. 'MERICA IS FREEDOM, DAMN IT. AND RONNY VALIDATES MY FEELINGS! #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@tedcruz: The answer is to lower costs of health insurance. Big Pharma: Um, dude, do you know how much we donate to @GOP? #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenSanders: We need to join the rest of the world and provide healthcare for all. .@tedcruz: 'Merica number 1. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenSanders: You're a good lawyer Ted. You use words well. Agree to disagree, Bernie. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I hear the @GOP talk about "competition" that's code for, "Whoever has all the gold makes and breaks the rules." #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSanders: That guy ovah there is full of shit. I don't comb my hair because this shit drives me crazy. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz: Our prayers and thoughts are with you. Translation: I don't care about you, I'm here to push @GOP bullshit. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now @SenSanders is forced to defend a @GOP health care plan after @BarackObama had a super majority and moved us right. #CNNDebateNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only reason @SenSanders might lose this debate tonight is because @BarackObama gave us a @GOP healthcare plan. #CNNDebateNight #tytlive<|endoftext|>
