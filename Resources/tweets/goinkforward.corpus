<|startoftext|>@LethbridgeCity good. Thanks for the prompt replies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LethbridgeCity Thanks for info. In the past, did both readings get done in one trip?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which begs the question....is an expensive water meter replacement being planned? @LethbridgeCity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMcCrea1 @JennSRempel You will hear again from them come election time. Btw, was that contracted recycling rpt. ever released?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I often wondered how that water meter relayed its info. BUT why then replace electric meter? Couldn't they read the 2?  @LethbridgeCity #yql<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennSRempel Most have their minds made upon advance. No amount of rational reasoning or new info ever seems to sway them. #lethcc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like snow falling flake by flake, #lethcc drops our money for every shiny thing that arises. Unanimous vote rule would reign them in. #yql<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a new electricity meter, so why are meter readers still entering the yard? @LethbridgeCity #Lethbridge #yql<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ASCUpdates I submitted a bunch of questions via Twitter but don't see any of them posted on your site. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OWS protest justified but won't work. Political change via Obama didn't work. Money calls the shots & police. Do taxpayers have influence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The danger to #OWS is that large groups of protestors draw cells of looters, whether paid or independent, whose mayhem then endangers all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NYPD once dragged away the Wall Street Bronze Bull. Now they protect it as valuable symbol. Will they eventually join #OWS fight 4 justice?<|endoftext|>
