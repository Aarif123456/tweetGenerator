<|startoftext|>We're playing poker. You claim to have four aces. I see a three of spades as you flip your cards on the table. Do I just let you scoop the winnings and leave? NOPE. Same with #ElectionFraud  #TrumpWon #Landslide  Show us your cards, Democrats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hi #Democrats! YUGE difference between the left Americans &amp; the establishment dems in charge of the party, it seems.

Which one is it?  Can't be both. #ElectionFraud #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melisandrePro @AK4WA @Project_Veritas Hon, the election official admitted it  could invalidate votes because of bleed-through. This is not okay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The dem party has committed fraud in this election as a further #CoupdEtat against @realDonaldTrump   That is about to be proven in court.   So you need to decide what side you are on.   And no, I don't mean what f*cking political side you are on.  This is good vs. evil.  https://t.co/DJSn7tRcoz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am an American citizen. I love America.  It is  time for you to love this country &amp; all our people, don't you think, Democrats? Isn't it time to apologize for calling your friends, neighbors, &amp; relatives racist Russian bots for the last four years? #RussianBots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if you got this far, you may be pissed or already typing an indictment of the #Republicans.  That's fine, because I am not one. They have plenty of corruption, too.  https://t.co/wZRcfNhPQh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you find fault in American history, you should LOOK at what you have done for the last four years.  LOOK at what you have condoned, accepted, &amp; fought for.

<|startoftext|>Hi democrats. It has been a fun four years of #demexit for me.

<|startoftext|>@Distinct_Words @EndangeredSense I've never said such a foolish thing, so not sure why you bring this #strawman up now. I also never suggested we "forget" about coronavirus.  Anyway, doc.  Have a great night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Distinct_Words @EndangeredSense I've never said anything of the sort.   So, this #strawman is a failure. Anyway, I had no idea quoting facts could piss off  people who are highly educated as you are. You have a good night, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense You are making things up.  Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Distinct_Words @EndangeredSense Yes, I am.    It is their "best estimate" as evidenced by the headline. And with those myriad of untested cases, the death count is much lower.  It is simple math. No med degree needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense Okay, doc. But keep in mind, even Fauci has been wrong  on many details. He has flip-flopped in his recommendations, so obviously even the best of  us are just interpreting the data the best we can So, no need to play the "I'm a doctor" card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense @Distinct_Words So I was right,  but you're mad anyway. Okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense @Distinct_Words I referred to real data which the CDC  released just yesterday.  BTW^^^^^^that was a fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense You're mad that the cdc disagrees with  your assessment? Well, take it up with them, doc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense What do you mean, "now"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Distinct_Words @EndangeredSense Instead of launching ad hominem,  Why not discuss the facts I offered?  They were all provably correct.  Maybe that's why you chose to call my intelligence  into question?  Good luck to you with such tactics. Most of us see through them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense I would also note: No other flu in recent years was purposely introduced into nursing homes by State Governors-- as Covid was. That act of negligence cost New York thousands of lives. I hope they sue the pants off Andrew Cuomo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EndangeredSense Well, take it up with the CDC then.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Obviously not what I said, Skippy. Liars gonna lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake  https://t.co/pqWoXvi8uZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake @ThorDeplorable Thousands of dead people received  ballots by mail at old addresses in Cali.   EASY to cheat in this asinine system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dwrench07 You forgot the part where thousands of ballots arrive at apartment complexes and get harvested by cheaters like you.  We won't be doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we start arresting these assholes already??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake Well, send your astute analysis to the @FBI, babe. Maybe you can help her with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake @ThorDeplorable It is even easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake If POTUS wants to investigate, cool. If not, we'll just leave the convo at...  "AOC is pulling some hokey stupid shit  because she has no scruples."  and move  tf on with our lives.  She isn't smart...lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With AOC online bragging about how she &amp; some tic tok kids kept the #TrumpTulsaRally #TulsaTrumpRally   numbers low...NOW ya'll get a better idea why #VoteByMail cannot happen.  They will cheat EXACTLY the same way. #voterID is what we need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uncommonground0 @HillaryClinton Yep.  So why were American death counts so high in democrat-run states?  Because they put seniors with COVID in with others to allow spread.  #CuomoKilledGrandma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissaGillies @HillaryClinton  https://t.co/Mp3EDd1XLL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victorshi2020 @HillaryClinton She should be #PresidentOfGitmo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Testing doesn't "save" anyone, Hillary. Real doctors now know that COVID is not any more dangerous than a bad flu season.  Still serious for our elders and immune deficient folks...but entirely manageable.  (Unless you expose seniors like Cuomo did in NY) #CuomoKilledGrandma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@number2pancake Yeah, no big deal colluding with foreign nationals for election interference! LOL. Ya'll not so smart...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD @Stasipipi @JohnRoten2 @m4d_r4bbit5 They not so bright.  That's okay. We love em' anyway. Hi sweetie!!  https://t.co/A8EPDqm2ln<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stasipipi @JohnRoten2 @m4d_r4bbit5 @DrShayPhD That is hilarious. Ya'll are desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Serene_Lotus @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Save it for the judge, hun.   POTUS probably won't come after her anyway. He is a good guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 She mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcLobliner Trump's base is not made of losers like you've been told.  There is very good reason we stand with @POTUS...because he stands  with us. BTW--I was democrat for thirty years.   They are horrible now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveTheTrinity Our wonderful president, @realDonaldTrump , is funny and obviously loves the #AmericanPeople. That never gets old! Hi Patriots!  https://t.co/FPcJZse142<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Serene_Lotus @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS There is the Constitution which gives us the right to #freedomOfAssembly. If it can be proven that AOC worked with foreign nationals to deny Americans their civil rights, she COULD be in big trouble.  She all but admitted it on twitter. Not so smart.  https://t.co/SzKtAzFnwN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were millions of us there virtually. #TulsaTrumpRally #TrumpRally  Hell, I'm going to watch it again today. Here is a #Biden rally for you to enjoy.  https://t.co/3BUnPnL19M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whitney_Mic @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump We were THERE online,  and we number in the millions.   Patriots who love our country are #legion. Most of those tickets "requested online" were to let our wonderful @POTUS know we are with him in spirit, even if #Tulsa was not reachable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRoten2 @m4d_r4bbit5 @DrShayPhD Of course not.   They were #Americans of every color. #TulsaTrumpRally #TrumpRally  #Tulsa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Serene_Lotus @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump LOL.  There are actual laws for these kinds of things. It isn't something you get to just make up in a tweet, Patrick.   We'll see if @POTUS wants to make an issue or not.  Til' then, you keep screwing up!  Fun to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@becksycan @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump LOL.  Night, Becks.   Get well soon.  #TDS is real, folks.  They will do anything.  Still won't be enough. #Trump2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whitney_Mic @jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump Night. Ya'll can convince each other your treachery was "fine".   I'm not really interested in your excuses for bad behavior.  https://t.co/DIzvENsXah<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jmarkgilbert @mommamaybemad1 @ps9714 @realDonaldTrump Because your pathetic campaign of election interference was small compared to those who symbolically were showing support online.

<|startoftext|>@DACox7 @DrShayPhD It is ridiculous hypocrisy on her part, to say the least. Personally, it pisses me off that thousands of Americans who wanted those seats --got told it was full because of this bullshit done by her/them.  AOC denied us #freedomofassembly  https://t.co/8PcF7oAjey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosen_johnny @parscale She is proud of her  #COLLUSION with foreign nationals in the American presidential campaign.  She could not wait to boast about it.   Vote AOC out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CCMEMTN @DrShayPhD Is that worth the effort?  I would rather just tell people the truth about her and let the chips fall where they may.   I love your spirit...lol.  You sound like you're tech-savvy!  https://t.co/O8waMKradb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfmcg21 @TikiTiQue Kinda missed the point, John.    Maybe someone will explain to you how interfering with Americans' #FreedomOfAssembly is unconstitutional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCMEMTN @DrShayPhD Let's just end her congressional career. That will be enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USAPATRIOT4MAGA They've been scared.  Now, they just can't control themselves.  All is out in the open now. They can't hide their corruption, so they're no longer trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVM_NoahShelley @m4d_r4bbit5 @DrShayPhD @RepAOC Cheers to that.  https://t.co/6rU0nAvn9o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewOrleansStsFn They keep failing.  Good.  #GodWins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katherineirene @AOC It was Ilhan Omar who married her brother.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@birdlegs1960 @m4d_r4bbit5 @DrShayPhD Nothing but #DirtyTricks from dems for as long as I can remember.  I used to be a #democrat.  There is no way I can support what they do now. #TrumpRally2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the very least she/ AOC should be #censured by congress for that.  Inappropriate and un-american to say the least.   But yeah, maybe the @FBI should be looking into this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>AOC is a hypocrite of the largest magnitude.   She spent years claiming President trump deserved to be removed from office for nothing.  #RussiaGate  But LOOK at her flaunting her collusion with foreign nationals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m4d_r4bbit5 @DrShayPhD Pretty funny/suspicious how she knew who to thank in the tweet below that one, eh?   She specifically mentions k-pop trolls and cheers on their interference as they denied American citizens their seats at the #TulsaRally #TrumpTulsaRally<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RachelAlter007 @catturd2 @GavinNewsom A death rate lower than most flu seasons is not a public health crisis anymore than your moronic application of case law is.   This will be challenged at the highest levels. You will be proven wrong in your overreach for power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AOC conspired, #colluded with K-pop to interfere with an election, and is now bragging about it on twitter. She will fail.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AOCIsFullOfShit  Many of us asked for tickets wishing we could go &amp; to virtually show our support in this crisis. Making up this lie to diminish Americans is worthy of dismissal.  We will work to remove you from congress, liar.  #TrumpRallyTulsa #TrumpTulsaRally<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@weijia Why assume it is any different behind your back? Obviously, they aren't two-faced. BTW--The president just called it #KungFlu at his rally, and it was hilarious.   There is nothing racist about that either. So chill with the #victimhood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrKandid @ololo666 @Handy_Time @jimmy_dore Mr K.  I beg to differ.

<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @to_letty @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Thirty years of hard work is not nothing.

<|startoftext|>@JonSellers11 @LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 I just want #Justice.   I don't want other people harmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@to_letty @LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Yeah, well aware.  In fact, was my area of study in college. I marched, I lobbied my senators, i was a democrat for thirty years.  So spare me the attitude.   MLKjr's methods were the ones that worked historically.   #NonViolence is the answer to the question of social change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Then, we are in agreement.   I have marched in many a protest myself when I was younger.  But this one worries me.  Antifa is inserting their violent agenda into this.  Be careful out there...all of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Yeah, I never told anyone to be silent, and I also would not be hugging a kkk member.  Go back and read my real words.  Anyway, we're good.  See ya around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@to_letty @LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Ahhh, ridicule is the tool of the tools.  LOL. Hi letty.  I just know that violence helps no one.   So it is violent "fighting" I am not into. Have a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 As we jump over hurdles, it is important also for us to recognize and remember not to make enemies of friends.   #Injustice outrages many people, no matter who the victim of police brutality is.  I have faith in humanity.  Love you brother!  Thanks for the convo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frankly, that is much harder than setting fire to a target.  We have work to do.  Let's get started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @Moore_Brandon23 @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Violence has come from many places in the last week. No need to fight for equality.

<|startoftext|>@Moore_Brandon23 @LegsandBread @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 No.  It isn't.   We are the lighter skinned #People who just want all forms of racism to end.  I thought that was the goal.

<|startoftext|>@LegsandBread @terrycrews @NecrotizingFas2 Wait, so "white agreement" is worth less to you? Come on now. In fact, you say it like it is a bad thing? You are my brother, because #Melanin   does not make us separate races.  #OurAmericanRainbow is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Justice is the path to #Peace.  #BlackLivesMatter  This police officer- taken by #AntifaTerrorists<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlairImani I've seen light skin people threatened in at least six videos where rioters/protestors demanded they drop to their knees to apologize for their skin color.

<|startoftext|>@CalliCapone @MsBanks4America @Rex13110792 @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika Good grief.   Your name calling will not change my mind. I am certainly not trying to push you around, and as far as Lori's family is concerned...I am horrified that they had to hear Joe Scarborough LAUGH at the joke that he killed her after using her for sex in an affair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalliCapone @MsBanks4America @Rex13110792 @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika It can be easily re-opened with new evidence..  LOL.."You twit"  I've never seen Democrats argue so hard against #Justice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trump20242028 @ari_russian Wars rarely solve a damn thing.  it just transfers the anger, hate and destruction to the next generation. We have to try to keep the peace best we can--for them. But I hear ya.  https://t.co/ELXEV3i2RN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBanks4America @CalliCapone @Rex13110792 @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika Yeah, we kinda saw that coming. Have a great night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBanks4America @CalliCapone @Rex13110792 @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika Hey, I fucking respect that. But I also am not getting bullied  into letting a murderer go free. You can fucking respect that...or not. Either way, have a great night.  https://t.co/VCiSuaYyTN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBanks4America @CalliCapone @Rex13110792 @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika Sure. They can say that. But ask any officer if families asking for "respect'' stops an investigation. Answer is--NOPE. Anyway, may her murderer be brought to justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, @JoeNBC shouldn't have laughed that hard when Don Imus reminded him of the "joke" about "killing her after their affair".  Using her memory as a joke is pretty low, even for Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalliCapone @Rex13110792 @MsBanks4America @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika It is absolutely anyone's right to question,  to investigate, to solve.  This is not entertaining, although @JoeNBC laughed pretty hard when Don Imus reminded him about his joke about "killing" her after having an "affair".So, if using her memory for clicks bothers you...call Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ari_russian Just say No to civil war. It is what the bad guys want. Peace will defeat them.  https://t.co/feTdie3YA4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalliCapone @Rex13110792 @MsBanks4America @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika Name-calling won't stop the #Justice. This is not a partisan issue. This is right and wrong. Every murder deserves to be solved. Lori's coroner was corrupt, even insane, being arrested with human body parts in his possession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBanks4America @jaazee1 @JoeNBC @morningmika You mean the @JoeNBC who joked about killing #LoriKlausustis on Don Imus' show?   They had a good laugh about it. BUT... He said NOTHING about remembering her as a person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyHo45354354 @MsMariaT @realDonaldTrump Not accurate, Becky. I watched every press conference our  President gave for two months straight.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei Hey, I concede that the article only said it has "likely" weakened, since the "great bulk of mutations" do that. The writers were "celebrating", saying in their headline, that it is a "good thing".   But feel free to ignore the #Science and wrap yourself in fear if ya want.  https://t.co/zhrjqLoPus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei We know it has already been confirmed to have mutated in the short time it has been publicly studied.   So, this is nothing but good news.   But I guess if you hate the President, you may want bigger loss of life to blame him for. Fortunately, that is unlikely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei "the bulk of the mutations that appear as a virus spreads are either harmful to the virus itself (meaning it is less likely to survive or replicate) or don’t change how it functions."  That clearly says it is likely to grow weaker with each mutation, &amp; coronaviruses mutate OFTEN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei Read the article.  The virus is continually mutating and we DO know quite a bit about coronaviruses.  We have studied them worldwide for years. Anywway,  have a wonderful Saturday.  https://t.co/JvzFRpLLMH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei Well, we've known of it for several months only, and yet we've documented at least one mutation.   Logic.  That's pretty fast, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @HughGnu @GeorgeTakei The coronavirus also mutates quickly.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @GeorgeTakei And he did.  Every day that man oversees the huge work of responding to the needs of the American people.  (all while the #FakeNewsMedia makes up another stupid lie about him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AreYouReady325 I love Bernie.   But he was unable to do the job for some reason. he turned his back on the progressives and told us to vote for the corrupt witch.  They either threatened him, or he sold out.  I dunno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werewookiee @heartdocotfried @BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei @POTUS Less reported cases is less case. That was always the point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>hey Chris.  Many of those deaths due to #Cuomo and other governors forcing nursing homes to take in #coronavirus patients instead of using the hospitals the @POTUS built.   Was he trying to get the elderly sick in #NewYork?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBibb321 @GeorgeTakei Death rate is similar to flu. People die by the tens of thousands every year of the flu. Did you angry-tweet about that last year, Chris?

<|startoftext|>@MitchNussbaum @GeorgeTakei So they're hiding the proof of their claims...why? LOL!  Please.  If the evidence showed it did not work, they would have released it weeks ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodneyross51 @HopeVigilance @GeorgeTakei #Testing is absolutely overrated.   You can test negative today, &amp; not know tomorrow. HOW YOU FEEL is much more indicative of severity  of the disease. As Dr. Birx said..."If you have symptoms, you should get tested."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covesa @GeorgeTakei Nope.  Didn't imply shit.  I said exactly what  I meant, as did @POTUS. BTW - ya know what isn't new?

<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS Trump knows damn well the vipers in the press and just wanted to shut them up.  He is a busy man.  He doesn't have time to deal with their stupidity.

<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin This hilarious article says the cedars-Sinai data  "might validate claims" then says they refuse to allow data out for study. LOL!!  Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS LOL!!  All to spite the President.   Hey, this new company is just re-using proven tech that is over fifty years old and invented by genius Russians. So, who cares what cedars-Sinai says?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjera1000 @StigmataBlues @GeorgeTakei Nice strawman fallacy. I never said only visibly sick spread the disease.    Dr. Deborah Birx explained this several times to fool reporters who kept demanding more testing.   She rightfully said it was not needed on those without symptoms.  Don't like it? Take it up with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei Anyway, see ya round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS Wrong...again.   https://t.co/nGi9TDr9On  https://t.co/9dugNSMNK7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei NO.   It is a treatment. Please go google it, FFS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS And.....I can't believe I have to say this... it is because he is the @POTUS. That is why he gets the cool white house and the free flights on air force one, and the free bodyguards and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS That is not what Dr. Birx said about that tech.  She said it was not developed for this application  yet, but they are looking at everything.   That is what good researchers do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HopeVigilance @rodneyross51 @GeorgeTakei I study medical tech as a hobby.   I knew about the Russian UV tech years ago.   You should study too.   Then you wouldn't fall for the #FakeNews bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjera1000 @StigmataBlues @GeorgeTakei Hi KJ. We have millions thanks to the strategic testing being done.  PS-- I have enough knowledge to know that over 98 percent of infected cases get well again with no medical attention, so testing asymptomatics ONLY wastes tests needed elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei Yes, light is easily used inside the body and does NOT kill the patient. A disinfectant (in medical terms) is anything that kills pathogens.  It makes perfect sense.  #DUH But of course the media lie was to show you cans of "LYSOL".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HopeVigilance @GeorgeTakei #Testing is being used "strategically" according  to Dr. Deborah Birx.   Her recommendations are being followed.   I like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That never happened.  No governor (or Americans) was ever denied anything they needed.  Trump used every power given to a President to do the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seagullfive @BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei He is smart.  He busted the entire #ObamaGate crew as they tried to pull a #coup on him.   They failed.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  https://t.co/HxLnb152ne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei @POTUS I have never seen him say that.   (and I watch every conference he has) What I HAVE seen is Dr. Birx telling reporters that testing is not needed for the general public who are not symptomatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei He never said bleach.  #FakeNews said that. He spoke of "disinfectants" being used to kill the virus. Yes, that is a real thing. He did talk about new technology using UV  light to kill the virus.  That is old technology that works , BTW.  Invented by Russians half century ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei Hey, did you see the video? Honestly, it was clear what he was talking about.  But every damn day the #FakeNewsMedia has some new hit job on the @POTUS.   Why do they hate him?  It is one hit job after another for over 3 years now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodneyross51 @GeorgeTakei You can disagree with the President. You can criticize and have opinions. #NoProblemo I'm cool with that. I will just refute the lies I see. We can disagree on emotion, but not the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TDS sufferers always change the subject when proven wrong.  The point seems to be that since they THINK the President #lies, then it is #OK to tell lies about the President.    That is not how #Integrity works, BTW.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The most #hilarious thing about this tweet, written to refute me, is that it puts quotes around a phrase  I DID NOT SAY.

<|startoftext|>@rodneyross51 @GeorgeTakei Truth is integrity. But you knew that. Funny, you just tried to twist  my words as George did to the President. #StrawmanFallacy is weak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iam_sagua @BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei Oh dear lord.  Is English your second language? I never claimed he said the word "recorded". But it is obvious that testing creates a "record" of the cases.   Understand now?  https://t.co/nO0TI9U21Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iam_sagua @BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei Context of the conversation, which of course indicated the President was speaking of recorded cases going up due to higher testing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesFine2 @GeorgeTakei you've obviously NOT watched the actual exchange, but are willing to come at me over a clipped quote on twitter.  So, I stand by the assessment that I see the problem here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradleyNAnders1 @GeorgeTakei OH REALLY?  Everything I said in my original response to George was scientifically sound, and information that both Fauci and Birx have admitted publicly. In fact, Birx recently told reporters... "No, asymptomatic people do NOT need to be regularly tested."   You need a new hobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodneyross51 @GeorgeTakei One man's clipped, out of context #lie is candy to all the idiot #TDS sufferers out there, sweetie. It is called "INTEGRITY". Get some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigmataBlues @GeorgeTakei Oh Jeebus.  So since I watched the actual footage and understood the conversation in context...I must be "under Trump's ass"  Mkay.   This is why people click the block button, right?  https://t.co/qrlkSu4gND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesFine2 @GeorgeTakei Oh good grief.  Just watch the actual video.  The truth of the conversation and what our President said is readily apparent to anyone with an ounce of integrity.   Oh wait, I think I see the problem here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnorlin @GeorgeTakei The point is, being a liar who clips quotes out of context to pretend they mean something completely different than what they TRULY did...is what #FakeNews does best. George needs a new hobby.  You may, too, Chris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigmataBlues @GeorgeTakei Nothing depraved about what he said.  Ya'll need a new hobby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodneyross51 @GeorgeTakei No, we just correct the #FakeNews that people like George are constantly spewing because they hate our President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CO1969 @GeorgeTakei Ask Georgie how it feels to be revealed to be a professional #TDS sufferer. I fear no accountability, Chrissy, since I'm not a pathetic  hate-filled liar pretending the President said something he obviously did not.  https://t.co/Gv6YJqykU5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei Only because media clips out context to pretend he said something else.  Ya'll need a new hobby.   This one (hating Trump so much you'll lie to attack him)  Is beyond pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heartdocotfried @BadcrumbleRJH @GeorgeTakei He did say what he meant.   In context it was obvious. But Georgie pathetically clips it to smear @POTUS. LOL.  Ya'll need a new hobby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei He meant recorded cases. But you knew that. it is a good point since the media obsession with testing is for the purpose of scaring the public.   This virus is highly contagious.  Many have had it and recovered, most likely.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngelsFrank @KellyannePolls @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNNSotu @jaketapper @JoeBiden No corroborating evidence of  Ms. Carrol's claims exists.    How many claims of rape against Joe are there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "liberal" man probably calls himself a feminist, and is pretending to white knight for women on the topic of rape.  But he denies the existence of all the #TaraReade evidence, while abusing a woman he just met.   #Hypocrite<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We are actually well below the lowest model estimates, but this guy is laughing about death, hoping it will be high, because he wants it to be Trump's "fault". These people are sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebtoh @CNN First, Sebastian.  You say "haha" in anticipation of high death?  WTFH is wrong with you?  Second, we are far below the original estimates from Fauci and Birx's models which predicted 2.2 million possible deaths. So you are wrong, twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Cool story, bro. But his estimates still beat the flawed "models" given to him by the experts whom you fawn over. It almost seems like you will twist anything to smear the President. Nah, you wouldn't do that... #FakeNewsAlert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chuckie has no idea that those strategies are in the hands of the governors, or that our President just had a call with all 50 LAST WEEK on this subject.    You can sit down, now, Chuck.   @POTUS has this handled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Horseshit, Chuckie.   On the last call with all governors, our President and the task force team assured them that supplies to meet their needs are already on the way. Just like ventilators, you are wrong on this one, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When faced with the truth that #JoeBiden is credibly accused by a victim whose corroborating evidence is pages long, some refuse to look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelsFrank @KellyannePolls @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNNSotu @jaketapper @JoeBiden There is no reason to take Ms. Carrol seriously. She went on a book-selling junket, flirted on air with  Anderson Cooper, and tried to cash in on a story.   #Yawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelsFrank @KellyannePolls @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNNSotu @jaketapper @JoeBiden Please.  DYK that secret service follows behind every POTUS since the 1980's making sure DNA is not left behind on any glass or tissue touched?

<|startoftext|>@ai_jared or enjoy pissing with the wind...LOL!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like always, this chick smears me and blocks me within seconds.  No integrity in these people at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, now synonyms are a problem?   Why? Because #TDS that is why.   I can't even with people anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalquette @xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS Vitamin C is used in hospitals for disinfecting sepsis patients.  It saves lives, and does indeed disinfect the blood.   I suggest to you that #TDS is harder to cure, my dear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalquette @xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS Yes, thanks.   Nothing wrong with any of it.  He brought to the attention new tech being tested by a Colorado company to disinfect using light inside the lungs.  "Aytu healight"  i think it is called.  Exciting stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalquette @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS I'm sure you've taken antibiotics in your lifetime. They are a disinfectant. So just stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalquette @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS YES, it certainly is.   Nothing he said was incorrect. He never lied, he brainstormed with the doctors.   His ability to think ahead has revolutionized the ventilator industry to the point that we now can supply the world. I am thankful 4 all these qualities in our @POTUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revolver909 @TVNewsHQ @johnrobertsFox Yeah, just like antibiotics disinfect you. Ya'll are a bunch of geniuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton You still collecting money while pretending to  "fight" these diseases?   #Haiti is still wondering --where the aid to rebuild their island after the Earthquake went? #ClintonFoundation paid for @ChelseaClinton 's wedding dress.

<|startoftext|>@chalquette @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS People use the word sarcastic to mean funny &amp; playful sometimes.  It is sad that our @POTUS is fighting to get the latest medical innovations out to the public &amp; the media is fighting him every step of the way!  Why would they want to keep these breakthroughs from Americans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS @realDonaldTrump There was nothing wrong with what he said. He was right about all of it. But maybe he was being sarcastic in terms of humor. Who knows?  That is his style sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS No one denied he said it.   I'm proud he said it.  He is right about all of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thinkiamfunny @xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS LOL. The problem appears to be one of comprehension of his words. The willfull desire to smear the President when his ideas are fine. (To twist his words. You do it all the time.) He may not have known the therapies he spoke of already existed. But they do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2GuysView @thehill Exactly right.  Funniest thing is...both ideas already exist in medicine.  (UV light therapy is real...already.) Injectable "disinfectants"...yep...we have those too.   (Vitamin C has been shown to have strong action and is used in sepsis these days.)  #ThankYouMrPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Injectable "disinfectant" is already medically used in oncology cases.  (Medical grade hydrogen peroxide)  And no, @POTUS never suggested Americans run experiments on household cleaners at home.  #Duh Your lies are beyond pathetic these days, #FakeNewsMedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xxjacquesxx @7of945443833 @ScottPresler @JoeBiden @POTUS Hydrogen peroxide therapy is used in oncology all the time  It "disinfects" the body.

<|startoftext|>@das_kaushik @Jodi09935519 @BKPragmat @HillaryClinton Kaushik, Hillary sent SAP classified via an unsecured server.

<|startoftext|>@weijia For all of your ridiculous attempts to trick @realDonaldTrump  into saying something  controversial,  THIS is the worst thing you could get him to say. You poor little troll. You even suck at being #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS By the way, I voted for Obama twice,  so keep your foolish assumptions about me to yourself. I dislike Obama now because of the facts of the #CrossfireHurricane scandal of spying on the candidate during the 2016 election. But that is another convo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS In this case, the technology was biological in nature. They were going back to Wuhan after paying a professor at Harvard to pretend they were students when they were really military. Those are all facts.   Ignore them at your own peril.  Most of us are awake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I haven't put forth conspiracy theory. I have pointed out conspiracy fact. The Harvard professor was taking huge payments--  that he failed to disclose to our govt.   One of the "fake students" was caught smuggling vials of biologicals to China.   That should concern all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS You'll have ask them why they would be so sneaky about their student status (they lied.  they were actually military) and why the Harvard professor was hiding his payoffs?   So could this be a military operation?   Your guess is as good as mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS You'll have to ask them.  But the story is true, and worthy of investigation.   https://t.co/lrCbsSV1f1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twacker1 @JustJoeKing13 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Perhaps it was seeded here?  That would explain. Not such a leap, either.  One of the two Chinese nationals who worked with that arrested Harvard professor were caught with vials of biologicals when leaving this country.  They were from Wuhan lab.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustJoeKing13 @twacker1 @PlaysTrumpCard @RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Thanks. I already conceded that fair point that 20,000 was my misreading of the Reuters article.

<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So this does not concern you that he signed off on this fun creation of bio-weaponry?  LOL!!  https://t.co/ge77ASFN0d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Does the Obama's administration payment to the Wuhan lab not concern you?  2015 3.7 million is a lot of cash.  Interesting timing, too.  Isn't that when the illegal FBI #CrossFireHurricane  started?    hmmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi He paid for it. 3.7 million to the Wuhan bio-weapons lab from the Obama administration in 2015.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Not true.  It was about saving lives.   Two million saved according to the Fauci  and Birx models.  #ThankYouMrPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So you think Americans should be left to die in a foreign pandemic?  #Yikes.  That's blooming ugly for such a sweet flower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Obama paid China to create the virus.   3.7 million. Fact check that.  :)  Hey it was fun chatting, flower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I quoted an article wrong, and admitted my error. I don't hate Obama.  I never blamed him for the deaths swine flu caused.  So, I'm nothing like you, flower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Sure, sweetie.   Obama just FUNDED the Coronavirus research in Wuhan to the tune of 3.7 million.   #MuchBetter to help create the virus....I guess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi The "hoax" was all the lies ya'll tell about him  being "racist" for closing travel.   LOL!   He never called the virus a hoax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Hey, nobody was reporting every time Obama sneezed during swine flu, so nobody knew.  The media--and georgie--hate President trump, so they gloss over Obama's failures to attack Trump.  Feel better, guys. Partisan hate during a pandemic is sad stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Yep, he waited to declare an emergency until after 1000 Americans were DEAD and 20,000 in hospital. Great response by Obama, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Yeah, and waiting until 1000 are DEAD was pretty dangerous, doncha think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevCia @MalkavianZinnia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Yes, I've already conceded fewer deaths.

<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Obama did not declare an emergency until after 20,000 Americans had died of swine flu.

<|startoftext|>@MalkavianZinnia @StevCia @MichMG22 @Lrihendry @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi 20,000 died of swine flu before the media or Obama made any big deal about it.  Nobody stormed the white house.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course she sees this through a racial lens.   That reporter was rude...nothing to do with gender or race. @AmbassadorRice is the racist here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBEsq @real_defender @realDonaldTrump He never called the virus a hoax.   The hoaxes have always been the pile of lies you  keep telling about him. And here you are trying to lie about our President again. #shame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @realDonaldTrump @jack Two full days of hate.  Gleefully proclaiming doom is coming my way.  YES-- WITCH is being kind. But have a great night anyway. You could repent of this evil.   I pray you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gina4DJT2020 @POTUS Yeah, she sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS It must be painful to be that hateful. Get well soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the ugliness directed at anyone who dares to say they "support the President of the United states. @realDonaldTrump  "Good Luck" this hateful witch says while gleefully telling me that (in her opinion) I will be "needing it."

<|startoftext|>@ShartsvilleGal @MrJones_tm Someone who beat an addiction is not worthy of respect in your opinion?  With the opioid crisis, one would expect a more educated point of view from a "liberal".   But I know.

<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS  https://t.co/KmRC3SjxSR  The Chinese tests are "useless". Several countries threw thousands of Chinese tests in the trash last week after discovering that their failure rate was high. Obviously, making tests ourselves (local supply chain) was a #genius idea of our President<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Every one of those things made a positive difference.   Hating Trump should not mean cheering on a virus. You people are nuts.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJ_Lena @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi DJ, did you REALLY just type "Hahah" at the idea of lives being lost? JEEBUS.  You are sick.

<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS President TODAY discussed new tests which take 15 minutes.  Pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I have never said anything like that.   EVER.   Nice #strawman ya built there.   Our President is currently a "man".   #DealWithIt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS So by calling him a "man"  &lt;---  you jump   to switch to a chat on gender. Hey, #SeemsLegit  and not completely weird at all. Nice chatting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS The tests which existed had to be re-designed. NOW, the new test yields results in minutes, not days. We are using the new tests now at record pace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpiritedIdeals @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi If we had not been led by a man, @realDonaldTrump , who closed down travel from China so quickly, those numbers would have been much more terrifying.
