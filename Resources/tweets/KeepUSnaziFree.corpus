<|startoftext|>@Mountaind3w @Awood732 @LalalaSilly @GregCfollows @atthebeach9 @ScottforFlorida @CoryBooker Maybe take some of those principles to gun ownership.

<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan I did not feel safe or free, and I am afraid our great country is heading in that direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan God, it would be like living in the Wild West.  That doesn‚Äôt make me feel safer it makes me feel like I am in a third world country.  I have been to one, the police rode around with machine guns in the back of their trucks and security guards with guns stood outside of my resort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan They don‚Äôt have the numbers, it takes time to load a rifle.  A high powered gun can shoot (depending on the size of the magazine) 30-100 rounds in what a minute/minutes depending how fast you can pull the trigger.  Look I‚Äôm know they are fun to shoot but is it really worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan It should not be a problem, yet every other day there is a shooting.  Something needs to change.  I like going to concerts and sending my kids to school.  It‚Äôs stupid to think that not doing anything is going to stop it from happening again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan We should ban people from having that kind of gun power.  Why do we need guns like that outside of the military.  I am fine with people having hunting guns or a handgun that they can use responsibly and lock up from children or other people.  With the technology we have today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan It‚Äôs only slightly different.  The military just calls it something different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGraviter @MarcVegan Like I first retweeted, the whole point of the tweet was an article about surgeons having a hard time trying to repair high power rifle ‚Äúwounds‚Äù while keep the patients alive.  The only places that they had previously seen such carnage was when they served in the military.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan What do you think animals eat? Feed that is farmed. The more animals the more farmland, water, and gas fueled farm equipment to harvest it.  An animal has to eat a lot of feed to produce a relative some amount of meat. It is more environmentally friendly to directly eat veggies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@twitweeting Happy 96th Birthday!üéä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Oh and I never killed anything.  I became a vegetarian after hunting with my dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Okay, if you can use it responsibly then fine.  I was that girl with deer rifle instead of the AR-15.  My parents locked up their guns.  I would have never taken one out on my own.  I just want people to use common sense with guns.  They are made to kill and should be respected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankySpaas @MarcVegan You will never have to use them for that purpose.  I hope you keep them locked up.  School shooters take their parents or friends guns.  Domestic abuses usually end up shooting their victim.   #GunSense makes sense, not doing anything allows people to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan My husband said a hunting rifle is designed to go through a deer without destroying the meat.  AR-15 bullets are designed to spin in the body and destroy an area, which would destroy the meat.  He said the only use for a AR-15 is to kill humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Skarekroww @Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan I have to be a certain age to drive a car, pass tests, keep insurance, wear a seat-belt, bring it every year to get inspected and re-registered.  Obey and the rules while driving and if I break those rules I can get a ticket or go to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan What proven measures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Handguns don‚Äôt cause as much damage internally.  Unless it has large bullets.  AR-15 bullets are able to do so much more damage because of the speed of the bullet.  It is designed to tear up people from the inside with just one bullet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan My first grader has shooter drills at school.  Which means my baby girl has to worry about getting shot while she is at school.  Now I don‚Äôt know if you have kids but it makes me a little emotional.  I am getting tired of guns being defended more than children‚Äôs lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Whitman was 1966, I little out of date and character for modern day shooters. I know they all don‚Äôt use AR-15s but it is a preferred weapon of the bloody thirsty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Emotion...that‚Äôs what I feel when I hear of people dying from gun wounds.  We can just ban all guns.  I would be fine with that.  I have kids, they are statically more safe without guns in our house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan  https://t.co/hSqTs6uzZP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordnance_Corner @MarcVegan Did you read the article?  You can ask the surgeons treating AR-15 victims if they feel the same way.  I never hear of a school shooter using a deer rifle. At 13, I took and aced my hunters safely course.  I respect the power of a gun.  It‚Äôs also the reason I do not own a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcVegan AR-15‚Äôs are designed to kill people.  We should ban guns that for almost certain will kill the victim.  I don‚Äôt care if they are ‚Äúfun‚Äù to shoot they have no place in civilian life.  I feel bad for the victims and the medical teams that have to witness the carnage.   #GunSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@satanicpsalms I went to Catholic school, if you want your kids to learn about ‚Äúgod‚Äù send them to a religious school.

<|startoftext|>@Savagesooner1 @ABC A huge racist, you feel okay with separating families?  Mothers from their babies?  The law is inhuman and cruel.  Americans are immigrants (unless your a Native American, and you see how they were treated).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Savagesooner1 @ABC Oh yeah, dude.  That is a stupid, one-sided argument.  These people are coming to the country seeking asylum.  That means they are trying to follow the law.  Your great leader wants to punish anyone trying to become Americans from the south because he is racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob_Rogers @realDonaldTrump He would do it, and all his little #MAGA followers would be like ‚Äúthis is the stupid liberals fault, or Obama, or Hillary, or Democrats anyone but Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC How much is this costing tax payers?
