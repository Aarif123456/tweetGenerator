<|startoftext|>Today's terrifying situation;  At new home, old floorings been removed in hallway &amp; noticed a dark red stain on the floor and when I followed the stain there's dark red spots up the wall by the airing cupboard  I'm calling the landlord to find out why did the old tenant moved out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son is being tested for autism/ADHD, has speech therapy for delayed speech and needs to be in his schools nurture group &amp; I get so sick of the parents of neurotypical kids saying s*** to me like "why doesn't my kid get rewards for talking &amp; doing basic things?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugs me when parents of neurotypical kids try to invalidate the achievements of neurodiverse kids. By saying s*** like "my son always sits still in class he doesn't need a sticker to reward him for it", "my kid has been talking for years they don't need a certificate for it" etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastieOaks I only watch Hollyoaks but it's a 3 way tie with;  Silas' return Nico returning as liberty's hallucination And Perri &amp; Juliet getting together.

<|startoftext|>Things I'm sick of people doing to people with a mental illness;   - making fake "mental health concerns" whenever a person with a mental illness reacts to their bulls***  - talking to them like they're stupid   - treating them like a child  - giving them no independence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Single parent problems;  Parent; *needs to go to hospital*  hmmm I'll call an ambulance after I've found someone who's available to babysit on short notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son needs antibiotic eyedrops for a week, I managed to get the infection diagnosed and start his eyedrops the day after symptoms appeared so thankfully I can nip it in the bud before it gets too uncomfortable for him.

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews The LGBT community needs to stop gatekeeping and infighting. A bi/pan person who is dating someone of a different gender is still bi/pan and still valid, a same sex couple who are in an open relationship with people of a different gender are still valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually don't think I'm capable of feeling anything other than resentment anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope someone helps this poor animal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate my PTSD medication and I hate my therapy, it's like I don't even have control over my own mind anymore as I have to have therapy because apparently "there's no other way to recover without it" and I have to be doped up on pills that make me feel like a fat zombie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Why did no one stop to let the dog in the car and instead chose to have them run 6miles alongside it? The dog could've been hit by a car or seriously hurt. A dog running 6miles alongside their owners car with no one stopping to help them isn't cute it's animal abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no such thing as a "trans debate" as what's there to debate?  Debate question; Are they a living being? Answer; Yes Okay debate over they deserve rights. 🤦🏻‍♂️  Trans people are human so therefore deserve the same human rights as everyone else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stormrosewriter Every child learns at their own pace, you can't compare children as every child is unique, there's no set age for people to be able to things they'll do it when they're ready.

<|startoftext|>My son's being tested for autism/ADHD due to his behavioural issues &amp; violent meltdowns &amp; he went out in his elf Christmas hoodie today &amp; people kept getting up in his face asking him questions about it, fiddling with his hoodie etc &amp; it triggered an horrific public meltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important;  If you see a family &amp; their kids are wearing Christmas jumpers/costumes please don't just walk up to the child &amp; start fiddling with their jumper/costume or getting in their face asking questions If the child has behavioural issues/autism/ADHD it can trigger meltdowns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The council had workers out to do work on the water pipes on my block &amp; the water ran brown for a few days &amp; when it went back clear they reassured us all it's now safe to use/drink but now there's a bacterial throat infection &amp; severe mouth ulcers outbreaks just on my block?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline That's bizarre and wrong on so many levels, if they insisted on tackling waste in a controlling way they could've thought of a different way like I dunno have a specific amount of the toilet roll dispensed for free then they have to pay for anything extra they use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important;  Sexual harassment at gigs or festivals is NOT "just part of the experience" or "should be expected" it's still sexual harassment &amp; still needs to be reported, u shouldn't have to "let it slide" it's ur body &amp; no one has the right to sexually harass you #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really 2020? However this is actually a very interesting article and for some people this will be the first time people have learned about the genocide in the early 20th century, so is worth a read as it's a part of history that was left out the history books in school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normally I think perfume ads are bizarre and make no sense regarding what they're advertising but I love the @CHANEL No.5 perfume ad, I think the dance routine with the music works really well together &amp; the gold colour scheme in the ad compliments the colour of the perfume.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is #BorisJohnson freaking kidding me with the bulls*** that stores are allowed to be open for 24hours a day when second lockdown ends but parents like myself aren't allowed to attend their children's school Christmas plays?   #COVID19 #BorisJohnsonMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GwenLawton1 @SkyNews I'm not an anti vaxxer, I'm just worried as this is a new vaccine so we can't know the long term side effects of it before it's rolled out to the public but at the same time all vaccines were new at one point &amp; didn't know the long term side effects but now they're routine so 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 has been a totally s*** year but at least @realDonaldTrump lost the US election and @cher rescued an elephant so this year hasn't been all bad. ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My mom's got #COVID19 again, she claimed she had it in February but now she's claiming that was just a lung infection &amp; apparently she's definitely got it this time I don't know what to believe as in Feb she specifically asked my loved one to tell me &amp; now she's done same again<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @BuddCharlotte Simply; the courts need to start listening to the children, the courts need to educate themselves on the signs that the child is being used as a weapon by the abusive parent &amp; educate themselves on court harassment by the abuser &amp; the signs of court harassment #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @BuddCharlotte From experience judges in family courts think it's best for a child to have contact with both parents especially if the child is biracial as they want the child to learn about both sides of their race/culture but in extreme cases the judge will rule no direct contact #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline - on the day you plan to escape give a trusted loved one a time to call/text you &amp; ask them to call the police if u don't answer them within a specific time frame in case your escape plans gone wrong.  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline When trying to leave: - make sure someone u trust knows the address of your abuser &amp; place u're going after escaping in case police need to be called  - if u need to call the police tell them ur location FIRST so if ur abuser cuts off the call they can find u #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline When escaping; - if you don't know what to do immediately after you've escaped or you got injured whilst trying to escape go to a hospital &amp; tell me what's happened they'll help you  - if you're staying in a hotel when you check in ask to be put as 'unlisted' #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline My advice to people thinking of escaping; - Make a plan - reach out for help to either police, a trusted loved one or an organisation - put a plan in place to make sure your kids/pets can leave with you  - try to get a no contact order against them asap  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline There are more advertisements online and posted around with numbers for helplines on to help victims of abuse get help #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Lockdown has put more barriers in place for victims to escape as the economy has taken a nosedive and unemployment is increasing so it makes it significantly harder financially for victims to escape, it's a nightmare moving during lockdown so harder to get a new home #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Barriers that prevented me escaping;  My abuser had the keys to get the door of the spare room unlocked, He bled my finances so even when I escaped I was unable to afford to go home as I lived 3hour bus ride from him, I was brainwashed to be too afraid to tell anyone #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't want to eat,  Just want to sleep all the time, Keep crying randomly it's doing my head in, Whenever I talk about it I'm accused of attention seeking, And Just want to be left alone.   Depression is fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo Actually transphobic but saying "oh I couldn't tell they were trans" when they find out someone is transgender, they're basically saying they think trans people are ugly and can't pass regardless of transitioning so should be obvious to spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo This is actually transphobic but when a person will correct themselves when they accidentally misgender your pet but when they misgender you &amp; you correct them they start claiming &amp; debating that your pronouns are confusing etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo When you come out and your loved ones say stuff like "I support you just keep it to yourself when you're around me"   And transphobic version "I support you but as long as you dress as *your assigned gender at birth* when you're around me"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo Saying "I thought she was a lesbian" whenever they find out an athletic/muscular woman is heterosexual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo Claiming gay people get "the gay accent" when they come out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocallhomo Being blatantly homophobic then claiming "I'm not homophobic I have a gay friend"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covidiots are doing my head in whining about wearing masks &amp; how uncomfortable it is, they want to talk about discomfort? My nonverbal 4year old has tonsillitis &amp; couldn't communicate with me he was in pain, had bowel condition flare up &amp; put on 3 different meds at the same time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's responding really well to his antibiotics and his pain relief. He couldn't even stand up unsupported yesterday he was so drowsy but after being put on pain relief and given fluids at the hospital he improved almost instantly. So fingers crossed he continues to improve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's got severe tonsillitis and is being put on antibiotics and pain relief so he's able to eat and drink, his fevers finally down and stable &amp; he's no longer dehydrated. I'm just shocked I didn't know tonsillitis could be so serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Me; *posts update about my sick son on Facebook*  Cousin: maybe you should be a *parent* and take your son to the hospital instead of posting it on @Facebook   Me: clearly he's recieving hospital treatment hence why he's being treated by dr's &amp; nurses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the f*** is letting off fireworks at 3:30pm on a Saturday? WTAF it's still light out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of people saying #COVID19 will ruin Christmas &amp; it might be cancelled. Christmas isn't about materialistic crap its a celebration whether for religious reasons or for being with the people we love, so instead of whining, order gifts online &amp; just have Christmas over zoom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This! I have PTSD from being in an abusive relationship and it was made worse after diagnosis by suffering a miscarriage with my 2nd child &amp; being raped by a friend months later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Gifts shouldn't come with terms and conditions and honestly she should've thought of what would've happened if he won any money off them before she gave them to him, also never buy someone lottery tickets or scratch cards as gifts as it never ends well if they win big.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline As long as they're happy and love each other who cares how they proposed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ayytlien Me too I thought I was the only one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts Keeping my kids off school when they're sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kerstintalks Jason Derulo, girl in my class wasn't invited by her friends to the gig so her mom ordered her tickets to go on her own &amp; she bought a ticket for me to use me to make them jealous as I was that person in school who is friends with everyone but prefers to bounce between cliques<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's new medication has worked, his bowel blockage has been cleared now thankfully without manual removal &amp; holy s*** did it unblock, I had to shout for help as he was doubled over in agony complaining his belly was burning &amp; he went pale &amp; sweating but he's recovering now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact his victims were prostitutes doesn't make his crimes any less heinous, they didn't deserve to die, no one deserves to die that whether they were prostitutes or lawyers it doesn't invalidate their trauma #PeterSutcliffe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As women are campaigning to make sexual harassment illegal at events etc can people make it illegal for women to throw their underwear on stage during events? Its still sexual harassment &amp; throwing often dirty underwear at performers isn't a compliment it's disgusting 🤮 #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when I see posts about "a girl got dumped the first time her boyfriend saw her without makeup, I think he was right what do you think?"

<|startoftext|>@Kieronfanx I loved their scenes they made me cry it was so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter;  Her: *blocks path &amp; me &amp; my son can't get passed*   Me: *checks its safe &amp; we walk in the road around her*  Her: *makes nasty dig on my parenting for walking in the road *   Me: eurgh it must be so hard living ur life with ur head that far up ur arse🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is the first time I've been able to wash my hair since November 2nd as I've been too busy taking care of my sick son &amp; moving home so yeah I'm very happy about that as my hair looks amazing now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of people telling me "ur son doesn't look sick", "he doesn't sound sick" etc 1) my son has a bowel condition so they're not going to be able to see it, 2) just because he's sick doesn't mean he can't be happy &amp; 3) I'm trying to make my son happy &amp; laugh whilst he's sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate the toxic positivity BS "u just need to learn a persons behaviour towards u has more to do with their own struggles &amp; not u, so don't react" yeah...no if guy with unresolved issues decides to beat on me I'm not going to let him hit me, I'm going to fight back &amp; defend myself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been on phone to dr's and hospital today about my son and he's having his medication and doseage changed AGAIN, got to get his medication tomorrow, if he starts deteriorating again I need to take him to the hospital immediately &amp; I'm exhausted I'm so freaking exhausted I'm tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cant get my son a dr's appointment because of second lockdown no one is accepting appointments so asked his health visitor to help book him into the drs, my son's been ill for a week now he needs to see a Dr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marsipanda @stormrosewriter Me too, no matter how rational and in control people feel, everyone has been affected by pandemic panic so I don't want people to rush out a vaccine out of panic and accidentally overlook something important about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stormrosewriter I'll let others go first and wait a bit as honestly I get that it has to undergo rigorous testing &amp; checks etc before it can be given to the public but at the same time it feels like countries are rushing to make a vaccine simply to feed their egos &amp; say they made the vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Son broke my mobile by randomly snatching it off me and throwing it across the living room, I've fixed it but the screen is cracked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooohhh  seems like PC Kiss has a sinister side #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nerdiest thing me &amp; my son have ever done;  Dressed up with our pokeball toys and our plushies of our favourite pokemon as our pokemon buddies and played Pokémon up the park instead of just playing PokémonGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Children's clothes are necessities though as children get through clothes &amp; shoes (especially school type shoes) very fast either through having growth spurts or wear &amp; tear/stains/scuffs as kids are extremely active<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry if bringing up #aidenhatfield triggers anyone but sick of people who still support him claiming they "hope he gets the help/support he needs after his behaviour"  No just no! What he did wasn't an erratic mental health episode, it was calculated &amp; he knew it was wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting article in relation to what #aidenhatfield did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of people feel this way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of people saying people should build bridges with Trump Supporters, no just no those assholes were supporting a president who was trying to take away people's rights, f*** building bridges instead burn bridges with loved ones who still support Trump &amp; everything he stood for<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Family member: *shows up uninvited at old house yesterday to hit me &amp; calls me slurs*  Brother: *today* u 2 haven't got along for ages it was bound to happen   Me: it wasn't 2 people not getting along, he beat me for being lgbt, it was a hate crime!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got such an overwhelmingly bad headache from being hit yesterday &amp; have to have my nose checked as the side of my nose where I got hit keeps making a weird noise/feeling whenever I breathe &amp; apparently the assholes calling me a liar claiming I hit myself to get him in trouble. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why I'm so excited about this but just made my first rent payment for my new home!!!! Dipped into my savings though so I could pay double so I've paid my next rent payment in advance just in case Lockdown 2.0 is extended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree to an extent with @BorisJohnson that clothes are non essential items but children's clothes are always necessities as kids have growth spurts regularly and their shoes especially their school shoes need replacing regularly so kids clothes should be classed as necessities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly not entirely sure how bad my injuries are as yeah I hit my abdomen when I fell but I'm also on my period so I don't know what extent of the bleeding and pain is period related &amp; what is caused by the abdominal injuries, I do know my rib cages hurts though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a black eye by an asshole who legally shouldn't have been at the old house because he's awaiting results of his Covid-19 test after showing symptoms. So yeh got a black eye, cut forehead, bust lip &amp; bad bruising, I hit him 1st time he lunged at me but 2nd time not so lucky.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kieronfanx Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harm that Section 28 caused to me, an #LGBT person;  - realising as a child I had a same sex crush and feeling confused about my gender but being unable to talk to anyone about it as people "weren't supposed to talk to kids about that" so I had to bottle it up &amp; surpress it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harm that Section 28 caused to me, an #LGBT person;   - being taught by my parents as a child that if an adult or older kid tried to tell me about "gay issues" I had to tell an adult or teacher straight away because adults weren't supposed to talk to kids about that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harm that Section 28 caused to me, an #LGBT person;  - when I had my 1st same sex crush aged 4 I felt ashamed because I was told girls weren't supposed to like girls &amp; boys weren't supposed to like boys and it was wrong if we did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cesar_Teixeira_ Clearly they're in denial about the harm Section 28 did to people and even though it was overturned years ago LGBT people are still unlearning the damage it caused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kerstintalks This looks like what happens when you do mushrooms whilst watching The Simpsons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the things that makes #sophielancaster 's murder so shocking is that it happened in 2007, when you hear about someone being murdered for being alternative you wouldn't think that it happened in the 21st century but it did it happened not that long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #britainsdeadliestkids and honestly don't think I'll ever be able to see a documentary about #sophielancaster that doesn't make me cry, I just still can't believe they did that to her, they killed her for being different, she didn't deserve it, no one does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kieronfanx Me too, I've missed Ste in Hollyoaks, when I saw him I was like "oh my gosh Ste's back" I didn't care about what he'd done in his previous storylines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in the UK and the fear I've felt for the members of the LGBT community who live in the USA during Trump's presidency has been sickening, seeing the LGBT community losing their rights overseas has terrified me knowing the same could happen to the #LGBT community here too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too Donald Trump has spread more fake news during his presidency than Fox News has in 24years. #deleteTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts They chose England really? Clearly they haven't heard about how Boris Johnson's handled this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's shows how much @realDonaldTrump f***ed up leading his country when people in pretty much every other country on this planet are celebrating the fact he's lost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now @realDonaldTrump  is no longer president can @Twitter please delete his account for all the hate speech, fake news and Covid-19 misinformation he's spread throughout his presidency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo Donald Trump's public and twitter tantrums during this election are freaking hilarious, my 4year old son doesn't have tantrums this bad when I tell him he's not allowed cake before dinner he just hides all the toilet paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun #DonaldTrump having public tantrums during this election is freaking hilarious, my 4year old son doesn't have tantrums this bad when I tell him he can't have cake before dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews How hateful must he be to believe that punishing people who spew hate &amp; fuel prejudices is a reason not to vote for someone? His arguement against Biden is just reassuring the people who voted for Biden that they made the right decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A side to sexual harassment people don't see is when a person's sexually harassed in front of their children &amp; the parent has to have "the talk" with their children when they get home about how it's never okay to sexually harass people &amp; why the creeps behaviour was wrong #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts It's called fawning, it's nothing to regret or be ashamed of it's just your brain trying to diffuse the situation by fawning &amp; pleasing that person. Its part of the fight or flight response, it actually consists of 4 parts fight flight freeze fawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Can they do research to see how many of his LGBT voters are terfs?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't catch a break, my son finally passed his bowel blockage hooray...and then he had a violent meltdown, dumped his drink across the floor &amp; when I was going to get the mop slipped on the drink &amp; cracked his head off the floor, he's now got a sickening lump on his head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If u were financially abused &amp; it's negatively impacted ur credit score after u've left the abuse, go to ur bank, tell them the situation &amp; ask if there's any accounts u'd be eligible for that can help u rebuild ur credit score &amp; manage ur finances.  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dysphoria sucks; just feel like a fat girl who's fooling no one and not a dude. I hate this, don't want to go out, don't want to see anyone, meant to be picking up my PTSD meds today and can't be bothered as my son's off school sick so not like I have to go out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to feel guilty that I keep complaining about stressful s*** to do with moving home when there's people who are homeless &amp; don't have anywhere to live &amp; Im bitching because I'm spending second Lockdown at my old home whilst I sort out s*** at my new home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second Lockdown has f***ed up my move, my new furniture can't be delivered to my new home &amp; can't set up the broadband until December due to lockdown restrictions, so I have a home with old furniture &amp; WiFi but no stuff &amp; a home with stuff but no flooring/WiFi/furniture until Dec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLionHeart Yeah society is f***ed up when people are more concerned with people breaching Covid-19 restrictions than arresting rapists &amp; murderers, someone doesn't wear a mask on a bus people intervene but a woman is getting attacked in a park &amp; people just walk past &amp; ignore it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLionHeart Are you f***ing kidding me? They arrested a woman for that?! There's a known rapist who works at a store in my hometown his boss knows what he did as someone contacted them letting them know what he'd done &amp; they refused to fire him on the grounds he was never arrested for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if men realise when they say "she got fake tits, fake hair, fake lips yet still wants a real man" they're insulting themselves as they're basically saying in order for a woman to date them she shouldnt value herself enough to want to put effort into her appearance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brain when my son's sick;  What if it's an unknown allergy? What if it's Covid-19? What if I was too rough with him when we were playing &amp; I've injured him internally? What if it's undiagnosed complications from that fall he had 3 years ago? What if? What IF?! WHAT IF?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I've got 2 ongoing stalkers 1) a work colleague I rejected in 08/2015 and 2) an elderly guy I rejected in 11/2018 The police got involved when I feared for my safety but I realised it was stalking when within a few days of rejecting them &amp; the first incident occured #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline From experience of being stalked for 5yrs stalking becomes criminal;  - When it becomes threatening - their stalking starts to include ur children  - Interferes with a court case (family court in my case) - they harm u/ur loved ones - showing up at schools/playgrounds  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline From my own experience of stalking pt2; - convincing themselves they should've been the parent of your children &amp; not their actual parent - putting flowers on your loved ones grave  - claiming u slept together when u didn't  - threatening to harm u/ur loved ones #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline From my own experience of stalking pt1; - harassment online, creating new accounts when blocked, using ur email to sign up for spam sites - following you places in real life, looking through your windows, showing up everywhere u go - harassing your loved ones online #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Son's been checked out &amp; been given a stronger dose of his medication, he's finally drank, ate and finally pee-ed he's still pale though but he's fell asleep now but he's drooling a lot, he's being made to sleep on disposable sheets to soak up his bowel leakage but he's improving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really scared. My son's not well at all, he fell asleep on the bus today after complaining he felt sick, when we got to our new home he fell asleep on the floor using my backpack as a pillow, is refusing to drink anything, hasn't pee-ed at all today, has diarrhoea &amp; is pale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my son's bowel condition flare up is suspected as being diarrhoea caused by something else and not a flare up so this is terrifying me, I'm scared it's something serious as he's drowsy, pale, has diarrhoea &amp; is complaining he feels sick. F***ING stressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's been back at school one day and his bowel condition is already acting up again, he's been leaking like a broken sewage pipe all evening so he's not going to school tomorrow as he'll keep pooping himself in class &amp; is instead coming to our new home with me for the day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kieronfanx Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new neighbors have issues with the fact I have cats as they hate the sound of cats jumping from table to table in a home, I can't wait to tell them my son has diagnosable behavioural issues that cause him to have violent meltdowns &amp; scream so loud he sets off security alarms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been living with my son, 3 pets &amp; 2 other guys so happy that me/my son/my pets have our own place without them, not sure how I'm going to break it that as of today I no longer legally live there so they'll have to start paying the gas/electric bill themself or get cut off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I got the keys to my new home today &amp; I was so worried I wouldn't love it again but I do, cannot wait to get it decorated so I can move our crap in, got a few weeks to get it decorated &amp; set up wifi before I move my furniture in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You definitely know you're over someone you were in love with when their photo shows up on your timeline &amp; instead of feeling sad or angry you actually vomit into your own mouth &amp; because you're using your phone in a public place you have to chew it &amp; swallow it. 🤢🤮<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear parents of #lgbt kids  Telling ur LGBT child u miss the person they was before they came out is extremely harmful as u cannot begin to imagine the damage to their mental health suppressing their LGBT identity was causing, support them instead &amp; watch how happy they become<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wonder if men realise when they blame feminism for why women won't date them they're actually insulting themselves and not feminists as they're pretty much saying that a woman should have no standards, be oppressed &amp; not understand consent/abuse laws to be open to dating them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Closeted trans tip;  If you still live with people you're not out too &amp; order something online for your gender identity e.g. chest binder, packer etc Order another random item e.g bear etc that'll be delivered around same time so u can say that was in your package.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love my son but I still can't believe I pushed out a human.  The worst part about childbirth (aside from the fear of stillbirth) is the pressure when pushing the baby out, feels like they're going to shoot out like a cannonball &amp; splat up the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So signed the tenancy agreement today and been a crying wreck for the past half hour as I need to move away from the area and my family for the sake of my mental health but doesn't make it easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F***!!!!!!!!! Was meant to have sent off some paperwork for the property I'm viewing Monday by 4pm today but failed to do so as I was too busy trying to ground myself because I was distressed by that disgusting pervert who's been harassing me. I'm sending it first thing tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole animal encounter;   Me: *goes outside in the dark to throw rubbish in the outside bin*   Neighbours cat: RRREEEOOWWW!!!! *cat dives out of bin*  Me: *screams*   Neighbours cat: *nuzzles me purring*   Me: you're cute for such a freaking dumbass, girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is a prime example of why I get so angry when my dad oversteps boundaries as a grandparent, when my dad's in the house he doesn't tell my son to tidy up his previous toy he's playing with before getting another game out so the living room becomes a pig sty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pervert who's been harassing me was out in full force today, he made me miserable when I out with my son he kept wolf whistling me, making gross comments, following us EVERYWHERE etc &amp; it was upsetting my son so I flipped the pervert off &amp; I've reported him to the police...again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to move away from the area as I have to deal with the pervert who's been sexually harassing me for two years, I don't get along with my dad &amp; brother as they're anti lgbt &amp; sick of my mom sending me hateful letters so want to move to a new area they don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been offered a property, I've filled in paperwork for tenancy agreement etc viewing it again Monday &amp; if I still want it they'll give me the keys so I can move straight in. I'm so nervous something will happen &amp; I won't get it or my son won't like it as I've given him final say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *trying not to think about someone and get over them*   *Goes on Facebook*   Post on my timeline: *pic of that persons name in block capitals* I've always liked the meaning of this name, comment a name you love the meaning of.  Me: 😠😠😠😠<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 1) ear plugs/noise cancelling headphones for indoors  2) bowl of treats outside the house so kids can take them without knocking  3) sign in window saying "no trick or treaters"   4) stick to well lit areas  5) map out your route &amp; send a copy to a loved one  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I find trick or treaters knocking on the door all night &amp; the sound of fireworks triggering as f*** especially with bonfire night only a matter of days later so everywhere smells of smoke &amp; with Diwali celebrations around halloween time too there's so many fireworks #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Terfs are horrible horrible people, terfs are basically the female equivalent of fragile masculinity, they're so worried that as a cis woman their own personal feminity will be at risk if trans people have more rights they have to attack anything that makes them feel threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brody is a dirt bag for doing a runner with the kids, Brody keeps playing the victim regarding Warren when he was the person who swung the first punch at Cormac, it's not fair to liberty either she wanted to give them her baby &amp; now they're just ditching liberty #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts Extreme jealousy; It's not a compliment &amp; they're not "just scared of losing you" Was with a guy who was extremely jealous he spammed me with calls at work as I worked at a gaming company &amp; was only 1/6 women out of 200+ people at company &amp; he didn't want me speaking to other men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gngaIex #weloveyouariana  I do love Ariana Grande she's stunning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to quite a few gigs next year as I ordered tickets to gigs this year that weren't scheduled for next year anyway and a few gigs I booked tickets to at the end of 2019 for 2020 have been rescheduled to 2021.  Next year should be interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small #COVID19 problem;  When you were supposed to have gone to a gig this year but it was postponed to 2021 due to Covid-19 and unfortunately you lose respect/interest in the band &amp; now you don't want to go to the rescheduled gig next year. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bitchiest thing I've done so far;  My mom I disowned for being a hateful bigot last year keeps sending me offensive letters so I've made a label to stick on her future letters which says "return to sender, we're in the middle of a pandemic so no junk mail"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and my son are sitting on the sofa watching cartoons in matching skeleton onesies LMAO 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;   Dad; *takes my laundry out washing machine dumps it on floor &amp; fills it with his laundry he brought round*  Me: WTF dude?  Dad; ur a worthless it  Me: that's transphobic  Dad: transphobic? Oh another word to prevent people calling u mentally unstable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know if I want to do another doodle of @GregHetson or @Pelathor can't decide which was I want to doodle first but I do know the fireworks are f***ING up my #PTSD should be a stressful night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can still enjoy fireworks despite my PTSD and anxiety I just wear ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones whilst I watch them from an upstairs window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay it's that time of the year when fireworks are going off like crazy and triggering the holy hell out of my PTSD and anxiety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my first attempt at doodling Iggy Pop has been shared on his insta stories with a yes/no poll and yeah I'm nervous to click on it incase people hate it even though it was my first ever attempt at sketching him so it's obviously not going to be my best work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Had total meltdown today been going through a lot just lately &amp; accidentally forgot to take my doses of PTSD medication yesterday as I was feeling ill &amp; yeah a teenie tiny thing sent me into a total meltdown, I went from shouting at someone, to apologizing, to sobbing in seconds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the kinda person who will dress up in matching Halloween costumes with my kids and have mini photoshoots  I'm also the kinda person who won't tolerate bulls*** and will not hesitate to call people out on their s*** and threaten them with a lawsuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son loves his new bike, I also got him a small Lego set on clearance so whilst he waits for the rain to stop to try out his new bike we're building Lego cars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ayytlien Very proud of you ❤️, when it comes to mental health even the tiniest personal victories are huge progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXCITING DAY! I BOUGHT MY SON HIS FIRST PROPER BIKE!  He had his tricycle when he was a toddler but he's now got his first real bike, it's a batman bike with the bat symbol on it, didn't tell him I was buying it him so cannot wait for him to get home from school to surprise him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sluttysloff I'm so sorry you went through that, what he did was so messed up as he posed as a mental health advocate to sexually harass people &amp; what he did was an unforgivable breach of trust he preyed on people at their lowest and made them feel sh*ttier than ever before. He's vile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manifestmomryan I wish that I'll finally be able to live on a houseboat with my kids &amp; my cats so we will no longer be surrounded by people who cause me stress &amp; affect my mental health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLionHeart I love pumpkin, it's very versatile to cook with and looks really pretty on the plate too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each to their own, I'm into Dom/sub relationships I've done it &amp; loved it but Dom/subs need to be mindful of others when doing stuff like this, taking sub for a walk on a leash outside is fair enough but paddling/having them walk on all 4 in supermarket is overstepping boundaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its not ok to mimic behaviour of people with autism/ADHD/mental illness &amp; shame them about their "annoying quirks" they have no control over them, it's exhausting trying to surpress them &amp; "appear normal" on daily basis &amp; mimicking them is humiliating &amp; makes them feel threatened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that's not okay to do to people on the spectrum or with a mental illness is to mimic their behaviour to them in an attempt to shame them into seeing "how annoying their quirks are", it's a personal attack on aspects of them they have no control over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah My mum constantly criticised my weight growing up, making comments all the time I never had a visit with her or interaction with her online/over the phone that didn't end in her criticising my weight, I developed bulimia as a result but I'm recovering well since I disowned her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me; *enjoys a really nice vegan dinner*   My PTSD; I can see you've enjoyed your food would be a shame if I sky rocketed your stress levels for no reason until you threw up wouldn't it?  My brain; you wouldn't dare?  My PTSD: wouldn't I? 😈😈😈😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should've realised #charmandercommunityday was going to be awesome for me when the first charmander I caught was a shiny. Even before I used the incense lure, like I literally opened the @PokemonGoApp and the first charmander I clicked on was shiny, I caught 24 shinies in total<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #CharmanderCommunityDay was a success caught 24 shiny charmanders evolved 9 so I have all 3 sets of the evolution family, renamed 2 of my shiny charizards to X &amp; Y for future mega evolutions &amp; I bought the ticket to do the special community day research &amp; completed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so f***ING angry with my family, they've invalidated my concerns my son might be autistic his entire life, invalidated his symptoms &amp; just brushed his violent meltdowns off as "boys being boys" them called me a bad parent when I said no boys shouldn't hit their parents. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've tried to tell people since I was pregnant with my son I was concerned he'd be autistic as there's a history of autism in my mom's side of the family &amp; that there's a study linking domestic abuse during pregnancy &amp; autism but no one took my concerns seriously for over 4years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad has blamed my son's suspected autism on me, telling me my son's not autistic I'm just a worthless parent, my son's violent meltdowns are because he's being raised by a f**ING stupid c*** &amp; he's confused that he's being raised by an 'it' &amp; I don't discipline him properly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So finally approached the subject with my father of my son being referred for tests for autism/ADHD as his schools got concerns about him, yeah didn't go down well at all &amp; caused one of the worst arguements I've ever had with him that didn't end in violence or me being attacked<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Family member; u going out today?  Me; yeh I'm taking my kid to school  FM; NO NEED TO BE F***ING SARCASTIC IS THERE?!?!  Me; WTAH?!   FM; I can see u're taking ur f***ING kid to school I meant are u going out afterwards no need to be f***ING sarcastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @sally_sst @safelives_ Small gesture that meant a lot to me was after I testified against my abuser in court, my son's godmom who came with me for support, took me shopping to cheer me up &amp; she bought me a pair of jeans I really liked, it was only a small gesture she just did to cheer me up #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @sally_sst @safelives_ We shouldn't be bystanders to domestic abuse and that a random act of kindness can save someone's life, it also reminds me of when I finally had saved up the travel fair to try to escape my abuser (1st time) &amp; people were staring at me as I clutched the money sobbing #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @PeacheyC @sally_sst @safelives_ Just watched the video and it is so touching and important at the same time. Thank you #abusetalk for sharing the link to this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well maybe women would wear less makeup and be smiling more if they didn't live in a society that profits off their low self esteem and thinks random men have the right to tell women to smile more?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no sympathy for Brody in #Hollyoaks like he inserted himself into Warren and Felix's trauma and swung the first punch, he's the most responsible for what happened out of all of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can they enforce this law in every country please? Unsolicited d*** pics are horrible, the internet has given predatory men ways to sexually harass people in the safety of their own homes #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews 1) J K Rowling isnt a victim the victims are the trans community she spews hate about  2) J K Rowling doesn't deserve rape or death threats though no one does   3) feminism includes transwomen as transwomen are women, if your feminism doesn't include ALL women u're not a feminist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stormrosewriter I tell my son he's pronouncing the word wrong and teach him how to say a different non offensive word that sounds similar to it instead.  C*nt = coconut F***ING = flipping F*** = frog Sl*t = shut Sh*t = ship D*ckhead = ding dong B*llocks = bananas B*tch = butch A*shole = halo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Lefties are surprisingly smart though, scientists results could turn out drastically different if they included left handed people in their tests.  I'm left handed and I love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokemonGoApp I really hope these are shadow Pokémon eggs you can get from spinning a pokestop when a grunt is there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son waited until I was using the toilet to dunk his school socks in his drink and then throw them at the living room door so now there's wet socks stuck to the freaking door. He's so proud of himself and I'm still trying to ya kno calm myself out of stunned anger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the mischievous s*** my son does when I go to the bathroom I'm not going to risk it in future and just start wearing adult nappies so I never have to use the bathroom when he's awake again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts My main concern is whether another lockdown would mean the schools have to shut again, my son's only been back just over a month and I don't want his education being affected again, he missed his friends during lockdown &amp; he's really enjoyed seeing them again at school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror I don't think the glow from his fake tan counts as a protective glow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What do people think an unsolicited dick pic will achieve? Are they hoping the person will send them a picture of their vagina back, That the person will use it as a mastubatory aid, That they'll get the pic printed &amp; send it off to have a custom made dildoe made of it? 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews So the lgbt equivalent of people saying ALM as response to BLM? Gay issues matter &amp; so do trans issues, gay issues are still important but right now trans rights are more under threat specifically &amp; trans people experience same sex attraction so trans rights is a gay issue too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think it makes a difference that there's a month for domestic abuse awareness as it brings it into the spotlight and draws people's focus on to it  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Hull city turned purple is pretty awesome but that's about it #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackDunc1 You couldn't make this s*** up 😂 #Leathermen is more likely to be taken over by LGBT community as the sheer amount of men in leather &amp; assless chaps at gay pride events is insane, I saw one guy walking around in leather hot pants &amp; dog collar with his boyfriend holding his leash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sara_Rose_G The one where no one proposes after Rachel gave birth to Emma was unnecessary and my least favourite episode of the entire show and I always skip it when I'm watching it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sara_Rose_G The whole plot line with chandler's dad was problematic, they lived their life full time as a woman they werent a drag queen they were transgender &amp; Ross &amp; Rachel being on a break didnt justify him sleeping with someone else as being on a break from work doesn't make u unemployed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sara_Rose_G Emily was right, Ross said Rachels name &amp; was going to go on his honeymoon with Rachel  Ross was a jerk isnt an opinion its a fact  &amp;  Paolo didnt hit on Phoebe, he groped her without consent whilst she was doing her masseuse job thats assault &amp; she was visibily shaken by it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Ahhh yes as apparently there's no such thing as gay people who are over 50 who'd love to see same sex couples on dancing shows, sorry people but when you get to 50 your membership in the LGBT community expires and you have to go through a lengthy process to get it reinstated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah well so what if it puts off older viewers? Times are changing, LGBT people have more rights now and deserve more same sex representation on TV so they can either stop watching the show or grow up and get with the times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's one of those days where I've thanked God for the invention of body scrubs, was feeling so stressed out and now my skin's super soft and I'm super relaxed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun She's beautiful and it's so nice that she's found love. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rewatching the @bigbangtheory and the episode with the killer robots really bugs me, as I was so happy when Penny layed into Howard for constantly sexually harassing her &amp; angered me so much when they made her apologise to him &amp; made him out to be the victim when he was a creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More of a reason to legalise it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stormrosewriter I got sick of my mom constantly trying to take my son's dummy off him as "babies shouldn't need dummies" I would always give it him back and let him wean himself off it on his own.  I'm 24 and still have a teddy bear to help when I'm having anxiety attacks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Really? 🤦🏻‍♂️  There are kids starving to death in the world, theres parents living on the breadline where the only meal their child will have to eat all day is their school dinner and there's parents dependent on food banks, a fed child is better than a starving one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnieGuilburt I had a few people who spring to mind when I saw this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Wow she's gorgeous, talented and flexible, she'd be my ideal woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews An opinion is does pineapple go on pizza, not denying peoples right to exist.  You can't have an opinion on whether or not someone is allowed basic human rights as denying their rights is denying their right to life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Agree with the replies the dress itself is grotesque and grossly overpriced especially considering how it looks it would be an insult to Primark to compare it to their products as even their clothes look better than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That creepy moment when 2 weeks after you go somewhere a random guy you didn't even know was there too manages to track you down on Facebook and messages you 🤢🤮<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Each to their own clothes don't have gender so wear what you want.  People think it's cute when women wear men's hoodies but gross when a men wears dresses because society's brainwashed people to think it's shameful to be feminine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therapist; so what's your relationship like with your father?  Me: I've already finished buying the Christmas presents for my friends dog but haven't decided yet if I'm even buying my dad anything.   Therapist; okayyyy then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole/covidiot encounter;  Guy who lives with his vulnerable family has gone far out of town for the day to a shopping centre to meet up with random person they hadn't spoke to in over 2yrs who added them randomly on Facebook &amp; asked to meet up with him very soon after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Nice, this Covid-19 pandemic is already the gift that keeps on giving so why not give it to your grandma for Christmas?  https://t.co/m0YsybJt6v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helen_a15 Woah that's offensive AF who's done that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel like my heart's going to burst with joy, my family are always dead naming me so when I was buying my son's personalised Christmas tree bauble I got myself 1 personalised with my real name "Alex" on it, got 2 though just in case my family smash it when they're visiting #lgbt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I freaking love Scott's shirt #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so proud of my son he had his first show and tell at school this week and he handled it brilliantly, I understand how it can trigger anxiety standing at the front of the class and speaking to the class so I'm extremely proud of how well he handled it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to realise there's a difference between people openly discussing their periods and using a persons periods as an insult.   People openly discussing their periods helps end stigma &amp; period shame   But people accusing others of being on their period as an insult is vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Family member uses the fact they're a Christian to justify their hatred &amp; bigotry then openly brags about the women he's cheated on, saying he'd do it again if he could &amp; then plays the victim &amp; making the women he cheated on out to be the villain 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's such a sweet kid I always ask him what he dreamt about when he was asleep and he said he had a dream about me and when I asked if it was a nice dream he said "good dream I dreamed you let me play outside with my friend *xyz*" and he hugged me so tight. I love my son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to disown another person today for being inappropriate towards me;  He asks me if I'm on period when he's around visiting my kids,  He walked in on me when I was on the toilet &amp; wouldn't get out &amp; I was in the shower when he arrived &amp; he deliberately walked in on me naked 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline During the abusive relationship I felt guilt for my (then) unborn baby as honestly I felt guilty that I chose to continue with the pregnancy &amp; was willingly choosing to give birth to them knowing 1day It'd hurt them when they learned the truth about their father #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline People who had children with their abusers I've noticed feel guilt more than people who don't as the parent feels guilty for keeping the child away from the abusive parent, I've never felt guilt for cutting abuser out my kids life as I know my kids safer without him #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Guilt is often learned, due to the society we grew up in with rape culture and victim blaming we grew up believing the bad things were out fault &amp; we shouldn't "ruin a persons life" by reporting it even though they ruined their own life when they chose to hurt us. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I'll never feel guilty for escaping my abuser, he falsely imprisoned me when I found out he'd got me pregnant via reproductive abuse &amp; I tried to end the relationship &amp; then he subjected me to constant abuse until I managed to escape half way through the pregnancy #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I don't feel guilty for escaping my abuser, I broke up with him months earlier he falsely imprisoned me in his home, he wasn't my boyfriend he was my captor &amp; he wasn't "my son's dad", he was just my abuser who got me pregnant with my son, we're better off without him #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cis people logic; claims trans people make them uncomfortable yet their reaction to finding out a person is trans is to ask them about their genitals.  Like yeah not like that makes a trans person feel uncomfortable or anything 😕 #lgbt #TransIsBeautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter;  Woman w/o mask: *shoves into me w/o social distancing* I'll just move around u then shall I?  Me: yeh I'm shopping?  Her; I can f***ING tell  Me: ur rude mannered  Me: bye 🖕  Her: *glares*  Me: not nice when people treat u the way u treat them is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokemonGoApp consider this before making changes yet, the pandemic is no where near over yet, don't put your players at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokemonGoApp Awful decisions, the Covid-19 pandemic is no where near over yet but yeah just encourage people to go outside for longer periods of time to hatch eggs and use incense &amp; where they'll end up going to public places like parks where there's more pokestops &amp; risk catching the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Sick of toxic positivity bs people with mental health conditions have no control they want to be happy and grateful for what they've got but their brain won't let them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son pushes me to my limit mentally when he's having his meltdowns but it burns him out, he just abruptly goes silent &amp; falls asleep within minutes, I just have to try and keep myself grounded as much as possible &amp; not react to the increasing stress. I know he can't control it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Days like today makes me so grateful the courts didn't grant my abuser any visitation with my son as honestly how naughty my son is being he's pushing me to the point I feel Sick &amp; I'm used to his meltdowns and I know for a fact his biological father would seriously harm him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo tambien 🤗🤗🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me who thinks wobbuffet from pokemon looks like a blue butt plug?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a relationship instead of spending a load of money on a bunch of flowers instead spend the money on a pack of pokemon cards. They don't die and even if we break up I'll still treasure them forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's so funny;  He shouted "3, 2, 1!", kicked my brother in the balls and shouted "never gonna die!" And ran off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Broke my foot in July after stepping on Lego figure head &amp; had to go for a check up on it this week, I thought it was healing well as I was able to run around &amp; kick when playing football with my son, I was wrong the nurse heaved when I took my shoe off at how swollen it still is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  My son; I want to be like u   Me: what really?  My son; yeah I love u, u're good, I want to be like u.   My dad; great just what the world needs another u, another worthless it. He'll be f***ed up  Me: I'd rather he's like me than hateful bigot like u<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yesterday's incident has really done damage to my head, I randomly went extremely dizzy, vision went blurry and almost fainted after I dropped my son off at school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #aidenhatfield has created a new twitter account, block...report.. Don't let this predator back on social media to sexually harass vulnerable women again.  https://t.co/474Q8NqUaQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Head's been cleaned up, hairs been thoroughly washed in the shower and even though my head's still hurting from today's earlier incident I've put my hair rollers in whilst I sleep so my hairs curlier in the morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfectly f***ed up response to  "Can you stop overstepping my boundaries?" Is give me a concussion and threaten to murder me.  My headache is getting worse by the second and have to be careful taking pain relief due to my PTSD medication.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been hit unprovoked again,  Was doing a sketch of @GregHetson &amp; I stopped to tell someone to stop overstepping 1 of my boundaries so they threw something at my head, threatened to knife me to death &amp; can now feel something trickling through my hair &amp; hairs matted to my face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng Another thing able bodied people do is use people with disabilities to gain likes online by guilt tripping able bodied people by posting photos/articles of a person with disabilities with the caption "like &amp; share to show respect keep scrolling if you're heartless" etc #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng A lot of parents are offered the option to terminate the pregnancy and discuss their options with their partner, they're usually given leaflets with information for websites and helplines they can contact to learn more about the disability #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng Inspiration porn is abled bodied people putting people with disabilities on  a pedestal/treating them like an inspiration simply for being disabled &amp; trying to manipulate/guilt trip able bodied people into trying harder as "if disabled people can do it why cant they" #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng Ableism is treating people unfairly based on their disability and favouring able bodied people over them instead  Infantilisation is treating people with disabilities like they're children &amp; patronising them  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng Honestly I've never heard of Disability Day of Mourning but I'm interested in learning more about what it is #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @DesAMowadeng I'll give it a listen to I'm really behind on all my podcasts I listen to at the moment #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Ditto lol, instead of counting down the days to my holiday in London I spent 5 months at home in lockdown binge eating Doritos and losing track of which day or month it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F*** irony. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I had a wound on my leg dressed &amp; I've had an allergic reaction to the adhesive on the surgical dressing and been left in worse pain from the allergic reaction than the actual injury itself.

<|startoftext|>Past 9 hours my anti #lgbt family have told me;  - "I'm reporting u to childrens services u're sons going to end up messed up being raised by a stupid useless it"  - "ur a thing u're not my child"   - "u're an it, bash ur head off a wall &amp; kill yourself"   - "please kill urself"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brother kept deliberately dead naming/misgendering me I told him to stop it &amp; he started "correcting my loved ones" when they used my pronouns telling them I'm actually an "it" &amp; when I got distressed &amp; screamed at him to stop it, told me to bash my head off a wall &amp; kill myself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brother preaches all this s*** to strangers that he's pro #lgbt, his best friend's gay &amp; he doesn't care what I identity as etc &amp; behind closed doors "corrects people" when they use my pronouns &amp; tells them my pronouns are 'it' &amp; tells me to kill myself as Im messing up my son<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sean is jealous of Dean and Tracey remaining friends but Davina is flat out being a bitch and gaslighting everyone into arguing with each other. #marriedatfirstsight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davina is so nasty, she's gaslighting Tracey and feels no remorse for it, I'm happy Tracey did find love with someone else though she deserves happiness especially after how she dumped Dean at the vow renewal it was brutal I loved it #marriedatfirstsight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Circle Jerks &amp; @GregHetson  should sell face masks with their band logo on as part of their merchandise as their tour has had to be postponed this year due to a pandemic so this would be a good business idea in case face masks are still mandatory when they go on tour in 2021<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunflxwervolsix He should release a book with photos of his tattoos in, explaining the meaning and the story behind each one, that would definitely be something I'd read as I love tattoos as they tell a story about the person without them having to speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to realise there's a line between being an entrepreneur &amp; being a sell out.  Entrepreneurs invest &amp; put their name on things that can expand their business &amp; reputation Sell outs just put their name on anything &amp; don't care about their reputation just for a quick buck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love @RamonesOfficial  they're my favourite band &amp; always will be BUT when I think of all the products @markyramone has put his "Ramones name" on he makes the band look like a joke, like he's sold out the Ramones name &amp; plastered it on pointless products to make a quick buck 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been way too productive for a Sunday morning and I need a rest now, I'm exhausted already, don't even want coffee to pick me up as I don't want energy right now just want to lie on the sofa whilst my son watches cartoon and let my body recharge naturally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been way too productive for a Sunday morning it's 10:25 &amp; already;  Been to church,  Gardens mowed, Sweeped the gravel back onto the driveway,  Living rooms tidied, Reorganised the freezer drawers, Washing is done, Done a sketch, Made the beds &amp; Tidied up my son's lego<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLionHeart I know right? I only buy miso paste when I've planned a meal in advance that needs it, I don't have it just lying around in my cupboards just in case I fancy making miso (vegan) chicken ramen on spur of the moment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The town I live in is going back into lockdown from Tuesday, no one not even my son's school are sure yet if this means the schools in the town will still be open or closed during local lockdown or open as usual with stricter rules during the school run, we will find out Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't use Facebook that often as it's full of drama but the days I do go on there the drama is juicy enough to make me want to buy a bag of popcorn to eat whilst reading the comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't see the point in holding a grudge I have more important things to do.  #SaturdayVibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a post on a Facebook Ramones group that is just thousands of commenters slandering the s*** out of @markyramone - I'm not commenting on it I'm just reading the comments, I'm too lazy to hold a grudge - but OMFG some of the comments are freaking brutal it's gotten vicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;   A known victim blamer who is still slandering someone for reporting sexual harassment they didn't even commit, is posting RIP posts about Ruth Bader Ginsburg who was a feminist icon who inspired millions of people. Victim blamers aren't feminists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JkRowling is just the gift that keeps on giving this year isn't she? She should be banned from writing anymore books #JkRowlingIsOverParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was so happy watching #MarriedAtFirstSight yesterday when Tracey dumped Dean is was one of the best moments of the entire series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pervert who's harassing me, intimidated me today when I was shopping, he made a beeline for me, was jangling his cars keys at me, glaring at me &amp; laughing, thought he was going to barge into me so I panicked &amp; just ran into the busy road, I'm unhurt though &amp; reported him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the pervert who's been harassing me has started back up again after a few weeks harassment free after I reported him to the police, he's created more social media accounts to harass me on so now my block lists are full of accounts with his name &amp; pic, it's terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK You put the wrong caption for the article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Starting to think when #JKRowling came up with platform 9 3/4 in Harry potter she chose the number based off of her IQ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent No one plans a visit to A&amp;E it's not like they're sitting at home thinking "Ohhh the TV's crap on weekends so I think I'm going to break my foot on Saturday and spend a nice relaxing afternoon in a&amp;e"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me; *loses my earstretcher* sweetheart eat your cereal whilst I run upstairs and get my spare  *arrive at school on time*   Teacher on playground: what did u have for breakfast today?  My son: *alex* lost their ear stretcher so I stole 1/2 carrot cake out the fridge  Me: u what?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Sorry I was late to the discussion again this week, I wasn't feeling well as honestly my depression has been a b**** the past few weeks so haven't been feeling well in THAT sense. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Education is key we need to make sure people know what minimizing is &amp; focus on survivors care to stop them invalidating their own experiences so they can say "u know what it was bad" &amp; say in legal settings "I didn't overreact to 1 thing I was reacting to ALL of it" #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I didn't know there was an actual term for minimizing but I knew what it was so I'm actually glad to learn there's a term for that kind of behaviour. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I've been minimized by my abuser and I've unintentionally done it to myself by thinking "yeah it was bad but in comparison to *abc that happened* it's not that bad" #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Minimizing is basically invalidating and diminishing the trauma and making the victims reaction when they finally snap after all the abuse seem like an overreaction, by the abuser focusing on just the specific small action that made the victim finally react #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me who thinks #Hollyoaks is getting a bit cringe with the background music every few minutes? Can have a scene that represents good times and bonds in friendships without cringey background music that changes every 20seconds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #Pokémon on TV whilst playing a Pokémon game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of anti LGBT religious preachers using freedom of speech to get away with hate  Freedom of speech is preaching the Bible &amp; trying to persuade people to join Christianity   It's not, grabbing a person's arm without consent &amp; telling them they're burning in hell for being gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews #JKRowling needs to get a life and stop trying to invalidate and erase trans peoples lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK This is basically teaching girls that the way they dress is more important than their education and future, also if the school doesn't feel comfortable with girls wearing shorter skirts maybe they should rethink who they're hiring to teach their classes &amp; teach boys self control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I get tempted to do this everytime I see someone online saying they're going to donate #jkRowling books now she's been exposed as a terf, I have to stop myself asking them to give them to me and I'll burn them for them instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah this is obviously BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beffybadbelly I struggle with light sensitivity which can trigger hellish migraines so i prefer dark mode as it is easier on my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews  https://t.co/qDr3cThOSr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Yeah she's a hate filled bigot so no one cares what she has to say anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to call up my son's school and ask if he came to school wearing shoes as it's bugging me, both pairs of new school shoes are in the living room, his trainers are so what did he wear to school? I trusted him this morning as school run was rushed as I had an early appointment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if my son wore any shoes to school today, I told him to get dressed into his uniform with his black socks &amp; he did, I walked him to school but I've just got back &amp; saw that both new pairs of his school shoes were on the living room floor so WTAF did he wear to school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Meh it'd be a bigger plot twist if it turns out the reason #JKRowling is such a transphobe is because she crushed hard on a man who was actually a trans man and he rejected her so she now lives her life writing crappy fiction &amp; spewing transphobia to heal her broken heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah the LGBT community aren't #JKRowling  critics they're the already marginalised group she's publically spewing hate about, there's a big difference. Also he's a cis white man of course he's defending her when her views don't personally fuel oppression &amp; hate against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuckCohlchez @PinkNews @jk_rowling I know I was being sarcastic, I'm bad at understanding sarcasm &amp; just as bad at being sarcastic lol, she's a raging transphobe though and this book needs to be banned before it hits the shelves it's just going to fuel even more hatred towards the transgender community<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Now I know why @jk_rowling posts such transphobic hate online ... She's just trying to boost the sales of her new book, oh btw charity shops are selling her other books for 10p now as they're being swamped with people donating them since she exposed herself as a terf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Really? My son loves being tickled, he asks to be tickled, he thinks it's hilarious &amp; it's just common sense to stop tickling your kids when they say stop as it can cause them to get hiccups or throw up &amp; stop means stop 🤷🏻‍♂️. Doesn't mean tickling is child abuse though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgin Media sucks it goes down every Sunday and is a nightmare.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This made me laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools have been reopened a week and so far my son &amp; several other kids in his class have colds and I've been vomiting my guts up all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews If the pleasure of sex comes from God &amp; God's a he, doesn't that contradict all the anti LGBT s*** religious people have been preaching as all gender identities experience sexual pleasure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsinestable Yo tambien<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son &amp; several other kids in his class are already showing signs of a cold after only being back at school a matter of days. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews If being LGBT is a sin and Jesus died for our sins then Jesus died to save LGBT people too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Gender reveals are pointless, I found out my son's sex by accident at an emergency ultrasound scan when the nurse said "he's okay" and yeah my family went overboard on the blue stuff buying blue everything like there are other colours ya kno yellow, green, red etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please punch Dean in the face  "I've been a feminist my whole life but I'm a man" and now he's playing the sexism card because he was called out on his misogynistic bulls*** #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@messy4mind My son, he makes me so happy he's just such a wonderful kid he has one of those smiles that's so contagious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday was an amazing day and it made me feel so anxious that I almost sabotaged it myself but I didn't and yesterday was awesome.

<|startoftext|>@guardiannews Morrisons have been cranking up prices for years they're using Brexit as another excuse. During veganuary they increased the price of just their #vegan food to exploit the fact that people were trying veganism for a month &amp; then put them "on offer" at their old price afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish people would stop trying to gatekeep periods and try to dictate who can or can't have periods, like who cares if they're a cis woman, a trans man or somewhere in between? They're bleeding out their vagina for a week, feeling sick &amp; having painful cramps give them a break<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews What's cishet's obsession with enforcing gender stereotypes on their children before they're even born?  I found out my son's sex by accident during an emergency ultrasound &amp; the nurse said "look he's okay" &amp; honestly it was frustrating as my family just bought him ALL blue stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah kids don't care about gender stereotypes on colours, I let my son choose a facemask &amp; umbrella for going back to school and he chose a pink Disney facemask with a girl character on it &amp; a blue umbrella with stripes on, kids really don't care about gender stereotypes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK 1) correct your headline she didn't have sex with a schoolboy she RAPED a school boy. &amp;  2) WTAF is wrong with you revealing the identity of the husband of a child abuser, he's got to be going through hell mentally right now he doesn't need his identity revealed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Feel like death nothing contagious though so was a bit late to the discussion today #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Kids need to be educated on the importance of hand wash, social distancing and that they can get poorly if they don't practice good hygiene etc, education is key for children returning to school #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline All we can do is try and support our children as best as we can and during this pandemic this has been new to everyone so we've all been in the same boat so its easy to put ourselves in our child's shoes regarding Covid-19 as we're as confused &amp; re adapting as they are #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @rockpoollife Not really sure what cultural trauma is but My son's aware of what's going on with the virus he asks to wash his hands regularly and likes wearing his mask now #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline My son's returned to school and I'm happy he's back as he's missed his friends but I'm still anxious about a second wave and it's just sad in general as I've honestly loved having him home the past few months I really miss him when he's at school #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSudricLegend Still valid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we please normalise adults having a 'safe place' in their homes like a calming/comforting place in their home that's just for them to go to when they feel overwhelmed mentally, instead of being judgmental &amp; mocking when adults admit they have a safe space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter 2:  My family; *keep deliberately doing/saying things they know trigger my PTSD/anxiety disorder*  Me: *repeatedly has anxiety attacks*  Family: u're so sensitive, go light ur incense &amp; u'll be fine  Me: or u could just stop deliberately triggering me?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm dreading my son going back to school, I already had issues with the school before lockdown when my son came out of school with a bloodied knee and the teachers didn't notice the blood stain on his trousers, I don't feel reassured the school will handle social distancing well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first few weeks when my son's back at school I'm not letting him do P.E lessons just until I'm confident the schools have got measures in place to ensure social distancing as I don't see how kids can socially distance during sports and sharing sports equipment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are people in my family who are so toxic I have to sage the house of their negativity and do a forgiveness prayer for my reaction to their toxicity everytime they leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abimoore79 @TheSun Exactly "sex with an underage person" doesn't exist if they're underage it's rape. It's vile that people are saying he should've enjoyed it &amp; he must be gay to report it, hes 15 &amp; she's an adult she groomed &amp; raped him made worse as he's already at a confusing stage in life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun She's a pedophile sex with a minor is rape and she groomed a minor and raped him. She shouldn't be treated any differently to a male pedophile with a female victim.  Just because the victim is a boy &amp; perpetrators a woman doesn't invalidate his trauma &amp; the severity of her crime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's so annoying what Dean's put Tracey through is the fact they were a compatible match they have a lot in common etc so it makes it so much more annoying that he was so willing to sabotage that #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks wise Gab reminds me of an older Cameron Diaz #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I say someone's attractive it doesn't mean I'm attracted to them  When say I'm in love with someone's music/art/etc it doesn't mean I'm in love with the person who created it  When give someone a compliment I'm just givng them a compliment  People need to get over themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK So publicity for a selfish asshole...nice All publicity for his actions is going to do is encourage airlines to put strict restrictions on people having snacks on the plane during this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>U can't imagine the relief of finally being left alone by the pervert who's been harassing me after 22 months of harassment, in Nov 2018 I blurted out that I'm LGBT to stop him hitting on me &amp; he tried to blackmail me threatening to out me &amp; has harassed me almost daily since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To celebrate being left alone by the pervert who's been harassing me I decided to dip into my savings &amp; treat myself to a hello kitty teddy &amp; treated my son to a dog teddy as he loves dogs. So happy now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got punished badly for reporting sexual harassment by a creepy fan when I went to @GregHetson gig last year which put me off reporting stalking/harassment by a pervert in town I live in but I found the fight to report him &amp; he's now been ordered to leave me alone &amp; so far he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So pervert who's been harassing left me alone again today, he came outside when I was walking past so his boss came out and told him to turn around and stand with his back to me until I was finished at the bakery next door, I didn't let me guard down though just in case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome its inclusive As long as they work effectively why do other people care about the gender of the person using them? Whether they're cis women, trans men or somewhere in between people shouldn't gatekeep who can use hygiene products &amp; let them menstruate in peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since going sober I've developed a new healthier drink addiction...pomegranate juice with rose water. It's so tasty and refreshing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love meditation, mood lights on, listening to soothing music whilst having wonderful scented incense lit and just being still whilst I focus on everything around me is such a calming feeling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou It's flannel season all year round for me lol, I wear them over my t-shirts instead of a jacket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Well my son's attendance is going to suck at school and he doesn't even start back until Monday, he has a bowel condition so he'll be constantly ordered to stay off school whenever he's having a flare up &amp; needs to go to the bathroom more frequently with diarrhoea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Because she is a paedo, she had sex with a school pupil, if this was a male teacher with a female pupil people would be out for blood but because it's a woman with a male pupil he's expected to enjoy it. Rape/abuse is still rape/abuse regardless of genders of victim &amp; perpetrator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me as a parent;   *Makes my son his high fibre vegan smoothie for his bowel condition*  Me: here's your magic butt juice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros of putting my son on high fibre vegan smoothies;  They help his bowel condition &amp; he can have his medication cut back and he's is in less pain  Cons; when making his smoothies I have to taste them to make sure they're the way he likes &amp; yeah they work a little too well 🤢🚻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't had any harassment off the pervert who's been harassing me since I got the police to take me seriously AND it's because his work hours have been changed, his smoke breaks have been restricted to limit his time outside during work &amp; he's been ordered to stay away from me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun They can protest in a way that makes people take them seriously. They're just making themselves look like idiots by glueing themselves to the pavement so no one will take their cause seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter;  Bunch of straight cis guys have joined lots of LGBT Facebook groups stating it's because the LGBT community should be inclusive of hetero cis people too 🤦🏻‍♂️  Why are non LGBT people so desperate to be oppressed?

<|startoftext|>Me: *does shopping*  Cashier: that'll be £44.44  Me: *goes out again*  Cashier: that's £8.44  Me: £8.44 as in 2 X 4 + 44p?  &amp; All the pokemon I caught on PokémonGo are 44CP Random numbers in news articles &amp; instagram likes are number 44  Keeps appearing everywhere it's bugging me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter:  Family member: *tries to parent my child*  Me: u've got to stop this, i get u have abandonment issues but stop it  Them: FU  Me: *gets blunt about their issues*  Them: *gets nasty*  Me: I'm sorry but go to therapy u CANNOT parent other people's kids!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I don't think so (from my loved ones experiences with mediation I've never done it), you might stand a chance with a really well trained experienced professional but nope. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline No mediation doesn't work as narcissistic people don't see nothing wrong with their behaviour, sociopaths and psychopaths get pleasure from other people's suffering so it's hard to mediate anything #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline No I didn't experience mediation #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @MosaicMediation No I forgot to watch it I can't believe it's September already, feels like this year went January, February, mmmmmaaaarrrrccchh, a load of birthdays in July, few days of August weather, boom it's September. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm worried about Ryan he's being too calm about this, it seems like he's bottling things up so much he's bubbling up ready to burst. He needs to just scream and be angry about this she's a cheat be angry #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracey/Dean's relationship is doomed to fail, if he's going to stray to other women the moment the sex stops then she's going to end up in either 2 toxic relationship scenarios; 1) feels she HAS TO have sex to stop him cheating Or 2) he serial cheats #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracey is making herself look like such a doormat the way she keeps trying to defend Dean and choosing to stay with him, like he "hit it and quit it" the first commitment ceremony so she stopped the sex with him so he cheated with Davina. #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gotten to a point in my bulimia recovery where people pointing out that I look like I've gained weight actually makes me feel so happy as whenever I look at the photos of me at my worst I realise that gaining weight is a good thing now, I think I look cuter now I'm chubbier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been bugging me since last week's commitment ceremony, why was Tracey given the chance to change her answer to leave when she found out Dean had Cheated but Ryan wasn't given the same choice to leave when he found out Davina had cheated? #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earthvesslee I'm almost as old as Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worried about son's speech when school starts, before lockdown his teachers referred him to a speech therapist just to find out his "delayed speech" was caused by them just not helping him with mispronunciations, so worried they'll discourage him from talking if he parrots them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davina really saying "I won't change me" etc ERM she seduced another woman's husband that's not a personality trait that's being an asshole, she needs to change or she's going to end up alone. #MarriedAtFirstSightAus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean can't treat women the way he does and expect to walk away without consequences and really want Tracey to confront Davina on everything #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How beautiful is Ashley? She's stunning. #MarriedAtFirstSightAus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracey is so much smarter than Dean ever realised and think he's well and truly screwed. #MarriedAtFirstSightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracey deserves so much better than Dean she's beautiful, kind and caring and he's just a f***boy player who cheated. Honestly she'd make a better match with Ryan than Dean. #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean is bulls****ING through his teeth and won't even take responsibility for what he's done. Davina's not innocent but at least she's admitting she f***ed up. #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vegan hot chocolate, crackers and #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia a fun way to relax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean is pure evil he's actually trying to blame Ryan for him cheating with Davina? Like WTAF dude that's so freaking low . #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lila_OWx I know i'd definitely go for a guy like Ryan he'd be my ideal match. She didn't realize what she had until she was left with nothing and realised Dean was just playing her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lozza_1977 Agreed lol I thought it last week when he mentioned the ring at the commitment ceremony it was flat out bulls*** but watching this episode I definitely think it's what he's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lila_OWx Agreed Ryan should've been her one and only choice and she made him a last resort choice so she wouldn't end up alone when Dean refused to leave Tracey, if Dean had chose to leave she'd have left Ryan in an instant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me who thinks the new ring Dean bought himself wasn't for his marriage with Tracey and that he got it for when he left her for Davina but he changed his mind on leaving Tracey after they started having sex again?  #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davina never gave Ryan a chance and now she's realised Dean played her she's realised she well and truly screwed up as Ryan was the better match for her. Ryan cared about her Dean just wanted to shag her #MarriedatfirstsightAustralia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I've seen in motion today is that people can call someone who speaks out against them a liar all they like their true colours will always get exposed in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Each to their own but there's also a time and a place for it, when he's at work keep it professional, when he's off the clock go for it.

<|startoftext|>Makes me laugh that people think the government is using Covid-19 to control us...ERM my son just had a meltdown &amp; minutes later I had a Pinterest notification for pins about parenting &amp; disciplining kids effectively, so yeah he threw books at me so f*** off he's grounded<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To the people who are calling Covid-19 a hoax...my loved one died during this pandemic and the last time I saw them alive was a matter of weeks before lockdown began so the only reason you're calling this pandemic a hoax is because you haven't been personally affected by it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting sick of straight cis people saying they're "coming out as an #LGBT ally" Like congratulations you're not an asshole but we're not throwing you a coming out party, the A stands for asexual/aromatic/etc not Ally so just stop saying you're "coming out" as an ally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've said it before and I'll say it again  LGBT sex education needs to be a mandatory part of the curriculum in ALL schools and there shouldn't be an opt out policy for it when there isn't one for non LGBT sex education.  Proper LGBT sex education saves lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It says a lot about the state of LGBT sex education in schools when the comments on an Instagram post about safe sex in #lgbt relationships is filled with comments from people admitting they hadn't been taught any of that in school sex ed as it was all cisgender hetero sex.<|endoftext|>

There's worse things going on in the world like Covid-19, Beirut explosion aftermath, Poland's anti LGBT stuff, Donald Trump's being a d*CK again, Muslims in forced labour camps in China, migrant crisis etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's "swapped names" with his friends and he's going around telling people he's his friends name and his friends are telling people they're my son's name it's so weird but cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have so many facemasks as pandemic aside I was kinda already wearing one before pandemic s*** hit the fan as I kinda got sick of creepy straight cis men telling me I should smile more so started wearing face coverings like scarves/turtle necks pulled up to hide my mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When reconnecting with people I fell out with after sorting things out I always get anxious/scared of disagreeing with them in case i lose them again until I remind myself that if I lose them again it's proof they were never supposed to be in my life to begin with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline This is so f***ed up, why aren't they terrorising the uncle for raping her? A 10year old carrying a fetus to term could kill her, she'd be at risk of haemorrhaging, cephalopelvic disproportion, premature labour, placental abruption, preeclampsia &amp; chorioamnionitis to name a few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanted to do another practice sketch of @Pelathor but can't sketch portraits for s*** at the minute whilst I'm grieving so spent past few days working on one big sketch of the ingredients for my favourite smoothie instead LOL, I love sketching fruit I'm actually good at it LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I don't think I've ever used the word 'serendipity' in my first language ever in my life but I've now learned how to use the word in Spanish simply because knowing how to say a useless word in another language I've never used in my first language makes me feel more intelligent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline What an idiot? That poor shark must have been so confused and scared, one second it's swimming along not hurting anyone the next a dumbass is jumping on their back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate people who chew loudly &amp; slurp everything they drink, currently stuck in a room with a loud chewer and no matter how loudly I turn the music volume up to drown them out he still sounds like a brain damaged cow chewing gravel &amp; slurps his drink like a cat licking sandpaper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are days when I struggle to get out of bed.  There are days when I can cook dinner for my kids but have no appetite to cook anything for myself.  There are days where my biggest achievement of the day is changing my underwear.   So when I ask for space, just give me space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of people making me feel like I'm a bad person for needing to be left alone for a while or accusing me of having a bad attitude for not wanting to talk to them &amp; politely asking to be left alone. I'm going through a tough time right now I just need space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *been too busy to shower in I can't even remember how long*  My brother: *offers to babysit my son so I can have a long shower &amp; wash my hair*   My Son: *has an epic meltdown when my brother's on a video call whilst working &amp; gets my brother into trouble*  Me: *feels guilty*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debunking excuses pervert who's been harassing has used;   1) Hes not a pervert I'm just a sl*t - nope, I said yes to others but doesn't mean he can try to pressure me to say yes to him &amp; 2) he's a man he can't control it - nope when the police were up town today he left me alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually have different facemasks to coordinate with my outfits;  - black as can never go wrong with a little black mask lol -pink for red/pink coloured clothes -blue for blue clothes -camo for camo/green/khaki clothes -black/white plaid for plaid shirts -sparkly for events<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today police were lingering around town due to spate of break ins in the area &amp; surprise surprise the pervert who's been harassing me everytime I go out ... Left me alone...all day...I was able to buy watermelon &amp; starfruit smoothies with my son without being sexually harassed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homophobes are like jeykl and Hyde, they're so freaking nice to you before they find out you're #LGBT and the moment they find out they back track on everything they said &amp; start hurling insults and criticisms instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homophobe before they find out I'm LGBT: "You're so nice" "Your hair is awesome" "Your son always looks so happy"  Homophobe after they find out I'm #LGBT : "I don't like your attitude" "No one will hire you with green hair" "I feel sorry for your son he must be so confused"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difference between my family towards me &amp; my not LGBT brother;  Brother's IBS acts up; Do u need taxi fare to the hospital? Let me take care of u *Cooks him dinner &amp; cleans for him*  I need to go to a&amp;e: I hope u lose ur leg How will u cope when u move abroad? I hope u f***IN die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneliRoberts I punched mine in the face once, he had me pinned against a wall and I knew he was going to kill my then unborn baby so I punched him in the face &amp; ran when he opened the door to storm outside for a cigarette, I slept in a bus shelter until he eventually found me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cousin *on Facebook* I'm sick of being hurt in relationships, I'm a good guy I don't deserve to be hurt by women all the time I'm done in future I'm focusing on my family &amp; staying single.   Me: oh shut up u're only 12, if women date u it's a felony &amp; ur family are ur parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting woken up by a loud scratching sound just to realise it's coming from inside my ear has got to be one of the scariest moments for me so far this year. I got the beetle out safely but was terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a fun way to get woken up today, a tiny beetle flew in through my bedroom window whilst I was sleeping &amp; landed in my ear, got woken up by a scratching sound &amp; realised it was coming from inside my ear &amp; could hear it crawling further in, I managed to safely remove it but 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter: Idiot: thank god you put 'official' in your insta name too many people trying to be you 😏  Me: actually there is ☺️, I have a stalker who created multiple catfish accounts of me to harass the people I love so 'official' is definitely needed 🖕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how my brother does work in HR at his work and fires people for a living &amp; yet he put his fist through one of my paintings hanging in my living room because I took a photo on my phone of my art desk and he thought I was secretly videoing him when I wasn't. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Artist problems;   Person; how'd u learn to paint/draw like that?  Me: practice  Person: yeah but HOW?  Me: years &amp; years of practice until what I think is my bad art now was once the standard for my best art  Person: I get that but HOW did you learn to do it???  Me: I JUST DID?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something weirds happened I didn't have a nightmare when I went to sleep, I take medication as I have horrific nightmares everytime I even nap but my dream was sweet, I dreamt I was getting married &amp; couldn't decide on an outfit &amp; was worried they thought I left them at the altar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all have that one family member who criticises you so much they'd probably bring a ouija board to your funeral just to criticise your choice of funeral plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My back injury is getting really freaking painful with each passing minute, my injured foot/ankle from July still hasn't fully healed yet so walking on my left side is already difficult and now I have a back injury on my left side. I always get injured on my left side.  🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROUDmoneyWorld Yeah my christian dad thinks my identity is a sin so is a total asshole towards me but he's also the same Christian who cheated on my stepmum for almost a year with an alcoholic &amp; never prayed for forgiveness 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suffered a back injury when working out and I'm in f***ing agony, the whole left side of my back from my rib cage to my thigh is in sickening pain, can't go to a&amp;e though as my family are refusing to babysit "on such short notice" &amp; my dad hopes i need my whole leg amputated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its_supersarah  https://t.co/Jcsw2IVVo7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact More like increase chances of saying no, making someone uncomfortable by invading their personal space is a huge red flag.  Like Friend: "How'd you meet your partner?" Me: "he touched my arm without consent &amp; invaded my personal space when asking me out &amp; it just went from there"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah The Burning by Laura Bates  &amp;  Everyday Sexism by Laura Bates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud of myself but shaking; Pervert who's been harassing me, reported his number plate &amp; he's been told to leave me alone well today up town he followed me, everytime I stopped he stopped, watching us so pretended to take pic of my son &amp; took pic of pervert &amp; sent it to police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline This is so f***ed up, humans have stopped to a new low by harvesting an animals tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todays asshole encounter;  Person: why'd you dye your hair green?  Me: because I let my son choose the colour.   Person: you let a child choose? That says a lot about you doesn't it?  Me: yeah it says I'm a good parent who cares more about my child's opinion of me than ur opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easiest way to weed out anti LGBT followers is to put your pronouns in your Insta bio, lost 20+ followers who "don't approve of non traditional genders" yeah bye bye assholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That thunder then scared the f***ing s*** out of me could feel it vibrate the floorboards and made my ears pop, f***ING hell. #storm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I just like to chill on a sun lounger in the sun and drink iced coffee #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Was supposed to have gone on my self care holiday without my son last week but due to the pandemic I've had to postpone it until next year which sucks as I've had a traumatic life I need that week of the year to chill in a hotel room with a private bathroom &amp; de-stress #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Nope doesn't feel like summer holidays at all this whole march - August has just blended into one long day punctuated with naps #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun Really? If I'm going to a punk rock concert I want to be getting a busted lip in a mosh pit not freaking sitting at a table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  My son: *gets sick from the heat*   Me: *takes him home &amp; asks my brother to babysit as I still had appointments to attend*  My dad: *finds out* didn't it occur to you to give him a drink?   Me: I did, several actually, do you think I'm stupid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had my hair cut and dyed green again also decided to go full goth makeup today heavy black eyeliner, black lipstick, white/black/blue contouring &amp; foundation, I hate how feminine makeup makes me look but the further I am into my transition the more masculine I'll look wearing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the weirdest feelings in the world is coming on your period when you're stoned, spent like 5 minutes staring at the toilet roll trying not to freak out before it sank in that oh this is normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah because my sex life as a trans man wasn't awkward enough now I have to wear a face mask during sex and not kiss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Maybe help them not treat it like a freaking sport. This is just degrading and an example of the human race at it's worst by treating migrants like a spectator sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So had a person I thought I was in love with come back into my life and at first I was happy but with each passing day I speak to them I've realized their presence back in my life has caused me more heartache than their absence did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #MarriedAtFirstSight Australia all I'm thinking is "Telv please don't hurt Sara" she's been through so much she deserves her happily ever after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah well I think it's immoral that everyday across this planet LGBT rights are under threat by holier than thou assholes who's religion gives them more rights than LGBT people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me as a parent;  Friend 1: my daughter's learning to play the violin  Friend 2: my son went to his dad's after football practice   Me: a guy swore at my son for chasing a butterfly &amp; accidentally running into his parked car so I threatened to key his car unless he apologized<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that's hard to accept is that someone you love the most is the main cause of your emotional pain and misery and that maybe you're better off without them in your life at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's not just Aiden Hatfield who does this. Woman sent 'sleazy' topless picture by charity after offering to volunteer  https://t.co/lrZWZrgJbj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life at this point;  Friend 1: I think my boyfriend is going to propose soon  Friend 2: I'm finding out the sex of the baby next week I think it'll be a girl  Me: my periods 4 days late but I don't think I'm pregnant as I haven't gotten laid in over 3years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else do this? If you are attending a loved ones funeral &amp; they're being buried in the same cemetery as some of their other loved ones you go and tidy up their loved ones graves &amp; headstones before the funeral just in case people want to visit them once the funerals ended?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life sucks at times;  Felt motivated past few days &amp; finished the 2nd part of a sketch of Pela , did an abstract sketch of Johnny Ramone, got the house redecorated &amp; My body has decided to leave me bedridden with vomiting halfway through my to do list &amp; broken foots swelled up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Straight cis men are so cringe at times;  Had several guys unfollow me on insta after uploading video of my rock collection as they "don't follow engaged people they only follow singles"  Yeh I'm single they just saw my late aunts ring on my finger &amp; assumed I'm engaged 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My rock/geode/fossil collection consists of over 100 pieces so far &amp; want to share my passion with people so decided every Sunday now on my Instagram I'm doing an insight into my life and showing small snippets into my hobby as a rock collector. I'm a bit of a geology nerd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something people need to be taught at an early age is that it's not normal for a person they've rejected to stalk them &amp; stalking isn't flattering &amp; they need to understand they shouldn't just agree to go on a date with the stalker they rejected to get them off their back #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to normalise people talking about stalking, society shouldnt have this mentality that it's only okay to discuss it when the victim has been murder by their stalker, we need to raise awareness of it now, we need stalking survivors to share their experiences to save others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had fun playing PokémonGo magikarp community day with my son. Got 20 shiny magikarp, 2 shiny gyrados &amp; an unexpected shiny Snover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67  https://t.co/yiUrKpPGsE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate struggling to understand sarcasm and understand people's jokes, it's hellish as if someone makes an offensive joke at a person's expense it's hard enough but a person having to stop &amp; actually work out in their brain that someone's being mean at their expense is hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnieGuilbert Any piece of clothing with the word "Twerk" on should be illegal. 🤢🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *makes a joke*  Me to myself: oh I hope they get it what if? What if? What if? What if?   My brain: who gives a f*** if they don't get it, you struggle to understand sarcasm, you struggle to understand people's jokes everyday of your life, let them have a moment in ur shoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Don't Tell The Bride on @E4Tweets and I understand why this bride won't wear the dress if it was better quality then it'd be nice but it's a cheap ass quality dress when there's cheaper wedding dresses in charity shops that are better quality than hers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching repeats of Don't Tell The Bride the dude in this one is a total d*** he chose her a cheap ass dress then called people materialistic because she won't wear a cheap ass dress on her wedding day that's being aired on TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Guy: *makes pervy comment*   Me: eurgh  Guy: why wear shorts if you don't want guys attention?  Me: these are men's shorts, my entire outfit is from the menswear department everything down to the sock I stuff my boxers with, do u harass cis men too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anti LGBT cousin on Facebook: *finding out what the sex of her unborn baby is* I don't care what the gender is as long as it's healthy that's all that matters   Brain: don't say it don't say it  Me: will you still say that if any of ur kids grow up to be trans?  Brain: u said it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I think I'm too stupid to be alive &amp; other times I can identify a rock specimen simply upon glancing into a box of rubbish that an antique shop owner was throwing away because they didn't know what it was so therefore didn't think it had any value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda proud of myself, pervert who tried blackmailing me for nudes in 2018 &amp; has been sexually harassing/stalking me everytime I go out, well he was harassing me today &amp; he got into a car when I walked past carpark so I noted down his number plate &amp; I've reported him for stalking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got given a grapefruit sized specimen of Desert Rose for my rock collection today for free simply as the person in the antique shop didn't know what it was &amp; put box with stuff they didn't think had any value outside as rubbish, I saw it walking past &amp; offered to buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kids are evil at times!   My son: *hides my deodorant*   Me: *can't find it anywhere, gives up and borrows my friends deodorant* ... *Finds out I'm allergic to my friends deodorant because my skin started swelling up and burning in minutes* ... Me: *calls up dr's for help*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the worst person to call stupid as if someone calls me stupid I will find out a subject that they're bad and educate myself as much as possible on it &amp; next time I see them I'll bring it up in conversation &amp; then ask them what they're thoughts on the subject matter are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@venusplutos Slowly part that's killing me I see so many signs not to give up whenever I'm getting impatient but it's frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how a shop owner knows one of their employees attempted to blackmail me for over 9months for nudes/go on webcam with him after I blurted out my identity in an attempt to stop him sexually harassing me, yet I'm the 1 in the wrong for refering to the guy as a pervert #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Me to son: don't go in that shop sweetie THAT pervert works in there  Shop owner: *comes out* who TF u callin a pervert?   Me: the employee u know tried to blackmail me for nudes after I blurted out my sexuality in attempt to stop him harassing me? Him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Why was this show even made? Who thought this was a good idea? We've been in lockdown for months barely able to go out whilst going through the trauma of a pandemic but yeah fat shame people on TV for how much weight they gained during lockdown &amp; encourage dangerous dieting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This is just heartbreaking her wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of her life and then that happened can't imagine the fear they felt, hope they're all okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to be so p*ssed if it turns out the person who predicted the world would end in 2012 was dyslexic and it's actually supposed to end in 2021 as how much of a f***ING disaster 2020 has been I wouldn't be surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five days into August 2020 &amp; so far:  - #Bairut  explosion, thousands are injured, there's fatalities &amp; the country has been devastated - Jake Pauls house has been raided by the FBI &amp; - Donald Trump is already spewing his unwanted opinion/conspiracy theories about #bairutblast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline ☺️ Sorry was late replying to questions 3-5 got a bit too engrossed in my workout lol #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NoushD_ Education is key; it's important to educate children on the signs of exploitation &amp; grooming and make sure they understand that they won't get into trouble with you for speaking out if they think it's happening to them &amp; that you'll try to protect &amp; support them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NoushD_ Signs of exploitation: - inappropriate behaviour - highly sexual or sexually suggestive behaviour - secretive  - withdrawn  - spending unhealthy amount of time messaging a "new friend" - unexplained things &amp; money they shouldn't be able to afford - skipping school/work #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NoushD_ Exploitation is pretty much using a persons vulnerabilities to groom them so you can use them for your own gain #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NoushD_ Thank you and think it's to do with my blood sugar as I got given a glucose drink and my headache went and I stopped throwing up within minutes so need to be tested for diabetes now so meh 😕 #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NoushD_ No sorry, I've been extremely busy and been ill #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews No he lost his job for being too far up his own backside to realise it's 2020 now &amp; he can't get away with being a transphobic d**k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK The way she's wearing her mask improperly is bugging me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son is so wonderful;  Me: *starts feeling sick*  My son: *runs out room &amp; runs back in* I think you need one! Here you go!  *Hands me a glucose drink*   Me: thank you sweetheart, I think you're right  My son: the magic drink will make you feel better uncle *xyz* said so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YAY! I've finally replaced my entire outfit that got ruined by the creepy dude at @Pelathor gig, finally replaced my ruined boots today! Took over a year to replace them as they were the comfiest boots I've ever owned but finally replaced them with an equally comfortable pair. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK I thought it was a grainy pic of an ass Infront of a candle at first glance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Well I hope he's sacked too as it takes two to tango and he's just as responsible as she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Yeah humans are the pests and the threat when we go into the water as we're in the whales home so they have a right to defend themself and their young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews If they see a child eating a banana &amp; sexualise it they shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children. I've never looked at my own child eating a banana in public &amp; worried it was sexually suggestive, I encourage him to eat fruit &amp; bring fruit for him to eat on the walk from school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Todays asshole encounter:  My mom who I havent spoken to since last August contacted my best friend to tell her, she doesn't like my friends new hair colour at all.   I haven't spoken to her in over a year but yeah send me a malicious letter &amp; then harass my friend about her hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sadiemm_ I think we're already having the first ripples of a second wave, we've got small localised outbreaks happening and eventually they'll ripple outwards to the next towns due to people not adhering to Covid-19 prevention advise and still travelling out of the lockeddown area<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Hetero people usually only complain about a gay man kiss I'm guessing they complained about this lesbian kiss because the lesbians kissing are too young to be sexualised by the men watching the show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sadiemm_ It's an issue of rebuildiny the economy over people's safety. It would be better if it was takeout or delivery instead of eating in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it about time the media left Meghan markle &amp; Harry alone as everyday there's another bulls*** claim about her plastered across newsites &amp; things she's apparently doing wrong now, maybe let her defend herself &amp; instead start focusing on Prince Andrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Yeah but you can learn a lot about someone simply by how they behave in the cinema<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpdChameleon Sorry if it's triggering you, I didn't mean to just want to make sure other people are safe too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since going vegan I've gained a new appreciation for butternut squash it's just an underrated vegetable, had roasted butternut squash filled with diced garlic &amp; chillies and got to be one of the nicest dinners I've ever had.

<|startoftext|>Me: *asks my insta followers who I should sketch today*   My followers: *suggest Eric Melvin as I'm good at sketching him*   Me: fair enough time to sketch a white guy with dreadlocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally replaced my pleather jacket &amp; boots that got ruined by that creep deliberately splashing gross s*** down my back when I went to @Pelathor gig last year, took over a freaking year to find replacements though as had a lot of sentimental attachment to my jacket so meh 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sadiemm_ They don't do nothing and whenever I report it they keep telling me it's not illegal but I don't care I value mine and my son's privacy so I don't appreciate it I should be able to dance around my living room with my son or have a cup of coffee in front of the TV in privacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People across the street from me are ALWAYS up their window looking through mine, I have to keep the curtains and blinds closed during the day to get them to stop looking in, its f***ING with my mental health as Im watching TV &amp; can feel Im being watched, look up &amp; there they are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a trans man going through a cervical cancer scare I'm going to say this; not all cis women have a cervix due to medical reasons, some trans men/GNC people still have a cervix &amp; trans women don't have one so it is more inclusive &amp; not erasing women to say "people with a cervix"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Pole dancing can be a very good form of exercise &amp; they were wearing clothes so not like they were doing anything illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metro_Ents So a heterosexual kiss is okay but a Same sex kiss is inappropriate? Yeah a same sex kiss won't turn people gay the same way a heterosexual kiss doesn't turn gay people straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MENnewsdesk Of course people are allowed to meet in beer gardens but not their own gardens, Boris Johnson only cares about rebuilding the economy than preventing a 2nd wave of Covid-19, people spend money in pubs &amp; by only allowing groups to meet in beer gardens it'll encourage them to spend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpdChameleon Most people including myself are just trying to keep his name &amp; what he's done still fresh in searches of him in case he tries to create any new social media accounts if this dies down &amp; try to rebuild a mass social media following to do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fsodofficial His social media and websites are still all down except one IMWT Instagram page &amp; he hasn't issued a statement yet denying the allegations which after 2 months makes him definitely seem guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I f***ING hate this pandemic as yes I've had to cancel my holiday &amp; seeing @GregHetson tour which sucks but they can just be postponed until this has died down but the person I've lost during this pandemic will still be gone when all this is over &amp; will never come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad people are still tweeting about Aiden Hatfield sexually harassing women as what he's done can't be allowed to die down as he's deleted his social media accounts now but nothings stopping him creating new one's if this dies down &amp; starting all over again to harass women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Did it take 20 seconds or 20 minutes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when men tell me I should smile more as  1) it's just annoying as f*** &amp; unnecessary street harassment &amp; 2) It stings I have depression &amp; PTSD I want to smile but I feel too low to, I would love to feel so happy I don't have to be told to smile by toxic assholes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Family member: *narcissisticly rambling on &amp; on about their same s*** different day drama* ...  Why are you so f***ING quiet are you even listening?  Me: no sorry I'm just trying to decide on what I'm going to wear to my loved ones funeral  Them: oh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 4year old son: *tucks his Spiderman &amp; green goblin action figures in bed together* they love each other  Me: oh, So they're a couple?   My son: yeah they're gay   Me: do you know what gay means?   My son: yeah 2 boys *my friend* told me &amp; Spiderman loves green goblin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people so surprised when I say something intelligent? Like does everyone automatically assume I'm stupid or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Meh it helps to raise awareness of domestic violence as people have the mentality of "celebrities can be victims too" it can also encourage victim blaming as celebrities can also pay the media to publish a character assassination of the victim &amp; make them the villain #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes celebrities get priority treatment in the system as honestly the justice system is like a business at times where innocence can be bought &amp; media can be payed to portray the victim as the villain, the celebrity with the biggest bank balance can buy their innocence #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Nope half the time the media is just mud slinging crap with a few "random anonymous sources" against the celebrity popping up here &amp; there trying to get a quick payout #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think celebrities should be protected too as they deserve their privacy as there will always be people who take sides in criminal/DV/rape cases despite evidence based on their own personal opinion of the celebrity #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline P*ssed off this week was supposed to be the countdown to my holiday instead thanks to this stupid pandemic everything is cancelled until next year. I just want to go to gigs &amp; go in a mosh pit😭 #abusetalk  https://t.co/4pDXF78oEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F***ING hate this pandemic this week was supposed to be the countdown to seeing @GregHetson in his circle jerks reunion tour whilst holidaying up London instead I have to wait a year &amp; I'm stuck at home having my PTSD therapy sessions via Zoom with a broken foot 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AAttempting Yeah just feel sick I called him a "f***ING pervert" and he laughed but like WTAF dude? it's a felony it's not funny, I didn't see him at first but when I felt something grab my butt I assumed my son had fell &amp; tried to grab my jeans pocket then I turned around &amp; saw him instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My head's messed up right now like I was happy up town with my son doing food shopping &amp; as my reward for starting therapy I replaced my pleather jacket that got ruined at a gig last year &amp; then boom pervert grabbed my ass &amp; now I feel broken &amp; violated &amp; physically sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Yeah race has nothing to do with this, how realistic that toy gun looks if I saw a kid playing with that &amp; didn't know it was a toy gun I'd be calling the police too as you hear way too often about kids getting hold of real guns &amp; accidentally shooting their friends when playing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easiest way to make me love you; simply sending me a message saying "If I don't reply I'm not ignoring u I'm just busy X" it's something so simple but just means so much to me. If someone means something to u, u make the time for them even to let them know u're not ignoring them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is being weird today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arizonashley I still do this, I watch a surprising amount of wedding shows for someone who has commitment issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really Spain? Can you stop this bulls*** for good? Animals shouldn't have to suffer for the sake of tradition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugs me when I'm watching documentary about in England in Tudor times etc &amp; theyre shocked when they discover black people who lived in England back then like did they think black people didnt exist until rich white guys wanted slaves &amp; believed our obviously whitewashed history?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going out or online and seeing all the beautiful in the world makes me more convinced than ever that I'm dying alone as I'm just a plain dump &amp; rarely wear any makeup anymore so why would anyone want someone who's not heavily made up or photoshopped to their eyeballs instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnnyDepp and #AmberHeard divorce has got to be one of the messiest divorces in celebrity history, the amount of accusations, mud slinging, random anonymous "sources" &amp; "friends" getting involved &amp; claiming to have witnessed each accusation no matter how outrageous is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a problem with someone discuss it with them don't ignore them as being ignored is a special kind of hell as they'll torment themselves wondering what they did wrong so they can apologize for it when you could've just discussed it with them in the first place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent I'm not an antivaxxer but even I think we don't know enough about long term effects of Covid-19 to be able to create a safe &amp; effective vaccination for it, I think research still needs to be done on long term effects of Covid-19 before rushing to roll out a vaccination for people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is one of those days that is a prime example of why I'm actually scared when I feel happy in case something goes wrong.  https://t.co/anLVo0LfGD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Me: *playing @PokemonGoApp with my son*   Asshole: you're always on that's f***ING phone aren't you?  Me: ERM this is the first time I've been up town since March? So Yeah that's obviously bulls***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think one of the most disrespectful things a person can do is eavesdrop on someone's prayers. Whether the person is religious or not &amp; regardless of the praying person's religion it is extremely disrespectful even more so if they try to discuss the subject of the prayers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So proud of my son it's his 1st non medical trip out the house since march today! He handled things so well, we went for a walk up town to help me pay bills &amp; took him for a walk through the park on the way home, he wore his mask &amp; social distanced, he made me so proud! ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Doing something at least will do more than sitting back and doing nothing when they know something is going on. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Bring it on, I think it should be enforced in England too as it would save so many women's lives as so many people are afraid to tell someone what's going on so sometimes taking the decision to report it out their hands can save their life. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeedsTransLad I'm trans and I was so used to people using transmen/transwomen as a singular word I only learned recently that trans men/trans women were separate words, I got self help books about being LGBT and it explained it so I'm still unlearning things &amp; relearning about my own identity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter  My family: *refuses to babysit my son so I can go to hospital &amp; get my ankle x-rayed as "how will I cope when I move away"*  My friend: *finds out &amp; DMs offering to babysit so I can go to the hospital*  Me to family: that's how I'll f***ing cope alone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I DID IT AGAIN! Was outside doodling  @Pelathor  and got distracted by a centipede and yeah long story short the centipede is named Kumquat, he loves running in circles and now lives in my flowerbed. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter 2: Me: *has an argument with my family member*   Neighbours: *goes f***ing mad at me for noise at 10pm*  Me: next time u get into an argument with ur drug dealer at 3am waking up the street screaming u want ur machete I'll put in a noise complaint too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter;  Family member; I know what you're doing you're poisoning your son against me  Me: no you're a raging transphobe so I'm not trusting you alone with my son so you can't poison him against me with your anti #LGBT bulls***.   Family member: ur a f***ING it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me who's nervous about the #CovidVaccine ? As it's a new virus that we still don't know enough about in general to be messing around with vaccines for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think in relationships the first time your partner tells you they trust you is just as special as the first "I love you" is as they're giving you their trust which is such a powerful thing to give someone as if you break their trust you break them too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I'm too excited! Stupid pandemic I don't want to wait until autumn to find out what happens it looks too epic to wait! #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Struggles of being a single parent: Got asked today "if u take ur son to the hospital when hes injured why don't u go for ur own injuries?" I answered because when my son's injured I'm there to take him but when I'm injured no ones there to babysit him so I can go to the hospital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found out today I may have broken or fractured my ankle when I tripped on Lego 10days ago so need to get emergency treatment on it. My son's health visitor pointed it out when she noticed how extremely swollen my ankle is &amp; I admitted what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love when cisgender people claim oppression as they're refused entry into a store because they're not wearing a facemask, when last week alone I had a transphobe threaten to cut my throat on 2 occasions, another threatened to throw me over the banister of a stairwell &amp; was hit 2X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sabrina84976314 Thank you ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some days I think I'm passing really well as male &amp; feel confident/handsome &amp; other days I feel like I just look like butch lesbian who's fooling nobody and break down crying because I hate my body so much &amp; want to shave my head so I'll pass better even though I ❤️ my long hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK My 4year old son hasn't left the house or garden since march due to this pandemic as few weeks before lockdown he was in hospital with an agonising bowel condition &amp; he's only been out to go to the hospital for medication/treatment...&amp; yet these morons are b*tching about a mask?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Couldn't decide on a reference image of @JosebaBLenoir I liked and ripped up 3 attempts at doodling him so I've just spent ages finding new reference images to use instead. Hit a mental wall at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've notice an easy way to purge your Insta followers of assholes is to post something supporting #BlackLivesMatter #TransRightsAreHumanRights or #LGBTQRights and your follower count will go down by 20 a day when the racists, transphobes and homophobes block you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent What about the human rights of the people Isis killed? &amp; What about the human rights of everyone in the country she abandoned to join the terrorist organisation that's been attacking us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a bridal TV show I'm starting to think my only chance of having a "until death do us part" marriage is if I become a serial killer lol 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK If she is allowed back she should spend the rest of her life in prison as I understand she was groomed online by extremists but no one forced her to go, she wasn't kidnapped, she wasn't in immediate danger if she told anyone, she chose to go &amp; knew what she was doing was wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can @instagram do what @Twitter did and ban #katiehopkins please? She's posted a distressing fake news post about #NayaRivera death on Instagram falsely claiming she committed suicide because of #COVID19  lockdown.

<|startoftext|>Posted a comment on Instagram defending #BlackLivesMatter &amp; started getting spammed with insults &amp; threats off "all lives matter" &amp; Trump supporters so I almost deleted my comment but I stopped myself as I realised that's what they want they're trying to bully people into silence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Hmmm I'm going to use my free speech to call him a racist homophobic c*** then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been defending #BlackLivesMatter on @instagram which has prompted "all lives matter" racists to send me threatening DM's &amp; post horrible comments on posts of my artwork to try to sabotage my career goals, they forget spamming my comments is just boosting my page visibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Can't pin point an exact time my survival mode kicked in but I could see how I started adapting to survive the situation &amp; felt my survival mode kick in the day my abuser tried to murder me I started very quickly working out how to negotiate &amp; get him to drop the knife #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It's an instinct that kicks in when we feel our life is at risk it's the primal instinct that allows us to quickly adapt to survive a traumatic situation &amp; act on instinct when we feel at risk #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in such a bitchy mood today I physically can't help it like I've even had to ask myself out loud "dude what the f*** is your problem?!" But I don't know what my problem is it's like I have spicy verbal diarrhoea or something I just can't keep in the bitchy comments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have the attention span of a caffeinated squirrel. I was walking home thinking of which reference image of @Pelathor to doodle 🖊️ &amp; got distracted by a caterpillar on someone's front garden so I took a load photos of it &amp; now I'm sketching a freaking caterpillar 🐛 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes me laugh that people were posting selfies on social media last year with the Snapchat filter of the animal ears with a face mask but now they're actually required to wear a mask in real life they're throwing tantrums #facemask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else ever send a message to someone when u're extremely angry and when u calm down &amp; go to reread it expecting to feel ashamed of what u said instead feel extremely proud of urself for what u said &amp; how well u actually handled the situation despite how angry u were?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the council please keep this statue it's so amazing! We need more statues of POC and more statues of women in general as most statues in the UK are of cisgender white men and there needs to be more diversity as women and POC have shaped our history too ya know?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't feel anything anymore physically or mentally.  I hurt my arm yesterday I saw it happened but I didn't feel it at all I didn't think it was even that badly hurt until I noticed the blood dripping then I was like "f*** I need to get a bandage I'm hurt worse than I thought"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yeah I'm very independent now &amp; don't ask permission to do things that make me happy, I don't ask permission to dress a certain way and I'm happier in myself for breaking the habit #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can work out how much I respect someone on Insta based on if I delete &amp; retype my comment on their posts  If respect someone like e.g. @Pelathor I'll delete &amp; retype comments if I think it sounded off/censor swearing, if it's someone I don't respect I won't care enough to do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Considering she repeatedly misgendered her own character I'm actually glad she saw sense and pulled out of the role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews 1) the Bible teaches people not to judge and they sound pretty judgmental  &amp; 2) Why are feminists going to hell? They're literally just asking for women to be treated equally to men what's so hell worthy about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun That's not discrimination.  A dress code is a dress code, I pretty much live in ripped jeans &amp; hoodies but I'd be willing to go to a restaurant in a button up shirt and normal jeans if the dress code stated it, she looks like she was going to the local chippy not a 5* restaurant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews If she can't even gender her own character properly how is she expected to play the role of a transman in a way that does the character justice? Why not have a transman play the role or even a GNC person? Anyones better than a cis woman who misgenders her own character<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F***ING hell this isn't far from my home it's scary AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really think @instagram should have an option to report people for solicitation of sex or nudes.

<|startoftext|>Pros of wearing a face mask; - reduces risk of catching/spreading #Covid19  - hides most of my acne  - only have to wear 1/2 as much makeup to cover my acne - reusable masks have cool designs &amp; are better for the environment - can pretend I'm in an action movie &amp; in disguise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @karenevansdaf None where I worked no one was trained to spot the signs so I think the staff should be trained in spotting abuse red flags amongst their colleagues and how to provide support for people they suspect are being abused #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @karenevansdaf My former employers never spotted the signs of abuse my ex would sit outside my work all day waiting for my shift to end &amp; they never got security to move him so I think employers should be better educated on the signs of abuse &amp; have staff trained to spot the signs #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline This poor baby hopefully her family will be able to get the funding to afford care for her so she can still have a good quality of life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Jesus wasn't white it's common sense, it's not like he was a white guy from the UK and travelled to Jerusalem, he was born and lived in the middle East to a parent who was from the middle East, figures &amp; artwork of him just portrayed him as a white man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tostopworrying I think this too it's so creepy also feel the same way about mom shaming videos like they're photographing/videoing a child without consent &amp; uploading it to the internet, it's creepy AF if they're so concerned about a child call police, don't upload a video that's out of context<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Not entirely sure what support is available as I haven't really been in a relationship since I left my abuser I've briefly dated guys for a matter of weeks but nothing official #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gave my son's diet a massive overhaul due to his persistent bowel problems that have required hospital treatment. By putting my son on a #vegan oat milk &amp; date smoothie every other day with breakfast his bowel problems are clearing up &amp; he's not longer dependent on his medication<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjshaw192 Ditto, who'd think that was a valid method? When my son was constipated for 7 days suppositories didn't work &amp; on the 9th day laxative solutions didn't work I took him up urgent care centre &amp; after a feel of his abdomen he was sent to a&amp;e &amp; admitted to the paediatric unit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another link to a news article about Aiden Hatfield from June   https://t.co/0e0FQb4cJD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With Aiden Hatfield so many people have asked why we didn't speak out sooner, we were afraid to whenever anyone called him out on his BS he'd post it on his social media &amp; get followers to harass them instead of just blocking them so we just called him "mental health advocate"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Link to another news article regarding the Aiden Hatfield allegations, I'm still shocked that people have finally named him I tried to speak out last year but was afraid he'd send his followers after me so I only referred him as "mental health advocate"  https://t.co/rWtVZ1SnGb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So going through latest updates about #aidenhatfield &amp; I think I'm actually going to be sick, a person who was 14 at the time has spoken out against him, they were 14! I'm SO proud of them for their bravery &amp; for speaking out &amp; I'm more relieved than ever he's being investigated<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews They should've apologised for Little Britain long ago you've only got to look at this photo of David Walliams in blackface to see how offensive it was, especially in the scene where David is in blackface &amp; Bubbles rips off their hair piece &amp; runs out wearing it as a pubic wig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact the #aidenhatfield DID actually donate to @MindCharity makes what he's done even worse.  As he was donating to charity &amp; helping others yet he abused the credibility he got from donating to Mind to pose as an advocate to exploit the mental health community &amp; harass women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK She renounced her citizenship when she made the decision to become an IS bride, I understand she was groomed online by extremists but they were overseas so she was in no immediate danger if she refused or told someone what was going on &amp; she would've got into a lot less trouble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline There's also a risk of a second lockdown due to a second wave of Covid-19 cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Aww congratulations! I'm so happy for her &amp; I respect her for keeping his life private I'm the same with my son, I don't post his photos on social media &amp; my loved ones &amp; family didn't know I was expecting a baby until I invited them to his baptism when he was almost 6months old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations #JKRowling thanks to ur transphobic bull**** tweets the hashtag transwomenaremen is trending during #PrideMonth u must be so proud of urself u've done a #DonaldTrump &amp; attacked the #lgbt community during pride month &amp; #BlackLivesMatter protests u must be so proud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do any other transmen get really dry skin on their chest underneath their binder?  Mine is extremely dry under my binder to the point it's flakey &amp; peeling like I have dandruff on my chest &amp; it itches I've been using creams to stop my skin being so dry but isn't working #trans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think #JKRowling would use her massive following to speak about #BlackLivesMatter instead of posting transphobic tweets during #PrideMonth even though she knows it was black transwomen who helped spark the stone wall riots in the fight for #lgbt rights in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There needs to be laws in place on social media/dating sites to protect people from receiving unsolicited d*CK pics, what happens now is the victim blocks &amp; reports them, get a verbal warning &amp; move on to the next victim.There needs to be 3strikes &amp; they're banned #aidenhatfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhallproduction @EmmaWatson My son's godmother is a cisgender woman... And she's never menstruated she had her uterus removed when she spent almost her entire childhood and teenage years battling cancer.  Are you and #jkrowling Going to tell me she's not a woman as she can't menstrate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 🙂 #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Signs might not work due to lack of awareness of them and it might be difficult to raise awareness of them in a way where it'll limit the chances of abusers learning them too and trying to prevent their victim using them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Signs are useful only if others are aware &amp; until abusers catch onto them and put "measures in place" in their relationship to prevent their victim using them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjshaw192 Did #JKRowling  spell LGBT wrong on purpose to p*ss off the community even further? Also it was transwomen who fought for LGBT rights so she's stabbing them in the back by being transphobic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline If you dial '999' and can't speak type '55' and they'll get you help  Also not really a sign more of a tip; when dialing '999' always say your location 1st then what service you need &amp; why as that way if your calls cut off they can send someone to your location #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I don't watch TV I saw it on social media though #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLightCreation @pjshaw192 @OnmarsSarah @HanathePNDqueen @AidenHatfield He said vile s*** to me on here last year so I had to block him so I definitely believe the other victims &amp; I've got the evidence to prove it so I understand your doubts but I believe his victims as I am one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Awesome definitely going to be involved in it this week, past few weeks been going through some stuff so needed time to process #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to What happened with Aiden Hatfield think there should be a 3 strikes law for sending unsolicited d*CK pics as accounts don't get banned online for sending them, just get a warning,  There needs to be a 3 strikes law 1st - a warning 2nd - 3day suspension 3rd - account banned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *bumps into someone from my past*   Person: *doesn't recognize me straight away*   Me: Last time u saw me I was a black haired woman &amp; now I'm a green haired man &amp; last time we spoke u hurt me.   Person: OH...   Me: yeh...fresh start? &amp; Don't let the past ruin a 2nd chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *types out a message &amp; sends it*  Me: *notices* oh s*** I said the 1st 1/2 of the sentence in Spanish &amp; the 2nd 1/2 in Italian oh s*** oh s***  Me: *checks Spanish &amp; Italian study books in my backpack* ohhhh 2nd 1/2 wasn't in Italian it's spelt the same in Spanish too PHEW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: I'm so s*** at speaking different languages why do I even bother trying to  Also me: *replies to someone in a different language without screwing it up &amp; without my study books*  My brain: see i said u could do it, the knowledge is there u just lack the confidence to apply it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baj1983 @MENnewsdesk There's also a pub named after him in bloxwich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MENnewsdesk Dumbasses. Its gotten to a point now where some people are treating 'black lives matter' protests as a trend they want jump on to simply say they attended 1 but aren't signing petitions/donating to the causes, proven by wanting to topple statues without properly researching them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this morning reading through the latest on twitter about #aidenhatfield I was nervous thinking it'd be full of people defending him...NOPE! Got to see people admitting they've downloaded their Snapchat &amp; twitter data, found the evidence &amp;... REPORTING IT! I'm so proud of u!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenFEdwards Happy birthday ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been on recieving end of unsolicited d*CK pics before (not by Aiden Hatfield but some of his victims were)  &amp; Its terrifying, u get a sudden jolt of panic from ur gut up into chest that makes ur hair stand on end &amp; ur heart pound, u panic &amp; u want to click off the image asap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @MindCharity for releasing a statement &amp; taking action we all appreciate it, the whole situation has been difficult on all of us, police are involved, evidence has been found. It's just confusing it's a relief to speak out but so emotionally draining on all of us too ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou @AllTimeADreamer Yeah I've made allegations and provided evidence against him and yeah I've never even met Aiden in real life and refused to go to his gigs let alone dated him so clearly that defense is BS I highly doubt all 30+ people who've come forward are all his exes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah Thank you for this 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou @AllTimeADreamer People like her are the reason it took so long for victims to come forward. She said she won't believe the allegations without evidence then made nasty comments on the evidence Like the dudes closed down his brand/source of income why would he have done that if he was innocent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art I know I've blocked her again, like WTAF though, saying she won't believe people without proof about Aiden Hatfield then when they post proof attacking them, he could be tried and convicted and she'd still think he's innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beware of this account they're attacking #aidenhatfield victims by accusing them of spreading B.S saying there's no evidence and when people are posting evidence she's making nasty comments on it, block &amp; report, she made a snide reply about my 3 year old son... too far a**hole  https://t.co/KEflf6Dasc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnmarsSarah 1) I blocked you on Instagram the block applies here too 2) you're defending a sexual predator, nice, your parents must be so proud👏  &amp;  3) I am spending time with my son actually I invited his friends over &amp; he's playing up the garden with them whilst I'm supervising ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People wanting proof that #aidenhatfield started an argument with me last year for asking him if he was okay here's your proof (got it via tweet analytics could only see my side due to him deactivating his account) I put the 'X' on the end of 1st tweet by accident BTW  https://t.co/voJDG94GJm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stressed. Son fell off neighbours trampoline when playing with his friends, I've checked his leg over but he keeps crying hysterically claiming it hurts to walk and his knee is swollen so got to call 111 and see what they advise in case it's something more serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so proud of everyone whether u're not ready to speak up yet or you've spoken up against Aiden Hatfield no matter how big or small u think it is, whether u spoke up about a gut feeling about him or experienced harassment by him I'm so freaking proud of u all for ur bravery. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulaannev I know right? All the BS he spewed about how it's not shameful to take mental health medication &amp; stuff &amp; giving advice about meds and I bet in actuality he couldn't even tell his followers the names of any anti depressants or their dosages he knew nothing about anti depressants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilonacatherine @_pariah @dreamershxtel @EndTheStigma_ie @mattwrailbus @AidenHatfield @WestYorksPolice @WestYorksOPCC He did a follow for follow thing he had 100k followers and followed 100k back, he followed mainly new accounts with less than ten followers knowing they'd follow him back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't mind people correcting my grammar if I'm not speaking in English. If I'm speaking French, Italian or Spanish and i make a mistake please feel free to correct my grammar, help me learn they aren't my first language so I'm happy to have my grammar corrected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulaannev Agreed I mentioned in a comment to someone I was worried about going back on anti depressants as they made me suicidal in the past and he didn't seem to understand at all that anti depressants can make people feel suicidal they can make people feel worse they're trial and error<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah I know what you mean &amp; that's what I meant like he couldn't have got medication without going to his doctor about his depression in the first place, if he'd just gone to the gp &amp; said he self diagnosed himself can he start meds they'd still want to discuss his symptoms 1st<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibbleF Thank you, I only spoke out as I went on twitter the day he was exposed to tell him stop harassing my private insta account on his IMWT account as the twitter block applied on there too then I saw the hashtag and realised it was time to speak out as it was a now or never moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art Agreed &amp; people are asking "why didn't we say something before?" We tried to but we were scared to everytime anyone tried to call him out on his BS he'd instigate an argument &amp; only post the screenshots of what they said to his twitter &amp; get his followers to attack their account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art That really angered me when he did that as by asking if he should go onto medication he made people believe he'd been diagnosed but he was never diagnosed he'd only be able to go on medication by going to a Dr for a referral for an appointment to get diagnosed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sum up this thread:  Aiden Hatfield fooled people into believing he'd been medically diagnosed with depression &amp; dangerously gave mental health advice to vulnerable people who'd been diagnosed without having experience with mental health treatments, medication or proper diagnosis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By giving vulnerable people medication advice and therapy advice online &amp; via tweets without proper diagnosis he persuaded vulnerable people to make decisions regarding their own MH treatment thinking his advice was credible especially with his connection to @MindCharity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr's legally can't prescribe mental health medication without a diagnosis &amp; as he was self diagnosed he legally couldn't be prescribed medication for his depression yet he gave people advice regarding medication they believed was based on his own personal experiences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was so dangerous as he tricked mentally ill people into believing he had so they turned to him asking him for advice about medication, therapies and how to go about getting professional MH support &amp; he gave them advice about it &amp; discussed it with them at length...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aiden Hatfield was Self diagnosed with depression but not medically diagnosed yet posted on twitter &amp; gave advice to followers about therapies/medication which was extremely dangerous as he was self diagnosed so had no experience with licensed mental health therapy or medications<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aiden Hatfield was self diagnosed with depression &amp; never got diagnosed by a professional yet the way he portrayed himself online fooled people into asking him for MH support believing he had experience with licensed MH therapies/medication which he cant have being self diagnosed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clucks86 @Tommy13Art Okay I am sorry about that if I've caused any stress but I was on the recieving end of some extremely vile comments from the accounts mentioned &amp; another victim DM-ed me warning me about that account so I've warned other victims as the comments made were terrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Moral of this news story; Only stick actual sex toys designed specifically for anal use or fingers with clipped fingernails up your rectum anything else is not worth the risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's p***ed me off about #jkrowling comment about "people who menstruate" she's basically assuming all women menstruate &amp; all people who have a uterus menstruate when some women don't have uteruses so can't menstruate &amp; some people with uteruses can't due to medical conditions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art For the sake of his victims I think it's best to air on the side of caution with troll accounts to prevent them being retraumatised any further as AH has a history of creating fake accounts to try to get himself verified so I wouldn't put it past him to stoop this low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art Seems like it's definitely him or someone he knows if they've slipped up and admitted he didn't see his own daughter as much as he claimed despite his weekly posts about seeing her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay important Aiden Hatfield update and I think you know where I'm going with this...  YES IT'S ANOTHER FAKE ACCOUNT TO TROLL HIS VICTIMS! PLEASE BLOCK &amp; REPORT IT IF THEY CONTACT YOU. They're claiming to be a family friend &amp; he didn't see his daughter as much as he claimed to  https://t.co/fyoBKVwekS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are getting scared that 1) IMWT has their addresses &amp; 2) anonymous accounts that keep being set up attacking victims online (evidence suggests it's AH)  So if u receive any communications off him via either way please report it &amp; if it's to ur home address call the police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle Thank you 🙂, just he THOUGHT he had depression he was old enough to go to a Dr by himself &amp; get professional help but instead he chose to exploit depression for profit &amp; wannabe fame, people with depression don't do that they get professional help &amp; therapy they don't exploit it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle OMFG!? I was convinced I had depression for years my family brushed it off as attention seeking so I waited until I was legally old enough to go to my dr's alone &amp; got myself diagnosed &amp; got treatment.  I sure as hell didn't start a clothing brand, make s***Ty music &amp; make a blog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toninestor @MindCharity Agreed It's raising the questions now did he 1) have another source of income he wasn't telling anyone about to fund his lifestyle &amp; 2) was he really donating 50% of profits as his clothing was poor quality &amp; overpriced not including shipping so the amounts were disproportionate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VioletAngel1 @Tommy13Art @heavymusicawds Agreed, the fact that he's deleted all his social media accounts and his own IMWT brand and has started making fake anonymous accounts to intimidate his victims is not doing himself any favours at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PTSDKintsugi No problems 🙂, there's another account as well that's been created today I've shared a screenshot on another tweet.  https://t.co/4GkbRXpmZ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VioletAngel1 @Tommy13Art @heavymusicawds People should all just go on his YouTube and start disliking all his videos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art Yeah it is &amp; to @MindCharity  keeping them in the loop as this progresses as it's only right that they know considering he exploited his association with them any backlash off this could seriously damage their reputation &amp; they don't deserve that, Mind have helped me in the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another fake anonymous account has been created defending #aidenhatfield &amp; attacking his victims online so please report and block. This a**hole slipped up with a piece of info only he would know This s*** is getting scary he's traumatising his victims further by doing this.  https://t.co/w8YtVXrhLs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something wish people wouldn't do when talking about my PTSD/anxiety/depression is refer to me being triggered as "having an episode" I don't know why but I find that so offensive &amp; makes it sound like I'm crazy, I'd rather people just say "his *whichever one* has been triggered"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @MindCharity I deleted the email address IMWT had of mine after I blocked him across social media last year and set up a new email address with the same email but a different domain, I only went to unblock him the day he was exposed to tell him to stop trying to follow my private insta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dad's informed me he's cleaning out my childhood bedroom to use as a games room...ERM I'm s***ting myself incase I left anything dodgy in there when i moved out... Sum up my teens I cut a compartment into my mattress to hide my weed in &amp; used to hide cigarettes in my jewellry box<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @MindCharity Maybe he did donate to them but how much about him turned out to be lies even IMWT logo &amp; name weren't his own designs like he claimed he could've easily just made one donation since he set it up in 2013 &amp; even if he did actually donate it was just part of his MH advocate facade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best things about learning a new language is that it opens up a world of podcasts I can listen to and so far theirs is one of my favourite Spanish podcasts to listen to.  (This tweet isn't an ad by the way I just follow them on Instagram &amp; I ❤️ their podcast LMAO 😂)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A point someones raised to me regarding credibility of #aidenhatfield donating to @MindCharity is that he claimed to donate 50% of his IMWT profits to them yet last year he bought a house &amp; sporadically posted videos of himself writing cheques for £50 to Mind? #inmusicwedonttrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So J.K Rowling is posting transphobic tweets One of them is "there used to be a term for people who menstruate" then proceeds to make up words that sound like 'woman"  ERM I'm a guy and I'm on my period, I'm a transman &amp; pre-op so yeah she can just STFU #JkRowlingIsOverParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @Ohforfucksake1 His silence speaks volumes, if someone made accusations against me I would fight until my last breath to prove my innocence, I got called a liar last year by ONE person when I reported sexual harassment so I spent over 3months fighting to prove I was telling the truth &amp; it worked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @Supportforthea1 @Ohforfucksake1 Also legally his victims can't post the screenshots of the dick pics he sent them online as it would legally be classed as revenge porn &amp; he could have his victims arrested they can only give those pics to the police to use in the investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy13Art Agreed the fact the accounts were created within days of allegations and evidence being brought to light against him and these accounts are ONLY anonymously attacking his victims is more than a coincidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important #aidenhatfield update for his victims. Please retweet. Screenshots attached  #inmusicwedonttrust  https://t.co/QMUPmejzC1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @Supportforthea1 I wouldn't be surprised if he was Aiden Hatfield on a catfish account trying to discredit his victims via attacking them anonymously online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People wanting proof about #AidenHatfield allegations...he closed down his social medias AND his business IMWT brand, why would he do something so extreme as closing down his business &amp; source of income if he had nothing to hide? That's a pretty huge sign he's hiding something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockOnTheRise Aiden Hatfield really? He's been exposed as a predator using the guise as a mental health advocate to send women &amp; 2 transmen vile DM's &amp; Mind Charity are investigating him as evidence suggests he wasn't donating as much as he claimed to them why are you giving that guy publicity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that some of #aidenhatfield victims have gone to the police, increasingly more people are sharing evidence, he's disappeared offline &amp; Mind charity are now looking into AH should be more than enough proof for doubters. Why would they go to the police if it was lies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SystemOceanic Evidence: 1) victims who were sent dick pics can't legally post them on online as he could have them arrested for revenge porn, 2) he sent pics on Snapchat where he knew there'd be no data evidence stored &amp; 3) 30 total strangers making very similar allegations is huge evidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah You're such a nice person and the world needs more people like you in it. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoundAffectsPod Thank you. He's completely disappeared off social media and closed his websites down which is making it clear he's guilty of something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @LeedsNews in light of allegations made against Aiden Hatfield &amp; increasing evidence that Police &amp; @MindCharity are investigating I'd advise you to remove this article  Aiden Hatfield: Leeds clothing company boss on coping with mental health issues  https://t.co/DLvXtJ5amP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpdChameleon 👏👏👏👏 I've also posted several screenshots of physical evidence as well as people were asking me if I had any screenshots &amp; "evidence" as apparently my testimony alone wasn't enough so what more evidence do they want from us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fsodofficial He hasn't showed up yet but I've posted some evidence to back up my allegations, some from July 23rd 2019 and some from February 12th 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SystemOceanic I'm so sorry you've gone through this and I hope now the truth is out about him you can begin to find peace in knowing you didn't do anything wrong and you weren't alone in this, he was a d***head to me last year &amp; to so many others, thank you for speaking out too ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopsdaisy @MariaEBarcelona @AidenHatfield I've posted evidence today on my account some from July 23rd 2019 &amp; some from February 12th 2020 to back up my allegations against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anxiety_Sugarr I've posted some evidence on my twitter account about him dating back to July 23rd 2019 &amp; February 12th 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J3fficka @messy4mind Exactly this, what kind of mental health advocate tests the loyalty of his fans with fake twitter accounts? Playing mind games is damaging for people's mental health. Also it's a bit convenient all his "fake accounts" have disappeared alongside his actual accounts now too eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More evidence regarding #aidenhatfield from a Facebook post on February 12th 2020 that was posted about his fake "catfish accounts" he was creating of himself #inmusicweDonttrust  https://t.co/vznsbzcyV4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@messy4mind Depends what it is LOL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People asking for evidence regarding #aidenhatfield  here's a screenshot from tweet activity I posted about him last year on July 23rd. Didn't post his name in the tweets as he'd retweet tweets about him he didn't like &amp; get his followers to go after them #inmusicweDONTtrust  https://t.co/ONwuHIC0sV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle @Twitter @instagram I don't believe he donated 50% at all as he posted videos of himself writing cheques sporadically once every few months &amp; his donations weren't automated either which was a big red flag as people can set up their bank accounts to have money automatically transferred to charities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle Yeah his "logo design he made" has been around since before 2013 there's women who've had that tattoo design since 2009 a girl I went to school with had it tattooed on her thigh and I dropped out of school in 2010.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle @Twitter @instagram He wouldn't have created this for publicity as his career is over now, I've been spending past few hours going through my twitter and Facebook and Instagram finding more of my own evidence about him to help destroy the b*****d  I've already posted some evidence already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle All you've got to type into Google, Pinterest, Etsy, eBay, Amazon or any tattoo site "heart music symbol tattoo design" &amp; his brand logo will come up with thousands of results dating back decades all across the world, its a stock photo that he should've purchased legally...for £1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitald00dle Definitely, he regularly created fake catfish accounts of himself on @twitter &amp; @instagram pretending one of his fans had done it &amp; he would follow all his followers on them &amp; ask on his main account for people to report the fakes &amp; he'd then "joke" he hoped he'd get verified now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anxiety_Sugarr AH, IMWT Instagram account is still up, he's set it to private now and deleted all his posts but he's still got followers and is still following people, seems like that's the account he's using to keep himself updated on the aftermath online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the people asking for proof regarding #aidenhatfield heres some proof from parts 3 &amp; 4 of my thread about him. These are screenshots from my twitter I posted on Instagram last year look at the dates on the posts. #inmusicweDONTtrust  https://t.co/DEBzxUQR9C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chlobliviate Agreed he retweeted every one of his own tweets and asked others to retweet his tweets and posted screenshots of his own tweets on Facebook and Instagram like self obsessed much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindCharity With #aidenhatfield IMWT logo, its a stock photo tattoo design but doesnt mean he used it fraudulently, if he can prove he purchased the stock photo legally he could use the design as a logo on merchandise but if he DIDN'T due to copyrighting he can't claim its HIS own design<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarding concerns that #aidenhatfield clothing brand was committing fraud (@MindCharity ) IMWT is the name of a preexisting music review website in Oregon &amp; IMWT logo design is actually popular stock tattoo design thats been featured in tattooists for decades #inmusicweDONTtrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@connordoner @madeleinesteel @justmeandeupd @imwtclothing @imwtrecords @AidenHatfield Woah...explains why I didn't see it I blocked him last year but woah just woah takes a special kind of narcissism for a white guy to make a black lives matter video somehow all about him  #inmusicwedonttrust #aidenhatfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunicorn88 @meds_meltdowns_ @AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @MindCharity Same, I was a 23 year old woman when he first followed me and when I started transitioning and became a guy he didn't take it too kindly, he started an argument with me for asking him "are you okay? You seem grumpy?" As he was being rude mannered &amp; asked me if I'm sure I'm trans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madeleinesteel @connordoner @justmeandeupd @imwtclothing @imwtrecords @AidenHatfield What video? Sorry for being nosey saw the tweet when looking for updates regarding Aiden Hatfields association to Mind charity and this came up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chaotic_Null @inmusicwetrust Ok thank you, retweeted this with a comment as the selfish attitude to you asking to retweet one of your mental health posts just encapsulates the whole selfish attitude of AH, it's all solely about Aiden no one else matters but him mentally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole message interaction sums up #aidenhatfield to a tee, the selfish attitude by not even retweeting something to do with mental health as it's not something done by Aiden Hatfield. #inmusicwedonttrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlinkandBurn @ChrimWreather I will when he replies I'll let you all know what's happened, I've also contacted YouTube and explained what's happened regarding Aiden Hatfield and requested that they suspend his YouTube account &amp; videos until further notice to prevent him fraudulently profiting any further<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah @jonrobmid Ok will do and what's bugging me about the way he's pressuring people for evidence here despite admitting Aiden Hatfield behaved 'icky' to his girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoeVictorias Agreed he seemed to think he was so much more famous as a musician than he was I'm not bleeding my savings for a free gig off someone who sent me an automated DM on twitter, if I'm willing though to pay £40 on a gig ticket &amp; travel 3 hours by train I'm willing to spend my savings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoeVictorias He got annoyed with me when I commented on his post that his gigs were too far away from me &amp; he replied that if I were really his fan I'd be willing to pay travel fare like I'd done when I went to other gigs. Like I'm not going to pay £40 train &amp; £100 hotel fee for a free gig<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrimWreather Agreed it's why I've contacted them to confirm they have no association to Aiden Hatfield just in case they receive any online backlash as a result of what AH has done, they've owned their account longer than AH had his clothing brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunicorn88 @meds_meltdowns_ @AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @MindCharity Ditto I had less than 10followers I was still setting my account up when he followed me which seemed odd that a guy with 100K followers who claimed to be tied to Mind charity would want a literal nobody to share his music was off AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ⬇️ why would he take down his clothing site if he had nothing to hide? No one can comment on his website so why take his own websites down and remove himself from social media? He's completely gone off grid &amp; @MindCharity are now looking into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#inmusicweDONTtrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found this account online upon googling #aidenhatfield clothing brand to see if he's taken their pages down, I've tweeted the page asking if they have any association to Aiden or his clothing brand at all or if Aiden Hatfield ripped off their name for his clothing brand.  https://t.co/e33wtAv3pl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inmusicwetrust I hope you don't mind me asking but your account has the same name as a clothing brand ran by recently exposed predator &amp; false mental health advocate #aidenhatfield, I was wondering if due to similarities in account name if you're associated with him in any way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now #keithlemon has apologised for doing blackface in the past, can @davidwalliams and Matt Lucas now apologise for these sketches too? How did anyone think these sketches were funny?  https://t.co/RHY16L4uHB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he's taken down his accounts online if you google search his name his links to his pages all come up to dead accounts.  Also a pic from a band page that seemed appropriate. 666 the Omen number highly appropriate. #aidenhatfield #inmusicweDONTtrust  https://t.co/cTCm9K7sLY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people who are calling the people who've spoken out about #aidenhatfield liars; What do we have to gain from him by speaking out?  Money? Fame? No! He wasn't famous &amp; doesn't have much money the only compensation we'd get would be literally pennies each #inmusicweDONTtrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People asking for evidence about #aidenhatfield well instead of facing the 100's of allegations made against him on Twitter alone, he's closed all his social media accounts including his clothing brand &amp; gone off the grid &amp; refused to comment is pretty solid evidence of guilt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact #aidenhatfield could so easily close his social media accounts including his clothing brand is further calling his credibility about donating to @MindCharity into question as he claimed to be donating 50% of profits to them but he could so easily cut ties &amp; stop donations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodbolam @meds_meltdowns_ @AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @MindCharity Most people including myself didn't take Screenshots as at the time to us he was just another creepy guy on the internet sliding into our DMs so we left the conversations and blocked him like we do with other pervs online #aidenhatfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just vile I'm so sorry he said that to you. So in the past 24hours it's been revealed #aidenhatfield is a narcissistic ableist sexist victim blaming mildly transphobic predator posing as a mental health advocate to prey on vulnerable women, OMFG?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last part of article (2)  https://t.co/dBtWATigqi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've published an article on Facebook page regarding #aidenhatfield link. (Also post Screenshots of the article below) (1)   https://t.co/wynbE2wg5q  https://t.co/v9qR26pyMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quick poll about #aidenhatfield  How many people had Hashtags about #mentalhealth in their bio when he followed them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom was the person who outed me as trans last year but #aidenhatfield reaction to me being trans was bad, he got argumentative &amp; rude mannered with me but when he asked me if I'm sure I'm trans? Like No s*** WTAF dude? Unlike him I don't use people's identities as an aesthetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay right, #BlackLivesMatter &amp; #JusticeforGeorgeFloyd are still really important so I'm using my insta stories to share updates &amp; ways to help, HOWEVER my twitters being used to keep #aidenhatfield trending to encourage his other victims to speak out &amp; updates about @MindCharity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've noticed today, a lot of comments regarding #aidenhatfield asking if anyone has any evidence so he can be investigated by police &amp; charged but a lot of people didnt keep evidence as he was just another guy online making us uncomfortable, we just left the convos &amp; blocked him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindCharity @meds_meltdowns_ Thank you for commenting on this; I wasn't sexually harassed by him like some of his other victims have been but he did say some vile things to me when I went through trauma last year (my current pinned tweet) I blocked him before he could try to take things any further though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you want to make America great again then step down as president and let someone run the country who isn't anti everyone who's not a cisgender white male.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading my own tweets about #aidenhatfield &amp; other people's experiences with him, a patterns forming in his behaviour, they all started off the same, he sent them automated DM which he used as an excuse to slide into their DM's &amp; he almost only replied to female followers not men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For fans of #aidenhatfield who are calling the people who've spoke out about him liars; there are hundreds of people who've spoken out today alone on twitter about his behaviour &amp; if you pay attention to them you'll notice similarities &amp; a pattern forming, it isn't a coincidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pariah You have helped me, you let me know I wasn't alone in aiden Hatfield's s***ty treatment of people. How supportive you've been to me when I started talking about my experiences with him I didn't want to stop talking about them, you helped me know I made the right decision 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red flag for me about #aidenhatfield was the fact he had 100K followers, I didn't know him personally  yet he followed me when my twitter account had just been set up I had less than 10 followers &amp; just had hashtag for my depression in my bio &amp; he sent me DM links to his music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a predator who's been using mental health advocacy to prey on vulnerable people. Including myself (pinned post)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that also set off red flags about #aidenhatfield was that he posted a lot of shirtless videos/pics whilst discussing his mental health, it was just his bare shoulders but discussing mental health with vulnerable people with his shirt off was very uncomfortable to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that set off a red flag about #aidenhatfield was the fact he sent me 'X's on the ends of tweets/messages to me straight away, it's ok if it's family/friends/spouse/cyber friends etc but a male to a female stranger on the internet introducing themselves on DM was off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaimsleeirish @Aidenhatfield2 👏👏👏👏 I've reported his account for being spam and blocked it ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#aidenhatfield  https://t.co/oYrLbx7fIS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SIMONDAVIDCOOPE It's okay not your fault, he fooled a lot of people into thinking he was a good guy, he spoke so much about men's mental health issues but rarely if ever replied to guys who had mental health issues it was only women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SIMONDAVIDCOOPE No youre not it's nothing to do with your looks 🙂, was more to do with your gender he was targeting women, he's a predator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartLaidler @mikemenhealth @its_carrie2685 @uktattoochick He was nice to me until I got outed as a transman but it was like flicking a switch he changed instantly, he started an argument with me for asking him "are you okay? You seem grumpy towards me" he told me I was being rude &amp; disrespectful so I called him out on it that he was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that p*ssed me off about #aidenhatfield was that he acted like he was so famous because he had 100K followers, when no just no it was ALL follow for follow s*** anyone could have 100K followers overnight with that same approach, doesn't make them famous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlinkandBurn Agreed he's so one sided always begging his followers to retweet and share his stuff but he only ever shared other peoples posts if they were mentioning him and his music career otherwise he didn't give a 💩 it was all one sided, he used MH advocacy as an aesthetic which is sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikemenhealth @its_carrie2685 @uktattoochick Ditto he was nice to me when I was a woman but when I got outed as FTM transgender and started transitioning suddenly be turned into an argumentative a**hole and asked me if I was sure I was trans. Like nah mate I just got beat up &amp; disowned by everyone cuz I'm cisgender 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am wondering this about #aidenhatfield was it just girls who got this special treatment or did he  send that whole automated message to initiate a convo about him being real crap to men too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwaysred010 @uktattoochick @its_carrie2685 Me too, I got that message and said the same stuff to me and he kept trying to initiate a conversation with me when I made it clear that I wasn't interested, how persistent he was I was surprised he has a gf as he had the persistency of a single guy. If that makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His response here to this woman making it clear the conversation was over is a big red flag, it may seem harmless to some but it's not, its so passive aggressive &amp; it's clear she didn't want him to respond #aidenhatfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WARNING: #aidenhatfield CLOTHES BRAND IS STILL ON @instagram  HE TEMPORARILY BLOCKED HIS FOLLOWERS TO MAKE THEM THINK HE TOOK THE PAGE DOWN, HE'S THEN REFOLLOWED EVERYONE, IVE BLOCKED THIS PAGE &amp; ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME &amp; @MindCharity STOP ACCEPTING DONATIONS OFF HIM  https://t.co/Gw0m2s0nDr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pigletish @Twitter Ditto, the moment I started being followed on Instagram by @PRK_LA (a music group 2 of my male role models I look up to are in) he suddenly started following me on Instagram too "like no a**hole u victim blamed me on twitter, I blocked ur a** so shove ur heart emojis up ur a**"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMPORTANT: IF ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF #aidenhatfield PLEASE SPEAK OUT! EVEN IF IT WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT PLEASE SPEAK OUT! NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL YOU THINK IT IS IT'S STILL VALID, SO PLEASE SPEAK OUT &amp; LETS EXPOSE THIS PREDATOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Importance of speaking out; it starts a ripple effect.  If I hadn't seen #aidenhatfield trending on twitter today, I probably would never have spoken out about why I had to block him last year &amp; many others who've shared their stories now too probably wouldn't have either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Importance of people coming forward about stuff like what's happened with #aidenhatfield is it starts a ripple effect &amp; encourages more &amp; more people to break the silence &amp; speak out, I've now spoken out &amp; I encourage others to do the same, the feeling of relief is undescribable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpdChameleon Done and thank you so much. I've explained in the post what's happened as I'd posted about him in the past warning people he was creating fake accounts of himself to try to get himself verified online but the blog helps explain everything better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou They need to be taken down &amp; @MindCharity needs to make a statement on this as he was exploiting them to boost his credibility so he could exploit vulnerable people's mental illnesses, by tying himself to Mind a reputable organisation it gave false credibility to his followers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpdChameleon Is it okay if I share the site link to this blog to a rape awareness page I run on Facebook please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou Me too, feel sorry for her has got to be a shock for her and his family. He was a d*** to me last year &amp; got sick of him making those fake accounts of himself to try to get verified was so obvious it was him creating them it was laughable but didn't think he was capable of this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using being a #mentalhealth advocate as an aesthetic to boost your music career is f***ING low but using being a mental health advocate to prey on vulnerable women &amp; excuse victim blaming people is just f***ING sick. He used people's mental health to prey on them  #aidenhatfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that all of #aidenhatfield pages/accounts on social media are all down &amp; even his clothing brands are, is a blatant admission of his guilt, as he hasn't even tried to defend himself or deny any of this instead all his accounts are now down on multiple platforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tripped when I was buying necessities and cut both my heels open, didn't think it was that bad... Until I got into a shop and the shop assistant asked if I was okay nodding towards my shoes &amp; sure enough blood was dripping down my heels &amp; down the back of my shoes onto the floor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#aidenhatfield has a f***ING daughter and he thinks it's okay to treat women that way, like WTAF? I already felt sorry for her last year when he victim blamed me as what kind of example was he showing his daughter &amp; I knew he was a dirt bag but now this OMFG, he's vile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact That sentence sounds like a dodgy porn title lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I  just want to say this; To #aidenhatfield  victims I'm so sorry you went through that &amp; thank you for speaking out.  What you've done has created chain reaction that has &amp; will encourage others including myself to speak out about his vile behaviour &amp; help expose him. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou Good morning, what's up? You seem fed up 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fsodofficial It was, like I'd been assaulted, I ran home crying &amp; threw my guts up as I couldn't get the taste of stale cigarettes &amp; cider out my mouth &amp; nose I was suicidal &amp; he told me it was my own fault like WTF? I've just posted a thread about him &amp; how he treated me when i followed him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sum this thread up Aiden Hatfield is a predator wannabe musician who uses being mental health advocate for @MindCharity as an aesthetic to harass his female followers &amp; boost his wannabe career. Steer clear of him &amp; to his victims I'm so sorry you've gone through this. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also just his whole attitude in general, he seemed to have an ego problem like he thought he was more famous than he actually was &amp; he was using mental health advocacy as an aesthetic also on Facebook he'd been shamed in groups via screenshots of him being nasty to his followers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aiden Hatfield always came across as very passive aggressive too towards his followers, like if none of his followers attended 1 of his free gigs he'd post a passive aggressive video about it online &amp; he posted very passive aggressive tweets about people in general, was odd. (8)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also got nasty with me on one occasion as I'm a rape survivor &amp; I'm open about that to help others &amp; he replied to one of my #metoo tweets telling me "I don't like reading about rape on my newsfeed when I'm having breakfast" i told him if he didn't like it just unfollow me (7)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It became obvious that he was just using being mental health advocate for @MindCharity as an aesthetic to boost his wannabe music career, hed get nasty &amp; jealous when people started being open on their own accounts about their own mental illness by sending them petty DM's etc (6)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got sick of him (was obviously him) creating catfish accounts of himself online &amp; then following his followers on them &amp; he'd post on his actual account asking his followers to report the fakes &amp; that hopefully @Twitter would verify him now he's famous enough for catfishes (5)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On multiple occasions Aiden Hatfield expressed sexist opinions that quite frankly promoted rape culture, 1 comment he made was "if a woman's going to post half naked pics of herself online she loses the right to get upset when men touch her without asking"  (4)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then Last year in early july a drunk guy tried to forcefully kiss me in a shop, I pushed him off me &amp; ran well Aiden heard about my trauma online &amp; personally DM-ed me telling me it was my own fault for wearing shorts &amp; if I dress like a sl*t men will treat me like one (3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was always really nice to me online &amp; kinda flirty until I got outed as FtM #transgender &amp; he changed it was like flicking a switch, he started arguements with me accusing me of being nasty to him when I wasn't, he'd be rude mannered &amp; asked me if I was sure I'm trans (2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @Aidenhatfield2  has been exposed as the predator &amp; false mental health advocate that he is, I'm going to post a thread of my own experiences with him last year; (1)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anxiety_Sugarr @AidenHatfield He victim blamed me last year when he heard online that a drunk guy had tried to forcefully kiss me in shop &amp; he DM-ed me personally &amp; told me it was my own fault for wearing shorts &amp; told me if I dress like a sl*t men will treat me like one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meds_meltdowns_ @AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @MindCharity I got sexually assaulted in July by a drunk guy who tried to forcefully kiss me in a shop, Aiden Hatfield saw my story online &amp; personally DM-ed me telling me it was my own fault for wearing shorts &amp; if I dress like a slut men will treat me like one. Like WTF dude I was assaulted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlinkandBurn @AidenHatfield I got sexually assaulted lin july by a drunk guy in a shop who tried to force his tongue down my throat &amp; I shoved him &amp; ran and Aiden Hatfield saw my story online &amp; DM-ed me &amp; told me it was my own fault for wearing shorts &amp; if i dress like a slut men will treat me like one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_doapsi I've received some responses to the screenshots, apparently he's notorious for making fake accounts under his name &amp; telling his followers to report the accounts for being fake &amp; unfollowing any of his followers who don't, he's doing it to try &amp; get his @twitter account verified<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_doapsi I know it was, I've had PTSD for 4 years the fact I'm at a point where I can finally talk about it is through years of therapy, I've screenshotted his little tantrum though &amp; shared it to a group warning others that he's false &amp; not a trustworthy advocate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_doapsi Agreed, I had a wannabe musician who claims to be a mental health advocate, victim blame for being sexually harassed &amp; yesterday I had his business Insta page get nasty with me because I've started being open about my PTSD since starting therapy &amp; he got angry about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being 👏 a👏 Mental 👏 health 👏advocate 👏is 👏not 👏 an 👏 aesthetic 👏 to 👏 boost 👏 your 👏 followers Only pretending to be a mental health advocate to boost your followers so it'll promote your other career when they follow your page is not supporting mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If u claim to be a #mentalhealth advocate but get nasty &amp; jealous with someone who gets more insta likes on their posts about their mental health than u, then u're not a mental health advocate, u're just using it as an aesthetic to boost ur followers which is extremely harmful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews &amp; Donald Trump spelt backwards is Bulls***, well technically it doesn't spell that but if he can make s*** up why can't we?  https://t.co/wPFO6psvQF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Why have no charges for neglect being brought against her family? Yes it's important suspects are questioned regarding her disappearance so the world can get closure on her disappearance but they left their children alone in a foreign country so they could hang out with friends?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I wouldn't be smiling if I was married to Donald Trump, all the trouble he's caused especially since he became president she"s probably terrified and miserable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Those rings do not look comfortable at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMail Really? He thinks that? Let's not forget him posting tweets on twitter encouraging violence against looters &amp; ordering police to tear gas &amp; fire rubber bullets at people protesting the murder of George Floyd, Trump's presidency is 1 of the worst things that's happened to America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Seems like the chicks died because he scared the mother bird off &amp; disturbed the nest when taking photos and videos of the nest, nothing to do with warm weather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I've learned about my son in lockdown;  He named his favourite teddy bear he carries everywhere "Dog Pee"  He was feeling very ill yesterday &amp; was getting scared &amp; he kept asking "where's dog pee?"

<|startoftext|>People who are more concerned with damage to properties and looting material items than the fact the protests were caused by #GeorgeFloyd murder are part of the problem, if you care more about material things than a person's life then you are part of the problem. #protests2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else ever lie in bed and start laughing at random words they think are funny? Like I'll be in bed and suddenly think "Durdle Door La Donna Sin sal  Uomini Le chat El gato"  And just start saying them out loud &amp; giggling to myself.  Or am I just weird?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brain right now;   1 part my brain: hmmm did @Pelathor call me "man" because he thinks I'm a cis man, does he know I'm trans &amp; is being polite or does he just call everyone man?  Other part my brain: Alex STFU you're tired   Another part of my brain: OH F*** WAS THAT A MOTH?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I look up to  @GregHetson   somethings got to give with some of his insta followers, received gross sexual borderline transphobic DM's off some of his followers, i'm going to Circle Jerks London gig &amp; several of Greg's followers have asked me for sex when i'm up London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent That's cool i prefer having sex outdoors anyway, the thrill of getting caught makes it more enjoyable. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thes schools/airports/etc that are taking people's temperature to check for #Covid-19 but how are they going to get an accurate reading when we're in the middle of a heatwave?

<|startoftext|>Happy Pride🏳️‍🌈 Month to all my wonderful followers, my 1st pride month as openly gay transman which feels weird to say the least but hey ho I'll be okay just nerve-wracking &amp; a bit scary but yeah cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cats are fat f***s, thought I had mice in the kitchen as I've noticed packets of cat food being nibbled open and eaten and the corners nibbled out of the boxes of cat biscuits, set up a sting in the kitchen to catch the culprit &amp; turns out my cats have been stealing their food<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First thing I'm doing after piercing/tattoo studios open back up is getting my lip pierced, planning on getting 5 piercings in my bottom lip, had a guy try to kiss me without consent last year so planning on getting 5 spikes put in my lip &amp; my septum pierced as I hate odd numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pelathor I still do s*** doodles of you from your manchester gig on my Insta account, only occasionally though gives me something to do when wi-fi's down &amp; I'm bored. Sketch Greg Hetson way too much though as he's good to do as practice sketches to post for the sake of consistency LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To answer DM's I struggle around this time of year about my pregnancy loss even though it happened in Dec 2016 is as I couldn't bury him until end of May as I had to get legal permissions to add him to the shared plot &amp; then my friend raped me a few weeks later. So yeah. #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I'm a bit miserable just lately but I'm just going through a lot It's approaching the 3rd anniversary of when I got raped again, My eldest's bowel problems are acting up, Dealing with the virus pandemic &amp; lockdown &amp; I'm just struggling a lot right now, I am really not okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the saddest realisations I had about my life was that I'm used to being lonely. It doesn't bother me anymore as I'm used to it &amp; I'd rather spend my days sitting alone with the curtains closed than be with people I care about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm used to doing everything alone &amp; I've accepted I'm not supposed to have anyone I'm supposed to be alone but sometimes I wish I had someone to just sit in silence and hold me no kissing, no talking &amp; no TV when I'm feeling mentally exhausted &amp; at breaking point. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If u're going to classify them as terrorists you should also class;  White people who commit mass shootings as terrorists Police officers who murder unarmed POC as terrorists Oh and You should be classed as one for using @twitter to encourage violence against looters &amp; protestors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feel like I want to cry but too numb to, like the tears are there they want to fall but they won't. Also got no appetite at all I want to eat as I understand that I need to eat to survive but got no desire to eat at all. Freaking frustrating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After some of the trauma I've survived the past 4 1/2years, sometimes I feel like I'm a ghost, like I didn't really survive the first trauma &amp; I'm just trapped in hell which is why bad s*** keeps happening.  There are days where I feel detached &amp; incapable of feeling anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't myself for a very long time last year and no one noticed, people just saw the cheery version of me but no one paid attention to the things I was painting🖌️, when I finally broke, people were so busy punishing for lashing out no one questioned why I was. #ArtistOnTwitter  https://t.co/AHZAEZ29kd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting mental health tip;  Instead of telling your kids "Don't cry" "You've got nothing to cry about"  "Boys don't cry"   Instead tell them; "It's okay to cry" "Tell me why it's upset you?"  "Do you want to talk about it?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always be nice to people as you have no way of knowing what's going on in their head; The person who seems happy could actually be suicidal &amp; is just manic. You have no way of knowing what's going on in their mind until they're ready to tell you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The thought of leaving lockdown is making me anxious, these past 2 months I've only walked to the shop around the corner to buy perishable necessities once every 6-9 days &amp; the thought of walking any further than that is stressing me the f*** out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailCeleb There's a deadly virus pandemic which has plunged millions into poverty &amp; unemployment, George Floyd was murdered, theres protests and riots &amp; Donald Trump is encouraging violence against looters but sure the REAL tragedy is a Kardashian no longer being classed as a billionaire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter can you ban Donald Trump already? His tweets are dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The state of America;  Where police care more about protecting possessions from angry protestors than protecting the people that police are murdering, which sparked the protests in the first place. #GeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caseyundercvr What angered me is the radio silence, if he was doing what I've done &amp; posting on business account &amp; leaving insta stories &amp; posts on non business account just for updates on George Floyd then FAIR ENOUGH, but it's the radio silence across his accounts then posting golf photos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews It doesn't matter that he had a criminal record, what matters is the sheer police brutality used against him, he was being arrested for a crime, was already in handcuffs and the police murdered him for it. There's white people doing worse crimes who aren't murdered by police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caseyundercvr Agreed I lost last bit of respect for a musician today as there's protests &amp; riots resulting from the #georgefloydmurder down the road from where he lives &amp; he's posting pics from his golfing trip on Insta whilst the protests are going on &amp; his insta is silent on the issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK There's a difference between raising child in a way where they're not pressured to conform to gender stereotypes &amp; forcing a child not to conform to gender stereotypes. Raising a boy &amp; letting him play with dolls/wear tutus if he asks to is 1 thing but pressuring him to is wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GeorgeFloydMurder has taught us about Trumps America; 1)a video has to go viral for white people to be arrested for racism 2)preaches pro life then encourages murder of looters 3)it's "ok" to use tear gas during a respiratory virus pandemic 4)he's only pro life if you're white<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkoko71 @ericlondon1984 @SkyNews Thank you for the screenshot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yet he's on twitter daily even encouraging murder against protestors who are protesting the murder of #GeorgeLloyd by tweeting stuff like "when the looting starts, the shooting starts"  Great logic Trump murdering people who are protesting a murder, to protect peoples possessions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Meh this may be true but still doesn't give men the right to tell random women they should smile more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just a thought; I wonder how many people say "f*** off" whenever my name pops up there phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror What sickens me most about what's happened is the fact he wasn't supposed to have been released, he had been arrested before for rape &amp; released, arrested again for rape &amp; released &amp; now he's raped again, the people who released him the first time have blood on their hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important for people: You should never out someone as #LGBTQ  in general but especially if they admit they're feeling confused &amp; are questioning their sexuality or gender identity as last thing they need is the trauma of being outed whilst going through a difficult time mentally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I'd rather be a Karen for wanting to keep gay sex legalised, than be a c*** for wanting it to be illegal.  #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews No you're a Karen if you think gay sex should be illegal as they're all like "think of the children" *faints*, they're just trying to fuel anti gay propaganda by calling straight white women Karen if they support gay rights as they hate being called that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I wish people told me growing up; There's nothing wrong with being confused, there's no set age u should have ur sexuality &amp; gender identity figured out, it's not black and white, so it's okay if u feel confused &amp; are questioning ur identity even if u're an adult. #lgbt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bugs me when people say I don't need to start T or get the surgery as I pass as male well enough already  Like yeah I do need to start T as my voice is too high it makes me cringe &amp; I need the surgeries as I want a real penis &amp; not just a rolled up sock &amp; I hate wearing binders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People think I changed my name to Alex as I'm trans but it's actually as I went through trauma that was posted in local newspapers &amp; newsites &amp; I couldn't escape it, even after testifying in court I had to leave out secret exit as I was being hounded so I moved &amp; changed my name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's obsessed with Lego so throwing him a Lego themed birthday party this year,  Everything from the cakes to the gifts and wrapping paper are all going to be Lego themed &amp; have decorations in block shapes  He can't have his friends over this year so need to make it awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Instead of accusing someone of overreacting to something instead try asking them why they reacted to the situation that way.  It'll save so much heartache by simply trying to understand them instead of judging them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to cancel my holiday plans this year due to Covid_19 so using the money I would've spent instead to go big on my son's birthday plans and celebrate the fact he's got accepted into his new school<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MetroUK This is so weird, literally only time I've helped my mom shower was when her boyfriend battered her &amp; broke her ribs &amp; she had her head stapled but wasn't like that I stayed fully clothed sitting on edge of the bath whilst she sat in the bath with a face cloth over her privates<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Assholes comparing being lgbt to pedophilia; A difference between #LGBT relationships &amp; pedophilia is consent LGBT relationships are between consenting adults, "relationships" between a pedo &amp; child is forced by grooming/manipulation/threats/coercion so they're not the same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews This has made my day, thank you US navy. Piddles me off that trans people aren't allowed in the military to fight for their country but a cisgender man accused of sex offences is allowed to be president and run a whole country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Can dispel abuse myths through proper education regarding abuse, teach about abuse in schools to educate people from an early age, abuse survivors being open about their experiences #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Reasons people listen to the myths are;  - Denial about abuse in general - their loved ones been accused and they're just trying to justify their behaviour some how - ignorance - can't accept that there isn't a reason for abuse, nothing makes them abuse someone #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think the myths originate from abusers flying monkeys who were in a position/job/class where they could influence more people easier, e.g. abusers friends/family deliberately spreading misinformation regarding abuse to excuse their friends/loved ones behaviour #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Abuse myths;  - "lightning doesn't strike twice" (also heard that myth for rape)  - only happens to women  - only happens to women who look/are a certain way (basically stereotyping victims)   - mental abuse isn't real abuse  - men can't be abused/raped   #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lecanardnoir @PinkNews What? I don't really understand what you're trying to say but from what I've gathered from it.  I'm not stereotying him as a man, he identifies as male so therefore he's a man, I'm a man, I don't fit the male stereotype but I'd still want people to recognise me as my child's dad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who think #lockdown is oppression. This is oppression; - unarmed POC shot by cops - being beaten/raped/murdered for ur race/being #LGBT - hate crimes - politicians voting on whether or not u're allowed rights &amp; the fear the next president will take away ur current rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews If I didn't know he is trans I would've immediately thought he was the child's cisgender father, he's clearly a man so  it should state he's the child's father as it is pretty obvious he's the child's dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people in America claiming oppression because Karen can't get a haircut ... Try being #transgender and having your own dad tell you to go catch #COVID19 and die from it.  There's reasons #lgbt aren't claiming oppression right now even though lockdown means pride is cancelled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in America protesting &amp; claiming oppression as lockdown to prevent deadly virus spreading means Karen can't get a hair cut but #lgbt people aren't protesting claiming oppression as lockdown means pride events are cancelled.

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It has a severe impact on the child's mental health, missed appointments can cause the child to develop abandonment issues, arguing between parents can be harmful to the child's emotional development as well #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's raining and I'm so happy about it for 3 reasons; 1) hopefully a down pour of rain will encourage the people who are ignoring lockdown to stay indoors  2) it'll wash the spit off the pavements/things that covidiots are spitting on &amp; licking &amp; 3) i just ❤️ the rain. 🌧️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now the whole world is going through a traumatic situation together &amp; it's ok not to be ok.  Don't feel bad if u aren't that productive during lockdown, if the most u can get done each day is simply just getting out of bed, that's ok, #COVID19 is scary &amp; its ok to be scared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Catches an unusual fish so leaves it suffocate on the concrete whilst he takes a video instead of snapping a quick photo and putting it back in the water where it can go breed and create more unusual fish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfreya @SkyNews Sadly there's a lot of people who are treating this as a holiday &amp; aren't taking the situation seriously. They think working from home/homeschooling are holidays when it's not it's a terrifying situation &amp; right now the whole world is going through a traumatic situation together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Serves them right, they broke lockdown, a BBQ on a beach isn't a necessity and it's not their hour of exercise.  It's just taking the p***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Considering this is a new virus people don't know much about, I don't think herd immunity is a wise decision as it could massively increase the death toll and make the pandemic last longer than it would do from self isolation &amp; lockdown to flatten the curve &amp; lower the death toll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I think they should roll out a stricter lockdown but start with the biggest cities like London etc  Also I do think lockdown restrictions on cycling should be added where it's only allowed for people who cycle to &amp; from work (who have proof) &amp; not as a form of daily exercise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews RIP Died a hero.   ...  I think that when this pandemic is over @BorisJohnson  should request that plaques or a monument are made to remember the NHS workers/carers/frontliners who've lost their lives during this pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw someone post "God should be put back in the places we removed him from e.g schools, government"  No just no  U can't use ur own religion as guidelines for how a large amount of people that are made up of multiple religions/beliefs should live their lives, it doesn't work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People want to know when the lockdown will end? When people start taking the lockdown seriously enough to flatten the curve. If people continue to ignore lockdown, rate of #COVID19 infection will continue to rise &amp; then the death toll will rise &amp; the lockdown will remain in place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best things someone told me after I reported sexual harassment was; "You didn't overreact to being sexually harassed, you reacted normally to a scary situation but people overreacted to you reporting it"  #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Who is he? This is a legit question I have no clue, the only times I've ever heard of him is when he's spouting hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror The best thing that can be done right now; as a way of reducing risk of further pandemics is to ban wet markets like the one where the pandemic began, in all countries. If u've been to wet markets or seen footage taken there they're very unsanitary &amp; breeding grounds for disease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aimes_lou I used to have a pet rat called Teabag And another called Oreos I nicknamed Double Stuffed, he had black fur and a white patch on his stomach so when he was curled up in a ball he looked like an Oreo cookie I nicknamed him Double Stuffed though as he had a fat roll on his belly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Yes it is time to discuss a pay rise they're putting their lives in danger everytime they go to work. They deserve a pay rise as if anyone's earned one they definitely have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caz_foster Also Mid February; I was experiencing runny nose, a bad cough, frequent headaches &amp; severe shortness of breath, it passed after a few weeks, I was just starting a new medication though so I just brushed it off as side effects but I never actually checked the side effects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caz_foster My dad last year had a really bad cold that lasted nearly 3 months before he was fully over it &amp; my son did I took him to Dr's &amp; they told me it was a viral infection &amp; last year I had a hellish cold, my skin hurt &amp; my jaw felt like it was full of bubble wrap &amp; kept vomiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror We already have enough covidiots preaching conspiracy theories and scaring people the last thing we need is a public figure or a celebrity running their mouth making conspiracy theories as they have more influence on their fans so will do more harm than good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact I guess I'm secretly a squirrel then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror That is revolting he needs jailing. 🤢🤮  https://t.co/DTHFfhIha0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This lockdown is reminding me of in schools when the teacher keeps whole class behind because a few kids won't do as they're told.  Some people are ignoring social distancing rules so the whole country is being put on lockdown. If the country was a school we'd all be in detention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During lockdown please still be respectful of ur neighbors: - don't have music up so loud that it will disrupt their young children sleeping - don't have backyard bonfires the last thing NHS/ur neighbors need is burns/smoke inhalation  - do check on ur neighbors if u're concerned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of accusing people/children of overreacting to things, try asking them why they reacted the way that they did to it.  Things impact people differently what might not upset you that much might really upset someone else, so don't invalidate someone's reactions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Being on lockdown has made me realise how toxic some of  the people in my life are even family I've realised some are;  - extremely selfish - have anger issues - narcissistic &amp; gaslight me - use my mental health against me - are sexist/anti-lgbt   &amp; I don't need them anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to stop using #Covid19 to preach hatred if it has taught us anything it's that our lives can be turned upside &amp; we could die at any moment so we should love &amp; accept each others differences &amp; make sure when we die we don't leave behind memories of hatred &amp; oppression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews At least he apologized but FFS if covid-19 has taught us anything it's that our lives can be turned upside in a second, we could die at any moment so love &amp; let be people be who they truly are &amp; make sure when we die we don't leave behind a legacy of hatred and oppression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent I have a feeling there have been cases and he's had the infected people executed to prevent further spread. I could be wrong but that's just what my gut instinct is telling me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something about PTSD I wish people would understand is that when I'm anxious I'm not anxious about things that might happen but most likely never will, instead I'm anxious about things that have happened to me in the past that I'm scared of happening again. There's a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews This is heartbreaking 💔 He founded such a wonderful place for our community.  Manchester Gay Village is a wonderful place it's like my second home, I get home sick everytime I leave there it's the only place I have ever felt safe and accepted.  RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who thinks @BorisJohnson  will use the #COVID19Pandemic to try to privatise the NHS by using equipment shortages to claim they can't cope during a crisis? Even though Tories have been making cuts to the NHS for years so they didn't have equipment they needed to fight a pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how now that  @BorisJohnson  has tested positive for #COVID19 he's suddenly realised how important testing is to fighting this and he's suddenly hell bent ensuring that testing reaches their daily targets.  He shouldn't have had to get covid-19 to deliver on his promises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Growing up I used to hate it when people said I was mature for my age, as I wasn't I was just traumatised at an early age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Boris Johnson did order lockdown too late, he was too busy profiting off panic buyers and people's fear and allowing companies to do the same that he ignored the seriousness of the situation &amp; now he's tested positive is what's motivating him to actually deliver on his promises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun It's not trying to play it's trying to eat him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a promise to my son that when lockdowns lifted &amp; he's allowed back to school I'll let him take his cat to school &amp; I'm making good on my promise as long as she's kept on a lead/harness and i pick her up &amp; carry her on the premises I can bring her on the school run with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This is so cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mndflns4covid I know he lives with two other adults and a child who are all isolating but he's ignoring it which is putting them at risk as well as he's risking getting infected and bringing the virus back into their home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  A neighbor is showing symptoms of #COVID19 and bragging about still breaking lockdown rules and going out because "I want to, coronavirus is just a bad cold" even though he's been coughing his lungs up all night I could hear him through the walls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 🙂 #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline He was offered the chance by the family courts &amp; he refused as he &amp; I quote "the b*tch deserved it", "she's full of crap" &amp; "how dare you have the audacity to call me a woman beater &amp; a sex offender" (all were said to the judge) if he did 1 he'd lie to make progress #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline They might work if the perpetrator truly feels remorse and accepts full responsibility for their role in the abuse.  The programmes won't work though if the perpetrator doesn't want to change or still tries to justify their actions #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I'm not convinced, abusive people &amp; narcissistic people are extremely cunning liars they can fake improvements in their behaviour but they revert straight back to their abusive ways after finishing the programme. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I should be, I threw up a lot but don't think it's anything serious just think it's physical effects my anxiety disorder #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Being in lockdown has made me realize some stuff; - I'm definitely going to change my name officially after lockdown ends as I don't want my deadname put on my gravestone, - I am going to start transitioning And - I'm going to stop being afraid to correct people who misgender me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretending to come out as LGBT+ as an April fools joke isn't funny. LGBT people are murdered, raped, disowned by family, made homeless, verbally &amp; physically assaulted on a regular basis.

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks @davidtagactor My son played a prank on me this morning, he put a stack of books next to my bed &amp; put a mug filled with glitter on top so I knocked it over when I woke up. I've hoovered it up but still keep finding glitter everywhere, he thought it was hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline I really hope this is fake news as honestly this was one of my worries when I first heard about covid-19 so much so I went out &amp; bought my cats a new multilevel scratching post and lots of toys &amp; food so they wouldn't be bored on lockdown.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline The badgers have returned to the nature reserve near where I live, I haven't seen a badger in the wild since I was 18 so was just so wonderful. Badgers are one of my favourite animals so I'm overjoyed by this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fun during lockdown: listening to Poison Heart by @RamonesOfficial full blast &amp; trying to decide if I want to do a sketch of something off @PRK_LA Instagram page in my A3, A4 or A5 sketchbook whilst my medication side effects wear off. 💊🤔🖊️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK The best way to end the coronavirus lockdown is to stop ignoring the rules of the lockdown so less people spread it and get infected so this whole ordeal will be over faster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror 1) it's died by not killed by, it's a virus not a gun  2) they were in the vulnerable age range  3) another article said it was 2 of the people but this article says 4 of the people so which one is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've done so much stuff around the house during lockdown I've walked just over 25km simply by walking around the property whilst cleaning, home schooling, doing laundry &amp; hanging the laundry out on the washing line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow no one predicted that 🙄 What did people who selfishly hoarded fresh food think was going to happen? They were hoarding more food than they could eat simply because of selfishness and shops profiting from fear mongering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people who are bitching about having to stay at home... it's not that hard to do. Since lockdown began I've; - Caught up on sleep - Caught up on studying - Decluttered the house - Tidied the garden - my son's doing great with homeschooling &amp; - I've emptied the laundry basket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's disrespectful to the NHS when people flout social distancing/lockdown rules it's taking advantage of the NHS when they're lucky to live in a country with free healthcare &amp; where treatment for covid-19 won't leave them needing to remortgage their home to pay off medical debts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anambrachic1 Covid-19 has taught me that fear sells and that people care more about money than people's welfare and as long as they're exploiting people's fear for profit they don't care who suffers &amp; is left with nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You shouldn't be too mad about this though as yes misinformation &amp; lies in the media are dangerous in general but I doubt you would be president if the media only published the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My eldest cat is an indoor cat as she's on medication so I'm taking extra precautions to make sure she doesn't leave the garden during the #CoronaLockdown as I'll probably end up being arrested if I'm running around the streets shouting "TIDDLYWINKS"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the0nly1uneed Qurntin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to think the reason NHS workers aren't being tested for coronavirus is the government is taking an ignorance is bliss approach &amp; are scared that if they test positive they'll need to stop working so there will be less NHS staff in the hospital to treat the already sick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline guy where I live tried to stab a security guard with dirty hypodermic needle for asking the guy to stick to the stores 2per customer rule on produce 2nd guy got arrested for licking handles of shopping trolleys &amp;  Some teens got arrested for smashing shop windows during lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline That looks like an ostrich not an alpaca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews When I was going through my straight phase being anti LGBT was a deal breaker for me, if they so much as even gave a negative look at something LGBT related it was bye bye bigot, I even started admitting that I supported LGBT rights on 1st date to find out if they were anti lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you to the NHS &amp; carers for your hardwork, dedication and willingly risking your lives to save others during this #CoronavirusPandemic you are doing this country so proud.  #clapforourcarers   (Posted this doodle on Insta yesterday too incase I was unable to post it today)  https://t.co/3w3bmWq6d7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK I watched a documentary about them, they're good loving parents &amp; provide for their children well but I think she &amp; her partner should speak to therapists as it seems like they have unresolved childhood issues that are fueling their need to constantly have more children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering people aren't taking this lockdown seriously can @BorisJohnson instead just hire people to drive around the streets in hearses with (empty) different sized coffins in decorated with funeral flowers to scare idiots into starting to take this lockdown seriously?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just realised humans invented words in general but they also invented the word "words" to label what they'd invented. 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did someone even decide to invent words and letters? Like were they doing a cave drawing trying to get their thoughts in their head out and then realised the drawing looked like how the words they were thinking should look like? If that makes sense I think it makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a thought but which came first the invention of words or the alphabet? Like did people invent words first then invent the alphabet to assign letters to the words  Or Did someone invent the alphabet first then invent words out of the letters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realised that humans invented reading as humans invented words so at one point nobody in the human race knew how to read, it must have been so weird when someone wrote the first word ever, like "hey I wonder what the words I'm saying look like I'm going to invent words"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An increasing problem I've noticed with social distancing during the #CoronavirusPandemic is that the people who are being told to work from home aren't seeing this as social distancing they're seeing it as a work holiday so aren't social distancing &amp; are putting people at risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Can we do a public survey to see how many of these homophobic religious people have gotten divorces?

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Why pray to God asking him to help stop the spread of the virus but then ignore his answers?

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline #abusetalk  https://t.co/encFmZ8pYb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the most vulnerable people during this #coronavirus outbreak are the people who are being abused,  Children who are abused by parents/guardians are off school &amp; stuck at home with them People being abused by their partners are stuck indoors all day with their abusers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people panic buying perishables like gallons of milk/eggs/bread are really confusing me, buying long life cartons of milk with long expiration dates makes sense but buying bulk milk/eggs/bread that will go stale before they've even made a dent in their hoard makes no sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK &amp; yet he's refusing to close the schools,  There's 41 kids in just my sons class, 3 teachers/teaching assistants, &amp; 12 staff supervising the playground at break time So thats atleast 41 parents doing the school run so 1 infected child in 1 class can infect atleast 96 other people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RustyGoodDalek1 @PinkNews I'm a Christian &amp; LGBT &amp;  my local parish don't preach hate they still let me get my kids baptised, accept communion, go to mass &amp; they even told me God created everyone including the LGBT community so when we're told to love everyone that literally means everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Getting divorced is also a sin but that hasn't stopped her getting divorced multiple times.  How is it fair that she gets to be married four times to four different men and no one stops her but she feels she has the right to stop same sex couples getting married even once?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless of your religious views one of the most disrespectful things a person can do is eavesdrop on someone's prayers And It's even more disrespectful to get angry with the person about what they were praying about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @domesticshelter When preparing to leave it's important to; - accept that it's abuse and not make excuses for their behaviour - make sure they try to leave in the safest way possible  - have somewhere to go even if it's just a temporary shelter #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @domesticshelter I didn't tell anyone I planned to leave as no one knew what was going on, my family had barely seen me in months &amp; were suspicious but they thought I'd moved in with him to be closer to my jobs as it was a lengthy commute but my bosses hadn't heard off me in months #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @domesticshelter I wish I'd known how helpful children's services are, my ex brainwashed me to fear them saying they'd take my baby away at birth if I told them what he'd done to me but they actually were wonderful they helped me get furniture for my home &amp; apply for school/new home #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @domesticshelter Yes, I have a safety plan in place at home, I also have a safety plan in place at my kids school in case he shows up, they have a pic of him &amp; security alert so if he shows up near the premises the police are called so the school goes on lockdown whilst he's arrested. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's Asshole encounter;  There were dad's on the afternoon school run catcalling the mom's who were picking their kids up from school, there was a group of 4 of them wolf whistling at the moms &amp; making comments comparing the moms asses. They were doing it in front of the kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel numb still can't believe today's asshole encounter, just can't believe I saw and heard a man say that a woman is too ugly to be alive.

<|startoftext|>Ok just a FYI  It's never ok to accuse a woman/transman/gender non conforming person of being on their period, as an insult just because they've called you out on your crappy behaviour.  Periods aren't insults or sexist remarks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whenever I see old gravestones where there's only one name on there &amp; a large space underneath it I always find myself wondering if their partner was supposed to have been buried in the same plot but their partner remarried after they'd died so wasn't buried with them.<|endoftext|>

She's forcing her prejudices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overhead someone talk about how since the #coronavirus outbreak they started Washing their hands after using the toilet like wait what?

<|startoftext|>Kinda shaken up, was out up the park playing #PokémonGo and there was gunshots fired &amp; armed police showed up. A guy was kinda shot in broad daylight during a drug deal gone wrong.

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I look after myself better now,  I workout daily, I let myself indulge in junk food without feeling guilty, I play online games that make me happy &amp; i pray daily now. I also do art whether it's sketching or painting every day #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I was like a new person after the relationship ended I was able to take care of myself properly I was able to eat what I wanted &amp; when I wanted so I gained weight, I showered everyday, wore clean clothes &amp; underpants everyday &amp; was able to start buying stuff for my son #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I did as best as I could considering he controlled every aspect of my life literally controlled everything from what I ate to how often I was allowed to shower &amp; change my clothes but I did my best to take care of myself and my unborn baby  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FBPE75 @PinkNews Huh? Which women has spotted who as male?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Just transphobes and homophobes who deliberately follow LGBT pages on social media just to post hateful abuse.  Like really?

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Rick Astley's cameo when Kim left will always be my favourite. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking back it's hard to pin point just 1 moment I knew I hated my abuser but 1 of them was;  When I was pregnant I suffered with severe morning sickness &amp; exhaustion &amp; he called me fat &amp; lazy b**ch for it but when he had a hangover he made me take care of him like I was his mom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Why is it heterosexual people post pics of themselves practically naked &amp; dry humping each other &amp; @Twitter doesn't sensor it but it sensors LGBT posts even ones where they're not kissing?

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think everyone should be given the right to appeal a courts decision and verdict and a time frame of around 12weeks however an exception to the time limit should be made if new evidence comes to light after the courts decision has been made #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The media needs to stop stating if criminals are gay or transgender in their news articles, it pushes prejudices towards the #LGBT community as it makes them all out to be bad people, when the media publishes articles on hetero/cisgender criminals they don't specify that though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK How is her being transgender relevent to the story? u could've just said "woman" regardless of the crimes she's commited she's still a woman, when u post articles about cisgender women u don't add the words "cisgender woman" on the article seems like ur trying to push prejudices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to block someone for sharing sick memes about #carolineflack  Really? She's dead and people are already creating sick memes about her?

<|startoftext|>Something I'm sick of since surviving abuse &amp; rape is people trying to pressure me into getting into a new relationship. A new relationship doesn't mean 💩 in my recovery, a relationship is a want not a need I don't need a relationship or need sex to recover #abusetalk #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Abuse is abuse &amp; mental health doesn't justify that &amp;  the CPS were right to persue the allegations, that being said she didn't deserve to die, she didn't deserve to be hounded to death by online trolls, newspapers &amp; misinformation regarding the allegations made against her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These newspapers that are posting tributes to her today less than 48hours ago were slandering her &amp; dragging her name through the mud. #Carolineflack deserved better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CarolineFlack was hounded by the press when she was vulnerable, people make mistakes &amp; she didn't deserve to die for hers  They dragged her name through the mud &amp; didn't respect her privacy so she could recover from her demons instead they tormented her &amp; became 1 of her demons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such tragic news about #CarolineFlack  This has hit me hard, honestly people should always be nice to each other as you never know what's going on in a person's personal life.  The press didn't just kick her when she was down they stampeded her to death, she deserved better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Really? You're posting this crap? You were horrible about her yesterday, haven't you thought that maybe your words hurt her, maybe seeing your bull**** online pushed her over the edge?

<|startoftext|>I can't sleep so I'm lying in bed listening to Small Bump by Ed Sheeran on repeat.  💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes there are days where it hits me that the person I was before the rape &amp; abuse is dead, my body physically survived but that person that I was before it happened doesn't exist anymore. I still grieve for that part of me though, it's still hard to accept they're gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the hardest things I had to accept as a rape survivor was that I can never escape the scene of the crime as my body is the crime scene, I just have to learn how to make it a nicer place to live in instead of trying to outrun it. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate being touched; They only way to understand how it feels to me, is to grab a handful of ur skin on ur stomach or side &amp; squeeze it as hard as possible &amp; then slowly pull it whilst twisting it in your hand &amp; don't stop even when it hurts That's how it feels all over my body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter: Me! I'm the asshole in this encounter.

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline My confidence has improved in front of the camera, I love taking photos of myself whenever I feel confident or happy with my outfit.

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline When people take a photo of me I feel extremely self conscious and anxious but when I take photos of myself and I'm in control, I feel confident in how I look and can't wait to post them on Instagram to show them off #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline When I look at recent photos I feel emotional in a good way. Seeing the sparkle back in my eyes, the joy back in my smile, the colour back in my cheeks &amp; seeing myself dressed in the way that I feel comfortable with instead of how he wanted me to makes me feel proud #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It makes me cry looking at photos of me from when I was with my abuser, I look broken, my eyes are filled with fear, my hairs dirty and greasy, my posture is slumped and defeated &amp; my skin is pale and chalky. It's heart breaking to look at. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks 1) really? Back to the pig farm, we've only just had that storyline end 2) I don't think Edward is a real doctor I think he's made it all up 3) kill off Edward, hes making Tonys mental health recovery uncomfortable to watch 4) Edwards a sexist pig constantly telling him to man up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hate when anti-lgbt people disown their loved one when they come out as lgbt then play the victim acting all grief stricken by their loss, like really? They're not the victim, they disowned their loved one for being #LGBT their loved one is the victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved Scott's dream lol was so very...Scott lol #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whenever people try to use being "old fashioned" to justify being hateful towards #LGBT people to me, I just ask them what type of mobile phone they have.  As if they were so old fashioned they wouldn't own a mobile phone as they weren't around when they were younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This episode of #hollyoaks is intense. I hate Mitchell but his grandad is evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd love it if there was an LGBT Joker, like a version of the Joker where he was raised in a community with rampant homophobia &amp; "old fashioned" anti #lgbt values &amp; eventually he snaps &amp; starts terrorising the community that oppressed him with a male Harley Quinn as his boyfriend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really don't want Mitchell and Scott to end up together, quite frankly I don't want Mitchell to end up with anyone, he plays the victim to justify his bad behaviour, like yeah he's struggling with his sexuality but that doesn't justify being homophobic &amp; abusive #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MenAreNotVeryGoodAt Understanding that there's nothing shameful about crying, it's okay for men to cry, I'd rather have a man come to me crying about his problems than have me crying at his funeral as he's bottled it up &amp; committed suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MenAreNotVeryGoodAt Handling rejection &amp; understanding the concept when it comes to dating if at first you don't succeed leave her the f*** alone, repeatedly asking a woman out on a date who's said she's not interested in him, isn't cute it's creepy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A night at the hospital and been given the heaviest and biggest prescription I've ever seen in my life.  There's 28 items in it.  My son's got a blockage in his bowel &amp; hasn't been able to pass gas or poop in over a week &amp; been running a fever &amp; having severe stomach pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the0nly1uneed 😠 extremely so  Asked babysitter to pick up my son's prescription as he was up a&amp;e all night and I didn't want to leave him with the babysitter in case he took another turn and they went fishing instead of getting his medication so had to send them back out to get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks His character name makes it hard to take him seriously. He sounds like a porn star or male stripper name.  His acting is good but kinda hoping he gets married off and takes their surname lol #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when people try to justify rape by saying "they was asking for it" Rape is done without the victims consent so the victim literally cannot ask for it.  If a victim asked to be raped it wouldn't be rape, it's that simple.  #metoo #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop claiming that rapist's shouldn't have their life ruined over "a mistake"  Rape isn't a mistake.  A mistake is accidentally; buying orange juice with pulp when they asked for no pulp  Spilling red wine on someone's white carpet.  Rape isn't a mistake it's a choice. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I've learned as an adult: Any health drinks that have the words; "detox", "colon cleanser" or "aids digestion" in the title are just short for "This gross textured drink will give you sudden diarrhoea, rancid gas &amp; vomiting at the same time"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Consent creates boundaries and people can have the freedom to do things without worrying about overstepping the other person's boundaries as it's already been established at the beginning that they feel comfortable with it. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline People need to be educated on consent from early age and their right to say no. Consent is a human right, people have a right to say no to something they don't want to do &amp; the worst things that happened in my life happened as someone didn't respect my right to say no #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Consent isn't open to interpretation it's either yes or no and if you're unsure stop everything and ask again.  It's that simple; Yes - ok do it No - no don't do it Unsure - stop and ask again so you'll know for sure if it's yes or no. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Consent is permission for something to go ahead and it can't happen unless all parties involve agree it can  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Society needs to end the stigma &amp; victim blaming of rape victim's experiencing sexual arousal &amp; orgasms during rape. As it discourages rape victims reporting it as they worry that people will think they consented &amp; are crying rape or think that they enjoyed being raped #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A rape victim having an orgasm during rape doesn't mean they're consenting. There are a lot of sensitive nerve endings in a person's genitals so even during a rape the victim can involuntarily experience sexual arousal &amp; orgasm.  It doesn't invalidate their trauma. #MeToo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine the reaction if #LGBTQIA people said 💩 like this: - cisgender isn't real they need to see a psychiatrist - cisgenders a mental illness - hetero/cis is a trend - everyones cis/hetero nowadays - *pulls out Bible* god said he hates figs not f*gs  - they should be sterilised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine the reaction if #lgbt people said stuff like this:  - I don't believe in heterosexuality it's not real, - being hetero is a choice, - they're only hetero as they couldn't get someone of the same sex - being hetero is just a phase - hetero is unnatural it should be illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important you can't "disagree with" or "not believe in" a person's identity.  A person's race, gender, sexuality, disability etc they aren't choices, believe in them or not they exist.  Things you can disagree with: Pineapple on pizza, Kirk or Piccard, pickles on pizza etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetterOnWheels @TransActualUK @DailyMailUK Agreed both need more funding to be honest, regarding treatment of trans &amp; gender non conforming pregnant people as well as disabled pregnant people as unfortunately there's a lot of hatred &amp; ignorance towards both in society so both should get more funding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK It's 2020, Genitals don't determine gender anymore so more does need to be done to improve treatment of pregnant men &amp; of trans &amp; gender non conforming people in general. A person's gender identity isn't a choice but choosing to be ignorant is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved ones of #lgbt people  It's not your right to out them. If you find out they're LGBT before they've told you themselves then just keep your mouth shut okay? They haven't told you yet for 1 reason ... They're simply not ready to so don't out them, wait until they feel ready<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People's attitudes towards being LGBT are like people's attitude towards pineapple on pizza;  Some people like it Some people don't &amp; Most people who don't like haven't even tried it Yet no one has made pineapple on pizza illegal simply as they don't like it... Unlike being #LGBT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I use instagram to share photos of my artwork as it's a good platform to share it on &amp; I hang my paintings and sketches around my house it makes me happy seeing them as they're colourful &amp; abstract so they help my home reflect my personality. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline What I love about making art is as even before trauma I struggled to function normally I struggle to recognise sarcasm &amp; I struggle with sensory overload like noises etc trigger them so it helps me process the chaos in my brain in ways that I can visualize &amp; understand #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Sketching and painting is helping my recovery as it gives me a way of expressing what's going on in my brain when I struggle to find the words to verbalise it &amp; Crochet helps I make blankets out of scrap yarn, doinh a small ball of yarn during an anxiety attack helps  #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield He jumped in muddy puddles 5 minutes before he was supposed to go into class and had to have clean trousers, shoes and socks bought in &amp; I didn't find out he'd stole my house keys until I went to pick him up at the end of the day his teacher found my keys in his pocket<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @APositiveStart People are taught stranger danger &amp; to fear strangers from early age so we grow up fearing strangers so we end up in denial &amp; less willing to accept when it's someone we know committing the crime, when I've only ever been abused/raped by people I knew #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @APositiveStart Honestly gender stereotyping made me a people pleaser; I was raised under strict gender roles &amp; as a female I was taught to hide my feelings with a smile, serve everyone else before I served myself, to apologize almost obsessively &amp; to stay quiet instead of speaking up #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @APositiveStart People pleasing from my own experience means putting my own needs on the back burner in order to please other people, lacking my own boundaries and the inability to say no to people in order to make them happy &amp; caring way too much about what other people think #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @APositiveStart The main difference between the two is: Coercive control is done for the benefit of the toxic parent not the child Whereas pushy parenting is done for the benefit of the child but can do more harm than good. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People shouldn't use a person's past trauma to decide whether their reaction to current trauma is valid.  E.g. Person has a history of being raped so that validates them being upset by sexual harassment  Even though these things are traumatic regardless of a person's past trauma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Point I'm going to make; My past trauma shouldn't be what validates my new trauma July I got harassed at a gig by a creep &amp; few hours later got woken by a creep in my hotel room when I was asleep in my underpants &amp; People accused me of overreacting until they found out I had PTSD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I didn't know what to do but my bank was incredibly supportive and provided me with so much support to clear my debt &amp; I had support from my loved ones who surprised me by buying everything I needed for my baby as baby shower gifts &amp; gave me gift cards for baby stuff #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline My bank referred me to fraud department to deal with him using my account without my consent so it sorted out my debt &amp; I'm still rebuilding my savings as I had next to nothing left but I'm working on it &amp; being realistic with saving a few pounds a week #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes massively, he bled my savings and ran me up into debt so took months to get stuff sorted with the fraud team to get the debt transferred to him to pay off &amp; I was pregnant &amp; it took months to sort out my benefits &amp; I had no money left to buy anything for my baby #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline People who've experienced it have better understanding of survivors as they've been in similar situation so they're less likely to victim blame them also since escaping I'm sick of people who've never been in that situation telling me what I should've done differently #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline If health care professionals were better educated on the red flags a better understanding of why victims don't "just leave" they'd be able to provide better support to victims of abuse to help them escape &amp; be able to refer survivors to services that would help them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes I told them outright after I escaped but I got victim blamed badly Dr's told me "if the abuse was that bad why didn't you get an abortion?", "sorry he did that to u but u must have loved him at some point", "u had Mental health issues u were easy prey" etc it stung #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I tried to but he came with me to all of my appointments so I couldn't say it, also there were so many red flags there that something was wrong but the medical professionals failed to acknowledge them even though looking back it was glaringly obvious #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Also I keep leaflets for domestic abuse groups on the notice boards at my loved ones homes so they can research it at a time that they feel comfortable with to help educate them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I was and still am very open and honest about my trauma with people, I've never sugar coated it or treated words like abuse &amp; rape like they're dirty shameful words that shouldn't be spoken out loud. Every story shared is another life saved. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 2) i expected not just due to how dangerously immature he is but how possessive he was it was apparent to everyone when we were together he wasn't in love with me he was obsessed with me so I knew before I escaped him he believed if he couldn't have me no one could #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I expected it long before I escaped him, he was an immature little boy trapped in a man's body &amp; he is still so dangerously immature i expected it &amp; I was right he &amp; his mother made my life a living hell from the moment he was released on bail after being arrested #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline He used more indirect means to abuse me after I escaped sending emergency services to my house claiming me &amp; my son had been shot or trapped in a burning building, Made dozens of false child abuse/neglect claims against me Got his family/friends to harass me/my family #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline The abuse was more financial abuse after I left him; he nearly bankrupted me using a bank account I no longer used to pay for drugs &amp; alcohol &amp; his lawyer in the court case, I found out, my bank got the police to order him to pay back the debt &amp; his lawyer dropped him #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 3) he stalked me and my family, Mentally abused me by posting vile insults about me online by setting up a horrific facebook group about me using my photos Breached the restraining order in the court building &amp; got him &amp; his family to block the doors to the court #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yep don't even get me started;  1) He did court harassment and dragged me through the family courts for 2 years then laughed on the day of the verdict saying he never wanted access to my son he just wanted to p*ss me off as it was a legal way to keep me in his life #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have so little faith in any of the candidates in tomorrow's election I'm deeply considering not even voting I've always voted since I was old enough to vote but how can I vote for someone to run our country that I have no faith in not to screw us over?  #GeneralElection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly don't know who to vote for tomorrow as I have no faith at all in any of the candidates, I'm at that point where I'm just trying to decide who's going to do the least long term damage to the UK. #GeneralElection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone made me cry happy tears today:   Me *in a cafe with my son*  Woman to my son: absolutely beautiful... just like their mom  Me: awwww *starts getting weepy*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst date I went on: Guy gave me a coupon for buy one get one free on entry admission to the venue &amp; I had to pay for my own admission so he got in free as he didn't bring his wallet &amp; when I bought myself a sandwich he grabbed half of my sandwich &amp; my drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear society:  Instead of telling women they should smile more why don't people give women a reason to smile instead.  Sincerely It's not a freaking compliment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoolBoizToyz Yeah and nobody asked for your opinion. I'm just tweeting my thoughts?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I think if sienna ever found out she'd say: "why didn't you just use artificial insemination instead? You didn't need to have sex"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people live their life like they think people will be reading out their bank balance in their eulogy ... And it really shows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact At the end of your life you will be remembered for how you treated others not for your possessions so stop living your life like you think it'll be your bank balance &amp; possessions that people will talk about in your eulogy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'd give up sex.  I've gone over two years without it I can go the rest of my life lmao 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It can cause; - lack of trust in adults - mental illness - feeling discouraged from reporting any future incidents - feelings of self blame  - can negatively affect their future relationships #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Be patient &amp; respect their boundaries by not pressuring them to tell everything at once, build trust, let them talk about it in stages if they need to.   Provide them with reassurance and let them know that it's not their fault &amp; honestly just listen to them. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline We need to give children a safe place to talk about what's going on;  We need to educate ourselves on the red flags of abuse to spot the signs so we can initiate a conversation with them about our concerns We need to provide the child with resources to get help #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Not really, as (from loved ones who've been in this situation) whenever a child has a negative opinion about the abusive parent the courts accuse the victim of poisoning the child against the other parent #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Why didn't they just use an artificial insemination kit to do it? Ya kno instead of having sex with each other, they could've ordered one off the internet instead. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing Meh  Either Ramones when Richie Ramone was the drummer Or Circle Jerks as Greg Hetson = ❤️❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Societies expectations of women are contradictary, women are expected to look a certain way but at the same time be the complete opposite.  These contradictions are so extremely opposite that there is literally no way a woman can be both, there's no middle ground between them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in a society where working mothers are expected to work like they don't have kids &amp; at the same time raise their kids like they don't have a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing Listening to Steps songs and listening to Disney sounds tracks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks @Twitter I'm not happy about it I bought a really pretty new outfit to cheer myself up &amp; now I can't spam my newsfeed with pics of it. I might sound like a spoilt brat right now but I've had 2 kids I like posting selfies where I feel confident in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorPolitics When he says that does he also mean his own kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing Things i love about winter;  - reading a book in a cafe whilst drinking a seasonal coffee - taking my kids to see santa - snow - dressing up as Santa for my kids on Christmas day - mince pies - Christmas cookies - candy canes - woollen mittens - eating soup on a freezing cold day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I hate judgemental assholes. I love my ear stretchers, when I'm old and my hairs dyed to hide my gray hair I'm going to look at my saggy ear lobes and reminisce on the good times I had when I was younger, I'll feel nostalgic not regretful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People ask victims why didn't they just leave but No one asks what was done to make them fear the consequences of leaving so badly it felt safer to stay in the abuse than to escape it. People assume leaving abuse is as easy as walking away from any other relationship #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Sorry I was very late lol ☺️ my son was in a tantrum/epic meltdown mood so was busy trying not to rip my hair out from frustration I've finally gotten him to sleep now though. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @OpenClasp People are listened to but not heard, even though huge steps have been taken to help support victims of coercive control &amp; in all other forms of trauma/abuse there is still so much stigma &amp; victim blaming around it which makes it hard for survivors to be heard #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @OpenClasp People need to be educated on coercive control to help them spot the red flags to help them get out &amp; to spot the signs someone is a victim of it in order to provide them with support to escape it.  Also more services need to be available to support survivors #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @OpenClasp The impact of coercive control on the victim is that they stop living their life &amp; instead adapt to survive it instead. They can develop trauma bonds with the abuser &amp; lose their independence which results in them becoming completely dependent on the abuser #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @OpenClasp Coercive control: Can be a pattern of abusive/controlling behaviour that intimidates, threatens and manipulates the victim into becoming dependent on their abuser &amp; manipulating them into staying in the abusive situation. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I escaped an abusive relationship everyone asked me; "why didn't you just leave?" Yet no one ever asked my abuser what they'd done to make me too afraid to just leave them.   #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Really? There are LGBT Muslims &amp; people of colour too it's just most of them are just too afraid to come out due to people like these protestors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I agree with what the pharmacy has done, Emergency Contraception needs to be cheaper as £26 for one pill can be difficult to afford especially if it's being purchased by someone who doen't feel comfortable going to a Dr for it.

<|startoftext|>Seeing Marky Ramone post on Instagram about Greg Hetson going back to the circle jerks &amp; how everyone should have their own band...

<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Most people who practice witchcraft - like in every other religion - are harmless &amp; just want to be left alone then there's a handful of people who take it too far &amp; turn to extremism which gives them a bad name &amp; fuels stigma.

<|startoftext|>@Fact The annoying thing about having a mental illness is that everyone tells you to trust your gut instinct &amp; then when you do people brush it off as your mental illness acting up &amp; won't take your concerns seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely freaked out; there was a sudden freezing cold draft over me despite the heating being on full blast &amp; a I'm wearing a cardigan &amp; my son ran into the living room scared pointing at the open kitchen door behind me &amp; grabbed my dads hand shouting "dead"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It's not the winter that affects my mental health it's the traumatic memories it triggers, I had a pregnancy loss on my 21st birthday so I spend the entire month of December feeling consumed by grief (my birthday is in December) it sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women are shamed if they masturbate  Women are slut shamed if they have one night stands &amp; enjoy sex.  &amp; if something bad happens when she has a hook up she's victim blamed or murdered   So stop shaming women for masturbating &amp; make it safer for women having 1 night stands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to understand that being a nice person doesn't automatically make someone a doormat if you hurt someone who is usually a nice person they're not going to let you get away with it to be polite they're going to stand up for themselves the same way anyone else would<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homophobia is stupid: Homophobia is basically telling someone who they're allowed to love based on your own personal preferences.   It's like banning someone from eating chicken soup simply because you prefer tomato soup.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline There is: - victim support,  - counseling services  - mental health charities/services   Families can support victims by: - not being judgemental about it - not slut shaming them for it/ using it against them - listening to them  - doing their research on revenge porn  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Victims of revenge porn should: - Report the posts immediately &amp; encourage any of their loved ones who come across them to do the same - call the police  - book an appointment with a counsellor for mental health support &amp; - give their loved ones a heads up about it #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Sometimes with revenge porn the perpetrator tells the victim they've gotten revenge porn on them when the perpetrator hasn't actually done it simply to distress the victim &amp; Sometimes the perpetrator doesn't upload all the pics at once they do it over a longer period #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Victims of revenge porn find out by: - coming across the images/videos themselves online - being informed by their loved ones who've found them posted - often the perpetrator tells the victim they've done it to harass &amp; distress them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Revenge porn: using persons nudes/videos to humiliate &amp; shame them this can be by: -Posting them online -Using them to slut shame a former partner during a court case - sending them to their friends or to the victims loved ones  - hanging the pics in public places  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Me: *tells my dad about stalking incident*  Dad: why don't u just delete all ur social media?  Me: what?

<|startoftext|>Hate when members of the #LGBTQ community be hateful towards each other. -Seeing lesbians excluding transwomen -Excluding bisexuals -Preaching transphobia -Being hateful towards LGBT people for acting like the LGBT stereotype.

<|startoftext|>An openly gay guy posted on Facebook: LGBT people (he called them f****ts) can't expect special treatment &amp; complain when hetero people commit hate crimes if they're acting stereotypically LGBT.

<|startoftext|>@remma3760 @AbsolutGrumpy Definitely the therapists in Hollyoaks either end up dating the patient or could benefit from seeing a therapist themselves there is no in-between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@remma3760 @AbsolutGrumpy Yes this! Mitchell needs to either accept his sexuality and stop messing Cleo about or accept that it's not fair on Scott to only be attracted to the Anita persona but not Scott in general and stop messing Scott about. He's hurting people out of selfishness &amp; denial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbsolutGrumpy @remma3760 Agree 100% as Cleo &amp; Scott were thick as thieves and then he just so easily screwed her over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@remma3760 @AbsolutGrumpy 👏👏👏👏 Scott can't live the rest of his life in drag as Anita one day he's going to take off the wig and Stilettos and Mitchell won't want to be with him anymore, Scott deserves better he deserves someone who loves him as Scott as well as Anita<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbsolutGrumpy I love Scott but Cleo came first she was his friend long before Mitchell came into the picture he shouldn't have pursued a relationship with Mitchell until Mitchell had broken up with Cleo #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my gosh! Stunt weeks started off epic!  #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really freaking hate Mitchell for what he's putting Cleo and Scott through! #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Nope I've made no new friends since leaving the abuse and I don't really mind I'm happy as i am, only need me, my cats, my dog and my kids. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline No, I don't want to rebuild any of the friendships I lost during the abuse, what's done is done, I'm not going to apologize to them for my abusers mistake, the abuse wasn't my fault but if they want to build bridges with me in the future they can the doors open #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I tried to reconnect with friends after escaping the abuse but they were mad at me, they told me if I truly cared about them I wouldn't have allowed my abuser to cut them out my life, they couldn't understand I didn't have a choice I couldn't let him hurt them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Thank you I hope so too lol I have the doctors on Monday so fingers crossed it's nothing serious. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I lost a lot of friends when I was in an abusive relationship, he isolated me from everyone and blocked all my friends on social media and deleted all of my incoming calls and texts so I couldn't speak to anyone at all, my unborn baby became my only friend. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My abuser raped me 2X a day minimum between pregnancy diagnosis &amp; me escaping him but was only charged with 8 counts of rape they rounded it down.

<|startoftext|>Just saw a post on Facebook about I Spit On Your Grave (rape horror film)  There were 15 comments including mine on this post &amp; 5/15 of the comments (including myself) were off people who admitted they're rape survivors So on this Facebook post 1 in 3 people had been raped #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sounds fun but I'm good at sprinting lol you'd never catch me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason society invalidates domestic abuse against men by women is due to sexism  Sexism that: Women are weaker than men physically so can't do that much damage  That men should be physically strong &amp; just "man up" &amp; take it  That crying in all gender's is a sign of weakness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sex workers/strippers/prostitutes/porn stars can be victims of sex crimes too it's just harder to get convictions People still need consent before sex/touching them. No consent = rape   Their line of work doesn't change that, sex crimes aren't part of the territory #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a society where two women dating is only accepted as long as they can be fetishised  I yearn for the day when two women kissing outside the sanctuary of a gay bar is no longer classed as an act of rebellion but merely seen as an act of love and passion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in a world where the rich aren't found guilty of their crimes until after they're dead,  As they were able to buy their innocence for their crimes when they were alive.  #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sick of living in a world where there's no justice;  Where a person's bank balance determines their guilt &amp; not the facts  Where people can buy their innocence even when they're guilty  Where a big bank balance gives people a free pass to get away with bad things  #MeToo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It's important for me to be focused; So I can be the best parent I can be to my kids,  So I can take care of my pets To help keep me motivated to create a career out of my passion #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline -I do a lot of planning, -I try to encourage myself to get dressed up when I go out even if it's a short trip as seeing myself showered &amp; dolled up makes me feel better  - I listen to music - I let myself have wednesdays off to relax  - I go for a short walk at night #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I got outed whilst I was at #markyramonesblitzkrieg so I put my phone on flight mode.

<|startoftext|>@Vixxy86 Mitchell should've been arrested for a hate crime for what he did to Scott yesterday, #hollyoaks are showing an extremely toxic portrayal of same sex relationship which is wrong, unless they turn this into an LGBT domestic abuse storyline they won't be able to save this storyline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scott needs to realise love shouldn't hurt and he needs to definitely realise that love shouldn't physically hurt. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scott shouldn't have gone with Mitchell again! Seriously?! After what Mitchell did yesterday enough is enough Scott needs to speak to a counselor to break the trauma bond he has with Mitchell and date someone who doesn't take their issues out on him #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scott shouldn't forgive Mitchell  They're in an abusive relationship when they're not even in a proper relationship he physically hurt Scott, hurled homophobic abuse at him and set his wig on fire.

<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing Poison Heart by Ramones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making someone feel guilty for reporting sexual harassment is a form of victim blaming and promotes rape culture as every act of sexual harassment that a person gets away with the more they try to get away with. Making someone feel guilty or regret reporting it is absolutely vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youthdvadvocate @cherylgabriel5 Thank you ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife Couldn't trust social services they kept trying to force me to accept help didn't need like kept refering me for an unnecessary amount of STI tests  &amp; health visitor refused to get my son's tongue tie cut &amp; told me single moms legally shouldn't be allowed to raise kids #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife No, i asked the agency not to tell my abuser when my baby was born or the babies gender &amp; name as he'd made death threats against the baby during pregnancy... And the agency "accidentally" sent a letter addressed to me with said information in...to his address #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife No one took me seriously they all told me "just to let it go and move on" People tried to encourage me to drop the charges against my ex as they didn't think I was "strong enough" to handle court  They all treated me like a stupid child &amp; thought they knew best #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife Nope I felt like I was being punished for his mistake; - Drs kept brushing me off as paranoid whenever I expressed my concerns about the effects of the abuse on my unborn baby  - police called me a bitter ex for reporting his indirect restraining order breaches  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to understand that abuse/rape creates a ripple effect It doesn't just hurt the victim,  It hurts their friends, family, kids who support the victim during their recovery.  Trauma affects more than the victim it affects everyone who learns their story #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife - if police/medical professionals had been trained to understand the effects of other abuse e.g mental, financial, coercive abuse etc  - if counselling had been offered to my loved ones to help them cope with &amp; understand the trauma I'd suffered as it affected them too #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @SuePenna @rockpoollife -If the police were better trained to understand domestic abuse - faster emergency service response times  - shorter waiting times for emergency ultrasound scans to check the fetus had survived the abuse (took a week) - received counselling to help me prepare for trial #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks After what Mitchell said to scott quite frankly I think both Cleo and Scott could do better. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as marriage proposals go that was brutal.  Brookes reaction was brutal for Ollie, not only did she reject him she kicked him when he was down. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was so nasty what Mitchell said to Scott, yeah Scott could do better and Cleo could as well #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooohh nana McQueen meow, that comment to Maxine was so catty lol #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with Imran, Bridesmaids is a classic #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't believe in trick or treating as i don't want to encourage my kids to take sweets from strangers so instead; Do #Halloween scavenger hunt me &amp; the other parents arrange a home to hold the scavenger hunt at &amp; the kids have to search &amp; play games for the Halloween treats<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww happy birthday gorgeous rou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww this is such a lovely scene with Marnie and Juliette #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After last nights episode of #donttellthebride I think the producers should add a rule to the contract where the couple's should have to change their passwords to their emails once the partner who's planning the wedding has moved out for the 3weeks to prevent that happening again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo necesito ayuda, me estoy mareando 🤢🤢🤮🤮🏥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me siento muy mal 🤢🤮 y triste😭💔. Buenas noches y qué duermas bien.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Felt proper gutted for the groom in #donttellthebride she should've trusted him, he was such a sweetheart &amp; his plans were so freaking romantic; having the ceremony in Paris &amp; flying home for the reception to celebrate with their loved ones. The plans was so romantic &amp; thoughtful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some of the relationship red flags from tonight's #donttellthebride ; - checked his emails - controlling him - no trust - made him change plans - no remorse &amp; laughed about consequences of her actions - selfishness - sabotaged the plans to maintain control  - kept lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That episode of #donttellthebride was perfect to show during #DomesticViolenceAwarenessMonth as the bride's controlling behaviour was setting off so many relationship red flags. Their relationship was toxic.  Her behaviour was so controlling she sabotaged her own wedding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How romantic the groom's wedding plans were I would've happily married him, screw marrying the controlling bride, he should marry me instead I think I'd be able to pull off the wedding dress #donttellthebride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so bad for the groom in #donttellthebride as she was so selfish, the wedding was both their special day &amp; she wanted it to be just hers, he planned her such a romantic wedding &amp; chose a stunning wedding dress for her &amp; she didn't trust him His plans were so romantic 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bride's only got herself to blame for the wedding being cancelled, she checked her fiancés emails because she didn't trust him at all, she ruined her own wedding. I hope he dumps her ass she wasn't even sorry. #donttellthebride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The groom could do better than the bride in #donttellthebride as how controlling she is, she couldn't even give him 3weeks to plan her wedding she checked his emails she didn't trust him that much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo Mi opina de Boris Johnson;   Lo odio porqué el es inutil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life tip:  Teach your loved ones from an early age; That there's nothing shameful about walking away from a failed relationship/marriage &amp; that it's better to walk away from a bad relationship instead of staying and leaving in a coffin.  #abusetalk #DomesticViolenceAwarenessMonth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeShmo23077829 @Fact Actually I nearly did when my youngest son passed away,  I ended up in the hospital with chest pains &amp; extreme weight loss &amp; spent 2weeks in the hospital.

<|startoftext|>Breda is so insane! What's wrong with her seriously? #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's breaking my heart seeing James like this, Harry didn't deserve to die and James didn't deserve to lose the love of his life #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Oni256 @sbdblogger Agreed I got smacked as a child and I didn't turn out fine at all I thought I turned out fine until I started therapy at 19 &amp; realised 8yr old me flinching, suffering with anxiety/self harm and vomiting from fear whenever I did anything wrong, was signs I had not turned out fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbdblogger All smacking does is;  1) teach children that it's ok to hit the people you love And 2) it's punishing bad behaviour with bad behaviour. It's effectively teaching children not to hit other children, by hitting your child. It makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield ✋ I get treated like I'm stupid, like I'm incapable of raising my own child and treated like a child in general who needs to be wrapped in cotton wool. I hate it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was such a sweet scene with misbah, Olly and Imran #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So help her god if Breda hurts Tony again. She's a freaking psycho #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooh Breda's lies are finally unravelling now. Yes Diane's reporting him missing at long last they've worked it out #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally someone told Diane straight!  Hopefully they'll find Tony soon #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hate when people try to justify abuse by saying  "But you must have loved them at some point"  I did love my abuser at 1 point, I loved the person they pretended to be to lure me in, I loved a version of them that never really existed, I loved a lie   #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when people try to justify abuse by saying  "But you must have loved them at some point"  I did love my abuser at 1 point but I loved the person that I was before the abuse started even more &amp; thought that that version of myself was worth saving #abusetalk #DomesticAbuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 🙃 #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth Schools should also add educating children on healthy relationships, consent and red flags of abuse to their curriculum as so many people go into their earlier relationships unaware of the red flags to look out for &amp; how to get help if things go wrong #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth Society could support survivors of DV by educating themselves on domestic abuse and the impact long term it can have on survivors and their families. Society needs to understand that domestic abuse creates a ripple effect &amp; it hurts the loved ones of the victim as well #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth I was and still am treated differently because of the fact I survived abuse; - People treat me like I'm stupid,  - Like I'm a sl*t, -People talk to me like I'm a child,  - get treated like incapable of raising my own baby - like people are punishing me for his actions #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth I was victim blamed a lot and still am.  I had doctors ask me if the abuse was so bad why didn't I get an abortion? I had people ask me if the abuse was so bad why didn't I leave sooner? People would remind me "but you must have loved him at some point" to justify it #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth I wish someone had taught me in school about healthy relationships and that love shouldn't hurt and about consent laws as I didn't know consenting to sex with him out of fear of the consequences if I didn't, was rape. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @resultsinamonth - I wish I'd known the red flags to look out for, - I wish I'd known about resources to help me leave safely and get support during my recovery - I wish I'd known about different domestic abuse laws to allow me to get a background check on my ex partner when I met him #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Breda has really become unhinged she's gone proper evil now, before she was a bad dad vigilante style serial killer now she's just unnecessarily evil.  She killed harry, hit Joel with a Bible and tried to kill Tony &amp; is holding him prisoner. #hollyoaks #killermcqueen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm crying at seeing Tony so broken talking about his children. 😭😭😭😭 #hollyoaks #killermcqueen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When I was in an abusive relationship so much of the pain I was suffering could've been prevented if professionals had been better trained to spot the red flags of domestic abuse as they could've referred me for help before it became more dangerous for me to leave #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 🙂 #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @vickier80353539 @UkKaleidoscopic I would've preferred dr's who were trained to spot abuse signs better as there were so many missed red flags like: - me wearing a wooly scarf during warm weather, - abuser answering all the questions - me asking his permission before talking to Dr - my nervousness etc  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @vickier80353539 @UkKaleidoscopic I would've liked my midwives, antenatal nurses etc to have spotted the signs I was being abused during pregnancy, I couldn't say it was happening as my abuser wouldn't let me go to appointments alone. I wish they'd have spotted the signs &amp; offered me help #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatherineWeibel @PinkNews Actually men can get pregnant.  There's more to gender identity than a person's genitals and reproductive systems, if a pregnant person identifies as female they're a pregnant woman, if a pregnant person identifies as male they're a pregnant man, etc.  It's not that difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @vickier80353539 @UkKaleidoscopic No there isn't and teachers/healthcare professionals/etc need better training to recognise the signs of abuse in order to provide the families with support sooner rather than later #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @vickier80353539 @UkKaleidoscopic Yes it does as they have a better understanding about how the trauma can affect you as they've experienced trauma themselves, it's easier to talk to someone when you know that you're both in the same boat #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>❤️ @GregHetson as a basset hound because he's got a smushy neck Just got to draw Spaceman tattoo as a bulldog with a bass guitar,  @Pelathor as a punk rat with a torn ear &amp; chewed tail (I think rats are cute so I'm calling Péla cute❤️)  &amp; Marky Ramone as a rattle snake with drums  https://t.co/ENKc6lZE6f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lulu_mastersxo @Vixxy86 Youare not alone her eyebrows have been bugging the hell out of me too lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vixxy86 Me too, I everytime I see them I think she looks werewolf like, I'm all for bushy eyebrows but why mess up her eyebrows? What was Maxine trying to achieve? Was one of her imaginary symptoms rapid hair growth so they grew out of control quickly? #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad Maxine's lies have been found out as she can sort her eyebrows out, I get she was pretending to be dying but seriously why'd she use so much of the make-up to make herself look sick on her eyebrows? Hmm now her lies have been uncovered she can get them waxed #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Maxine has been so busted, the more people know the less she can keep up with her lies. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Marky Ramone isn't the last living Ramone we still have CJ &amp; Richie Ramone, Marky's just the only one still coasting off the Ramones success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm working my ass off all day trying to build a career out of my passion blah blah blah, whilst taking care of my sick son &amp; my injured dog, having repair work done to a collapses sewer pipe that runs under my garden &amp; having physiotherapy on my inflamed tendon.

<|startoftext|>Oh my freaking gosh! One of the best moments of my life so far! Greg hetson liked one of my Instagram posts of a sketch I'm currently working on of him as a basset hound! Pinch me I'm dreaming!  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'd say "u were so afraid of me having a life without u I now have to live the rest of my life without u"  Ex fiancé committed suicide after we broke up as he'd stopped taking his meds so he'd be dependent on me to take care of him so I couldn't have a life outside relationship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes James! Get in! Maxine's been found out! Hopefully he'll unravel her lies now! #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww this scene with yas &amp; Imran is making me cry, it's so thoughtful of him #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Jesse's question to Anita, Jesse and Courtney are such a cute couple #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda wanted sienna to slap Maxine then #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love James, when he suspects something's amiss he won't stop until he finds out what's going on #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think it's brilliant how #hollyoaks have showed yas being deaf from both perspectives yas' and her families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Scott's t-shirt #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm doing a drawing of @GregHetson as a basset hound because he posts photos of his cute basset hound on Instagram.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's dilemma:  -Kinda want to do a drawing of Greg Hetson - Kinda want to do a drawing a badger - Kinda want to do a drawing of @GregHetson as a badger.   Hmmm decisions decisions decisions 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#donaldtrump ... Qué mierda?  https://t.co/hhnDVYoJjT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I think Maxine will slip up on her new lies when trying to cover up her existing lies and make a mistake which will result in her accidentally exposing the fact she's been faking the whole thing. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Person: *laughs at me because I stayed in a £50 a night hotel when I was on holiday* my hotel was over £250 a night  Me: ok did you have an ensuite bathroom? Underbed storage &amp; a work desk?  Person: no &amp; it was a shared bathroom  Me: I freaking did 🖕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliceoguevara @FansRamones @RamonesPodcast @RamonesOfficial @theecjramone Pardon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaRizinti Louder for the people in the back! Women do pee on the seats sometimes accidents happen, especially if they've had children their muscles aren't as strong as they used to be so sometimes when they're bursting for a pee they drip on the seat when they're sitting down on the toilet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the LGB doesn't stand with the T, what chance do we have of getting equality?   If there's infighting/inequality amongst the LGBT community &amp; the #LGBT community can't accept each other then how can we expect equality in a heteronormative society?  #TransRightsAreHumanRights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Buenos Dias, qué pasen un dia marvilloso ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life tip:  When you finally find your backbone and started standing up for yourself, the people who benefited from you not standing up to yourself, will have a huge problem with the new u.  When u stand up to their bull****, they'll play the victim &amp; make u out to be the bad guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No, I'm not being rude mannered, you are.  I had the decency to ask if you were ok as I could sense that you weren't,  &amp; I had the decency to be playful in an attempt to cheer you up &amp; you got p*ssy with me instead of appreciating the effort.  You owe me an apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention: Can people please stop being nasty to me? Seriously Haven't I been through enough?  I've gone through horrific trauma the past 4years I'm recovering from,  I'm trying to build a career for myself,  I'm learning Spanish/Spanish politics whilst trying to raise a child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life tips:  1) Don't take your problems out on other people   2) If someone asks if you're okay don't go around being nasty and rude mannered to them to make yourself feel better  3) if someone tries to be playful with you to cheer you up, appreciate the effort. #SundayMotivation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>- Being a punk rocker doesn't give you an excuse to treat your fans like s***,   - Being a punk rocker doesn't give you a free pass to be hurtful to people   &amp;   - Being a punk rocker doesn't mean you don't have to apologize when you hurt someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend made a valid point:  #markyramone should refund all the fans he's bullied who attended his #markyramonesblitzkrieg as he lined his bank account with the money from them attending his concert and then turned into a cyber bully within 24hrs of his concert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the mood for cuddles and to nuzzle someone's Adams apple. Not in a romantic way just in an I need attention kind of way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dancarer37 Agreed it's like men think rape victims should inform people they have been raped at some point in their life just incase the asshole decides to make a sick rape joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield 1) grumpy is a playful term where I'm from lmao 😂, 2) fine means you're not, 3) point proven ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You ok grumpy? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's badly injured his toe in a freak accident. His grandad was baby sitting him and he opened the door too fast and crunched my son's big toe under the door.

As all my hatred &amp; anger is directed at just him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks You've handled this far right storyline brilliantly, it's been so intense and disturbing in parts, was heartbreaking seeing ste so terrified when he was being arrested, they're all amazing actors who've done this storyline justice. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Guy: *makes rape joke*  Me: u think rape jokes are funny? I'm guessing u've never been raped?  Guy: no  Me: u ever met anyone who's been raped?

<|startoftext|>Maxine has gone too far Damon is on the verge of going to prison, she's lied to everyone and now Brody and sienna are putting their plans to have a baby on hold.  I get Maxine is mentally ill but she's gone too far #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm dying at that scene with James and Marnie 😂😂😂😂 #awkward #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Guy: *takes the piddle out of me for making a spelling error on a tweet I wrote in Spanish*  Me: you're Spanish &amp; you learnt English, I'm English &amp; I'm learning Spanish, we're in the same boat the only difference is I never mocked you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah I got cyber bullied by a guy who's concert I went to see, weeks before the concert they made insensitive comment I brushed off, then 24hrs after concert he implied I was stupid, his vocalist took the piss out of me on insta &amp; the others sent me nasty DM's for a month afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LGBTPlusProud Oh my gosh they should make this into a film! An LGBT love story and empowerment film about his journey to learning to accept himself &amp; how it's never too late to come out and find true love<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NataliePage31 There are days where I feel like I'm going insane from stress and fear that he's made malicious false child abuse claims against me again, I feel stressed when anyone knocks the door/ my phone goes off &amp; it's a number I don't recognise it makes me shake uncontrollably #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NataliePage31 I suffered agoraphobia which I've mostly overcame now, i have crippling anxiety &amp; PTSD which I'm on medication for, I have meltdowns when people get mad at me as I panic, I'm over protective of my son &amp; I have locks &amp; alarms on every door/window including loft hatch #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NataliePage31 I endured so much abuse after leaving him; it was truly horrific recieving death and rape threats, threats to kidnap &amp; murder our son, I developed agoraphobia &amp; couldn't leave my house alone in case he hurt the baby, he would make Catfish accounts to harass us #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NataliePage31 I had to endure death threats for years afterwards; he threatened to rape my family &amp; friends, he threatened to kill my dog, signed me up to prostitution websites claiming I was prostituting myself for baby formula, he got revenge porn on me, harassed my family #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline @NataliePage31 My abuser used the emergency services to threaten me; he would send police/ambulances to my house claiming a pregnant person (me) had been shot, he sent fire services to my house claiming a pregnant person was trapped in a fire &amp; He harassed me through the family court #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Asshole: I don't believe he bullied you if he was truly a bully why did he attend a charity event for vulnerable children?

<|startoftext|>Using the excuse "I'm old fashioned" to excuse your; - Racism - Sexism - Transphobia - Homophobia ...Isnt an excuse! Times change, people change, either get with the times or get lost.  Claiming you're old fashioned is just a polite way of saying you're ignorant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's this pro life, anti lgbt Christian asshole in the town I live and everytime he goes on one of his preachy rants at me about something being a sin I always shut him up by simply pointing out that infidelity is a sin &amp; he still had an 18 month affair behind his wife's back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Pro lifer: abortion is a sin, I don't understand how you can be pro choice, it's murder, it says so in the Bible.   Me: really?   Pro lifer: yes it's an abomination, God will punish all those who get an abortion.  Me: ok 🙄 u cheated on your wife 🖕🖕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My son woke me up last night by climbing into my bed and cuddling me saying "you're my teddy, my teddy bear" and fell asleep hugging me.  Thought my heart was going to explode from love for him. He's such a beautiful little boy I'm so lucky to have him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life tip: If you threaten to make false child abuse claims against someone just because you're mad at them then you are the biggest piece of 💩💩💩💩 to grace god's green earth.  As anyone who would risk a child being put in care over a petty argument is pure evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  My dad's been threatening to make false children's services complaints against me and when I asked him why he's doing this he said:  I saw in the court papers from ur exs assault trial the babies dad used to say it to u &amp; it worked at keeping u in line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a special place in hell for parents who threaten to make false child abuse reports about their adult children just because they asked their parent to stop telling them how to raise their grandkids. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Reaching out and seeking help and learning to accept that there is nothing shameful about getting help. Its ok to buy self help books, it's ok to have therapy, it's ok to need medication and its ok to get help.  Getting help is the best way to overcome an obstacle #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Can help manage toxic shame by:  - recognising and accepting that you are suffering with it  - practicing self care  - seeking therapy and counselling  - speak to a mental health service to see if you have any other underlying mental illnesses that may be causing it #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Symptoms of toxic shame that people can recognise are: - having flashbacks of situations where you feel shame  - irrational guilt - being a perfectionist  - being a people pleaser - mistrusting people including nice people - shame anxiety - anxiety about feeling shame #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline How toxic shame was defined to me was: Toxic shame is an irrational feeling of worthlessness and self hatred caused by trauma and it usually starts in childhood but can be triggered later in life #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remarkable thing about humans is ability to adapt to situations to survive.

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes - there's nothing wrong with asking for help, everyone strays from a path in life at some point whatever that path may be and it's ok to do that, all that matters is that you don't give up no Matter how far you stray. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline We can feel more in control of ourselves by; - Not beating ourselves up over mistakes - meditation - planning things out in advance - accepting that there isn't always a reason for everything sometimes bad things happen &amp; there is no reason #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline -Self care - setting small realistic self care goals each day to achieve. - start a journal to write down and make sense of our feelings so in future you can read it and see how far u've come  - doing random acts of kindness e.g. Feeding birds, compliment someone etc #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes - we need to reclaim our lives and show ourselves that the abuse doesn't define us, we are more than a victim We're a survivor and we can live our best life despite our trauma #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Parenting summed up: My son's whacking me with a toy light saber whilst I'm shouting "stop whacking me I gave you life"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing parent moment: my son got his toy stuck under a parked car in the town centre so I had to get a litter picker with a granny grabber to help me get it. Took 10minutes to retrieve his toy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the worst person to get on the wrong side of as I won't stay silent.  When I left my son's dad he made repeated daily death threats, intimidation &amp; harassment &amp; I didn't stay silent or drop the charges against him. THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS BE THE TRUTH EVEN IF NO ONE BELIEVES IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Good morning, have a terrific Tuesday. I've given myself a reason to get out of bed for the first time since Thursday so I'm somewhat optimistic today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodiGrinder @My_SimpleMind I also don't understand why guys send a photo of them in their "new t-shirt" but angle it downwards with no trousers on so I can clearly see their boxers and their penis bulge. It's like a slightly less subtle than a Dick pic way of showing people their crotch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodiGrinder @My_SimpleMind Yeah I lock my phone I have two locks and I report and delete the messages immediately when I receive them but it's not very nice when I'm sitting on the sofa with my son and my phone goes off and when I check the message *boom* unsolicited dick pic. It's horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodiGrinder @My_SimpleMind Unsolicited dick pics panic me as well as I have kids; so when I get one randomly I panic in case my kid sees it or if I'm browsing on phone whilst my son plays at the park &amp; I receive 1 I panic incase the other parents see it &amp; think I'm viewing porn &amp; I get in legal trouble<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@My_SimpleMind I hate that jolt of fear and panic I get whenever I receive an unsolicited dick pic, like I can't close the message fast enough, I feel violated when I receive them as it's like it gives predators a way into the safety of my home through my WiFi connection. I hate them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenNolan @Jim_Wells_MLA @Robinwindsor Are you on crack?  It's easier to teach children acceptance than it is to brainwash them into being ignorant.  Why are children too young to know about sexuality &amp; gender identity unless the sexuality &amp; gender they're taught to accept is only heterosexual &amp; cisgender? #LGBT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarrenFEdwards Wow 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I hate about being vulnerable is no one takes me seriously when I speak out when something bad happens as they accuse me of blowing things out of proportion simply because I'm vulnerable.  I want to scream at them "they knew I was vulnerable so no one would believe me"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pastor_CVB Love... I hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when narcissistic people do something bad and people try to excuse their behaviour because they have too much class to do that. No they don't have class they pretend to so people think they're incapable of being assholes when people speak out against them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate the term Attention Seeking  Yeah so what if the person wants attention, maybe they're just lonely and need someone to talk to and people in their life only bother to communicate with them when there's drama happening.  Attention seekers aren't bad people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought having 2 large lumps outside near my colon that need to be removed would be painful but considering how painful my trapped gas is because the lumps are causing an obstruction, quite frankly the drs can remove the lumps with rusty tweezers for all I care. 🤒🤒🤒🤒<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 I'm obsessed with Ramones but I hate #markyramone no matter how much I love the band I don't support bullies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 I know but doesn't make it ok, the vocalist is Spanish but the person they misgendered hasn't insulted the fact they're Spanish to be hurtful to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 Doesn't matter if he does as just because someones mad at a transgender person doesn't make it ok to misgender them. No matter how angry a person is with someone it's not okay to be transphobic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 Easier said than done when he turned their trauma into a publicity stunt to make himself come across as an LGBT ally, when his vocalist deliberately misgendered the transman in a public post &amp; called him a little girl who should go to the playground if she wants drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rizickyusuph1 Ifb 🏳️‍🌈✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 Made hurtful comments, deliberately made them feel stupid, keeps blocking and unblocking them on Instagram, ghosting them, turning their trauma into a publicity stunt without asking, making them feel like they need to apologize when he's been nasty to them.

<|startoftext|>I hate when people hurt someone then when the person's they hurt snaps and reacts to what they've done they try to play the victim.  Like seriously? You're not the victim, karma's bit you in the ass and you don't like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kiss your career goodbye asshole. I hate narcissists and I will bring him down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @Morrisons I know but bit hypocritical that a supermarket that exploits live animals yet preaches about it's vegan range &amp; promotes invisible disabilities then does anything to save their own ass from sexual harassment, even going as far as making false claims against the customer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate the smell of toddler breath. Like that unique stinky smell all toddlers breaths have no matter how good their dental hygiene and diet is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteDeschanel @PinkNews Definitely true, my political views have changed since the referendum as it's been years since the vote and we still haven't left the EU &amp; the countries government is the toilet so my views are opposite to what I voted for now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteDeschanel @PinkNews Honestly I'm confused about Brexit as so much fake news was spread around during the referendum it's just so confusing knowing what to believe, what's fact &amp; what's fake news.  Either way anti LGBT education protests were scary as they were hate crimes disguised as protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @Morrisons They have those in tescos and Tesco's is better as #Morrisons exploit live reindeer every Christmas in their willenhall branch and they'll do anything to avoid a lawsuit when their staff sexually harass female customers, there's a reason 4 of their larger branches have closed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uss_avenger His tail should make a full recovery but it's breaking my heart seeing him so sad, he's a lovely dog his tail should be wagging not bandaged up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Word of warning for Instagram: There's a guy called Fidelle who's using the #markyramonesblitzkrieg to DM women &amp; trans men who he thinks "are technically still female" to start talking to them about the concert, then he's asking them to meet for sex &amp; sending dick pics. 🤢🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I live near Birmingham and I honestly don't feel safe being LGBT, especially since the #nooutsiders protests happened at the schools. It scared me that people were preaching so much hatred simply because their kids were being taught to accept LGBT people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when someone is mad at me and won't tell me what I've done wrong especially when I've asked what I've done so I can try to make things right.  It triggers me; it causes flashbacks of my son's dad hitting me &amp; not telling me what he was punishing me for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤬🤬🤬🤬 I'm still covered in my dogs blood from his freak accident as I haven't had the chance to change my clothes yet  And now I'm also covered in my own blood as an unhealed wound on my wrist from weeks ago got accidentally knocked &amp; it has reopened so it's bleeding a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case anyone is curious about my dogs tail injury. It was bent at a 90 degree angle and the tail bone was exposed. Here's some pics after they cleaned the blood up and slowed down the bleeding  https://t.co/pY050Ub4e2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I wish I could find me someone who looks at me the same way Mitchell looks at Scott/Anita ❤️😂#hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when my dogs injured, he's too lovely to be sad, I rescued him 10years ago, when I was pregnant with my eldest he would fall asleep with his head on baby bump &amp; when my eldest was born he'd bring him his ball &amp; couldn't understand why my newborn son couldn't throw it back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: my dogs tails been saved it's bandaged up but he's going to hopefully make a full recovery the only risk now is of infection developing but yeah he's being spoiled within an inch of his life &amp; I've also asked he have flea and worming treatment whilst he's here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaRizinti Hi I'm Alex Xander, I'm gay f2m transgender,  Always open to making new friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dog's been in freak accident, my son accidentally trapped my dogs tail in the door &amp; his tail is badly injured, there's blood everywhere, I'm covered in blood &amp; he's having emergency treatment to save his tail My son keeps crying but it was just a horrible freak accident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm lonely but I wish people would leave me alone.  I'm lonely because I miss being surrounded by positive people But I wish toxic people would leave me alone and stop stressing me out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IStanYUNGBLUD This is heartbreaking but the statistics don't surprise me.

<|startoftext|>I'm fully aware that this is beyond 💩💩💩💩 it took me literally 5 minutes to do during the adverts during #Hollyoaks  and I may have sketched it with a felt pen I stole off my son when his back was turned...whoops 😂 @MarkyRamone    #markyramonesblitzkrieg  https://t.co/3ZnkQ7ZAx3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My dysphoria is being a huge b*tch today;  I feel like I look like a straight girl pretending to be a butch lesbian so is over compensating on the butch aesthetic. I hate this.  I honestly care more about having top surgery than I do about starting HRT &amp; getting bottom surgery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I agree with the makeup artist, it's protocol in all the hair stylists where I live that they'll refuse to cut a person's hair if they find any signs of headlice.  They even inform parents before they start doing their child's hair that they'll stop if they find any nits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm re reading The Lovely Bones as it's my favourite book/film, could always relate to Suzie. Right now I feel like Suzie, caught in the in-between, so consumed by anger she can't allow herself to cross over into heaven I can't allow myself to cross over until I tie up loose ends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel like the past is repeating itself but that's ok. I've been praying to go back and have a second chance to change what happened &amp; been having crazy deja vu just lately, I can't go back in time &amp; change what happened but I can go back and make things right.  So I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Honestly this scared me;  I was outed as gay F2M transgender recently and my world fell apart; so anti trans protests happening in the place that's like my second home, the place I feel safe to be open about who I am, is terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been awake since 3:45am I'm so tired need sleep. 😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline 🙂 This week's subject is something I feel strongly about. When I was pregnant I spent the night in a bus shelter after he strangled me, ran past him when he went for a cigarette &amp; spent the night in my Pyjamas, in the middle of winter on the streets until he found me #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline People who are homeless due to leaving abuse aren't homeless by choice, being made 2 choose between stay with abuser &amp; risk being murdered or leave &amp; be homeless isnt a choice. No one should be in a situation where it's safer to live on the streets than live at home #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think a full background check of their criminal records (like companies do when they're employing people who work around vulnerable individuals) also the UK needs domestic abuse offenders register that abusers should be made to sign like they do for sex offenders #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I think there would be an increase in hobosexuals (hooks up with people solely for a place to live) as they'd quickly find another vulnerable person to take advantage of then move themselves in right under the victims nose without them realising until it's too late. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes as I've lost count of the amount of homeless people I've spoken to who have told me they ended up homeless because they left an abusive relationship &amp; their landlords ruled them as voluntarily making themselves homeless. It's just so wrong. #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrradiatedMouse @JackDunc1 It ended with Breda stabbing Tony when he confronted her about Harry as he worked out it was her when he received texts off Harry's phone so called him back in front of Breda &amp; his phone rang in her bag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks He can't be dead, he'll probably be in a coma and his dad will come to the village and help him or something. Either way this can't be the end of Tony I can't be too sure anymore after you killed off Harry then tricked us into thinking joel was dead. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDunc1 You would understand if you watched Hollyoaks, I signed the petition and watched Hollyoaks afterwards it was so intense they killed off Tony Hutchinson!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ross_adams @Hollyoaks Me neither! I actually shouted no at the TV. I was shocked, he has to survive this they can't kill off Tony those scenes were so intense, the acting was brilliant but holy 💩 I can't believe what bredas done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No! Oh my gosh not Tony! Please tell me it wasn't just me who shouted no at the TV then?! #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no please don't tell me Breda is going to kill Tony?! #hollyoaks please don't do this to us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit excited, planning on getting a more realistic multifunctional packer to wear to help with my dysphoria.

<|startoftext|>1) I post love stuff in Spanish because as far as anyone is concerned I'm a heartless b*tch so yeah I don't post it in English &amp; 2) unless I specifically say who I'm in love with please don't assume that you are the person I'm in love with, you may be disappointed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#mentalhealth tip: There's no such thing as being too old to do something that helps you when you're struggling mentally. It's ok to: Cuddle a teddy bear, Hide under a blanket, Play on a swing, Watch kids films or cartoons etc When u're sad. If it helps u, u're not too old for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah I have a wooden sign that says this, on my wall of positivity in my bedroom (it's a wall I hung loads of positive quotes on &amp; put a chalk board in the middle to write how I'm feeling on)  Good morning by the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to rest... Trying to stay positive and be strong when everything is falling apart, is exhausting. I'm exhausted from fighting a losing battle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stop crying again. I've had a rough few months; bumping in2 my rapist &amp; attempted sexual assault by a drunk guy before I went on holiday, my mum outing me &amp; my stalker taunting me about my youngest son who died during holiday &amp; being beaten after getting off holiday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun @LeoDiCaprio Finally someone donated something to it! When Notre dame was burning people were throwing money at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PunKandStuff That dude is awesome. 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror This article is sick! The little boy got mauled because people are used to it being drugged up and used as a selfie prop, that poor animal it should be sent to a sanctuary where they won't exploit it within an inch of it's life.  #veganism #PETA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 @RamonesOfficial @MarkyRamone Yeah I like a bit of everything music wise. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 @RamonesOfficial Agreed it is incredible, everything about the song Poison Heart is amazing; the overall beat of the song is awesome, the music video is simple but effective, @MarkyRamone drumming is brilliant, Joey's vocals were one of a kind and Dee Dee Ramone was a freaking lyrical genius 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TylerJay100 Poison Heart by @RamonesOfficial   The lyrics are incredible it's my favourite song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itskayie Tiger stripes 🐯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People moaning about how short @ArianaGrande performance was, hadn't it occurred to any1 maybe she was scared about being back in Manchester due to the Manchester bombings? It's got to have been triggering &amp; I have so much respect for her for performing at #ManchesterPride ❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil So they basically flew on a private jet, all the hell Meghan and Harry got and then will and Kate did this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Apparently I'm bigot for explaining to religious preacher that being LGBT isn't something that can be cured by religion  They're bigots for treating being LGBT like it's a disease &amp; claiming sex is just between husband &amp; wife &amp; not LGBT or masturbation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I thought this tweet was going to be about dumb stuff a kid says until I read the article. Oh my gosh did he seriously say that? 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Less people would think LGBT are evil if main Stream religions like christianity/Islam were LGBT friendly, instead of new age religions like satanism/wicca, (religions with stigma of being evil) being LGBT friendly LGBT people aren't going to practice religions that hate them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How bad things are getting right now, I honestly would be surprised if I'm not dead by the end of the year. I'm having constant chest pains from the stress of it all and I made an "attempt" a few weeks ago so yeah I'm being realistic &amp; I've already got my affairs in order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOMerGUY345 @PinkNews Trying to get people to "overcome their sexuality" is homophobic it's like they're treating sexuality as a sickness that can be overcome and cured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOMerGUY345 @PinkNews How is anything about my response bigoted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love trauma bonding. Currently torn between; I hate his guts and want to block him on everything And He's the person I looked up to when I was growing up when I lacked a male role model and can't imagine a life without him in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews It seems more like the mass shooting scared them that they'll be murdered for their own sexuality and they're projecting their fears onto other people in the LGBT community instead of dealing with the trauma in a healthier way They haven't overcome their sexuality they're scared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDunc1 I follow back I'm Gay, F2M transgender... Pre-T  https://t.co/KRFePBkPXu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo Holy crap that's a lot of rubbish! Haven't people heard of bins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice I'm being made homeless.  Apparently they don't want a tr*nnie living in the same building as them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feels like I'm dying, my heart physically hurts I'm so fed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people think being LGBT is contagious like #LGBT #pride and representation in the media will turn people LGBT? Like the only thing contagious about pride events is the atmosphere there, it's so positive and joyful that it's contagious and impossible to feel sad at pride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes when I'm lonely, I sleep with a heat pack near my back so it feels like there's someone in the bed next to me or I'll put a hot water bottle in one of my pillows and lean it against my back. It helps feels like someone's body heat which is comforting when I'm lonely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDunc1 I hope she dumps his bigoted ass when she reads this  Being bisexual doesn't mean threesomes and orgies  Bisexual people can still believe in monogamy and never have a threesome yet still be Bisexual People like him are the reason bissexual women are treated as fetishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mood: Need a hug, literally just a long hug, no sex, kissing, talking or anything, just a hug in silence.  It helps, sometimes silence says more than words ever could and i just need a hug in silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A horrible realisation to have is that the people I give a s*** about only pretend to give a s*** about me to make themselves look good, Supportive for show people are the worst kind of people to have in your life as they only care about you if it makes other people like them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly hate going home after being away for a few days. When I'm away from the constant criticisms, verbal abuse, threats, violence, I feel safe, free and actually happy.  Then I remember that I need to go home at some point and I feel like my heart's been shattered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ewww no  @RamonesOfficial are god's  Joey Ramone is god and the other band members are his messengers and archangels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm I'm actually hungry but can't decide between a #vegan grilled cheese, a cheese and onion crisp sandwich or marmite on toast.  How hungry I am I'm tempted to have all 3, ohhh but I could have chocolate cake instead or as well I'm not high just finally got my appetite back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't mind having to do everything alone at times but there are moments I wish I had someone, anyone in my life: Like when I'm puking my guts up in portable toilet &amp; have no one to check I haven't passed out Or When I'm feeling low &amp; need a hug but have no one to give me a hug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 11:20am and I've already danced my ass off until I'm beyond exhausted, dripping with sweat and puking water out my nose.  Not complaining, I've had a traumatic month so I just need to burn off stress and let myself go and dance until I forget why I'm sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe people would stop thinking being LGBT is evil if more main stream religions like Christianity &amp; Islam were LGBT+ friendly  Instead of just religions like satanism, Wicca, paganism etc being LGBT friendly. #LGBT people aren't going to practice a religion that hates on them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not that I don't love you I'm just exhausted night night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to make a serious confession: I'm not as strong as people think,  Few days after came home from holiday up manchester, I attempted suicide but never went to the hospital, I passed out, woke up few hours later, bandaged my wounds, cleaned up the blood &amp; carried on as normal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel like I'm going to pass out from exhaustion and heat.  Finally admitting defeat and taking a rest to have something to eat as I haven't eaten since 8:30pm yesterday haven't even had breakfast but I'm actually not even hungry, I just know I need carbs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This heat is killer today, had to switch to drinking water as the booze wasn't helping,  I love pride as it gives me chance to dance until I forget why I'm stressed out but dancing nonstop in this heat for hours is unbearable. Feel like I'm going to pass out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This heat is killing me 🔥🔥🔥🔥 been dancing nonstop in the sun ☀️☀️☀️☀️for hours; I'm soaked through with sweat, exhausted and my feet are killing me ... I'm wearing trainers not high heels.  I'm covered in face paint and silly string lmao 😂  Worth it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my gosh the wind is blowing! This breeze is heavenly! Also my trans pride flag is blowing like a cape so I feel like a super hero lmao it's only 13:53pm and I'm already a bit delightfully drunk and the weekend is still young. I f***ING love this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I always end up buying Ramones t-shirts when I'm up Manchester?  I did the same when I was up here seeing @MarkyRamone on tour which is guess makes sense but just bought another 3, was supposed to be heading back to the hotel for a break 🤔🤔 This heatwave is hell! 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm having such an incredible time up pride today but I'm struggling with this heat, if it gets any hotter I'm heading back to hotel for a cold shower and breather. It's unbearable wearing a chest binder in this heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This heatwave is murder!  My chest binder feels like a boa constrictor around my chest but had a discussion with an event organiser who's let me know where theres area's are I can go in to take it off &amp; give myself a break from it &amp; where the medics are in case I feel too bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son is never living this down!  He split his head open a few weeks ago dancing to Does Your Mother Know by ABBA (which is the national anthem of closeted LGBT people) and it's the first song playing when I arrived at pride 🏳️‍🌈festival.  Can't stop laughing. 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a difficult moment just when I was unpacking my suitcase, when I saw that my rail ticket had the phone number for a suicide helpline on the back. I sat on my bed and started sobbing hard but I've pulled myself together now &amp; I'm going to enjoy my pride weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utterchocoholic I know it's revolting I feel violated as I haven't had top surgery yet I still have breasts and I don't want him seeing them, it's everytime I'm going out somewhere fun &amp; enjoying my life he does stuff like this he tries to make me feel as low as possible before I go.x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To answer the concerned DM's: No I'm not in an abusive relationship, I've been single for nearly 3 years, I went on a few dates around 2years ago and the Occasional date since but I haven't even gotten laid in over 2years as I just haven't found someone I click with yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Convinced he doesn't want me to be happy: -The morning I went on holiday to Manchester he whipped me across the face &amp; i couldn't upload photos for 1st half of holiday as my eye was weeping -Today I'm going to pride celebration &amp; he hurt me again.  I can't take this anymore!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This can't be happening to me: Asshole deliberately walked in on me when I was getting dressed &amp; told me he's allowed to as I'm "no longer female he's allowed to see me topless" I started crying he called me a "silly little girl" who needs psychiatric help  I feel sick &amp; broken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🏳️‍🌈Manchester pride is this weekend &amp; there are some other smaller pride events going on throughout England so woohoo!!!! Hope everyone has a safe weekend free of hate &amp; yeah if anyone does be hateful towards you for being LGBT+ please report it even if it's "just a slur"🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need a dad right now to give me reassurance, feel like I'm walking on egg shells and just trying to focus on crocheting to stop myself shaking.  He's trying to start an argument and I'm refusing to take the bait so he's invading my personal space to intimidate me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grace and sylver would make a better couple as mercedes is a bad wife to him #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So within an hour I've been called: -Fat -Worthless -A waste of space -A waste of bones and organs -Trannie -F****t -lazy And -f***ING stupid  I'm just ignoring him until he goes to meet his current girlfriend as he's annoying me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo That is creepy it's awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing around on a collage app lol 🛌 @MarkyRamone  looks like he's smiling in this pic, it's actually a nice photo of him, also cool action shots of the others as well. The bassist is a really talented dude. #markyramonesblitzkrieg @Pelathor @GregHetson @tattoo_spaceman  https://t.co/yMHNm2RDzp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Family member: always imagined in the future you'd meet a man, get married in a wedding dress as a woman  Me: 1) I can still find my twin flame regardless of my gender &amp; 2) I never want to get married I've been engaged b4 &amp; he turned into a groomzilla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot to post this until yesterday (on Instagram) as had a lot of stuff going on, it was a sh*tty sketch of péla i did on the train ride home from Manchester. It's complete sh*t as I felt sick on the train &amp; was trying not to fall asleep and miss my stop #markyramonesblitzkrieg  https://t.co/lLlNngqJku<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we should start telling people the #AmazonRainforest is filled with expensive materialistic stuff like Notre dame was then maybe people would care about saving it? As ya kno the rainforest is crucial to the earth's survival but that's not as important as materialistic 💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question: why is it when Notre dame, an old manmade building, was burning people donated millions to save it Yet the #AmazonRainforest which is crucial to the planets survival &amp; the equivalent of the earth's lungs &amp; hypothalamus, is burning no one gives a s***? #AmazonFires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so proud of myself right now!  My Spanish lessons are paying off! Read an article in Spanish about public money being used for bull fighting &amp; was able to translate article into English when I was reading almost perfectly, only made few errors when checked translated version!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mood is somewhere between: I need a cuddle  &amp; Touch me and you're dead. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pain relief needs to hurry up and kick in. Also wishing someone would give me some ear plugs as well. Feel like my head's made of lead and everything is so f***ing loud, i can't sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is taking every fibre of my being not to give in to curiousity and ask my drs how a blow to the back of the head makes my nose bleed and gives me black eyes.  I look like a freaking coked up panda. 🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_crucifucks Me too I like to jingle I love wearing a chain on my wallet clipped to my jeans. I love chains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itskayie Sagittarius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit has basically turned into the world's messiest divorce. The UK wants to divorce the EU but the EU wants the UK to pay alimony and the UK isn't happy with the amount it's demanding but the EU isn't willing to lower the amount to make the alimony payments more affordable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Amazon is burning, Bees are dying, The waterways and oceans are polluted, The ice caps are melting, Yet all politicians care about is wasting money on starting conflicts to gain power and control over parts of a planet that's already dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austin_jarboe @Pelathor @tattoo_spaceman @GregHetson @MarkyRamone He's a nice guy, he doesn't make me feel thick when I get confused about stupid things or make me feel immature when I get sidetracked and start rambling on my comments I put on his posts lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>B*tch who outed me doesn't understand why I'm still so broken about it. ERM She put me in danger that's why.  I live with devoted Christians, in a Christian community there's 5 churches, a Catholic school &amp; a dozen christian bookshops/organisations/cafes within a mile of my home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline What the hell is wrong with people? Also that rhino looks a bit skinny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun They made the right decision, yes this might make him feel even more depressed but he's in charge of planes full of passengers daily easyjet just couldn't take that risk of him acting on his suicidal thoughts mid flight and putting the passengers in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda scared about going back to Manchester for pride this weekend as it'll be exactly a month since sh*t hit the fan so kinda scary how much has happened since then. A lot can happen in a month &amp; my life's still falling apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's completely normal for me to go out for walks in my Pyjamas, I'm not having a nervous breakdown just yet. 👌 I do it regularly when I need to clear my head, I ask someone to babysit when Noah's asleep &amp; I sit over the fields behind the house &amp; just enjoy the silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently sitting over the nature reserve near my home in my Pyjamas and watching birds flying in and out of the woods.  It's very cold tonight, I needed to clear my head, it seems like the human race is determined to p*ss me off this past month it's one crisis after the other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Pro-lifer: if you're so pro choice, you have no reason to still be upset about your miscarriage.  Me: actually I do have a reason to still be upset about it, it's called "because I f***ING chose to continue with the pregnancy" there's a huge difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off for a walk for a bit, my brother's babysitting my son, I just need a walk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of people telling me to stay positive, that I need to remember that this time next year things will be different. Honestly right now I can't even imagine waking up tomorrow morning let alone imagine next year.  It's hard to stay positive when everything is so sh*t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at this scary b***Ard outside my window. He's just ate a fly.  https://t.co/SeoGD1p8dd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My cat Princess Tiddlywink's bottom teeth are missing so her tongues permanently sticking out. Melts my heart everytime she looks at me with her big bright eyes and her pink tongue poking out.  She's my fluffy sweetheart. 🐱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't decide if I want to laugh or scream  Son's dumped a bag of cat litter on the kitchen floor and decided to try to clean it up himself without me asking, with his toy hoover. Meh  I want to scream because I have to clean it up but at least he tried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made a pomegranate, mango and orange smoothie. Actually tastes really nice but think it would taste better with some vodka in it but meh can't drink alcohol when Noah's awake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iam_blarj Why I don't even love me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karma is a bitch In February one of their security guards falsely accused me of racism as I refused to go on a date with him, he told me I was a racist because I wasn't "willing to date outside my race"  Went in to buy milk not to be sexually harassed, I've boycotted them since<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I need more painkillers: My head's still hurting, my back hurts, my ribs are agony, my stomach has a swelling size of a grapefruit in it, my wrist is aching like I have hellish pins and needles and I'm very aware of my lip feels like I'm involuntarily doing duck lips 🤕🤕🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to save 2 frogs in a week from plastic waste.  First frog was stuck in a crisp packet on the fields behind my home &amp; he decided to follow me home &amp; set up residency in my pond (has a unique scar on his back)  &amp; rescued another caught in plastic beer packaging on fishing pool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son decided to give me a plate of raw onions &amp; said "dinner" and gave me a bowl of jam &amp; said "cake" lol 😂 Didn't want to hurt his feelings by throwing them away so instead I've used the onions to make a curry for dinner and the jam as filling in #vegan pop tarts for dessert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice, that asshole has told people I'm bipolar and my bruises are caused by my anaemia  So yeah now only way anyone is going to believe me is if I have x rays or an autopsy (if I take another hit to the head) still need to see a neurologist &amp; a dentist after the last few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e I feel your pain my son had a meltdown Today because I wouldn't let him put the cat in my bath whilst I was still in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird question I got asked on Instagram DM:  "Why do you think you're stupid? You quoted Ovid in Latin on @theecjramone post, I had to Google what it meant, if you were as stupid as you think you are you wouldn't have been able to do that, so why do you think you're so stupid?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naturinniuk @PlantBasedNews Cashew milk is my favourite I'm trans F2M and cashew nuts are on my list of foods to eat on my natural Transition diet whilst I wait to start hormones so the milk is an easy way to add them to my diet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my parents didn't spot any signs I was trans as kid: 5yrs: I told my mom I needed to save my pocket money as being a boy is expensive 6yrs: asked dad if I was born a boy &amp; he had me changed into a girl as he didn't want 2sons 10yrs: I cried when I started puberty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a kid my mom tried to scare me cis by giving me an article to read about a man named Adrian who was born female hoping the surgery photos would scare me Instead after I read it I looked at my mom &amp; said "i need to start saving my pocket money being a boy is expensive"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Agreed a a candlelit bubble bath bath with a dinosaur bath fizzer and moisturising bubble bath is the best. Kinda better when I have someone to join me in the bath lol but meh I can practice self love and treat myself to a bubble bath instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesGavin12 Have done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Percy0 😘🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to know a low point in my life?  Happened just now a guy gave me a wonderful compliment and I thanked him and broke down sobbing and when he asked me what was wrong, I replied "I'm not used to people being nice to me, it feels weird"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I have a remarkable brain and I'm very intelligent and have a deep thought process.   Considering I think I'm stupid, ditzy and quite frankly thick as pig 💩 I'm actually quite surprised to have someone say that to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I already had a community psychiatric nurse when met my abuser &amp; they didn't spot the signs of the abuse &amp; after escaping the abuse they just kept prescribing more pills to manage the PTSD so I started having cognitive behavioural therapy (paid privately) instead #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Also mental health services should be trained to spot the red flags that someone's in an abusive situation so they can tactfully approach the subject and provide resources to the victim to help them escape the abuse safely &amp; they should make a record of it just in case #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Definitely, part of leaving an abusive relationship is breaking the trauma bonds, getting through fear of starting over &amp; fear of admitting abuse is happening so mental health services should help victims of abuse deal with these issues &amp; provide resources to get help #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a person has a physical injury that doesn't heal properly, drs reopen the wound &amp; close it so it heals properly Same needs to be done for trauma, if emotional wounds don't heal on their own they should be reopened &amp; treated in a way that helps them heal properly #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes, they don't understand that abuse survivors want to let go of the trauma, their brain wont let them &amp; prescribing more pills isn't helpful, abuse changes a persons mind so they should provide therapies that reopen emotional wounds &amp; help them heal differently #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My transTimeline: 6yrs old: asked dad if was born a boy &amp; had me made into a girl as he didn't want 2 son's 14: felt like something was missing between my legs 15: started wearing binder to school &amp; refused to use girls changing room 16/17/19/21/22/23: tried to come out as trans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming out the closet is scary when you choose to come out Someone outing you and forcing you to come out the closet is downright f***ING terrifying and traumatising.  #LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't take another blow to the head, feel like I'm dying my head's hurting so bad, my previous injury isn't even healed before the next one  My ears have intense pressure in them, I can smell blood, I feel nauseated &amp; Extremely tired all the time. Can't take another head injury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maslanofficial Hello  https://t.co/1o1kOUp1JR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok going to my first pride event as openly trans at the end of the week and I'm so scared.  Trying to decide what to wear because of the weather I usually wear full purple to pride events no idea why, think it's because purples my favourite colour so it's like a safety blanket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I told you so! I said yesterday Maxine's fake illness is becoming a fraud issue. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all this Bible, God stuff Breda is preaching when she's caught she could easily get the insanity plea #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Family member: *brings my son home*  He's covered in s***  Me: why is he?  Them: must have food poisoning.  Me: didn't it occur to u to clean him up?   Them: why he's ur f***ING kid?  Me: u were babysitting  Them: this isn't my fault  Me: get out!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: today is a good day I'm passing really well as male as long as I don't speak and as long as I just pretend I don't speak English.   *Spider lands on me*   Me: *high pitched women's squealing* oh my gosh get it off get it off me! Oh sh** busted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda hate having no one in my life friends/family/anyone. When my son's asleep I get kinda lonely having no one to talk to. Have to constantly have music up full blast to fill the silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I stopped sketching whilst I was dancing I needed a break my hand was cramping lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly I don't deserve forgiveness for lashing out verbally at people because I've been getting abused since the Sunday got off holiday ...but... I can still apologize &amp; put things right with the people I lashed out at so I'm doing just that, I'm determined to put things right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lot of people have DM-ed me concerned about violence I've suffered since returning off holiday. Not ready to say who or where yet but it's because my mom stalked my twitter on a catfish account &amp; deliberately outed my sexuality/gender identity to everyone without my consent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesbianTalkShow An elephant 🐘 I relate to them. They look calm and gentle until you cross them then they'll crush you like a bug.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkyRamone Wow &amp; sorry btw U hurt my feelings with an extremely insensitive comment a few weeks b4 ur manchester gig &amp; didn't apologize, even though made it clear I was pretty p*ssd about it. I nearly didn't go but had to walk passed venue to get to takeaway, ur gig was actually good though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I've suffered another blow to the back of the head. Can't even be bothered to go to hospital this time.  Walked up behind me said "don't scream" &amp; got hit hard in the back of the head, I feel dizzy and sick. I just want to run away from this &amp; have a fresh start with my son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people say hate is a strong word but some people make me realise hate isn't strong enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AAttempting I know some people are too stupid to function. Being trans is not the same as having a split personality it's just mind boggling that they'd even think the two were the same thing 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been sketching up designs for an apple neck tattoo I really want where my Adams apple should be. #artistsoninstagram  https://t.co/xvafQ3dQO8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do people think LGBT representation in the media will turn people LGBT? The older generations of LGBT people only saw heterosexuality on TV &amp; they still turned out LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sketching up designs for a tattoo of a snake coming out my rib on my back and tattoo it's fangs over my scars on my collar bone as people regularly take the p*ss out me that they look like snake bites so might as well steer into the skid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abuse technique: When on public transport like cars, trains, airplanes etc they'll try and box you in. Making u sit in the seat near the window, isn't to be nice, it's so they can sit in the aisle seat &amp; block u from trying to escape as u'll be forced to walk past them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dumb things I've heard since coming out as trans:  - do u have a split personality? No theyre not the same thing?🖕 - did I turn trans because a gay guy rejected me?  No i don't have a crush on a gay guy I've identified as male since I was 6 &amp; been trying to come out since was 15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at my rescue cat rolling on her back on the floor, tapping me with her fluffy paws for a tummy scratch, I honestly feel so lucky to have her she's such a wonderful cat she's a fluffy teddy bear.

<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams Happy birthday, have a wonderful day. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayMotivation  If someone says you hurt them... You hurt them! Say you're freaking sorry.  Just because you don't think what you said was hurtful doesn't change the fact it hurt them so just say you're sorry.  You don't get to decide if you hurt someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been nearly a month since what happened up manchester &amp; the scumbags responsible are carrying on with life as normal Whereas I'm still struggling with grief: -Head injury still hurts  -Have no desire to paint -Vomit constantly from stress -Can't eat/sleep &amp;  -I cry all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Cinderella_007 Hello<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current war in my head:  Me: *loses toothbrush*  Brain: f*** where is it?  Heart: Brain you suck how could you lose it!  Brain: you're full of bulls*** how dare you speak about  Gut: Brain hearts acting out of character, don't take it personal  Brain: Heart you ok?  Heart: no 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leela looks really beautiful in today's episode, she does usually but her outfit really suits her #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate seeing Lisa sad she's so lovely and bubbly, breaks my heart when she's sad. 💔 #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been having chronic chest pains since getting off holiday from Manchester and ERM yeah it's caused by the constant grief and stress also been projectile vomiting from the stress. So yeh apparently the grief is actually killing me SO IF PEOPLE CAN STOP HURTING ME I'D APPRECIATE IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Me too need someone to give neck nuzzles to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't regret coming out as gay (F2M) transgender, I just wasn't prepared to lose everyone. It f***ING sucks &amp; religious a**holes suck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing around on an editing app as I can't sleep  https://t.co/IPdaNqvKva<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll admit I lashed out at a lot of people when I went through trauma in Manchester &amp; because I got beat up a lot after getting off holiday but I'm doing my best to extend olive branches &amp; make things right but some people are making it extremely hard to want to apologize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tip: before going to see @MarkyRamone gigs try reading his book first and you'll soon think twice, I've given it a read &amp; yeh it's basically a written crucifixion of his former band mates, I understand that secrets come out when ur dead but some things are best left out of a book<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asier_gomez The first thing I noticed about the photo was all the plastic waste, there is so much.  (My Spanish is still rusty so sorry for typing in English)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acamsammich Yeah unfortunately I'm related to that horrible person, I called him an ableist piece of ****<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acamsammich Scumbags.🤬 Had a guy rant to me about how angry he was that his boss created a programme &amp; department for mentally disabled people to complete an apprenticeship, the guy called it a child's nursery &amp; said if he wanted to work with disabled people he'd get a job in a nursing home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently working on a seahorse tattoo design for myself.  I love seahorses they represent transmen perfectly as the male seahorses get pregnant.  So I want to incorporate a trans flag into the seahorses colours.  &amp; Working on design of 5 seahorses 1 in each colour of trans flag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Could be a bear? It looks like a bear. 🐻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nmgraywiz @nembotavy_0101 I know being gay &amp; transgender is natural, being LGBT is proven to exist in in thousands of species of animals it's just having people tell me who I am is wrong growing up has taken longer than necessary for me to accept myself for who I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need a dad figure in my life but all the men I look up to as dad figures either turn out to be assholes or try 2 have sex with me Grew up idolising male celebs as they gave me a male role model to look up to, I didn't fancy them, they were next best thing to having a dad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting tip: teasing ur kids and telling them something they're doing makes them look gay, a homo or a lesbian is extremely harmful as you're teaching them that being LGBT is a bad thing that they should tease people or be teased for so just don't do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know my gender identity and sexuality are normal but right now I still feel like a freak that belongs in a roadside attraction as I'm still unlearning all the anti LGBT self hatred, I had brainwashed into me growing up. I know I'm normal but my brain still can't accept that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettWRLD Yeah the word Spaceman looks weird to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spooky_t0fu I know it's so weird time is going way too fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need a dad right now to give me a hug and tell me everything's going to be okay eventually.  I have a dad but he's a devoted Christian so 😔  Been holding a heatpack &amp; hugging myself so it feels like someone else is hugging me &amp; telling myself "everything will be ok Al"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't regret coming out as FtM transgender I'm just scared of being murdered or being alone for the rest of my life as kind of feel unlovable as I'm pre T and haven't had surgery yet so I'm kind of undesirable. It sucks 🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming out I never imagined how hard it would be losing everyone it really hurts, being completely alone &amp; knowing the only family left in my life only speak to me to see my son hurts like hell but honestly I'd rather have be alone than spend the rest of my life in the closet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tried to come out as gay F2M transgender back in May this year but transphobic family scared me back into dressing hyper feminine around them and it made me suicidal but I've disowned all of those assholes now &amp; I feel comfortable using my correct pronouns now so yay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've learned by following @GregHetson on Instagram is that jumpers look good with mens shorts  Added a pic of him to my Transition scrapbook on page about men who's style inspires me.  Since starting my transition I thought only t-shirts looked ok with men's shorts - I was wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5) I realized I was trans 4 years ago but only accepted it in May 2019 (I've experienced dysphoria since childhood) I chose the name Alex Xander after my youngest son's middle name I couldn't decide on a name I liked for myself that went with Alexander so I split it Alex &amp; Xander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo That is a lot of plastic waste. (Sorry only been learning Spanish since January so I tend to switch between two languages)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Transphobe: back in my day men were men and women were women end of.  Me: clearly you don't remember; Twisted Sister, music video for I Want To Break Free by Queen, Pete Burns, Boy George... I could go on but I think I've made my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If someone says u hurt them, u don't get to decide that u didn't. If they tell u something u said to them was: - Insensitive - Hurtful - Offensive - Nasty The right thing u can do is say u're sorry, just because u're not offended by it doesn't invalidate the fact it hurt them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) I have reported my stalker to the police multiple times and they never take me seriously &amp; just give him verbal warnings which never work Had another run in with stalker on monday after I got off holiday, he followed me to church &amp; just stood there watching me in silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) what my stalker said in email to make me so distraught: He insulted my youngest son who was born into heaven and said:  -i deserved it -he's a bag of cells -a science experiment -why waste money on a funeral for medical waste? -that he bets I was happy when he died -an alien<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) My injuries. I don't particularly want to talk about who, why and where yet but since came off holiday I've had scissors thrown at me, few black eyes, scratched with fingernails down face, shoved across a room, hit in head a few times, few busted lips &amp; hit across back twice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) Reason I still went to @MarkyRamone gig even though I was/am still angry with him for his insensitive comment a few weeks earlier is: I went to see Greg hetson. Marky made it worse few days after gig by trying to make me feel stupid &amp; gaslighting me which was vile &amp; disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Answering some DM's today where I've been asked the same questions by multiple people. So it's easier to answer them as tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cat_Bell568 Thank you. It's been difficult as been dependent on it since I was 8 but finally hell bent on making sure I stop doing it for good. Kinda scary though it became an addiction and compulsion so it's weird going cold turkey x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have started my Sunday with a tennis ball sized bruise to the face, this is starting to become a weekly occurence. Freaking hurts like holy hell. 🤕🤕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Ditto self destruction is my greatest talent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@depressionnote 💙😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of the problems in my life could have been avoided if people stopped being so selfish and actually listened to me &amp; respected my boundaries.  There are rules &amp; boundaries in place for a reason and when people ignore them is when things go wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexxaandraax33 I follow back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise b*tch... I'm f***ING transgender (f2m)...hmmm I guess I pass better than I think I do.  https://t.co/qOVH8wetHf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo Que opinas sobre tauromaquia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Religious preacher: everything happens for a reason it's all part of god's plan  Me: really? Is that so? Well what reason did God have for me being raped 6 months after I had a life threatening miscarriage? And why didn't he stop it? I begged god to save me &amp; no one did. #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of religious preachers telling me everything happens for a reason! No! Sometimes horrible things happen to good people and there is no f***ING reason why! Its not God punishing them for their sins, its not karma, its just f***ING s***, everythings s*** &amp; thats just how it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_im_jules_ Thank you it was difficult to do as I've been dependent on it since I was 8 years old and I'm 23 now so was a huge step to make as my safety nets gone now and yeah kinda nervous about recovering but I actually did it, I can actually start treatment to fade my scars now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been struggling mentally with what happened up manchester and my heart still physically hurts, feels like all I'm capable of doing is crying all the time... ...But today I made a big step... I got rid of my self harm kit &amp; yeah I feel anxious &amp; stressed but I did it, it's gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoshWithTyler This made me smile, thank you for posting this ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breda's gone too far first Harry who wasn't even given a chance to be a dad and now Joel who wasn't even a dad he was just a horney priest. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I miss Manchester. 😭😭😭😭 I miss the gay village I actually felt safe there I didn't make friends there I was made part of a community instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People lashing out when they're struggling mentally or with trauma aren't attention seekers, immature or trying to create drama.  They're actually screaming out for help when they can't verbalise what's wrong, they're mentally in agony &amp; crying out in pain They're not bad people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling someone an attention seeker or claiming they're just trying to create drama when they're struggling mentally isn't okay.  Bottling up their feelings makes it worse &amp; when someone commits suicide everyone says they wish they'd talked to them about how they were feeling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grafismo me puso fuera de mi desayuno 🤢😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💔Te ame desde el momento en que puse mis ojos en ti. Te echo de menos. Se que te lastime, pero todavia te amo. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After everything I've gone through this can't be how it ends for me I want to give up, I'm tired of fighting but I keep thinking this can't be it for me, there has got to be somebody for me, it can't just end like this, being beaten down by life until I'm too tired to get back up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny when you're dead, how people start listening🎵🎶  A person can lash out &amp; make it clear they're not ok &amp; dr's just prescribe another pill &amp; no one really listens to them  Then when they die everyone is shocked but the signs were there all along but no one was listening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highlights since I got off holiday: Stalker: "I bet u were happy when that bag of cells died, why did u waste money on a funeral for medical waste?"  &amp; Mom: u're a slut u just couldn't keep ur legs shut it's y u have 2 kids from 2 dad's" WORDS HURT WORSE THAN BROKEN BONES DO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ELLEmagazine I don't understand why she's getting all this back last Halle bailey is beautiful and her facial feature have a mermaid look to them naturally. Her eyes and face shape remind me of illustrations of mermaids in old books I read as a kid. She's going to be a beautiful Ariel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I hate when people compare homosexuality to pedophilia There is a huge difference between the two it's called consent. Homosexuality is sex/love between consenting people of the same gender  Pedophilia is rape and grooming of a minor and trauma bonding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just sitting here on the sofa in silence, watching as my life falls apart around me and I feel completely helpless and alone... ...It's only when you're dead that people start listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I look at how much trauma I've gone through especially the past few weeks, I realise my eldest son's the only thing keeping me alive, which makes me feel guilty as no one let - alone a child - should have to carry the burden of being someone's reason to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mood:  Sitting on my bed in the dark, listening to Small Bump by Ed Sheeran on repeat. 💔💔💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMail Ok I didn't see this coming. I expected them to find stuff to do with the Clinton's in there but didn't expect them to find something like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Answer to other DM's regarding my stalker: My stalker has been stalking me for 4yrs he's a guy I used to work with who I rejected as 1) I was in a relationship &amp; 2) he shoved his hand up my shorts without consent. He got fired &amp; started stalking me &amp; I have a restraining order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I left a bad review about gig as karma's a bitch: Few weeks before gig @MarkyRamone made a hurtful &amp; very insensitive reply to 1 of my comments on Instagram &amp; never apologized. I was going through trauma I just didn't need it.  &amp; Its easier for him to block someone than say sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline I could type out a list but I'm going to post a link to a website that has links to all domestic abuse charities for men and women in the UK instead (it's more helpful) #abusetalk   https://t.co/k4rmfHUKWl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline ☺️ #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline the jobs are mainly charity work &amp; advocacy work  There are also jobs where people can volunteer with domestic abuse charities to respond to calls on their helplines  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Here's a link to women's aid website that explains the bill as well. #abusetalk    https://t.co/txChBtuzR2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It's a bill that supports &amp; puts victims of abuse 1st &amp; supports them during them by helping put measures in place that prevent abuse occuring &amp; holding abusers responsible  website that has pdfs of the bills  https://t.co/ZazhCkB0Ha (Also a copy of bill on women's aid) #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline If you're in the UK here's a charity that really helped me when I left an abusive relationship Women's aid: 0808 2000 247  They also have a website which is easy to find on a Google search.  #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Philipt52265699 Agreed  I know the writers wanted to shock us with an unexpected character death but Harry seriously?  Ste still wouldve been a shock death for us as he's been on the show for ages Also white supremacist dad vs innocent dad framed for a crime I know who's worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 I'm not suicidal or anything just hurts what that sicko said x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My stalker taunted me about my pregnancy loss, told me I deserved it. Lucas should've turned 2 in July &amp; that monster taunted me about it.  I don't want to die but I don't want to remember what he said anymore either, it hurts too much.  His words are still haunting me. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep lashing out at everyone since what happened up manchester: as I've only ever been nice to people throughout my life &amp; yet they inflict trauma on me so what's the point in even trying anymore? I just can't take anyone else hurting me I was a good person I didn't deserve this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This smells fishy: Either someone murdered him or someone paid off the guards to let him kill himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since I got off holiday I've been beaten up 4 times and had a pair of scissors thrown at me (thankfully my Pleather jacket took the brunt of the force) and honestly none of the physical injuries hurt as badly as that email my stalker sent me did. Feel like I'm dying from grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeJonXIII @XNicoleAnistonX Too many to pick one but pretty much anything that involves diced tofu marinated in something spicy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important: Trans men are men  Gay means a man who is attracted to other men So when a ftm transgender man says that they are gay, it means they are gay and attracted to men It doesn't mean they're lesbians, "technically still straight" or just confused.  #TransIsBeautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always keep a copy of the only photo I have of my youngest son in my pocket wherever I go. It doesn't matter if I'm going to a concert, if I'm visiting friends or I'm going to the corner shop for toilet roll. I always keep Lucas Alexander's photo in my pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason I've been so depressed &amp; lashing out just lately is because my stalker sent me sick email after the gig in Manchester I went to taunting me about my youngest son who died.  The police did nothing My heart physically hurts &amp; I don't want to remember what he said anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cut my holiday in Manchester short I just didn't tell anyone,  I actually came home at 12:45pm on the Friday instead of the Sunday hence why I'm wearing the same outfit in the rest of my holiday snaps. After the sick email I received after the gig I just wanted to go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My trauma counseling sessions are starting to increasingly feel like  Same sh*t different shrink  I know that I have a dad who I see regularly yet I'm still searching for a father figure, yet everytime I try to discuss my other issues with my shrink they just prescribe more pills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After gig in Manchester July 25th I went to my phone connected to the venue's WiFi when I turned it back on &amp; received sick email off my stalker taunting me about youngest son who died It hurt. Lucas Alexanders 2nd birthday should've been July 8th &amp; that sicko taunted me about it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SummerGregg69 I know Harry was the last person I expected to die I thought mercedes, james, Liam or ste would've been killed before Harry did as harry was harmless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SummerGregg69 I know but I think in a toss up between white supremacist dad and a scared dad framed for a crime he didn't commit I kinda think ste deserves to die more than Harry did. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why couldn't Breda have killed ste instead of Harry? Seriously? Harry didn't deserve to die he wasn't a bad dad he was scared &amp; wasn't given a chance, ste is a freaking white supremacist  #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda think the #e4 narrator person should've gave us a warning before airing the second half of #hollyoaks as that scene with ste at the end was terrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That scene with ste was terrifying and disturbing to watch #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eco friendly tip: make scrapghans (crocheted/knitted blanket made of scrap yarn) out of left over scrap balls of yarn from ur projects &amp; odd full skiens of yarn that are discontinued It's eco friendly way 2 utilise small odd balls of yarn instead of them going to landfills #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Agreed but on the plus side end of August is Manchester pride so woohoo bring on the gayness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Religious preachers: God would never give you more than you could handle...  Me: quite frankly I'm starting to think God is taking the p*ss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting tip: If you suspect your child is #lgbt or they tell you they are DO NOT &amp; I repeat DO NOT tell anyone else without your child's permission &amp; DO NOT post it on social media, it's not your right to tell anyone without their consent and you could be putting them in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  A dumbass tried to claim being transgender IS THE SAME as having split personality disorder.   I'm truly baffled by her ignorance. #lgbt #TransRightsAreHumanRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok update on my health issue: I've developed shortness of breath, chest pains and low blood pressure it is definitely an infection that's spread.  They think it's related to undiagnosed broken ribs I didn't know I had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand how people can't exclude trans people in the LGBT community and be transphobic when I won't even do an LGBT inspired painting/sketch until I've worked out a way to include elements of the trans pride flag into it as well as the #LGBT pride flag #Transgender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a trip to a&amp;e as I'm leaking bile, feel like my intestines/kidneys are on fire and my vomit has burned the skin off my mouth/tongue/gums strong chance I have a seriously infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning, I have a trip to a&amp;e as I'm leaking bile, feel like my intestines/kidneys are on fire and my vomit has burned the skin off my mouth/tongue/gums strong chance I have a seriously infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm the opposite I found an amazing takeaway in Manchester and since returning home I already miss it and can't wait to move there permanently just for the takeaway alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been up cemetery all day visiting my youngest son's grave.  I feel heartbroken but calm but I needed to talk to him.  I put poppies on his grave as well as when I found out I was pregnant with him I called him my poppy seed as that was how small he was. My perfect poppy seed 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate ste now! Why couldn't Breda kill him instead of Harry he's the worst dad in #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I've disowned her for it and blocked her on everything now and removed her out my will. Family means nothing when they pull stuff like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My mom screenshots my selfies and sends them to her boyfriend and posts them on Facebook groups calling me a slut and an unfit mother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annoying thing about being a single parent with a dead beat baby daddy is when you get really sick and need to go to a&amp;e and you have no one to babysit the kids so you just have to grit your teeth through the pain and pray it's not appendicitis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided on a design for my first tattoo/s Having my favourite lyric from the song Poison Heart by @RamonesOfficial tattooed around an abstract human heart design (designs based off a painting I did a month ago)  &amp; getting concert ticket from #markyramonesblitkrieg tattooed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Bitch: the reason you look so gaunt is your false eyelashes Me: what?  Bitch: they make you look like a drug addict as your eyes look sunken in Me: stop being such a bitch false eyelashes don't make me look like a drug addict you're just being a bitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Spill Mr Hatfield tell us  Give us hints: Have you gotten someone pregnant? Is your dog pregnant? Have you gotten engaged?  Are you moving in with your girlfriend?  Spill damn it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youthdvadvocate I am it's just so f***ed up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cat_Bell568 It's freaking sick on so many levels and perverted and incestuous it's so freaking wrong it's next level twisted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blaming ur children for "ruining ur body" can seriously affect their #mentalhealth, from experience they can develop: -unhealthy body image issues/eating disorders -depression/feelings of inadequacy/guilt for simply existing -resentment towards u -fear of pregnancy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting tip: Don't blame your children for "ruining your body", having kids doesn't ruin your body and blaming them for your own insecurities damages their mental health.  Instead create a daily family workout u and ur kids can do together. U have fun &amp; u lose the baby weight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter: Mom: ur a slut flashing ur flesh all the time Me: not fat shaming u but are u sure ur not just jealous that I lost the baby weight &amp; u didn't? I spent my childhood being blamed for ruining ur body &amp; when I gave birth I made a post natal exercise plan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom has gone psycho stalker on me stalking me on social media using catfish accounts under fake names &amp; making screenshots/notes of my posts ...it gets worse... When I found out she was messaging me ON A DATING SITE on a catfish account posing as a woman to find out if I'm gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun It's obviously going to do damage as they're inhaling chemicals into their lungs. It doesn't matter if it's an e-cigarette or an actual cigarette they're still inhaling chemicals into their lungs which shouldn't be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes when it comes to my behaviour I struggle to work out whether I'm just very stubborn or just severely traumatised.  It's sometimes hard to tell whether I won't give in out of general stubbornness or stubbornness I developed from the trauma #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting win: Got my son to fall asleep by cuddling him and singing him Poison Heart by @RamonesOfficial  Fastest he's ever fallen asleep.  Who needs traditional lullabies when I can sing him Ramones songs instead. 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Goodnight, sweet dreams and I can't sleep I really don't feel well and I have literally no one to babysit my son for me whilst I go up a&amp;e I've got to wait until tomorrow afternoon which is the earliest my dad will be available to babysit. I'm f*cked if this is appendicitis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤬🤬 My son decided to celebrate not needing stitches today after getting his penis stuck in a tape measurer by dipping it in a pot of silver glitter when he was supposed to have been asleep. He's having an emergency shower &amp; I have to hoover glitter off his bed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: the tape measurer has been removed off my son's penis and still have no idea how he got it stuck and quite frankly I don't want to know how, I'm just glad he didn't need stitches or surgery and he's at home now feeling sorry for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another trip to a&amp;e with my son he stole my tape measurer when I was repairing the bath and got his penis stuck in the actual tape measurer part the measuring part retracts into. It was hanging off his penis. I'm kinda scared in case he's accidentally circumsised himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those scenes with Sinead going to see Laurie's body were so powerful and heartbreaking at the same time.   @Stephdavis77 is such an amazing actress. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awwww hope she feels better soon. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear men of the world  Taking care of your own kids isn't called babysitting it's called being their dad you're supposed to take care of them!  You can't expect sexual favours/rewards for cleaning your own home &amp; doing chores, you freaking live there you're supposed to clean it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter:  Woman: why'd u let ur son have a doll's pram, they're for girls? Me: so when he's older he enjoys being a dad instead of being one of those sexist dad's who thinks taking care of their own kids is baby sitting &amp; expects sexual rewards for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyleipryor @Hollyoaks You played the role of Laurie with amazing (slightly disturbing 😂) accuracy and you are such an incredible actor, also the scriptwriters did brilliantly with his death as how he died was unexpected as I thought one of the other characters would kill him so was a clever twist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baby naming tip: If u name ur child after a friend/family member u admire don't try to force ur child to grow up to be just like them let them have their own identity otherwise they'll develop: -low self esteem -no sense of self worth -feelings of inadequacy -no sense of identity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asshole encounter: Mom: you have a split personality why you go by 2 names Me: u named me after a friend, I lost my childhood being forced to be like her so I ended up with self esteem issues, no sense of self worth &amp; no sense of identity I'm just have my own identity now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I love about #hollyoaks is that they blindside us with some of the plot twists.  They'll have a few somewhat predictable storylines then they'll suddenly blindside us with a storyline no one saw coming Like Brookes pregnancy they didn't give us any hints until that episode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that I loved about Laurie's death in #Hollyoaks was that it was accidental. How evil he was everyone expected him to be murdered by one of the other characters but instead he died accidentally following complications to injuries he sustained in a car crash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Good morning have a thrilling Thursday and Stay safe the world's going crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It affects all future relationships in different ways as the survivor becomes aware of the red flags so looks out for them in all relationships they develop, they also develop trust issues and insecurities that can have a negative impact on their future relationships #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Domestic abuse isn't reported because: - victim blaming - scared of the trial process - fear of children's services involvement and losing their children - trauma bonds with their abuser that causes them to feel guilty for reporting it - fear of their abuser #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline #abusetalk  https://t.co/6cDrHceJUg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Raising awareness to abuse will help people notice the red flags of abuse sooner in the relationship which could help lower the death rate of abuse victims as they are able to escape the situation sooner when it's safer rather than later as they'll know the signs #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Victims don't leave because of : -fear of starting over after abuse - they're too scared to - been threatened with consequences if they leave - blackmail - financial abuse which means they lack the finances to leave - trauma bonding #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Sinead. Even after everything Laurie did to her she still tried to save him, she didn't have to try to save him. I'm glad Laurie's dead though he was evil #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brookes pregnant!? No freaking way I did not see that coming I thought it would be Sinead who got pregnant not Brooke! #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Cleo's outfit, she looks so beautiful  #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that Mitchell looks at Scott with the same look in his eyes when's he's dressed as Anita as he does when Scott's out of his drag attire. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Juliette did to Brooke was wrong but I'm really glad she saved Brooke when she realised her mistake. I hope Brooke forgives her and this is a turning point in their friendship. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's heartbreaking that there are innocent children caged in worse living conditions in migrant detention centres, than mass shooters are kept in, in prison.  #massshootings #massshooting #DonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrairieMouse55 Police can't really do much as they're calling it all empty threats and she's not acted on her threats yet x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWingless @DailyMail I know but it seems to have gotten worse since he came into power. People who are committing these crimes that people are afraid of are starting to use trump's own words to justify their actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now accepting applications for a father figure in my life. Description: a warm loving supportive male role model I can call dad and look up to as a supportive father figure  Also accepting applications for a mom figure Description: warm, loving supportive female role model<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrairieMouse55 Thank you just feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm being blackmailed, stalked and having my own son used as a weapon against me it hurts. I trusted these people so who am I supposed to trust now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMail This is so depressing, can't imagine how scared they must have been over a car backfiring. Seriously #DonaldTrump open your eyes this is your America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people keep being horrible to me? I'm a good person I don't deserve this, haven't I been through enough the past few years? Why are people who are supposed to be supporting me turning into psychos now I'm getting my life back on track why don't they want me to be happy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone wants to find out about the destruction of my life and the sheer hell that I'm living feel free to read my tweets it's covering everything in real time as I lose absolutely everything.  I've officially hit rock freaking bottom &amp; I didn't deserve this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my family are having bets on how long they think it'll be before I commit suicide. So freaking lovely no wonder they're being such assholes they don't want to lose a bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm calling the police on my mom. She's mentally unstable after what she's done. She called me trying to blackmail me by claiming she's going to make false children's services reports claiming I have split a personality &amp; I'm violent unless I let her have access to my son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my mom has revoltingly been stalking me on twitter and Instagram on a catfish account posing as someone else &amp; screenshotting my posts and sending them to people and slut shaming me and making me out to be a bad mom. How f**king sick &amp; mentally unstable is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fed up of crying about my angel baby honestly what should have been his second birthday in July hit me a lot harder than I imagined it would, I just keep crying all the time and cuddling my reborn doll of him I just miss him so much and I blame myself for what happened<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Those scenes with Laurie and sinead then was terrifying to watch  @Stephdavis77  is such an incredibly talented actress oh my gosh she was brilliant. ❤️ #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap Laurie reminded me so much of my son's dad then, it was actually terrifying to watch. Which is a compliment to the actor as he plays an obsessive narcissist well but I actually need to go throw up. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those little 💩💩💩💩 how dare they hurt Scott he's wonderful, harmless and Anita is a beautiful extension of his personality.  I hate when anyone hurts Scott he's a good guy he deserves to be happy. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly when #Hollyoaks bought @Stephdavis77 back I was a bit mehhhhhh 😕 about Sinead but now I absolutely love her, she's stunning and such an incredibly talented actress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Laurie that was a low blow trying to use her brother against her. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of want Sinead to kill Laurie I hate him. He's an evil narcissist. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it just me who shouted "oh no Sinead run!" At the TV? #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How beautiful is Anita seriously? I could spend 3+ hours doing my makeup and look no where near as beautiful as she does. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Agreed she's stunning , she could wear a bin liner and still look like a catwalk model<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I Kinda love Brookes outfit, it looks similar to the dress I wear for pride events. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lisa looks gorgeous her outfit is amazing #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people blame mental illness, video games, horror movies etc for people committing mass shootings?  There are legal ways to shoot stuff to release stress without any living thing getting hurt it's called shooting ranges and paintballling.  #massshootings #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Agreed I have multiple mental illnesses, I watch crime documentaries daily and I watch horror movies daily and I've never once had the urge to shoot up Walmart, garlic festival or any other place/person/animal.  I go to the shooting range or paintballling &amp; do sh*t legally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld The actual ****? That's like some slavery day sh*t  if they can't arrest people on horseback in a way that doesn't involve using rope to lead them through the streets like a slave then they shouldn't be arresting people on horseback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline They aren't gay hunting vigilantes they're extremists who are murdering gay people.  Vigilantes go after criminals and there is nothing criminal about legal age consenting people being in love regardless of their gender identity and sexuality.  #lgbt #loveislove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If white people who do violent crimes are mentally ill And  People of any other race who do violent crimes are terrorists  I'm mixed race (white British &amp; middle eastern) Hypothetically if I were to commit a violent crime would #DonaldTrump call me a terrorist or mentally ill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning I'm cleaning the house up and I'm exhausted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When are people going to realise that thoughts &amp; prayers after a #massshooting arent going to do anything to help prevent further #massshootings ?  What will prevent further mass shootings is enforcing stricter gun laws &amp; making mental health services more affordable #DonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is #DonaldTrump going to realise mental illness isn't the reason for #massshooting ?  The real mental health problem in America is that it's cheaper to pay for an assault weapon &amp; bulk ammo than it is to pay for ongoing mental health services &amp; medication. #EndGunViolence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So by #DonaldTrump logic: White person doing mass shooting is blamed on mental illness Any other race doing a mass shooting is blamed on terrorism So... Hypothetically what excuse would he use if the shooter was biracial?  Mental illness fueled terrorism? #massshooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the love of all that is holy will #DonaldTrump stop blaming mental illness for the mass shootings?  Lack of gun restrictions are to blame!  I have mental illnesses (yes plural) but I've never once had the urge to shoot up a freaking walmart or garlic festival! #massshooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't romantic at all he's violated a cow by placing a ring on it's nipple. I doubt people would find it romantic if he proposed by forcing a ring onto a humans nipple without consent so why does it make it romantic that it's a cows nipple? #Vegan #EndSpeciesism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChloePa56883734 I hope so I love the happy mushy moments but after a long day dealing with my toddler, mama needs to switch off my brain and watch me some Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Hmmm I think she she should be saying: assholes like her who's bigoted views are breeding hatred and prejudice are to blame for the mass shootings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChloePa56883734 I hope so as drama is meant to ensue at the festival what if there's more to the drama than Brooke and Juliette's squabbling? He could show up and someone maybe Cleo (actress is going on maternity leave soon) could end up getting hurt in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a thought but what if Laurie shows up at the festival sineads at as the van crashed near woodlands, Laurie knows Sinead is going to a festival and she was meeting the girls at a rave near woods? Just a theory would be an epic showdown if he did. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh 💩💩 I did not see that coming #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I respect Sinead for not going to Laurie's trial as seeing him get sentenced might help some survivors but how obsessed Laurie is with her it's the ultimate middle finger to him going out with Sami &amp; enjoying her life without him instead #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews When a white person does a mass shooting they blame mental illness But when a person of any other race does it they blame terrorism One excuse fuels the stigma all mentally ill people are dangerous And  The other excuse fuels racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a white person goes on a killing spree it's blamed on mental health issues But when a person of any other race goes on a killing spree it's terrorism   This mentality fuels racism and fuels the stigma behind mental health issues that every mentally ill person is dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of praying after a mass shooting enforce stricter gun laws Instead of praying for rape/abuse victims enforce laws that protect them &amp; not blame them &amp; Instead of praying for solution to climate change ban single use plastic &amp; enforce laws that help protect the environment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If prayer really worked then the mass shootings wouldn't have happened If prayer really worked people wouldn't be getting abused If prayer really worked everyone would be safe &amp; have access to clean water, food &amp; shelter &amp; If prayer really worked our planet wouldn't be dying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Will see if I can get a baby sitter to go to the Manchester gig. I just really miss Manchester and I need to go back already I miss it there so much. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I get called one of those every freaking day next time someone calls it you simply say "chupa mi pinga, por favour" will soon shut them up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to break my silence. This is going to be terrifying but totally worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 Thanks, I hit self destruct mode after I returned home from Manchester on Sunday and deliberately burned bridges with people I love and always will love and they'll never forgive me so needed to put an end to this because I can't lose anyone else out of hurt.

<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 Thank you I'm speaking out now as I realised everything bad in my life could be solved with four words "my dad is homophobic" I'm planning on moving to Manchester permanently and never coming back I'm determined to make my fresh start happen soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Am I immature that I couldn't stop laughing when I was up Manchester seeing #markyramonesblitzkrieg because the gay hotel I was staying in was on a road called Sackville Street? I thought the irony was too hilarious. 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love Anita she's so beautiful and Scott seems so much happier in himself since he became Anita she's like an extension of his personality that helps him express the parts of himself he normally wouldn't know how to express. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My son's going to need his head glued.  Yep you read that right the little poop is going to need a patch of hair shaved off around the injury and have his head glued  He only had his hair cut on Wednesday. For **** sake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to wish my son's head would stop bleeding as he's getting blood all over me, he got it all over the taxi and yeah his hair and clothes are soaked through with blood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My eldest son is currently in hospital as he got a bit carried away dancing to Does Your Mother Know by ABBA and he accidentally whacked his head off the wall and yeah he's most likely going to need stitches there's blood all over my new sofa haven't even bought it an hour. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been getting my will and funeral plans updated to write my parents out of them anyway...

<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline The type of abuse can change: Mental abuse can become physical abuse Physical abuse can become sexual abuse Sexual abuse can become coercive abuse etc But abuse can't change into something positive as abuse in itself is wrong #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Yes whilst we can't stop bad people from existing in general we can prevent it: -by education on the red flags,  - promoting positive self image which prevents people settling for less than they deserve  - ending shame of getting divorced/slut shaming/victim blaming #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline No, abuse can't be forgiven because abuse isn't a mistake.  Abuse is not like accidentally spilling red wine on someone's white carpet; the damage it causes can't be shampooed out, you cant replace the soul that got hurt or cover it with a rug it doesn't work that way. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sometimes struggle with my reality as I survived by mistake the door lock didn't work properly so I was able to escape. I survived because a few mm piece of metal jammed.  Sometimes it's hard to accept that the past 3 1/2yrs of my life happened because of a mistake #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confession since leaving abuse:  I feel guilty for surviving the abuse at times because I keep thinking if I hadn't survived the abuse he'd be in jail for my death &amp; he wouldn't be out hurting other women. I sometimes feel guilt for his future victims for surviving him #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline No.  It may stop for a while but they'll always fall back into old ways, all it takes is to metaphorically hit their trigger and they'll fall into old ways. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Thats bull**** doing that. I went on a bus the other day in just a fishnet mini dress with black lingerie fully visible underneath  and no one kicked me off the bus or the train I took afterwards or out the shops and cafes I went to even though it was completely see through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already loved liberty but now I love her more than ever! The moment #brienna told her about the surrogacy plans I was hoping liberty would offer to be their surrogate as she's so wonderful! #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I respect misbah I thought she was going to be a b*tch to Maxine about her condition and out her but she was extremely professional, supportive and such a a kind person. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo #brienna worked it out! They're such a perfect couple she completes him. I wish I could find my sienna, my Mrs right, attempted child abduction aside they're relationship goals. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Fingers and toes crossed they sort it out, they're relationship goals, they're both beautiful but damaged in opposite ways he's damaged which has made him tender hearted and she's damaged which has made her sly. They complete each other. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ahhh that's good then I can't stop lashing out at everyone at the minute, I offered a homeless guy my bottle of water during the heatwave so he thanked me by trying force me to go to an ATM machine &amp; withdraw money for him. I'm done being nice to people the human race can do one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Men are my barrier from reaching climax  Thank goodness for lesbians and bi/pan women<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I could do with one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel guilty every single day for surviving the abuse my ex put me through I keep thinking if I hadn't survived he'd be in prison and he wouldn't be hurting anyone else. I feel so freaking guilty for surviving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to wonder if I'm passed the point of saving or if I just don't want to be saved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've officially hit self destruct mode on my life and the damage has been too severe to possibly rebuild the bridges I've burned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so sad for grace she looks beautiful in her dress, I love Maxine's wedding dress but hate her for what she's doing to Damon she doesn't deserve him. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marnie's becoming one of my favourite characters she's so lovely now she's an amazing parent figure, she's funny and she's got her annoying traits that have become her loveable quirks #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Me too Marnie stepped when Juliette lost both her parents she's becoming the mum figure to her she needed when she was younger. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the verge of tears at #Hollyoaks what Sienna's going through is so sad she just wants her babies back she's living every mother's worst nightmare and she's just desperate, she acted out of desperation not to be cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe I'm taking parenting lessons off #hollyoaks but Marnie is an incredible parent figure to Juliette she's strict but does it with their best interests at heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I laughed way too hard at this lmao #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"you're in trouble with a capital T" I'm going to use that one on my son next time he's driving me nuts another reason to love Marnie. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love liberty she's such a ray of sunshine even with her depressing 6months to live poem. Maxine doesn't deserve liberty's friendship #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay I found the TV remote in time for the storyline we've all been waiting for in #hollyoaks ... Maxine's wedding hehe I can watch it on a bigger screen now instead of my friends tiny TV! (Not that I don't appreciate my friends lovingly letting me borrow her tv lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_crucifucks That's gorgeous already! Wow I bet it'll look incredible when it's finished ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I don't know I honestly don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gay people can still register the attractiveness of the opposite sex they just have no desire to sleep with them A gay person can tell someone of the opposite sex they look hot in their pic or the way they're dressed/tattoos makes them look sexy etc but it's JUST compliments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A gay person can still look at someone of the opposite sex and notice they look hot and admit it &amp; it doesn't mean they're Bisexual. It's like how people with nut allergies can still think food with nuts in looks tasty but they'd never have any desire to eat it #LGBT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline This is why I stopped my cats from sleeping in my bedroom I became convinced they were trying to murder me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like such a f***ING mom right now: At a #markyramone tour thing, I'm wearing full freaking black and fishnets and I've just text my babysitters the words to my son's bedtime nursery rhyme and asked for a non alcoholic drink at the bar. Oh my f***ING gosh I feel frumpy. 🖕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 How come?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my uselessness at reading directions got me a date with a beautiful brunette who helped me find the venue apparently reading Google maps directions backwards is a good thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swear @MarkyRamone tour is cursed at the minute as been planning to go to this for over a month &amp; so far: I cut my foot   The unbearable heats causing me to sweat my concealer &amp; False eyelashes off have semi healed black eye &amp; Semi healed very painful cuts &amp; bruises to my face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to see @MarkyRamone on tour in a few hours but honestly how hot it is today I kinda want to stay in bed with the fan on as the heats going to be hell but I'm going as venue is closer to hotel than pub even though at the pub I have a chance of getting laid ... 🤔decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mood: Kind of want to have a one night stand with someone off tinder tonight Kind of don't want them seeing or feeling my huge lump Kind of think I'll have a night of "self love" instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confession about life after abuse  I'm angry all the time I'm angry at the people who hurt me I'm an angry with the courts/police for failing me I'm angry at religious preachers telling me everything happens for a reason I'm angry at people for not seeing the signs #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Morning I'm supposed to be going to a concert tonight and all I can think about is how much happier my son is with his uncle than he is with me. Tempted not to even go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline The abusive tendencies are always there in the background with the abuser but they start very small and gradually escalate the abuse towards their victims #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline The constant state of fear, stress and isolation can cause survivors to develop mental health conditions like PTSD &amp; anxiety etc as their brain becomes used to and adapts to the situation and once they leave the brain is constantly still in fight or flight mode #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline It's a mixture  Sometimes the signs of abuse are obvious: broken bones, bruises, bust lips Other times they're less obvious like the person suddenly neglecting their appearance, seeming sad all the time and withdrawn &amp; long periods of time without hearing from them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseTalkOnline Domestic abuse is any form of deliberately hurtful behaviour done to someone with the sole intention of hurting them E.g. hitting someone, calling them hurtful names etc in order to hurt their feelings #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Apparently it's not appropriate to name a painting "I f***ING hate you, asshole" So thank you Spanish lessons I've kept the painting name but wrote it in Spanish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me after I realise someone I'm attracted to is actually just a pretty face with a hideous personality.  https://t.co/lGJgQQ04wb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres a difference between uploading a sexy selfie online &amp; allowing comments  &amp; Someone being sexually assaulted/harassed in real life The difference is consent.  They're consenting to comments on their pic they uploaded they didn't consent to being touched in real life #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because a person uploads sexy selfies to Insta doesn't mean trauma from being sexually assaulted, raped and sexually harassed in real life is invalid Just because a person likes to flaunt their body doesn't mean they deserve to be raped &amp; sexually harassed. #MeToo #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently according to an asshole there is no difference between strangers complimenting my appearance and body online on a sexy selfie  And A stranger in real life grabbing me, kissing me without consent after I said no &amp; following me home after I pushed him off me &amp; ran #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a mental health advocate has tried to invalidate my trauma from being sexually assaulted in real life just because I got a confidence boost off thirsty guys telling me I looked beautiful on a sexy selfie I uploaded to Instagram Yeah there's a huge difference asshole #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 The dudes not a professional he's just a narcissist using being a mental health advocate as an aesthetic to boost his career. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Take your own advice x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I have zero tolerance for: People who use being a mental health advocate as an aesthetic to boost their career.  Using othet people's trauma and illnesses to line your own pockets is never ok. #TuesdayMotivation #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 I know it's such a shame as he seemed like a nice to everyone else but I saw through his bullshit back in January I just needed to get enough evidence to prove he's a narcissistic asshole using being a mental health advocate as an aesthetic to boost his career<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something ironic about a mental health advocate telling someone with mental health issues that they don't know how to speak to them like a normal human being, don't you think? #mentalhealth #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love testing people who pretend to be good guys to see how far I have to push them to get the mask to fall off   I'm an empath I can see through their bullshit from a mile away they're not a good guy they're an asshole pretending to be a good guy to get people to like them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Life tip: Don't wear strawberry body lotion during a heatwave you will get chased by wasps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I for once agree with you, decided to wear pink and black today and I look very sexy and judging by the comments the thirsty guys on my Instagram seem to think so too. Xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People ask me why I teach my son about his Indian heritage even though his dad abused me.

<|startoftext|>@peterlcurry Yeah it was gone out for coffee with a guy I met on a dating app, we were discussing deal breakers and then he went and said that. My deal breakers were common sense things like abuse &amp; heavy drug use not stuff like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterlcurry Was on a date and discussing dating deal breakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've noticed since escaping abuse I notice red flags in TV shows a lot that I never noticed beforehand  E.g re watching Season 1 of the big bang theory and how Leonard interacts with penny and my brain is like 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 he's a narcissist &amp; not a good guy at all #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bisexual men:  You deserve love, you deserve your happily ever after,  you deserve a committed relationship, You don't deserve to erased, invalidated and fetishized.   I see you, you are valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bisexual women: You deserve love, you deserve your happily ever after,  you deserve a committed relationship,  you don't deserve to be fetishized and objectified.   I see you, your sexuality is valid and not a fetish and you shouldn't be erased. #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important:  Bisexual women: Are not fetishes Don't all want threesomes  Aren't basically straight Aren't confused Aren't greedy  Bisexual men: Aren't invalid Shouldn't be erased  Aren't basically gay Aren't confused  Aren't greedy  #bisexual #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cat_Bell568 Yeah some people need to be taught how to think before they speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love what you do your tweets are like cuddles I can read. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re watching Season 1 of #TheBigBangTheory and Leonard's behaviour towards Penny is actually very uncomfortable to watch and they should never have ended up together. He becomes narcissistic, possessive and obsessive towards her straight after meeting her. Leonard's a creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leonard's behaviour towards Penny in season 1 #TheBigBangTheory is vile -His train of thought keeps going to having sex with her even though he just met her -He's Jealous &amp; only nice to her for that reason &amp; asks her on a date straight after she breaks up with someone &amp; is upset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 Agreed I hate arrogant people. I get sometimes arrogance is ok when people like footballers are arrogant after winning a match and showboat a bit but they deserve their moment of arrogance in their glory x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You deserve to be proud you cute little fluffy thing xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epiphany6966 Agreed the most annoying thing is he was too arrogant to consider that maybe I'd had a pregnancy loss myself as they happen to 1 in 4 pregnancies and my youngest son died in the first trimester he was too ignorant to consider that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @roadieric I know but that was his excuse. The whole thing happened in such a blur that I can't be sure if he succeeded in kissing me or not as I saw his face coming at me &amp; felt something touch my bottom lip hard and I turned my head and pushed him away and ran. I'm so confused by it. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning fluffy human I spent my morning in candlelit bubble bath mwahaha x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Megan Rapinoe: *works her ass off*   Men: we hate her, she's arrogant, she doesn't deserve to act so arrogant she needs to have some humility &amp; stop being such an arrogant b*tch  Women: why? She's just being the same as any male football player only difference is she actually won<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks This trailer is so intense!  I legit have no clue who is going to be Breda's next victim as quite frankly they all deserve it for some reason whether it's past or present I also kinda want Maxine added to Breda's hit list I get she's mentally ill but she's gone too far #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah go for it. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadieric @AidenHatfield I wish I'd had pepper spray. It was literally 10 metres from my house a 30 second walk and it's not like my clothes were to blame for it happening as I was wearing an oversized zipped up hoodie, a running t-shirt and shorts and trainers and had no makeup on. I looked hideous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror  https://t.co/Fje5SW6xc8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It's easier said than done Try having an old drunk guy who reeked of piss and cheap cider try to kiss u without consent when u only went to a shop 10 metres from ur freaking house in broad daylight. I still feel too sick &amp; violated to eat anything &amp; can still taste his breath 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I freaking love Marnie. I used to hate her and thought she was stuck up but she's becoming one of my favourite characters as she's still stuck up but it's become one of her loveable quirks now instead of being an annoying trait #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A guy followed my brother into a public restroom yesterday in an attempted attack, he's unhurt but scared. He was wearin his work suit, readin a book whilst he waited at the station on his commute home in daylight &amp; a guy followed him when he went to the restroom #mentoo #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm fine just had yesterday take a bit of a nose dive off a cliff metaphorically speaking but I'm good now nothing jumping on the sofa in my underwear listening to a feminist playlist can't solve. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks The acting was brilliant in these scenes was so emotional, even though it was just acting I was actually nervous for her when she was giving birth, thinking "oh god I hope the babies born ok" etc 😂 #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ohhh who's a good boy 🐶 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah it is, still hurts like holy hell and have to keep applying anti sceptic cream to the wound and changing the dressing on it as it's still bleeding a bit but at least it's not cancer so I'm happy. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I feel numb and cut my hand and didn't even feel it but meh I'll take your word for it. You're awesome too by the way you're like a tattoo covered ray of sunshine xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Morning you are way too cheerful for this time of day lol xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sweet dreams 😘 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattJaffeMusic I love this song I love the music video as well ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today: -I developed migraine from hell - i accidentally nearly set the oven on fire but luckily no one was seriously hurt &amp; no serious damage was done aside from smoke everywhere. - a drunk pervert tried to kiss me without consent - thug tried to mug my brother at the station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so a guy tried to kiss me without consent today In case any of y'all victim blamers want to know what I was wearing: - black/grey sports top - paint stained lilo &amp; stitch shorts - large black mens hoodie (zipped up) - black trainers - no makeup - I was covered in paint #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You're welcome xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Be Loud, Be Proud, Be You" Painting I just finished hence the paint still being wet.

<|startoftext|>No matter how much I vomit and brush my teeth I can't get the taste of that pervert out of my mouth. I feel sick, shaken and vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Have fun, stay safe and knock them dead xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stop being sick  A drunk man just tried to kiss me without consent. I asked my dad to babysit my son whilst I ran to the shop &amp; drunk guy touched my face &amp; tried to kiss me I pushed him off &amp; dodged the kiss but can still taste his breath despite brushing my teeth #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 Thanks, just I should've waited until later to take my medication for my migraines I shouldn't have taken it  I knew it made me tired and i took it anyway I should've just fought through the pain x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 Accidentally fell asleep when I was cooking dinner and set the oven on fire, got woke up by the smoke alarms. No one's got hurt and I put it out myself but I feel so awful my migraine just overwhelmed me. It was a freak accident. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've f*cked up bad. I feel awful and like such a sh*t mom right now. I feel so guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield And you hope you have a wonderful weekend you deserve it xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason I love the Inside Out so much is that growing up I was taught being strong meant not crying when things are bad but Inside Out taught me that crying when things get bad is ok &amp; helps us be strong.  I never stop myself crying when I need to anymore #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Pink is definitely for boys  It's my son's favourite colour, he goes out in neon pink shorts and pink t-shirt and I go out in full black and black lipstick  My son's so much like me and so much his own unique person at the same time I love him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I have no time for: Homophobes who actively partake in the fetishization of lesbians and bisexual women and the erasure and invalidation of bisexual men  #lgbt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Attention: U can't use ur religion to justify u being against male same sex relationships but being ok with female same sex relationships.  When homosexuality is a sin in ur religion it covers same sex relationships of all genders not just men so stop being an asshole #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the film Inside Out I love this film as I watched it in the cinemas just after my diagnosis with chronic depression and it actually really helped me understand what was going on in my brain &amp; made me feel a lot less ashamed about my mental illness. #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Agree with all these comments. James has officially snapped and needs to speak to psychiatrist asap before someone gets hurt And yes Harry kissed ste but ste played mind games with him whilst he was vulnerable to seduce harry into kissing him so ste is gross #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I can relate with piercings I needs another 8 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Green_Plover @Hollyoaks It is actually but please enlighten me? How is a male same sex relationship so disgusting you stopped watching a TV show because it showed one but a female same sex relationship wouldn't have stopped you watching the show? Please enlighten me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention: Not being okay with two men kissing  But  Being okay with two women kissing makes you a homophobe as you've contributed to the fetishization of lesbians.  #lgbt #feminist #feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Green_Plover @Hollyoaks Congratulations you're a homophobe!  Being ok with two women kissing but not watching a TV show because two men are kissing is actually homophobic as you've fetishized lesbians. I'm glad you don't watch #hollyoaks anymore as now my favourite TV show isn't watched by a homophobe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Green_Plover @Hollyoaks Would you have cared if it was two women swapping saliva?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks What the hell is wrong with ste?  Harry has James &amp; needed a friend he's just became a dad, he's visibly vulnerable, terrfied and needed support from other dad's and ste just preyed on his vulnerability like he was a wounded animal just to seduce him, it's vile. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No quiero amarte más, me duele demasiado. 💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Drummers are irresistibly sexy in general but my favourite drummer is Marky Ramone ❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww we appreciate you too x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's just a thought to prevent a monster jellyfish invasion Humans are land animals, jellyfish are sea creatures why don't we just stay out the sea until the monster jellyfish have finished with their visit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period problems: When you're doing a workout when you're on your period and can't work out if the sudden abdominal pain is caused by period cramps or the beginnings of a hernia.  Right now I have no freaking clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Depends it's up to someone else too if what I want to do with my life involves doing someone it's 2019 I'd need consent so would kinda be their life too. 😂😂 X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning human  Have a thrilling Thursday and stay dry it's piddling it down.  I have a date tonight and I'm pooping myself lmao I have no idea what to wear. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bitch problems: When you're being nice people think you're being patronising  And When you're actually being patronising people think you're being nice  #WednesdayWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww you're so sweet xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Father &amp; Son by cat Stevens always makes me think of my eldest son as I used to sing it to my baby bump when I was pregnant with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @StellaEden1 I'm a lot stronger mentally than I ever thought possible,  I'm resilient, tenacious and very head strong  I've also found my back bone and sense of self worth and I'll never settle for less than I deserve anymore #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else get the hiccups and when they're typing out a message it's worded in a way that makes it obvious you have the hiccups?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @StellaEden1 If people stopped treating the abuse like it's the sole part of my identity. As yes I was abused but being a victim of abuse but it doesn't define my identity the inner strength I developed from surviving the abuse is what shaped my identity. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @StellaEden1 For me: support groups and blogging about what I went through has helped me recover as it helps me get it off my chest instead of bottling it up #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @StellaEden1 Stressed  My family keep asking me if I'm pregnant because I Keep throwing up when no I have a stomach bug #abusetalk  https://t.co/8FGG0U3nAb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Haven't murdered anyone by the way I was just feeling ill and started gushing like a tap when I was gardening. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I'm going to get a sign made that clearly states "I'm not attracted to you I'm just nice to everybody"   Maybe that would help save me from awkwardly rejecting people. #WednesdayWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Clearly you are blind then as I for one am not beautiful I'm just way to confident for someone who looks like I do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accidentally trapped my son's hand in the door and yeah his fingers bleeding and suspect it might be broken I officially feel like the world's sh*ttest mother and I'm crying worse than my son is I feel so guilty I didn't see his hand there until it was too late #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm happy I'm currently hosing blood off the patio but hasn't stopped me smiling lmao I'm happy happy happy. 😋😋😋😋❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm nice hehe mainly because I know what it's like to feel so sad it feels like being on life support and my son doesn't want to pull the plug and let me go, so can't bear thought of anyone else feeling that way. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm very specific about what I like lmao xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Poke me in the eye I'll bite your finger my eye makeup looks amazing today don't want it being ruined. Xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Ditto they all call me medusa because of how lacking in affection I was but right now I want to coil around someone like a boa constrictor lmao 😂  https://t.co/QZqqjL7ZEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Oh my gosh this is so me lol  When I'm in a relationship I'm like "touch me and I'll cut you" When I'm single I'm like "give me cuddles and I'll pay you with neck nuzzles" lmao 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield When I'm stressed I go high up as high as possible usually to a top floor balcony, motorway bridge or  old quarry. Somewhere tall. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Didn't hurt too much actually felt kinda nice the pain was a pleasant distraction. X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I watched some of it, I was doing the cleaning as well though xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody has somebody and I have nobody. Fed up of being alone, fed up of having no friends, fed up of being single and fed up of life. It sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield *big hugs* 🤗🤗🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sometimes nothing helps and the best thing to do is leave them be to process it alone xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting really tempted not to go to the concert next week as what fun is there going to a concert alone?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Every piece of plastic no Matter how small that's removed from the ocean will help save an animals life so what they've done might not be much in comparison with what's still left to clean up but it's still an amazing thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews The way that bigots are reacting to a lesbian couple in toy story 4 you'd think the toys were talking sex toys that start scissoring in the middle of the film, instead of just being two innocent talking kids toys that show a normal family life. #ToysStory4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swear to god my period better start in the next 24 hours as no way in hell am I being on my period during a freaking concert seriously have no intention of spending 4hours +1hour waiting to get in paranoid I'm going to bleed through my Pleather trousers. No way in hell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This has made my blood run cold. What a sick piece of ****? Bring back the death penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Wasn't a dirty dream. Was trapped in an old building, couldn't escape by myself and kept shouting at you that I didn't need your opinion I just needed you to listen to me. 🤨🤨🤨 And aww bet your abs look lovely I am trying to get rid of my jiggly belly. Lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah hehe helps me push through the wall when i feel like giving up from exhaustion. My abs are coming along nicely though. X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Either Italy or Berlin Italy because it's my dream holiday destination as I love the culture But Berlin because I plan on moving there in future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to a concert in 10 days and I'm having panic attacks over the thought of being in a huge crowd surrounded by lots of strangers. Yeah this concert is something I've dreamed of my entire life (seeing Ramones in concert) and my social anxiety is being a wanker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning. I had a dream about you last night, was very weird.  Mwahaha I've been up since 5am working out I'm sweating like a pig but my abs are starting to look awesome. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning twitter world hope you all have a wonderful sunday x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield A world without music would be an emotionless dystopia as listening to music helps us express our emotions when we our own words fail us. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good luck, stay safe and knock them dead xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timh1973 @VeganOlive1 I know the texture is so real I had to double check the box to make sure they were vegan they had the flakiness of real fish was nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e The smell of nature after its rained Seeing bees on flowers Seeing a beautiful flower growing between the cracks in the pavement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisam_burrows @VeganOlive1 I know they're amazing first time I've tried them and I love them they're definitely worth the money. As I'm British so fish &amp; chips was harder to give up than bacon &amp; cheese combined so I'm so happy to find an equally tasty vegan alternative. I've missed fish. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm so sorry, that's got to be a hard realisation *big cuddles 🤗🤗*  Hope you're okay.  Suicide doesn't take the pain away it just passes it on to someone else. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear men of Earth  Shouting "Oi milf!" At me when I'm out with my son or just out in general bis not a good way to try to chat me up. It will however get you told to f*** off.   Sincerely The person you sexually harassed  #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A random act of kindness goes a long way,  Today I saw a homeless woman with her dog and I gave her the £1 change I had left in my wallet she smiled &amp; thanked me I saw her again on the way back home &amp; my son fell over &amp; hurt himself &amp; she helped me stop him crying, was so lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems. My weekends started off bitter sweet I met a homeless woman and she was one of the nicest people I have ever met despite her situation was so lovely speaking to her but hard at the same time. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am proud to say as of today my son has officially Been potty trained!!!! I took him on his final potty training test, a long walk, nearest toilet was 2.5 miles away, he had drinks when he wanted and wasn't wearing a nappy and he waited until we got to the toilets, he stayed dry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Having low self-esteem and insecurities doesn't make people become paedophiles every human being at some point on god's green earth has experienced low self esteem and felt insecure about something but they haven't committed paedophilia. She doesn't deserve to be freed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried these today and they're an amazing #vegan fish substitute. They have the taste and texture of fish without the cruelty. They're very realistic texture wise and taste delicious. Would definitely recommend. I missed fish and chips since going vegan so I'm super happy  https://t.co/FEYW0Kp65k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e @AidenHatfield Blasphemy! Lol joking to an extent...lol I love them I'm addicted to punk music it's everything to me it gave me the passion and motivation to be who I truly am and not be afraid to chase my dreams or care what anyone thinks. Punk music is the driving force behind my identity. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e @AidenHatfield I think it's an easy question lol Ramones! They are legends and they are god's who deserve to be worshipped. All hail Joey Ramone. I'm obsessed with Ramones I love them they helped shape my identity growing up. I have issues lol 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ramones!!!! Duh! They're the best band to ever exist ever! X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AppleMusic Ramones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You ever have one of those moments when you're speaking to someone online and you get the urge to nudge them with your foot and say "loovveee youuu" but them remember you can't because you're both miles away chatting through a screen? #SaturdayVibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when people say "I'm #vegan except for *insert animal product*..." If a person is vegan except for certain animal products then they're not truly vegan as when you're vegan it means you don't eat any animal products there is no exception. #Vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloggettRyan I loved that scene though as it showed a true bond between them the fact that  Romeo felt comfortable enough to talk to his dad about such an awkward subject, was a nice albeit awkward father son moment between them. It showed trust between them. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e @AidenHatfield Harry potter is awesome, Snape is weirdly hot and Sirius black and the werewolf but only when he's in werewolf form...hmm 🤔🤔🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all goths/alternative people are mentally ill! Mental illness isn't some werewolf s*** like a person dresses like a goth &amp; suddenly they're mentally ill &amp; when they change in2 bright colour clothing &amp; wash off their eyeliner suddenly their mental illness is gone #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not ok to assume that every person whos a goth/alternative is severely mentally ill Not all goths/alternative have mental illness it's just how they feel comfortable dressing it doesn't automatically mean they're mentally ill, mental illness affects all people #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not okay to tell someone with a mental illness/addiction that they don't have one because their mental illness/addiction presents itself differently than other people u know with the same condition. Everyone's experience &amp; how it's presented is unique to them  #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e @AidenHatfield I have stitch clothes I have an entire drawer filled with clothing with pictures of Stitch on I love him he's the reason my favourite colours are blue and purple. Lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jo5if Thank you ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_lou_e @AidenHatfield I had a Disney day yesterday I put lilo and stitch on and my son wanted to watch it several times in a row and yeah I love stitch so I didn't mind lol stitch is so cute!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Yeah I freaking love Harry potter, I'm a Slytherin. Lol 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week I have told my idol I practically worship to go **** off then and made a patronising comment about the size of their feet. Yeah I'm just going to block him on everything and hide at the back of the crowd at the concert and pray I don't offend him further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm now convinced my cat is trying to kill me though as i had a bath to stead my nerves (water makes me feel safe), fell asleep and woke up to find my fluffy ass cat sitting on the window sill right above my face staring at me in the dark. She fell in the bath when I screamed 😂x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Had it done before in cafés and yeah they learned the hard way that cows milk makes me projectile vomit like a boa constrictor trying to cough up a whole goat. I developed an allergy to animal products when I was pregnant they make vomit and get cold sweats now it's fun. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a nightmare and in the nightmare I broke my right ankle  When I woke up from the nightmare and tried to get out of bed I couldn't walk on my right foot as it hurts too much to put any weight on.  I think it's broken. 😶😶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stop being sick since I woke up that nightmare was so ****ed up the things that was being said to me in it were horrific I was so scared and couldn't escape it was like being trapped in a maze everytime I got to the ground floor I ended up back at the top floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning Mr Hatfield hope you have a glorious day and Haha i woke up before you for a change not through choice though lol I had a f***ed up nightmare &amp; was screaming at myself in my sleep to wake up. I'm happy though I get to buy paint today &amp; I love painting 😂😂 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stop shaking and crying &amp; my heart's poundinng because of the nightmare I had, i want to have a very hot bath and pretend it never happened I feel numb &amp; sick. Was so twisted people in the nightmare kept laughing at me as I panicked &amp; screamed for help I felt helpless. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had such a confusing f***ed up nightmare  Was in an old building &amp; a vicar holding a pillow kept telling me to go **** myself &amp; that I need to kill myself whilst chasing me through staircases cases &amp; tunnels in the building &amp; my ankle broke &amp; I fell down the stairs. 💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity My son was amazing to me this week he's only 3 but when I got upset about something I hadn't even started crying and he ran up to me and gave me the biggest hug &amp; patted me on the back so I bought him a giant lizard teddy. He's such a lovely little lad I'm so lucky to be his mama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Oh right? 😉 Lol  Good night, sweet dreams and stay safe. Xx I'm having an early night myself I'm exhausted and need sleep before I pass out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks I love how Romeo and James have bonded as father and son this was actually a sweet scene despite the general awkwardness of getting the talk from his son lol #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching lilo and stitch and cuddling my Stitch teddy bear. I love this film I'm obsessed with Stitch. 😝😝😝😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Yeah mushroom is a good substitute for ham on a pizza 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 Vegan cheese and mushroom pizza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_JamesUK @AidenHatfield Had it done in cafés before so I'm wary 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAntMoore It's yummy the onion isn't too strong it's nice and their Greek style cheese that imitates feta is delicious tastes lovely in a pitta bread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I rarely eat takeaway I don't trust them not to try to "prank the vegan" and put animal products in my food. Lol xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some days you've just got to fake a smile and pretend life's peachy 🍑 even when it feels 💩 #mentalhealth #selfie  https://t.co/1XRpdwFpeu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of just want to meet the one and settle down and give them snuggles and neck kisses for the rest of my life #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Was a nightmare last night and awww still love you too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried this #vegan cheese today got it from Sainsbury's in England UK and oh my gosh it is incredible it melts amazingly I had it on a grilled cheese sandwich and the way it melts it goes so oozy and gooey and sticky it's heavenly it's so delicious. #veganuk #veganfood  https://t.co/Ttr1qq0QO2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It takes a special kind of asshole to deliberately trigger someone's mental illness. Deliberately: - causing a person distress  - causing someone feel to suicidal/ or selfharm -causing someone feel so bad they need to go back on medication  Isn't funny!  #Mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield If I say that I mean it. Never speak to me again means never speak to me again.  Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's so cute! I always thought they got euthanised  My cat got given away by her previous owners for being too loving she was annoying them. I love her though she's a fluffy teddy bear. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Society needs to stop this mentality that reporting rape/abuse is easy.  That victims can walk into a police station/court &amp; discuss their trauma as easily as they'd order a pizza It's not easy it's difficult, terrifying and traumatising it's not easy to report #metoo #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People want an idea of how difficult it is 2 report rape they shud go into room filled with their loved ones &amp; discuss their masturbation habits in graphic detail dates/times etc whilst people take notes, then they'll begin 2 understand how difficult it is to report a rape #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinwal_jayant I know but i can talk about anything I'm a jabber mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone talk to me I'm bored I need attention. 😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/ALdJv6lXyB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Love the hair colour and I'm spending my Friday being made (by my son) to read him all the Harry potter books in order. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red flag: Your relationship feeds off drama for it to survive. -Your partner will start off deliberately creating drama &amp; arguements with other people to feed the need for drama &amp; when that stops working they'll use u to create drama by using abuse &amp; accusations #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imwtclothing @MindCharity Good morning and got Poison Heart by Ramones up full blast love that song best song ever! 🤘🤘🤘🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sneaking off to have a bubble bath without waking my son up who stole my bed lol he's my cuddle monkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a wonderful day xx My son's currently asleep on my arm smiling in his sleep whenever I kiss his nose it's cute but also breaking my heart so meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need naked snuggles in bed. I love skin to skin contact whilst I snuggle someone, not for sex just for intimate snuggles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aTigerslunch It's ok thank you listening regardless ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mabinfield Thanks and likewise my DM's are always open. Just going through some stuff and it's just one blow after the other by life and just had enough hit rock bottom x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aTigerslunch Thanks just feel like I've hit rock bottom because of this I didn't need it at all I'm already going through enough x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aTigerslunch Yep feel broken and like a failure as a mother.  I didn't do anything wrong I was just trying to protect myself and this happened I feel broken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life just keeps going from bad to worse and even worse.  First time in a long time I've felt completely hopeless and can't even imagine tomorrow let alone anything better.  No matter how nice I am to people I'll always be a failure I'll never be good enough. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @blink182 No problems x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to my dad it's my fault for what my landlords done because apparently I should've just kept my mouth shut instead of calling my landlord a b****** and a pervert when he wouldn't leave me alone.  I've been victim blamed for what's happened, I feel broken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww why not? You can borrow mine lol it'd bring out the colour in your eyes x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Try going out in a tight velvet skirt and Pleather jacket  Feel like I'm sweating to death. 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥 Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skylarrrrxx They've gave me a sexual harassment complaint form to send to police and I have them coming out Tuesday to write a report saying it was a false report made with malicious intent. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why women are afraid to reject men: I rejected my landlords sexual advances so he made a false children's services accusation against me to attempt to get my son taken into care out of revenge for rejecting him.  #metoo #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I rejected the landlords advances yesterday during the inspection and he told me I was going to regret it.  Well just had children's services at my door as he called them falsely claiming my son was naked and eating cat faeces during the inspection. They realise it was lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Too cute 🤗 Hope you have a fun afternoon xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror What else would they put in the window? Tbh I'd be happy to see a coffin in their window to get an idea of what kind I'd want to have in my funeral plan for when I kick the bucket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feeling a smidgen lonely and inadequate in comparison with the rest of the human race  So kinda want to snuggles whilst I eat fruit pastilles and give neck kisses between sweets. #mood #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @imwtclothing @blink182 That is amazing! Go you! X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good boy 🐶 Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems and I know lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I feel your pain  I get called an attention seeker for posting about the abuse I went through with my kids dad even though I post about it to help others. These people seem to forget if they don't like someone's posts just block them.  https://t.co/rafdTvi99H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got told I look like a sexy gothic mermaid today! I can die happy! Best compliment ever! #thursdaymorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning human have an awesome day.  I'm feeling positive today because I actually remembered to put my primer on when doing my makeup I usually forget and get annoyed with myself. Lol 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hope you have slept well and today is a better day for you. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitkarm @AidenHatfield Thanks and I did I took baby steps to get to where I am and Lots of cognitive behavioural therapy and yeah I occasionally still have a flare up but I'm so much better than I was 3 years ago ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I always go out my way to be nice to people as I don't know what's going on in their personal life and a random act of kindness can mean the world to someone when they need it the most. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Break a leg and stay safe eh? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat 😊 I'm good just really tired. #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I'm seeking Marky Ramone on tour and I'm too freaking excited. I worship Ramones they are god's so ahhhh I get to see Marky Ramone live and his cover singer is gorgeous so bonus lol I live by the 3 P's that are Piercings, Pleather &amp; Punk Music #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat For fun:  I paint as painting is one of my passions &amp; it's therapeutic, I love reading and exercise I just love exercise it makes me feel sexy and confident. #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I wanted to be a professional freelance artist growing up. I'm still actively trying to make it as an abstract artist - freelance - and I'm currently in the process of setting up a website to sell my work I never gave up on my dream growing up #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Purple &amp; blue I love the colour purple specifically vivid purple as it's just so bold and regal I love it. Also love the colour blue in any shade as it's such a calming colour  #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield 1) that's because it's freaking amazing And 2) you would still be something even without your loyal fans as you're a wonderful guy so that makes you something pretty special  Xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Strong chance I'm going to need stitches in my arm... Thanks asshole. It freaking hurts like hell though and feels cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This can't be happening to me. Why do bad things keep happening to me I'm a good person I don't deserve this. Why me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ditto I hate  the sound of people eating drive me nutss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the reason men refer to other men as 'men' but refer to women as 'girls' is a power thing as by calling grown men 'men' they make themselves sound big &amp; powerful Yet by refering to women as 'girls' it makes the women sound fragile, immature &amp; vulnerable instead #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! I got asked on 3 dates today by 2 men and a woman woohoo I still got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My family are the worst for my mental health whenever they're assholes to me they tell me I'm not right in the head for getting upset. I found a lump &amp; they claimed I was paranoid due to my depression turned out to be a cyst. I don't speak to my family often because of it xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel so beautiful and sexy today it's insane.  Feel like in 12 feet tall and like I'm Jessica rabbit in my tight red dress.  I actually feel stunning and I'm not ashamed to sound vain saying that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I wish you could I want to slap some respect into her with a pair of rubber gloves I'm not happy with her but I'm happy with life in general so meh x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah you owe us lol jokes  Could repay my kindness by helping me clean my house dumbass roommate and his disrespectful gf destroyed the house &amp; I have a landlord inspection in 2 hours. I'm freaking out it's not going to be clean in time as honestly looks like a dump site X  https://t.co/kRqN0fWwRz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning you wonderful human being. Have a glorious day. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FCDWhittaker @moffat_andrew Agreed this is just a hate crime disguised as a protest and they're using children to attempt to justify said hate crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just stepped on a drawing pin, my foot is bleeding and f***ING hell does it hurt oh my gosh I feel like my foots on fire. 🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww you're a sexy piece of ass lmao 😂😋 Also agree to disagree about myself I'm not attractive I'm just good at doing my makeup I wouldn't even date me lol ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gay_loveeee  https://t.co/zgdpsVzEdh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yep I'm open about it.  I have depression, PTSD and anxiety  I used to self harm, have alcohol and painkiller addictions but I'm clean now and have no desire to drink or do any other destructive habits again.  I also suffered from agoraphobia for 2yrs but got past it xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning human hope you have a wonderful Tuesday xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I have a potty mouth at times I can't help it! Lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now accepting applications for someone to snuggle me.  Job description: giving me snuggles in bed as I suck jelly through a reusable straw.   Payment: neck nuzzles and smiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to understand that trying to invalidate someone else's trauma/mental illness/addiction isn't going to make theirs go away.  It's not going to make their trauma easier to cope with &amp; it's not going to speed up their recovery  #mentalhealth #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdevils1 @AidenHatfield I know. I hate when people do this in support groups for trauma or addiction making it like a competition of who has it worse. People need to understand that invalidating someone else's trauma/mental illness/addiction isn't going to make theirs go away. #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Thank you I try to be. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dread the day when people i speak to on a daily basis realise that when I reply "fair enough " it's my code for "f*** you then" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I wish more people understood this. Mental illness &amp; trauma aren't competitions, the experience is as unique as the person going through it it's not something that can be measured. Xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah you should buy yourself a chalk board and write your name in funky chalk writing on it. Do different styles of writing. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Liam is evil so he'll probably use James insecurities about Harry to his advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah I'm sh*tting myself I worship Ramones and practically stalk him on Instagram (haven't got into restraining order territory yet though 😂) so will be amazing to see him live also the guy who's singing is just one of the hottest guys I've ever seen in my life so yay 😍 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah I can only half see what I'm painting as my false eyelashes are blocking the top half of my vision but totally worth it I look like a camel. 🐫👁️👁️🐫 Xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anniewallace I hate Mumsnet it's an online cesspit of hatred, transphobia, homophobia, internalised sexism and holier than thou assholes who pretend their kids are perfect but leave out the parts where their precious kids got suspended from school for eating worms in the school playground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You're pretty amazing too.  Also I feel like **** but my false eyelashes are gigantic so I'm happy lol ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@troshius Haha that's actually made me smile thank you ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@troshius I know it's just frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mood: Lounging on my sofa sucking blue piping icing straight out of the tube  😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK It's still inhumane because they're still slaughtering birds to make it. Make a #vegan alternative then it would be humane as no animals would need to suffer on farms and in slaughterhouses to produce it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the people saying #NotMyAriel because a POC being Ariel is unrealistic:  Obviously the little mermaid isn't going to be realistic as: - She's a mermaid - Has a talking fish (flounder) - Singing crabs (Sebastian) - A sea witch (Ursula)  - Magic spells &amp; - An Underwater kingdom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I started crying because I was feeling bad mentally &amp; needed to take my anxiety meds &amp; felt guilty for ruining my son's birthday by needing my meds  My brother's laughing as I spent all night decorating the house &amp; icing son's cake so he doubts my son cares that I needed my meds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anxiety problems: Taking anxiety pills to help you cope with the anxiety and then getting anxious about the side effects and becoming paranoid you're allergic to the pills everytime you feel a twinge until they wear off. #mentalhealth #MentalHealthAwareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 I'm the same even if I'm having a good day and I feel happy I still need an hour of me time to just sit, relax and enjoy the silence with a cup of tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah lol ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield The internet is full of weirdos lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I've used some colourful words so much it corrects the innocent sounding word to the swear word instead which kinda makes it awkward messaging my mom  Send her a message saying "took Noah to feed the ducks" And it changes it to  "Took Noah to feed the f*cks" 😝❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday to my eldest son. Filled the living room with balloons when he was asleep and yeah his reaction was brilliant when he walked in this morning. Was so cute. #parenting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah they suck hard and not the good kind of sucking. X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Last time someone broke the speed limit when I was in the car (they did 70mph in a 10mph zone) it ended in a 2week hospital stay after surgery and regular ECG's &amp; abdominal scans for a year afterwards so I hate people who speed. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I changed my username again to match my insta by the way I'm not a catfish lol ☺️ x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who wants to come give me snuggles in bed?  I need snuggles &amp; will be willing to pay in the form of neck nuzzles and smiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @Twitter Just being honest 🖤✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww well we're glad there are people like you in the world 😝 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meant to be seeing #markyramone on tour in a few weeks &amp; I'm sh*tting myself about catching train on my own. Refused to go on train alone since saw a drug addict die in the station, he just slumped against the wall &amp; died, people didn't help as he was "just another dead addict"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've lost 9lbs in weight in 5days because I've lost my appetite due to feeling so broken so yeah kinda sucks I'm already skinny enough as it is. I'm 4lbs away from being diagnosed as medically underweight and need to start taking anti sickness medication again. 😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah he's over 6foot tall so took up most of my bed lmao but felt nice having snuggles in bed. I'm 23 and still like to cuddle a teddy bear but meh it's the longest I've slept in nearly a month so can't complain. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah should be so much fun lmao got to wait until he's in bed to start putting the party decorations up and finish decorating his birthday cake so yay pulling an all nighter to make the house perfect for him. 😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all these people tweeting #NotMyAriel   When I saw who Ariel is being played by I thought "Ariel in the little mermaid I grew up watching was white with red hair but oh well it's 2019 things change &amp; at least POC get the chance to grow up with a mermaid that represents them"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my kids dad hasn't followed court ordered indirect contact again for my sons birthday because he "would rather go out clubbing"  Feel like my heart's being ripped out having to explain to my son his dad isn't making contact on his birthday tomorrow as he chose clubbing instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter @AidenHatfield  I love that dude 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difference between toxic &amp; good people: - Toxic people will tell you they don't like your attitude. As they know they can't get away with being mean to u  - Good people will tell u they love ur attitude As they respect that u are willing to stand up for urself   #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a fun day, remember to be sun safe so you don't get burned.  I woke up cuddling my son's giant teddy bear lol I need cuddles last night so I stole it off him for the night he wasn't bothered by it lol 🖤✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sweet dreams and stay safe 🖤✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You too rockstar 🤘🖤 My son"s birthday is on Sunday so spending Sunday dealing with screaming kids hyped up on birthday cake and I'm spending Saturday decorating the house ready for his party got a few hundreds balloons to blow up so meh x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Changed my username as I'm in the process of setting up a website to start selling my paintings so changed my twitter username to match my Instagram profile 🖤✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I know I've been single for over 2years lol, retail therapy has cheered me up a bit retried on all my new clothes when I got home and first time in my life I've said "holy ****" at the sight of my reflection in a good way. So I'm broken but confident so meh x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Did more retail therapy.  It kinda didn't and did help.  Didn't because I'm still broken and will be even more depressed when I get my bank statement but kinda did help because at least I have matching underwear just need to get a bf or gf to show them to. 💔🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK It's the name of a very tasty cocktail.  If they're offended by that I pray they never come clubbing with me as my favourite cocktails called a Blow Job it's Bailey's, disaronno &amp; whipped cream tastes amazing. Also S&amp;M shots (sambuca and malibu) are delicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good Morning have an awesome day 🖤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amybobs86 @AidenHatfield I wasn't too impressed but It made me laugh though he's a tiny weirdo lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made spicy teriyaki tofu and rice for dinner today, has got to be one of the best meals I've ever had. #Vegan #plantbased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield He's very noisy he even laughs in his sleep which scares the hell out of me. Nothing is scarier than being woken up by a child giggling in the middle of the night x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love kids they make my life happier as no matter how broken I feel he always puts a smile on my face without even trying. He's my tiny silver lining. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's so adorable I love kids!  My son woke me up the other day just to tell me he'd farted, literally got woke up at stupid o'clock to tell me he'd farted. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks That cliff scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever it's the reason I love James so much. I wish people would stop screwing him over he's a good guy he deserves a happy ending he's been through so much #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good luck with your tour, stay safe  Obviously I'm going to say @RamonesOfficial as they're awesome, I'd recommend the songs Poison Heart, Pet Semetary and I Wanna Live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Oh my freaking gosh this is the cutest news I've seen all day! 🐧👩‍👩‍👦🐧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My son lives with me and I still miss him whenever I have a break from him. The silence drives me nuts. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanjameskeane @the12013 @PinkNews I'm wondering the same thing, I just explained why gay penguins are cute. Gay penguins are the animal kingdoms equivalent of an elderly same sex human couple, they're freaking adorable &amp; gives us hope we might find our own true love against the odds. #LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think one of the reasons i didn't realise how messed up the other forms of abuse i experienced mental/financial was is because it wasn't physical/sexual so in my head it's like "yeah he shouldn't have done that to me but at least he didn't hit me that time" #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning human I've been up since 4am! I don't even know why I woke up that early I didn't even set my alarm I wanted a lie in. I'm mad at life right now it sucks 🤬 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet dreams everyone stay safe 🙂✌️✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I was feeling vile today so had the morning to do some retail therapy and take my kid out. My heart's still broken but at least now I have 9 pairs of false eyelashes and my heart's broken in a sequin dress so meh. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjilover32 @AidenHatfield I know Instagram is piddling me off. I spent 2 days working on a painting and couldn't wait to post the finished result on Instagram as it's my main platform for sharing my art &amp; yeah can't even see my damn post. 😤😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat ☺️ It's felt good to talk about the financial side of the abuse as I don't discuss that side of it as was difficult to admit he was stealing from me as I slept as I had no idea for nearly a month until I got a bank statement so feels good to get it off my chest #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I got help from: - the police, - a solicitor who specialised in domestic abuse cases,  - my bank - domestic abuse charities - women's refuge - my midwife also gave me information/contact sheets with organisations on to help with the financial cost of being a single mom #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Red flags - money randomly going missing  - discrepancies on bank statements - refused to hold down a job &amp; expects others to pay for them - starts asking u to pay for things, starts small &amp; slowly increases in cost - treats ur money as their money #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat In a way yes as they spend all their victims money so they can't leave &amp; their victims dependent on them financially with both types of abuse. My ex would constantly make sure I never had even the bare min amount of money so couldn't even afford bus fare so was trapped #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KT_Robson @AbuseChat I know oh my god he always promised he'd pay back the money he "borrowed" (without asking) then he'd go out clubbing spend all his money on drink/drugs then claim I was controlling &amp; wouldn't let him go out because I was angry he'd spent the money he owed me instead #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've noticed with abuse you don't realise just how messed up something your abuser did actually was until you say it out loud to someone or write/type it and read it back to yourself. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KT_Robson @AbuseChat Mine was the same, he had zero interest in getting a job, he didn't even bother having help off the government through benefits as he thought it was for schmucks so he just stole money off his family and loved ones instead. He also sabotaged his jobs to get fired #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yes, my ex (I have no idea how) worked out my bank pin number and would steal my bank card when I was asleep and steal my wages.  He also made me buy my right to go visit my family I had to buy him gifts worth a certain amount to be allowed to visit for a few hours #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat #abusetalk  https://t.co/UJmTXdA5Nt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its_supersarah Yes it's doing my head in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews How can anyone not love gay penguins? They're so freaking cute! Penguins are already cute as it is but gay penguins are just ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ . Penguins already look like they're wearing a suit so it looks like they're ready for a penguin gay wedding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah it is lol it works out well as I had my hair restyled Thursday and it took hours but I freaking love it lmao. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm honest with mine and it piddles her off as takes twice as long to finish styling my hair as it's not perfect until I say it's perfect. I'm the one who's paying for it she shouldn't care lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week is what should have been my miscarried babies second birthday and honestly I'm struggling my heart feels like it's physically breaking and the grief feels as raw as the day I was told those 3 words I prayed I'd never have to hear "there's no heartbeat"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I feel this way a lot x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have an awesome Wednesday 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Yeh I'd be angry if I was her mother I'd be marching down to the bullies house and making them pay me back the money I'd spent on the dress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lez_Lover22 Sagittarius ♐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Children aren't a burden. I'm 23 and  i've got a 3 year old I've been raising alone since I was pregnant and I'd never hurt him no matter how much hes being a pain in the ass. Parenting means making sacrifices if she wasn't prepared to make sacrifices she shouldn't have had kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahJDaniels75 @AidenHatfield Ditto I can just about tolerate my kid hugging me I feel like I'm being hugged by a boa constrictor lmao. He's currently growing through a clinging onto people's legs phase which is nightmarish for me. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahJDaniels75 @AidenHatfield Agreed 😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/2gwqMxceBj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It creeps me out when people hug me without asking lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Beards are sexy though and stubble is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love kissing someone with stubble and feeling it gently scratching my face as I kiss them it is just the sexiest feeling ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I've had the morning off from painting to speak to a psychic so meh kinda helps. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi guys right. My current piece will take a few days to finish painting as it's a heavily detailed natural landscape I'm painting so will show you pics of my progress on it ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Side of pregnancy loss that doctor's didn't tell me is that ur body plays a cruel trick on u &amp; u start producing breast milk for a baby that didn't even survive, it's horrific when this happens &amp; it's a side 2 pregnancy loss more people need to speak openly about #miscarriage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't trust anyone who doesn't like Poison heart by #Ramones That song is incredible so anyone who doesn't like it clearly can't be trusted. Always listen to it before I go to bed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm exhausted, I've repainted three rooms to cover up any marks off my kid and cats on the wall and I've completely replaced a broken door and shampooed all the carpets and done up the garden. I have an asshole landlord who's high maintenance for such a scruffy bloke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New hair, no makeup on and my shoulder and collar bone scars on display. #nomakeupchallenge #nomakeup #naturalface  https://t.co/FBsIHA2dav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I've been cleaning the house since 5am as I have the landlord doing an inspection next week and I have no desire to be fined or evicted for failing said inspection. Lmao. 🤪🤪🤪🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi changed my Instagram username to art_by_alex1995 Feel free to follow me I follow back #instagramfollowers #artistoninstagram  https://t.co/bgAZhJkhVN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the cards: everything I seek in my life will soon fall into place &amp; is on its way. I'm skeptical my love life is a car crash I'm trying to follow a career out my passion &amp; feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall &amp; I just want to move to Brooklyn NY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww that's such a cute face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks And Sally saves the day again. Such a touching scene when Sienna hugged Sinead was so emotional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah he still stalks me less frequently now (think the police got through to him a bit last time) and harasses family when he sees them in the street but no where near as bad as it was, he'll get bored &amp; move on to someone else eventually as I'm the 2nd person he's done this 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ramones!  They're the first thing I listen to when I wake up and last thing I listen to at night. I ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It was hell, he got arrested multiple times &amp; was charged for trying to sabotage a family court case against my abysive kids dad which could've put my son in danger had he succeeded &amp; he also got arrested for offering me money in exchange for pics of my son he could post online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I got stalked for nearly 4 years by a guy I used to work with that I rejected. He found out through another colleague I was pregnant with my now exes baby a few months after I rejected him &amp; he convinced himself he should've been my son's dad and not my ex. So he stalked me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally having my hair dyed and restyled as I type and I'm sh*tting myself right now about how it'll look as I'm not scared about the colour as I've had my hair every colour over the years I'm sh*tting myself about getting a full fringe put in haven't had a fringe in 10yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mum charged with manslaughter when she had miscarriage after being shot  https://t.co/pX1T7ikkRW via @MetroUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK He looks awesome, love his attire.  Also him dressing like he's from 1820's is no different to me wearing outfits inspire by 80's punk bands. It's 2019 and I style my outfits around Joey Ramone style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A Puzzle Piece Never Fits The Same Way Again After It's Been Broken" Finally finished this painting #artist #artists #artistsoninstagram #ArtistOnTwitter #abstractart  https://t.co/PCHarZC1iQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently in the process of setting things up online to start selling my paintings. It should be up and running in the next few weeks to end of July/early August<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I do that anyway, I always ask people what's their preferred name and pronoun's when I meet them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Shooting Stars Surround A Broken Heart" #artist #artistsontwitter #ArtisticTuesday #artistsofinstagram #abstractart  https://t.co/JzS65aaUom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still painting as usual however I'm also currently working on a personal project called Do Not Feed The Homeless, it's a paper I'm writing which I'll be turning into a Vlog exploring the links between domestic abuse and homelessness &amp; what needs to change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Alien Experiences The Same Emotions As Us Humans" Took me 11 1/2hours to complete this piece but I love how it's turned out. #artistsontwitter #abstractart #artistsoninstagram  https://t.co/1aQlXQtMPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's brilliant news. So happy for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been wondering why my foots bee hurting for the past 5 days turns out I stepped on a piece of glass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to realise it's not okay to shame me for being slim. It's not okay to call me anorexic and bulimic in front of my kids And It's not ok to accuse me of spending more time exercising than with my kids. I'm not underweight, I'm healthy I just have a small frame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When my loved ones moan when son is annoying them by demanding all their attention I always remind them to take it as a compliment that he loves them as when hes older &amp; wants to play video games instead of playing catch with them they'll be regret not spending time with him now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keim_cathy @peta He was arrested, had weapons seized and banned from owning guns and pets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning! Mwahaha for once I woke up before you. Spent the past hour playing what my son calls dodgeball but it's really him throwing balls at me and telling me I suck when I throw them back lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peta Police are aware he got arrested and had his guns seized and banned from owning any weapons for life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asphodelmoon @spooky_t0fu Oh my gosh that's so cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sj_compton @amy_lou_e Sandi Toksvig I just love her in general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peta My ex used to blame being bullied in school for why he used to illegally shoot wildlife and tortured local cats  Not an excuse though as I got bullied in school and I now have 3 rescue pets and went vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5ad13M It's an amazing design it'll look amazing when it's finished. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5ad13M That is so cute and badass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I know i forgive him though as he was sleeping in his fish blanket so he looked like a giant Nemo lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Little Green Men Will Infect Your Hearts With Poison" Painting I was working on yesterday! I love it! #artist #artistsontwitter #artistsoninstagram #abstractpainting  https://t.co/YZpEZGOA9i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Cookie monster is cute! My kids stole my bed so I'm banished to the foot of my bed like a dog 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people always blame being #vegan for my anaemia when they forget I suffered with it for  8 years before going vegan.  I have a condition with my periods that makes me bleed longer than normal that is why I'm anaemic and sometimes it's significantly worse at certain times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo just got an email my tickets to see Marky Ramone on tour have been dispatched! I should be getting them soon! Oh my gosh this is too exciting! Ahhhhh f******CK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person: have you heard this song it's so good?  Me: Did Ramones sing it?   Person: no it was sung by-   Me: yeah just going to stop you there unless Ramones sang it I probably haven't heard of it.  #ramones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ex abuser tried to blame being bullied when he was a child for abusing me when I was pregnant, he also claimed it was why he liked to slaughter cats and local wildlife he claimed he was still angry &amp; it made him feel powerful. I still don't understand his logic. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If some1 asks me to paint them a picture &amp; gives me an extremely vague idea of what they want &amp; sign off on 1st sketch idea I show them, I will deliberately go with the most far out the box concept as If I'm going 2 use my time/money/resources at least b straight bout what u want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 1: Me: my anaemia is acting up again keep randomly fallin asleep Dad: maybe it's ur #vegan diet? u need some animal products even if its just milk for iron Me: really u think it's my vegan diet? How do u explain 8yrs of anaemia prior 2 goin vegan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesetoastie67 I do it to be nice as I know something as simple clicking a button and letting someone know I like their content can actually brighten their day and encourage them to keep up the good work.<|endoftext|>

He's my son so say it to my face I f***in dare u! Go on! Say it! No one makes my son cry  Man: *runs off*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You don't just listen to #Ramones, they're a feeling that you get in your soul. Their music just takes over you when it starts playing and you can actually feel the beat in your soul.  ❤️🤘🎵🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat 🙃 I'm meh but that's mainly because of the weather today it's humid and wants to rain but it won't I just want this storm to erupt from the clouds already before I sweat off my eyeliner #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I'm honest with people about what I went through and let them know that sometimes I'll get triggered without warning so just be respectful with their choice of words or conversation topics #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat It kinda feels like being hit by a car or punched hard in the chest when they hit and I don't recognize what trigger has actually set me off. It winds me and makes me feel confused &amp; disorientated &amp; almost erratic as I try to process my thoughts &amp; work out the trigger #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I use painting and sketching to help me cope with triggers I'll do a quick abstract sketch of what the emotions I'm experiencing feel like in my brain e.g like sad aliens etc &amp; I'll paint it when I get the chance to &amp; it actually helps me make sense of the feelings #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yes it's nightmarish as it's mainly from TV that I get triggered I'll see something and get triggered and be like "woah where did that come from?" It's horrible #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited but heartbroken for July, it's my eldest sons birthday can't wait, my miscarried babies 2nd birthday which is breaking me, my dad's birthday can't wait &amp; then I get to see Marky Ramone on tour! #ramones #July<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dropped out of school when I was 15 but I'd like to thank my perv school teacher who asked me when I was 14 if I'd ever consider turning straight for him. As now I'm a 23yr old feminist &amp; LGBT rights activist who fights to raise awareness about people like him #ThankATeacher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd like to thank my secondary school teacher who made me feel like a freak for being #LGBT , scaring me back into the closet &amp; accused me of bullying the entire school for simply being open about my identity. I'm now openly living the life as who I truly am #ThankATeacher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews  https://t.co/rRR6PlL4GF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to be going to see Marky Ramone on tour but just hate that I've had to use my deadname when ordering the tickets etc as I hate my deadname. Oh well can't wait to legally change my name to Alex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think it's even possible for me to get my eyeliner perfect in the morning unless I'm listening to #ramones they're awesome. If I'm not listening to them when I do my makeup it looks like my 2 year old did my eyeliner<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm seeing Marky Ramone on tour!!!! This is the best gift ever! I have the bestest big brother in the whole wide freaking world right now! Thank you thank you thank you!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah this is really happening it's official I'm going to see Marky Ramone on Tour.  I want to cry with joy right now. I worship Ramones, they're the first thing I listen to in the morning &amp; the last thing I listen to at night.  This is a dream come true just doesn't feel real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im going to see Marky Ramone on tour soon! Oh my ****ING god! I worship the Ramones I freaking love that dude! He's the only dude I find sexy AF! Ahhhhhh F***************CK!!!!!! #excited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnni Seriously? Why not tranquillise it and move it further away instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok attention people: Emergency contraception arent method of abortion  Emergency contraception prevents the unplanned pregnancies that lead to abortions  Refusing to give someone emergency contraception as u don't agree with abortion will most likely end in abortion #Prochoice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splicedgenes @MetroUK Agreed! 👏👏👏👏 Emergency contraception aren't abortion pills they're actually preventing unplanned pregnancies that will lead to abortions. People need to understand there's a huge difference &amp; if they don't feel comfortable with abortion don't get jobs in the healthcare sector<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok a transphobe has accused me of only coming out as #transgender as an aesthetic to boost my art career This is false B4 I came out I hadn't painted in 4yrs but since coming out the passion 2 paint &amp; follow my dreams has came back as I'm happy now, I've also stopped self harming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If their beliefs affect how they do their job then they should get a different job. The pharmacist doesn't know patients circumstances who need emergency contraception, patients could've been raped for all they know or have conditions that make pregnancy dangerous #Prochoice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Yeh this is disgusting if their personal beliefs affect how they do their job then they should get a different job. It's not fair on patients The pharmacist doesn't know the circumstances of the patients that need emergency contraception they could've been raped for all they know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knew I was attracted to women when I was 4 as I was watching Xena Warrior Princess &amp; my heart started racing when I saw her Knew I was trans when I was 6 I asked my dad if I had been born a boy but he had me changed into a girl because he didn't want 2 son's as I felt like a boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5ad13M @TheSun Agreed! She's beautiful as she is she doesn't need to be stick thin like a rake nibbling tofu to be beautiful she can have curves and devour a burger and still look stunning. I admire her confidence &amp; most of these haters are just jealous that they lack her body confidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun As long as she's happy and comfortable in her body good for her. I wish I had her confidence to sunbathe topless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This is why we shouldn't eat lobsters so they can continue to breed and create more rare blue lobsters and I agree with the other comment he's probably blue because he's sad he's in a tank #GoVegan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightsLGBTI @PinkNews Agreed all these religious preachers making up false claims about homosexuality and the Bible are just doing themselves more harm than good as they're making God sound like a homophobic bigot when he actually doesn't care about that stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>P*sses me off when people do this to prank vegetarians &amp; #vegan into eating animals. It's dangerous the person who ends up eating it might be on a plant based diet for medical reasons &amp; they're pretty much poisoning the person when they trick them into eating animal products<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My abuser actually tried to  used his star sign to justify the abuse in court It went as follows: Ex: I'm temperamental by nature I can't help it I'm a leo Me: your son's also a Leo &amp; he doesn't go round beating people Judge: agreed star signs aren't excuses for abuse #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asshole encounter: Guy 2 friend pointin at me: shes a prostitute now Me: WTF? Guy: remember me We went to same school &amp; u rejected me? Me: 1) it's 'he' now 2) did u seriously brand me a prostitute for rejecting u when I was 16? Him: yeh it hurt Me: ur a dangerous little man child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres days where it feels all I do is shout at my kids when they're being assholes, theres days when I cry as being a single parent is hard &amp; theres days I feel like a bad parent when people give their opinions i didn't ask for despite this i love my kids more than life itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeganGamer2 Amen someone gets it. This is the reason I get so angry when pro lifers try to argue with me whilst they're eating a double bacon cheeseburger. It's hypocritical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 2) Had my kids health visitor ask me if I have Stockholm Syndrome because I redecorated my bedroom blue and purple and she thinks the colour scheme reminds her of a bruise.  The actual ****? Blue &amp; purple are my favourite colours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 1) Had to give a woman who lives up the road from me emotional support in taking her ex to family court for child support as she's been dumped by her husband &amp; hes cut all contact with his newborn baby because the baby was born deaf &amp; blind. 🤬😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not ok 2 tell trauma survivors who've developed a mental illness from it to "just let go &amp; move on" as 1) they are movin on &amp; rebuildin their lives &amp; tellin them 2 "just move on" makes their progress seem invalid &amp; 2) they want 2 let go their brain won't let them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aTigerslunch Agreed  Being pro life is being pro all life of any race, gender, sexuality and class in society Being pro life isn't only being pro life if the fetus they save grows up to be a Rich heterosexual cisgender white male.  #AbortionIsHealthcare #abortionban #ProLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's internet asshole encounter number 2: Me: *uploads photo of a biro sketch design for today's painting to Instagram* Troll: "ha looks like art made by a 3year old" Me: considering how talented my almost 3 year old is at painting I'm taking this as a compliment so thank u 🖕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Why wasn't this in the movie?  I would love to see a version of titanic with a lesbian with a light up walking stick in it I'd pay good money to see that.  Screw the Kate Winslet and Leonard DiCaprio version Give me a version with Ruby Rose &amp; Ellen Page.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Rou's a cutie though lol My cats make it hard to paint as they like to wait until I've just finished the last brush stroke to step on the painting and leave paw print smudges on it. I love them though ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews This is so wrong ... B4 I came out as trans, I had a girlfriend, we walked down canal &amp; had a picnic under a bridge an hour later 3 men walked past &amp; 1 said "u 2 lesbians?" we nodded &amp; they replied "oh cool! so's my sister" &amp; walked off  ...that's how men should react to lesbians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before these pro life people decide to go around telling women what to do with their bodies maybe they should go #vegan first as its pretty hypocritical of them to claim they're pro life &amp; abortions murder when they're eating a double bacon cheeseburger made from murdered animals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Online asshole encounter:  * People start arguing in my comments on Instagram*  Me: *gets bored and goes out for a bit* *Get back they're still arguing* Me: ur still arguing? Seriously I've hatched 2 eggs on #pokemongo caught 2 magikarps, a whailmer in Tescos &amp; evolved 3 pokemon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 1: Person: if you're vegan why are you pro choice, why think it's ok to kill one &amp; not the other Me: 1) as I'm making the choice not to dictate what other people do with their bodies &amp; 2) if u're so pro life why aren't u #vegan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This is so f*cked up, this isn't going to work it'll just make things worse also if the police know they're being abused why not provide more support to help them leave the abusive situation before they're murdered<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanFoote8 @TheSun I meant in general, whoever has hired her should fire her I didn't specifically mean BBC, people who make jokes like that shouldn't be in the public eye at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun She should apologize &amp; be sacked what she said was dangerous. She's someone in the public eye joking that people should commit an acid attack against politicians all it takes is one idiot to act on it &amp; someone's life has been ruined Acid attacks aren't jokes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 2: Ignorant people still deliberately calling me by my dead name and incorrect pronouns simply because it's easier on them.  It's not easier on me it makes me cringe I hate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 1: Guy: ur cute Me: thank u but not interested Guy: ur a racist  Me: no I'm not Guy: I won't call u racist if u go on date with me  Me: no 1) ur race isn't the problem ur weddin ring is &amp; 2) I don't date guys who try to threaten me into datin them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It did help but my dogs got a lump and is very untreatabley sick so at the minute he's breaking my heart as I'm not ready to say goodbye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun For once I agree with him All it takes is one nutter to believe her joke and some politician ends up in intensive care because they've been victim of an acid attack  Whether she meant it literally or not, acid attack jokes aren't funny at all.  #NigelFarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat 🙂 #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat It's easier said than done, as a lot of my unhealthy eating habits are triggered by my PTSD I'll be completely fine one minute cooking dinner &amp; a memory will get triggered &amp; I'll feel too upset to eat.  It's annoying I need to manage my relationship between PTSD &amp; food #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I don't have an healthy relationship with food at all.  I used to be bulimic and even though I've recovered I'm still strict about my food I have a set list of food things I have to eat daily at some point as either a snack or part or added to my meals, I'm too strict. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat My mood affects my diet as when I'm upset I shut down and struggle to eat anything at all, When I'm happy I eat healthier food When I'm stressed I eat junk food And when I have PMS I can only eat lemon flavoured food. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yeah I've become a vegan now as He put me on a diet when I was pregnant &amp; I was allowed one hour a day to cook &amp; eat my dinner &amp; he would put animal abuse/torture videos on whilst I ate to make me feel too sick to eat my dinner but he would only let me eat meat #abusetalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror What did they expect? A polar bears a wild animal it's basic instincts is to hunt and kill for food, no matter how long a polar bear is kept in captivity it's still a wild animal, it's instinctive for it to kill &amp; eat a duck if it lands in it's home. #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention people: A straight cisgender person supporting #LGBT rights will not turn them LGBT if they already aren't ok?

<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter number 1: Person: think my friends gay he supports #LGBT rights Me: seriously?

<|startoftext|>People need 2 realise, putting ur hand on the small of a woman's back without her consent &amp; telling her how sexy she looks is a form of sexual harassment especially when u can clearly see shes vulnerable. It's disgusting &amp; people should ask before they touch someone #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before I came out as F2M trans, I was sexually harassed in court by an usher; he knew I was vulnerable as I was going against my abuser, he'd seen me sobbing &amp; vomiting after reliving the degrading details of the abuse &amp; he still chose to sexually harass me. #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was sexually harassed in family court, I was wearing a red dress &amp; an usher put his hand on the small of my back nearly touching my bum &amp; told me I looked sexy in red &amp; should wear it more often. The next court appointment I wore trousers &amp; a baggy shirt #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's asshole encounter: I painted psychedelic nudes of a man and a woman &amp; a family member has bombarded me with messages assuming i'm in a relationship with a man as I painted a nude male Yeh i also painted a nude woman &amp; a drug addicted parrot but I'm not datin them either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dazthfchill @SamFarmer2 @MetroUK I know right? If I left my son home alone even for a few minutes I'd be arrested for neglect &amp; he'd be taken into care so why didn't they have their remaining kids taken off them?

<|startoftext|>Cisgender Heterosexuals are complaining that they're sick of seeing rainbow stuff everywhere during #PrideMonth well now they know how the LGBT+ community feels seeing hetero normative stuff everywhere for the other 11months of the year 🏳️‍🌈🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamFarmer2 @MetroUK Thank you someone agrees. I don't even leave my son who's the same age as Maddie (when she vanished) in the house alone when I take the wheelie bins out I either take him with me or if he's sleeping I ask my neighbours to do it and buy them a bar of chocolate to say thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Think I'm going to do an experiment as it's still #pridemonth and every time I see a company selling pride themed products I'm going to simply ask "are any of your profits from the products going to LGBT charities?"

<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Why is the dad always smirking?! It seriously bugs me every freaking pic he got a small smug smirk on his face!

<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK That mortified she decided to post the pic online for the world to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went 2 a store &amp; they were selling pride themed clothes so I asked a shop assistant "are u donating any of the profits 2 LGBT charities?" Shop assistant: erm no we're selling them 2 show we support pride month Me: no ur doing it 4 profit &amp; u won't be profiting off me #PrideMonth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Savan_Kotecha @TrollDragonBorn Talk is cheap, he can say he supports the LGBT community all he likes but his trans military ban, restrictions on LGBT people adopting children, giving medical professionals permission to turn away trans patients if they want, restricting trans access 2 shelters proves otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LozlovesBRITT I'm so sorry you've gone through this, what they said was out of line and good on you for making a complaint hopefully something will be done to stop them thinking it's ok to say it to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reason 124 straight people don't need a pride parade: Whenever theres an election they don't live in fear that the new person who's in charge of their country will take their rights away from them, LGBT+ people have this fear &amp; Trump's justified their fears #StraightPrideParade<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a load of bull****<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone told me their observation on being trans: they think people who did something bad in their past life their souls are reincarnated into a physical body that's a different Gender as punishment for what they did in the past life &amp; can transition if the souls redeemed itself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The LGBT+ community would be less p*ssed off about the commercialism of #PrideMonth if more companies selling pride themed products gave the profits of the products to LGBT+ charities instead of just slapping a rainbow on a product &amp; pocketing the profit to further their business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield He also decided to get me to get out of bed and make his breakfast by whacking me with a pillow shouting "you suck" until I got up. Perfect way to start a Sunday is having a pillow fight with a toddler 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun I had a guy ask me the same thing a few years ago, a few days after I dumped him he messaged &amp; asked me to give him back all the sex toys he bought and he was shocked when I admitted I threw them in the bin as I always buy new toys when I'm with a new partner for hygiene reasons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I isolated myself as since escaping I'm paranoid he'll find out about things I'm doing etc like just general things like seeing friends etc and twist it so he can use it against me so I feel more isolated as I'm scared to do anything in case he finds out #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>During family court when the courts refused my abuser direct contact they gave him the option to send letters to my son &amp; he responded "I'll send a letter everyday, I'll never let her forget me" that's when courts accepted it was never about my son he wanted to hurt me #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning, I've had barely 4 hours broken sleep didn't go to sleep until nearly 1am and woke up at 4:17am yet I feel weirdly wired. 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield One of the annoying things about being a single parent is that I'm almost always the photographer on days out but rarely in the photographs. So there's loads of photos of my kid on days out but not many of me and my kid together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I made my son smile when I put his favourite Scooby-Doo DVD on. ✌️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When i was in court abuser claimed he didn't control me as he "let me" go on Instagram I confirmed he did but he controlled what I posted &amp; The Judge calmly told my abuser "the most disturbin part of this is u 'let them' hav an account they shouldnt need ur permission" #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BankofAntandec #santander using a convicted drunk driver to advertise them...were the advertising dept drunk when they came up with this...oh wait.  I'd prefer it if it was Holly Willoughby &amp; Dec advertising #Santander as Holly was a better replacement for him on his other shows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@santanderuk @antanddec Ant crashed his car so seems like a bad omen that the banks going to crash.  This advert should come with an option so people with #Santander can automatically close their accounts and switch to a bank that doesn't have a drunk driver advertising them? Just a suggestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beeapproved1 I know my dad said it to me on his arguement against going vegan as he's a vegetarian. Was so freaking bizarre it makes no sense lmao 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meat: Eater I don't like tofu it's taste and texture is too much like eggs ... Also meat Eater: I could never go #vegan I'd miss eggs too much.   Vegan: That logic makes so much sense! Not! You wont eat tofu because it reminds you of egg but can't go vegan because you'd miss egg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fix_your_hearts I know tofu that's unseasoned tastes like plain egg whites but once it's seasoned it's really delicious. I love it southern fried. It's amazing. ✌️🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews About freaking time! 👏👏👏👏 This was never a protest it was a hate crime disguised as a protest &amp; they were using the kids as an excuse to justify their homophobia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews It's alright as a variation of the flag if people want to use it like how we have the pride flag but people still have bi/trans flags etc But the pride flag was already inclusive of all races without those stripes added.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yay Mondays up at 5am to get **** done and being exhausted and on the verge of falling asleep by 3pm but being forced to stay away to get more **** done until 11pm. Always fun lol 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah think my obsession with Ramones has reached a whole new level as I actually dreamed about them last night.  Was a wonderful dream though. 😍😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks 1) Jarry have to sort this out they're such a cute couple they're meant for each other 2) I used to dislike Marnie but now I love her &amp; how she's bonded with Juliette.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to hate tofu until I found a recipe for it that marinated it in garlic, chillis &amp; lemon juice and then fried it with a Side of rice noodles  Yeah now I'm addicted to tofu it's delicious. #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield If someone doesn't like my dog or my cats or my pets don't like them it's a deal breaker My pets are like my kids &amp; I wouldn't stay with some1 who didn't like my kids so pets are no different &amp; My pets are pretty trusting so if my pets don't like someone there's a good reason why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I'm a #vegan and my kids cuddle up to a giant teddy bear and a blanket shaped like sully from monsters Inc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks @natsus @natsus  definitely deserved the award, Buster was so evil and manipulative and he played him brilliantly as it couldn't have been easy taking on a role of someone so disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I've been Painting all day and I'm honestly exhausted and only half way done so yeah I'm in need of a nap but at least I have a tofu stir-fry cooking for dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LGBT tip: Day 2: When you come out it's normal to be disowned by some people but also YOU are allowed to disown people too.  If someone doesn't disown you when you come out but starts making insulting comments towards you about being #lgbt &amp; being nasty you can disown them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it's pride month I'm going to give you a LGBT tip I have used myself each day: Day 1: if you're trans don't wear a binder when you're exercising, it'll put you at risk of fainting and injury. 🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews So Trump's logic is to make more restrictive abortion laws so more people who are forced to continue with unwanted pregnancies end up putting the babies into care &amp; Now hes trying to add more restrictions on who can adopt the kids that's are in care to stop LGBT people adopting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm the opposite warm weather affects my mental health worse I prefer it cold and raining and I like going out when it's dark. I don't like sunlight it makes my migraine attacks worse &amp; I live in jeans and jumpers so heatstrokes a huge risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah the song Me! By Taylor swift &amp; Brendon urie is an okay feel good anthem... But have you ever listened to So Am I by Ava Max it is like the ultimate feel good song as it's so positive &amp; inspiring &amp; awesome to dance to. #AvaMax<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Our country didn't fail her, the people around her failed her unintentionally by not spotting the signs she was being groomed. If more people educated themselves on the signs of grooming for any motive then this could be avoided in future but it doesn't mean its the UK'S fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lez_Lover22 23 ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midowazzan @SkyNews It's a school programme that teaches LGBT inclusiveness most of these protests stemmed from the programme being in a school in Birmingham. Google it. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This was never a protest it's hate crime disguised as a protest, if someone protests against peoples sexuality then it's a hate crime  They're not protesters they never were they're just a bunch of homophobes disguised as protesters using their children as an excuse #NoOutsiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Major red flag, yeah they should run like hell and don't look back and keep his photo and write it down on the back of said photo just in case there's ever any incidents reported to police that sound like he could be responsible for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Broken Beyond Repair But My Heart Is Still Beating" Finally finished this painting and I love how it's turned out.  #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/g2tIUVKcsh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why you shouldn't litter: My cat had 2 inches of thread sticking out her mouth &amp; she was heaving &amp; needed emergency treatment as she had actually swallowed several metres of cotton thread that was dumped near my home.  She would've choked to death #savetheplanet #vegan  https://t.co/d6QtnRMsLS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Everytime they get a threat they need to make a record of it and hand it over to the police and report it as hate crime - as that's what it is it's homophobia - instead of just reporting it as harassment.  The protesters need arresting as it's a hate crime disguised as protesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi guys been working on a painting most of today - had to take breaks from painting to go see my best friend/kids godmother and there was an emergency with my youngest cat - but I'm super excited to finish this painting and show you wonderful followers the finished piece ✌️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An abuse red flag was how casually my abuser would be racist/sexist/homophobic etc like he'd say the slurs &amp; comments so casually when talking that I'd actually second guess myself thinking "did he seriously just say that? Nah I probably just misheard him" #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Looking back there were lots -Extreme jealousy -Showing up at my work -Bombarding me with calls/texts when he knew I was busy -delusions on grandeur -extremely immature for his age -money randomly going missing around him -how casually he'd be racist/sexist/homophobic #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yes it would have as I would've ran a mile in the opposite direction. As I noticed red flags but I didn't know that's what they were I just knew his behaviour made me think "hmm okkaayy????" But I didn't know his behaviour wasn't normal in a relationship until too late #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Always trust your gut you're not paranoid your gut instinct is something we were born with to protect us use that instinct People also need to stop romanticising domestic abuse in books/films etc as it's teaching people that those toxic behaviours are ok #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I go to a support group run by women's aid which is very helpful I also joined domestic abuse groups on Facebook which helped me know I wasn't alone #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Been singing along to Ramones again before I go out and buy more canvases and black paint. It's like a form of blasphemy to turn off a Ramones song before it's finished. Lmao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had to block a transphobic lesbian who was sending nasty Dm's to me since I came out as trans man but didn't mind my attraction to women beforehand SO ATTENTION PEOPLE: Transphobia has no place in the #LGBT community, if you're LGBT don't be hateful towards other LGBT people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Awww congratulations to them on their beautiful baby,  Wishing her a safe and speedy recovery. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ode to boobs!   Cleavage,  Side boobs,  Under boob,  Boobs in tight shirts,  Bra less boobs,  perky boobs,  saggy boobs, Whether the boobs are big or small,  When it comes to boobs  i freaking love them all #LGBTQoftwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the family court case my ex abuser was caught on multiple occasions admitting to his family in the waiting area that he didn't want access to our child at all he just wanted to **** me off, his friend tipped off police about it yet the courts did nothing #familycourtpledge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ex abuser intimidated and harassed me throughout the entire court case even in the court building he would intimidate me, on one occasion he stepped towards us shouting "oi you" we were forced to run &amp; call the police. Judge told him off but did nothing else #familycourtpledge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yes, we're stronger together!  No one should feel they should have to choose between their religion or love.  By standing together we can stop people using religion as an excuse to be homophobic and people using their sexuality as an excuse to be islamophobic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegannews2 I'm so vegan I only use "honey" as an insult Eg. meat eater claims they love animals Me: awww honey it must be so exhausting being that hypocritical all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuzzFeed Progress My angel babies dad did this to me and it was distressing. He stealthed it and didn't tell me until it was too late for me to take emergency contraception and when I got pregnant he blamed me because I should've Checked he hadn't stealthed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My weekends been hell, yeah i got some of my best paintings done which has been a huge positive but my family have been ****ing *ssholes and I've been gaslighted to hell and back by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason my son understands about people being trans &amp; isn't bothered by it is when he was a baby I wrote him a story explaining about transgender people it was about a prince who was cursed by a witch to live in the body of a princess until the curse was broken by a magic Tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>mom's reaction to me coming out as trans "Apparently I'm going to confuse my kids &amp; only reason my kids don't care that I'm trans is I'm the only parent they've got so dont have a choice" Yeah they have had a choice I asked for their blessing so I could start transitioning #LGBTQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whowantstolive3 @MailOnline Agreed the bulls covered in blood from him torturing it but yeah... Poor bull fighter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Karma's definitely left him butt hurt  He's tortured the bull it's covered in bleeding wounds he inflicted on it but yeah it's really dramatic that the bull defended himself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun Hope she's getting the support she needs after going through this As my ex threatened to do this to me multiple times when he found out I was pregnant because I chose to continue With the pregnancy &amp; the fear it left me with caused anxiety and severe agoraphobia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I had a lie in until 8:45am when my son stole my bed, my duvet, my pillows and my blankets and kicked me down to the foot of my own freaking bed like a dog.

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews So what about the under 5s who are being raised by same sex parents? Teaching kids about same sex relationships &amp; being trans when they're younger will help them understand why their friend has 2 dads when they have a mom &amp; dad or why their friends mom is now living life as a man<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Had the worst migraine attack I've ever experienced so far in my life yesterday. Never felt pain like it I actually thought I was going to die at one point it got so bad. Pains not so bad at the moment but feel drowsy and sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Actually Elsa teaches people that you don't need to be in a relationship to be able to love yourself, that the love of family is just as strong as love from a partner &amp; to love ourself despite our flaws &amp; be proud of them instead of hiding them from people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love having pyjama days they're awesome, I'm in my fitness attire and sweating like crazy. Exercise is worth it though lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saiz_what I know he is he's also extremely sexist, biphobic, transphobic and anti everyone with a uterus but then has a tantrum when anyone even so much as looks at him and his boyfriend the wrong way then cries about wanting hate crimes against gay men banned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hate when people tell me that periods aren't that bad, As yeah when mine are debilitating, they leave me doubled over in burning pain, my reproductive system swells up like a balloon animal, I'm nauseated, dizzy, struggle to get out of bed from pain &amp; my meditation is s***.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK This is a bad idea as the top 3 possible outcomes are either she'll be murdered, radicalised or abducted &amp; forced into marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Is this a joke? How is he supposed to diagnose her symptoms that she went to the doctor for if he can't even hear what her symptoms are? The diagnosis would be about as accurate as googling her symptoms. He's done nothing wrong at all &amp; they're just creating problems.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You ever have one of those moments where someone's telling you about something that's happened and you know instinctively they have more to do with it than they're letting on?

<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams @SimonCowell @BGT @ITV You're brilliant 😂😂 I bet he loved it really lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else have those Periods where you don't even know what's going on with your period? Like it's really abnormal compared to how it usually is so you go to the clinic, have them look up your vagina &amp; take swabs just to find out nothings wrong you're just having a weird period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun My dogs face went like this after he was stung by a wasp he wasn't trying to eat it though, he just got too close to it.  Was terrifying rather than funny to be honest his face looked like it had been inflated &amp; he was in agony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews If they're so homophobic they're willing to disrupt their child's education to stop them being taught to accept LGBT people then they seriously need psychiatric help and investigating by children's services asap as they clearly don't care about their kids welfare #nooutsiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Dear protesters Yes you are homophobic! To sum it up basically claiming that you don't mind LGBT+ people as long as your kids aren't taught to accept them is homophobic.  If your religion tells you that 2 people being in love is wrong find a new religion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews If they're behaving this way about their kids being taught that it's okay to be LGBT+ what would they do to their kids if their kids ended up coming out as LGBT+ when they're older?  I'm concerned that they're so homophobic they're Willing to interfere with their kids education<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UndercoverNikki He's really smart for his age he's intellectually matched with children older than him, my son was fine he just slammed the door on the person and it hit them lol served them right my son's had lots of cuddles for being my tiny badass x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What p*sses me off more than people chatting bull**** behind my back is when my loved ones instead of telling the **** stirrer to shut up &amp; ignorin them instead decide 2 call/text me askin me questions about the BS rumour they heard, if it concerned them I'd hav already told them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UndercoverNikki What's up? You okay? ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoOutsidersUK They're homophobic Not teaching kids about LGBT relationships isn't going to stop them being LGBT, I wasn't taught about being lgbt in school &amp; was raised by religious parents who taught me it was a sin &amp; I'm still LGBT, I've known since I was 4 but I was scared into the closet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews There is no way they can word why they're protesting that does not make it obvious they're just a bunch of homophobic ****s It's not like they're protesting against getting pork banned from school dinners they're protesting against people's identity which is disgusting &amp; shameful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you're having a sh*tty day Today me &amp; my 2 year old are wearing coordinating Pikachu t-shirts so yeah it's super cute he's my mini me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning I've had a horrible allergic reaction to weeds when I was doing the gardening so now I'm in agony, the skin on my arms is swollen and itching and scratched so hard I've taken the skin up.

<|startoftext|>Pro lifers claim they care about the fetuses rights before it's born but what about when the fetuses they save are girls?  Will they still fight for their rights or will they continue to take their rights away from them?  #Feminism #prochoice #AbortionRights #AbortionIsNotACrime<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks The actings brilliant in this scene but oh my gosh it's so sad 😭 poor grace she has to get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I can relate I've been suicidal and hated myself for so long the thought of getting better scares me but I know it's possible I was addicted to painkillers &amp; couldnt imagine ever being clean but now that I am i feel the opposite &amp; it's the thought of relapsing that scares me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parents be careful; there's a scam going about with ice cream vans when you order from them, they are deliberately adding extras u didn't ask for &amp; then trying to charge u for them. Had someone brazenly do this to me so i paid for what I asked for but refused to pay the extra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi the UK is having a heatwave so please be respectful of trans people as it's really difficult for them when it's really warm as it can make dysphoria worse as they're trying to pass but at the same time the don't want heatstroke.

<|startoftext|>@lgbttrains I follow back ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You ever met someone and just felt straight away in your gut instinct "I don't f*cking trust you" like felt it so hard in your gut you can hear it clear as day?  Had one of those moments today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ramones are my go to, I love them, they are awesome 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My left ear is burning like crazy so guessing someone is bad mouthing me according to the myth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm guessing you wasn't sure how to respond to that? Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had an appointment with the most judgemental person I've ever met so far, felt so paranoid like I was on trial for a routine appointment. Was awful glad it's over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Agreed He's a bully and it should've been cancelled years ago, he gas lights people, victim blames them, has no clue about how hard it to permanently leave abusive relationships, he doesn't understand drug/alcohol addiction well enough to judge people &amp; he's a disgusting bully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Honestly I'm not surprised this hadn't happened sooner, he's a bully, he victim blames domestic abuse victims &amp; addicts, he's 2 faced &amp; he's so caught up in making sure every child knows who their father is he forgets that it's not always safe for the child to know their father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leponline I'm curious as to the circumstances of the death. My friend was on the show in 2016 &amp; she admitted the bits they don't show on TV is him being a vile bully and victim blaming people who struggle with abusive relationships. He's a bully #jeremykyleshow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People hate abortions but aren't doing more to prevent pregnancy by providing easier access to birth control, emergency contraception &amp; doing more to stop rapists  Effective way 2 reduce abortion is stricter controls on erectile dysfunction meds, No erection = no pregnancy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The abortion rate would be lower if pills and remedies to cure erectile dysfunction were as tightly regulated and controlled as women's birth control is.  They can say God is against abortion all they like but God also broke their dicks but that's not stopping them selling Viagra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK He is in no position to be discussing peoples weight and fat shaming anyone. #piersmorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today I've learned that I live in a world where there are people who actually think that strangers thinking I'm a man is MORE shameful to my family than random men sexually harassing me in front of my kids &amp; shouting at me to get my breasts out whilst we're at the park 🖕🖕🖕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my loved ones asked me why I've suddenly only started going out in baggy men's jumpers I explained it's because I'm sick of being sexually harassed when I'm out with my kids &amp; They told me I should just take it as a compliment instead of "risking" being mistaken for a man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Good morning and have an awesome Monday 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes me laugh when my auto correct changes "hay fever" to "gay fever" Yes I'm suffering with gay fever...Symptoms are: Hot  Sweaty and  https://t.co/TMSRPxwNJX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is currently gripped by a heatwave and I feel like I'm drowning in my dysphoria because it's too hot to wear jeans, a jumper or my binder without risking heat stroke. I need rain right now so I have an excuse to cover up. 😭😭😭😭 #LGBTQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 3 of getting my teeth corrected) hurts like hell, can't stop drooling I'm drooling like a blood hound, feel like I've been punched in the teeth but I'm already noticing results. So yay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams @BGT @BAFTA Congratulations and this is so sweet! ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicolacoughlan @DailyMirror What the hell are they talking about?  You look like a model @DailyMirror  is talking out it's arse, shame on them for trying to body shame you it's absolutely vile.  You're stunning, that dress makes your figure look amazing and the colour is lush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the MANY reasons people are so angry with @jamescharles for what hes done is because he's causing more unneeded stigma towards the LGBT+ community  The LGBT+ community gets stigmatised and false news slandering us as it is without bull **** like this hitting the news #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton I think this an amazing thing that she's done as more awareness is needed about food banks so people will donate to them so they can keep up with the demand.  She still looks stunning whilst literally wearing a bin bag she looks stunning in this she'll look stunning in anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My toddler got creative in the kitchen and emptied an entire bottle of syrup and a few teaspoons of sea salt into an empty saucepan and was pretending to cook  So I decided to give him the rest of the ingredients to make #vegan gingerbread balls with &amp; baked them for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my kids so much... They're the air in my lungs, The blood in my veins And piece of my heart that lives outside my body.  They're the best thing that ever happened to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Oh No - Short Sighted Sea Creature!" Finally finished finger painting this been using metallic and pearl paints so this photograph was taken with a flash to show off how shiny it is #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/J0P8yuU9d6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My little one is finally how from the party! I have missed them so much! I ran down the entryway to meet them moment the car pulled up and my gorgeous little one ran up and gave me the biggest hug ever I'm so happy they had fun at the party they won't shut up about it &amp; I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been looking forward to my kid going to his friends birthday party all week so I get a day off as his grandad is taking him &amp; now he's gone I feel lost, the house is too empty &amp; I can't wait for him to come home so I can hear all about the party. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entish2 I know it can happen to all genders and sexualities byt it just shocked me that that was one of the scariest parts of coming out as a lesbian is fear of being murdered for rejecting a man as she obviously won't be attracted to him. floored me when she admitted it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lesbian admitted something sad to me earlier: She admitted one of her biggest fears since coming out as a lesbian is that she'll be murdered by a man when she rejects him  It's 2019 and lesbians are afraid of being murdered for rejecting men who ask them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Why is the father always smirking in all the photos of him? Even if it turns out they had nothing to do with her disappearance aside from leaving her alone in a foreign country, why is he always got a smug smirk on his face? Its not fake smile for the cameras it's a genuine smirk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK He sees Meghan as dollar signs which isn't healthy, after everything he's done in the past to make money off her fame and success how is she supposed to trust him? Even if she did send him a photograph he wouldn't keep it he'd sell it to the highest bidder instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK She's self destructing and is unwilling to get help. I feel bad for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 2 of Getting my teeth fixed) my teeth hurt like hell, I've barely slept from pain, my tongue feels rough like it's been burned but I'm already noticing results.  I'm proud of myself for getting the motivation to change what I dislike about myself but it's still painful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night, sweet dreams and I have a very early start but can't sleep this is so frustrating lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An example of why women are afraid of rejecting men that happened in my hometown: 17yr old girl rejected man in his late 20's...So he committed a spate of arson attacks at random blocks of flats within an hour that resulted in an elderly man becoming trapped &amp; burned to death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night all I've Finally finished painting for today so time for this exhausted parent to go to bed as I feel like I'm going to pass out from exhaustion and I have an early start getting my son ready for his friends birthday party. I'm so freaking tired<|endoftext|>

But now my dogs got a tumour shes started being nice to him... My dog shouldn't have to be dying to be respected!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally found what I'm getting my son for his birthday and I'm too excited he's obsessed with painting just like his mummy (awww bless)  So I'm making him his own art chest &amp; filling it with canvas boards, professional paints &amp; brushes, art easel &amp; oil pastels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brother was talking to me about how hanging out with female friends has made him realise how bad sexual harassment is &amp; I told to him how hard it is as mother when someone does it when I'm out with my son so I have 2 teach my son about sexual harassment in the middle of a street<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Side to sexual harassment &amp; cat calling people dont see is when people sexually harass mothers who are with their children... The children hear it, so the mother has to give her kids a spontaneous sexual harassment lesson to explain to their children that that behaviour is not ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saiz_what @AnnieKenyon2 Agreed and if it was because of old fashioned values why didn't the elderly woman care about it but he did? Things change people evolve if she could get with the times why couldn't he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieKenyon2 I know it's revolting, was made more annoying as an elderly woman who was visibly older than him, had a lovely conversation with me about how cute my son was being and she wasn't even bothered the I was wearing LGBT pride jewelry. She treated me with respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Karma is a bitch isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetHolly18 I'm so jealous! Cheesy Doritos are the best flavour of Doritos... I will not be convinced otherwise lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An old man spat at me &amp; called me a dirty f****t in front of my kid. I confronted him &amp; he tried to blame it on "old fashioned traditional values" So told him 1) its 2019 not 1919 get with the times &amp; 2)if hes so old fashioned &amp; traditional why the f***  does he have an iPhone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This is heaven to me Marmite on toast or grilled cheese sandwiches made with the crust is heavenly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Seems more like he's a closeted gay and his homophobia is based on his actual fear of people finding out he's gay so he wants to see a public gay sex act so he can watch it without risking people seeing his internet search history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Have an awesome weekend ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leah__Dean For **** sake seriously? This is bull**** what's next? Charging women with involuntary manslaughter when they have their periods or a natural pregnancy loss because it's a potential life their body chose to remove without her having any control over it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peta @MorpheBrushes @jamescharles 😠 I love badgers they're wonderful in the wild I love watching them at night near woodland Also vegan makeup brushes have improved my technique, they're softer, easier to clean and makes the makeup easier to apply with less stray powder falling onto my shirt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun I feel bad for her kids, she's self destructing and they're getting caught up in her destruction. She needs to see a mental health professional to get to the root of her destructive behaviour so she can get better. The path she's going down is going to end up killing her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a man tells you your makeup is false advertisement as you look different without it...that's their issue not yours... It's not your fault they're too stupid to accept that women don't naturally have bold coloured eyelids, lips, glitter and eyeliner. It's their issues not yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half Makeup, half natural.  Wearing makeup IS NOT "false advertising" I don't naturally have black eyeliner I don't naturally have black lipstick &amp; my eyebrows don't naturally have corner's  https://t.co/GxXUqOewIl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Different ways to say NO to someone; 1) NO 2) NO 3) NO  4) NO  5) NO 6) NO   NO means NO you shouldn't have to say it any other way to get someone to accept that you are saying NO.  Just say NO, NO means you're not consenting end of.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning, have a lovely day and try to stay dry up your end as where I live is currently caught in the middle of a storm so yeah my eyeliner is going to run &amp; I'll end up looking like a Dawn of Ashes tribute act.  Lmao ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do men claim women wearing makeup is false advertisement? Like seriously women don't naturally have black eyeliner etc It's not like it's some puberty sh*t, like her breasts grow bigger, she starts her periods, develops contouring, eyeliner and purple lipstick.  #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I'm a vegan and I couldn't care less if my food tastes like bacon as long as there's no actual bacon in it.  As long as there's no bacon from a pig (vegan bacon substitute or turkey bacon is ok though) in the food it shouldn't be a problem as shes not breaking any religious rules<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reason number 18974748 why women are afraid to reject men: I rejected a guy I used to work with just under 4 years ago and he's been stalking me &amp; my family since and gets arrested multiple times a year for pretending he's my 2 year olds dad on social media &amp; to his friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today's been traumatic, need to go to police station to give a statement after my stalker of nearly 4 years, touched my bum on a bus, took a photo of me &amp; my 2 year old son without my consent, taunted me &amp; ran off the bus when it stopped.

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews P*sses me off when I see LGBT+ people being hateful towards other parts of the LGBT+ community, there's no need for it, hate has no place amongst the LGBT+ community. I'm a lesbian &amp; I couldn't care less if a woman I'm dating is trans as long as she treats me right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK I understand why he's upset as it shows ignorance and lack of acceptance by his mother. If she truly supported his gender identity she'd let him wear a suit. I wouldn't go if my mom told me to wear a dress.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Important: Please don't use weight loss supplements or go on weight loss diets when you're pregnant it can be dangerous, the growing fetus needs all the vitamins and nutrients it can get from you, it's not going to get them from dieting.

<|startoftext|>@Sherida57897192 @TheSun If the child's awake and doesn't have any health conditions or behavioural   conditions that affect their ability to get out the buggy then the mother should take them out and fold the buggy down but otherwise not much they can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun It's a shame but tough whats the mum supposed to do when there's no room left? Get off the bus &amp; be late to their Destination?

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love them both equally 🐕Dogs are cute but loyal 🐈Cats are cute but assholes They both have their charms which is why I own 2cats and a dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Teresa May just doesn't get it does she? Brexit has dragged on way too long we want what was promised if we left the EU we don't want a half arsed deal to shut us up  The vote to leave EU was on my pregnancy due date I voted on the way to be induced...My kids almost 3yrs old now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Agreed, painting got me further in life than school did as it got me my last job as a graphic designer, helped me build a decent portfolio &amp; gain valuable experience to add to my CV. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toxic people hate seeing other people happy examples: Me *finally feels confident in my body* Them: you look like you've gotten fat since I last saw you Me *visibly is happier than ever with my life* Them: u seem so miserable all the time I'm here if u need to talk  Me: **** off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Questions that need answering about this: Were they dating before she turned 16? If so why did no one call police? Why didn't her parents do anything about the relationship? I would have if it was my kid due to the age gap The fact he's asking for child maintenance is disturbing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@homoanxiety Hey I follow back ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right guys I'm off too eat chocolate cake In a candlelit bubble bath so I hope you all have a wonderful night and stay safe and warm wherever you are in the world. ✌️ #selfcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Hate when doctors don't take parents concerns seriously. My son had a severe tongue tie &amp; couldn't burp, put his tongue out, was vomiting &amp; struggling to feed &amp; his weight crashed &amp; GP said indigestion until I went to a different GP who sent him to hospital for it to be cut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeganPod 1) car was probably a tornado or someone going up a homemade stunt ramp 2) The cat attacked something on the blinds &amp; got stuck 3)The horse probably kicked something &amp; as it's hind legs went straight they went through the gap and it got stuck 4)I can't work out the 4th pic sorry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just love having that moment when I get an idea for a painting and when I put paint to canvas the finished result is even better than how I imagined it. Makes me feel like my heart will burst with self love and pride. #artistsontwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After today I'm grateful my ribs were already broken in a freak accident nearly 12 days ago and I have the records to prove they weren't broken my friends scumbag boyfriend. Still shaken up &amp; keep randomly crying though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Saturdays twist...my house guests scumbag boyfriend has randomly attacked me in the kitchen when I was making a sandwich, my scalps bleeding &amp; I'm shaking but I defended myself during the incident I shoved them off me and got help. Thankfully my neighbours saw everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Is there anything he won't bitch about seriously? He had a tantrum over a vegan sausage roll and now he's having a tantrum over an LGBT Sandwich. Like seriously dude grow up there are people suffering from starvation who would happily eat this. #piersmorgan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @MindCharity @redhead_ordead @imwtclothing You look toned in black but handsome in pink and me personally I prefer black as don't think a person can ever have too many black clothes. They're awesome. 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you are all having an awesome Saturday and staying warm and dry this weather's so weird today one minute it's cold and dry the next it's humid, clammy and piddling it down with rain and gales. It's draining. #saturdayfun  https://t.co/M1kD5uzfvT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barely gotten started on today's painting and already had three awesome ideas I had to made note of roughly for my next 3 paintings. Argh I'm inspired whilst painting the last thing I felt inspired to paint. Going to work on perfecting 1 painting per day. Quality over quantity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fotrickvic I follow back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's important tip: When it comes to abuse, rape, violence or sexual harassment ... Once is one time too many.  It doesn't matter if they only did it once, apologized and never did it again, it is still one time too many and they shouldn't have done it at all, so report it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstbro1 @PinkNews Apologies mean nothing what he did was vile and doesn't matter if he didn't do it again Ana didn't sunbathe topless again after he did it the first time so he had no reason to feel the need to it again if she had though he most likely would've repeated his actions. Once is enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning my wonderful followers, hope you all have an awesome Saturday, I'm painting again today which I'm really looking forward to, very excited for today's piece as I hate the colour yellow but I love bees so I'm excited. #GoodMorningWorld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's good that you enjoyed it. :-D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstbro1 @PinkNews He covered her in love bites so she'd be forced to cover up just because she sunbathed topless? That is domestic abuse and was one of the most disturbing parts of the franchise. Also his relationship with Elena when he was a minor was romanticised when it was disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Defendergenes @AbuseChat My doctor had to be suspended as when I was pregnant he told me if the abuse was really that bad I would've got an abortion &amp; me chosing to continue with the pregnancy was proof was exaggerating as no sane person would want to raise their abusers baby. I reported him #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstbro1 @PinkNews It was domestic abuse, it was mainly emotional abuse shown by his need for control over Ana, his extreme jealousy, the stalking obsessive behaviour after their first encounter, his constant hot &amp; cold behaviour towards her, taking out his mommy issues on her etc it's not love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hope you have very sweet dreams and stay warm and dry it's piddling it down tonight. 🌬️🌧️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hope you enjoy your takeaway and it's good that you're happy, dogs are a Humans best friend they're wonderful. 🐩🐕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Yeah...no 50shades of grey is a romanticism of domestic abuse and an inaccurate portrayal of BDSM culture and relationships. Unless the author actually does their research this time around I don't think they should write anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Okay, if you ever need to talk feel free to drop me a DM 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Demon Under My Hoodie" Based on my gender dysphoria and my misery at having to dress hyper feminine when I see my mom as she doesn't know about my gender identity. #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/GrwkctK1KT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I doubt it my kid's jealous of the cats whenever I cuddle either one of m girls they take them off me and put them on the other sofa. Lol my kids a jealous little monkey at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You okay? You seem off. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield R.I.P hopefully his next life will be just as amazing as this one was. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right! I'm going to have a cup of coffee and a grilled "cheese" sandwich then time to work on my next 2 paintings. Really looking forward to my first one I'm painting as I'm doing the background colour different to what I usually go for. #artistsontwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@depressionarmy The moments when my thoughts go like that are when I paint or sketch, I just shut my eyes take a few deep breaths and I just grab the paint brush or pencil and go with the chaos it helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Can easily veganise this by using Quorn bacon and the Q in Quorn gives us the Q in LGBTQ lol just arranged differently lol ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Hello ✌️ hope you have a relaxing weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalRocksUK Good morning and have an awesome weekend 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm a full time parent trying to make it as a painter and I still get excited for a long weekend lol I tend to get more paintings done on a bank holiday as it's a day where I'm expected to stay in all day so I'm happy to fulfill expectations &amp; spend all day at an easel. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate my ribs being broken but I love the pain medication I'm taking for it as it makes me feel high as kite which actually really helps with the pain. Lmao. 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm drooling an awful lot considering I feel dehydrated I'm going to go have a shower have a happy Friday everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @sinittaofficial At my funeral I'd want Beam Me Up by Pink playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had such a weird dream right now! That it was the middle of June and the tv was playing Christmas song translated into Japanese but I was getting annoyed because most of the songs on it weren't even Christmas songs they were just dancing with sparkly tinsel  https://t.co/T3zYZaz1VA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning Aiden have a fun Friday and woohoo it's Friday and I have way too much stuff to do but I also have painting to do so I'm excited to get cracking on it🎨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got woken up by the police banging on my door, turns out the weird car that parks outside my neighbours regularly is stolen and someone was spotted running out of it when the police drove by and police needed my CCTV footage. Think I just sh*t myself when I saw the police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I have 2 cats and a dog I love them as much as my kids ... Just don't tell my kids I said that lmao they won't be happy 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Necks suddenly gone stiff, started vomiting like a fountain and I'm so tired it's unreal. Can't wait to go to bed see if an early night makes me feel better. #feelingsick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I take my kid to see his godmom on Thursdays and he had an epic violent meltdown in the middle of a busy car park today so I feel bad for her as she was looking forward to seeing him. He's being adorable now though lmao 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@puller_lewis We suspect my kids got behavioural issues so I've booked them in to get tested after their 3rd birthday as today was next level violent it broke my heart seeing them that way but thankfully got them under control safely. Was nice having other people who were understanding 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Pride Gremlin"  I loved painting him was so much fun and he's turned out so cute! I was so unsure about this painting until I finished the last stroke of paint and yeah now I'm in love with him. Definitely one of my favourite pieces I've done. #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/M1o0Db8BQl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made "cheesy" #vegan kebab burgers and garlicy mayonnaise for my kid's dinner and yeah it's gone down very well they tasted delicious and perfect comfort food for my kid after their epic violent meltdown today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi guys, hope you are having an awesome Thursday. My toddler has had an utterly horrific violent meltdown today thank goodness my best friend was there to help. Currently working on a colourful painting I cannot wait to show you guys when I've finished it  https://t.co/E5rUnEL712<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men can have their navel pierced it's not just for women okay? If you're a cisgender man &amp; want it pierced... Go for it, If you're a trans man who had your navel pierced before transitioning &amp; want to keep your navel piercing...go for it it won't make you "less of a man"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sounds fun, stay safe and hope you have an awesome day together. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams They're so cute they cutest little nose.  I have 2 cats and a dog and they're my fluffy babies I love them as much as I love my kids ... Just hope my kids don't find out I said that. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that hit me hard was: Trauma survivor telling me she was suicidal, not because she actually wanted to die she didn't want to die but because she didn't want to remember the trauma anymore as the memory of it was killing her More needs to be done to support victims<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Artist problems: *Buys 9 large canvases* hmmm this will be enough to last me a week. *Gets hit by inspiration overload and has 4 new ideas in 5 minutes they need to write down* Yeah I'm going to need a lot more than 9 canvases to last a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person: are they a boy or a girl? Me: they were assigned male at birth Person: so he's a boy? Me: they were assigned male at birth but raised neutral until they're old enough to tell me what gender they are Person: he's a boy Me: they're freaking 2yrs old they don't know yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LGBT_updates I say this about my kids Person: are they a boy or a girl? Me: they were assigned male at birth Person: so he's a boy? Me: they were assigned male at birth but raised neutral until they're old enough to tell me what gender they are Person: he's a boy Me: they're freaking 2yrs old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat It should be the victims choice to hand over their phones and it should only be handed over with a victim signing a consent form, shouldn't be forced on the victim as it's inflicting more trauma by saying hand it over OR ELSE we'll drop your case, it's threatening them #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Definitely would discourage victims from coming forward as it'd make them paranoid their case would be dropped over any tiny thing they found on there phone &amp; the victim needs their phone to contact their support network &amp; they wouldn't be able to do that without it. #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yes, the police were vile to me to the point I had to call the police on a police officer who was in the case as she victim blamed me to hell &amp; back &amp; made a malicious phone call to me during her lunch break off her work phone, she was fired. I felt like they blamed me #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Thought of handing over my phone makes me feel violated as there's pics &amp; private conservations with family on there it would feel like an invasion of my privacy to use any tiny thing against me to get the attacker off. It would discourage me from reporting it #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Medical records are important as a record of injuries sustained during the abuse &amp; to prove a person's mentally stable if the abuser is making false claims of them being mentally unstable during a court case as My ex tried to falsely claim in court I was schizophrenic #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat  https://t.co/Yv5qjlsb5S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Looking handsome as ever, hope you're feeling somewhat better, have fun and stay safe. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Beltane and blessed be To my wonderful twitter followers, stay safe &amp; have a magical day. #wicca #Beltane<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's not okay to call someone a transtrender (trans as a fashion trend &amp; it's "cool" &amp; experiences no dysphoria) this is not okay to call a trans person, gender dysphoria is hell, trans people experience hate crimes &amp; transitioning is hard. They're not faking it as a trend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Came to the conclusion I'm just as bad as my kids; my toddler threw balls at me when I was trying to get them to go to bed and turned it into a 2 hour long game of dodgeball instead and yeah haven't laughed so much in years. #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstyLPorter @Hollyoaks So glad you're back, I've missed seeing Leela on #hollyoaks she's awesome and you're a brilliant actress. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Ghost With A Monobrow" 😆😂 Painted this with just a makeup sponge which has been so much fun to do.  Think the universe is telling me I need to wax my eyebrows 😂😂  #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/MuCCu5BeOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Easy way to fix this problem make the coffee lids out the same type of card they use to make the coffee cups.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Currently working on finger painting a larger abstract piece on canvas. Looking forward to seeing how this piece actually turns out as it's going to be different to what I normally do as I'm doing a few pieces based on the things I see when I'm meditating. #artistsontwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ramones up full blast as per usual 🎵🎶❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People don't walk into get an abortion with a smile on their face. It's a heartbreaking decision that they had to make as it was the right thing to do at the time, having an abortion is one of the hardest things emotionally a person can go through so it's not ur right to judge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline I Feel so bad for her, My ex put me on a strict diet when I was pregnant as he thought I was using pregnancy as an excuse to "get fat". Men who do things like that don't deserve the women they've done it to. She can do better &amp; deserves better than him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how music influences my creativity as whenever I'm listening to #ramones #greenday #rollingstones #fleetwoodmac etc I suddenly feel inspired &amp; have to keep a notebook near me just so I can very roughly sketch up &amp; annotate the ideas that are going through my brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hopefully. People wouldn't believe my 2 year old son broke my ribs as he shouldn't have been strong enough to. it was an accident he slammed the gate during a meltdown &amp; the end of the bolt went into my back but I still can't believe a Toddler broke my ribs. It's weird. Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night all, I can't sleep so got Angie by Rolling Stones on full blast in my ear phones. Will always and forever be one of my favourite songs, it triggers happy memories of my childhood lol ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sweet dreams, stay safe &amp; good night ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life with a toddler summed up: I left the room for a few seconds to get their drink and my toddler took off all their clothes, climbed on the back of the sofa and shoved their bare ass against the living room window and mooned the neighbors. #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Monday has been weird; my trapped nerve was a misdiagnosis &amp; I actually have broken ribs, my cats reacted well to their medication but it cost nearly twice the usual price and I bought new paintbrushes so did a political painting which piddled off a pro lifer on Instagram. Whoops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person: why'd you care so much about abortion laws in America when you don't live there? Me: why do you care so much about Brunei stoning gay people to death, you're not gay &amp; you don't live there? Person: I care because it's still wrong what's happening Me: there's your answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My cats have sort of forgiven me they still love me but they aren't happy at being quarantined in the bathroom until the side effects of their medication wear off but not having two cats hyped up on medication running around my house They can come out when they've calmed down lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your mental illness is still valid if: - you need to take medication for it - you don't take medication for it - you use alternative therapies to manage it - you use self help books - you need to be hospitalised at times No matter how u manage your mental illness it's still valid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckyslunchbox I love this look it's simple but dramatic. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyReeses @MailOnline I know I'm confused by this wrong headline for wrong article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi guys, hope you're having an awesome today. My ribs are definitely broken &amp; I'm supposed to be wearing a sling to stop me using my left arm whilst they heal as moving my arm is affecting them but eurgh at least my pets took their medication with no issues today. #selfie  https://t.co/r8A6Il2AU2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm going to try to. Doubt my cats will be smiling after I give them their medication but hopefully they will be after I give them a full pack of their favourite treats x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I don't take medication for my mental illnesses but they definitely still exist I just manage them with non medication therapies that do help.  People don't need to be on medication for their mental illness to be valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Dr Puppet Master" Been working on this all day inspired by America's abortion laws and my male Dr in the UK who has had a vascetomy telling me I can't be sterilised in case I change my mind. #artistsontwitter #Feminism #Equality  https://t.co/IEDnyMttej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got Rocky Horror Show on in background whilst I paint and keeping my idea sketch pad at the side of me just in case I get anymore ideas whilst Painting my current ones. #artistsontwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men can have body hair &amp; still be hygienic because they bathe regularly, wear deodorant &amp; antiperspirant, shower after exercising... The exact same things women do even though society expects us not to have body hair.  Body hair is not unhygienic it's natural.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok feeling super inspired today to paint today been drafting up ideas that I like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect way to start Sunday, #vegan hot cross buns and latte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Awww that's so sweet, I love kids my toddler is an adorable pain in the butt around babies as they always want to cuddle them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK The animals were tranquillized as part of a conservation effort I get that but what I don't get is why he felt the need to keep that to himself and editting the tethers out of the photos when he posted the photos instead of just admitting the truth they were tranquillized?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnni The mama rhino looked so happy with her baby. Actually looked like she was smiling hopefully more can be done to save such a beautiful animal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exhausted...What was originally thought to be trapped nerve in my back has actually turned out to be broken ribs. Explains why I've been in so much pain &amp; why its been agony to breathe. Not mad at my toddler for slamming the gate on me he was having a meltdown &amp; accident happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night, stay safe and warm, it's bloody freezing tonight. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A woman having body hair isn't unhygienic the same way people don't call it unhygienic when men have body hair.  Body hair is only unhygienic if you have bad personal hygiene in general there's no issue if you maintain a good personal hygiene routine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anniewallace I can't stand Mumsnet nearly everyone on there is so judgemental it's become more of a forum where people can openly be offensive about people rather than actually providing parenting advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It's not Weird to love someone you've never met lol and safe today your followers love you too lol ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Nature's Landfill" Been working on this all morning kind of lost motivation in it at first but put Ramones on full blast whilst I did a 10 minute work out and yeah got my motivation back. #artistsontwitter #plasticpollution #vegan  https://t.co/GCsN08X0rB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love listening to Ramones, whenever I'm painting and feel like I'm losing my motivation and drive in what I'm painting I just put Ramones on full blast and yeah I get my motivation back. #Ramones #MusicIsLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The winds blew my kids slide over and into the garden fence so yeah the fence panel is destroyed so it'll be fun to see what other damages will be done before this storm passes. Yay Another surprise expense this month #StormHannah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror The winds blew my kids slide over and into the garden fence so yeah the fence panel is destroyed so it'll be fun to see what other damages will be done before this storm passes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeWithLydia I know lol was having one of those moments of its only 10:18 and I'm already so over today kinda moments lol. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeWithLydia 10:18 in England and I'm listening to Ramones whilst i exercise to hopefully get some inspiration as to what I want to paint. I know I want to paint as painting is life &amp; I feel inspired just an issue as to what I feel inspired to actually paint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dipak125 @DailyMailUK I hope you have an awesome weekend too, stay safe out the weathers awful today. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Listening to Ramones full blast whilst I exercise. Have a trapped nerve in my back that won't budge so I'm doing the exercises advised to, to hopefully release the painful little ***hole. At least I have an excuse to workout more than usual so silver lining lmao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dipak125 @DailyMailUK I'm having marmite on crumpets for breakfast lol I love marmite. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun There's nothing wrong with a woman having body hair it's completely natural and as long as the woman showers regularly and have good personal hygiene having body hair isn't unhygienic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah my son's happy about it he gets to watch scooby doo DVDs all day whilst mommy paints x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ditto I get my buzz from painting and exercise though also I have stoner thought processes when I'm sober or not stoned and so I don't need drugs and I'm currently quitting alcohol for good this time which is going to be fun. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I can't imagine what was going through your head"  Painting I've done, as being a survivor of domestic abuse &amp; rape I hear painting title a lot I Kept the person gender neutral &amp; done them purple as it's my favourite colour so their race is unknown. #artistsontwitter #abusetalk  https://t.co/3efhYXV7Ke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little girl made me proud today: She was no older than 4yrs old and asked @ woman "is your baby a boy or a girl?" The girls mom said to her "he's obviously a boy he's wearing blue" So she turned to her mom &amp; replied "the babies mom's got blue jeans on &amp; she's not a boy is she?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"She Said No" Painting I've done to raise awareness about FGM (female genital mutilation) as it's a horrible practice that should be stopped but unfortunately many girls around the world have been victims of. #ArtistOnTwitter ontwitter #feminist  https://t.co/uB2RR6zhMH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pro lifers saying "if they didn't want to get pregnant they should've used contraception" is BS contraception isn't 100% effective &amp; What about rape? Are women supposed to be on hormonal contraception all the time just in case or carry condoms with her to give to her rapist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pro lifers saying "if they didn't want to get pregnant they shouldn't have had sex" is a load of rubbish Yes abstinence is a 100% effective form of contraception when it applies to consenting to sex  Abstinence is a 0% effective form of contraception against rape &amp; sexual assault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning to you too, it's only 9:05am and I've already completed a painting that is insanely gory and disturbing so yeah I'm classing this Friday as a win. Woohoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sleep tight, sweet dreams and stay safe ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How consent was explained to me: Sex is like admiring a beautiful ring in a jewellery store, u can admire the ring in the case but u cannot touch the ring without asking for permission from the store owner as they're the person with the key to access the ring &amp; they can say no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hell yes 🤘, been listening to Ramones I love them I love their music &amp; how they dress they're awesome. Music is my  life. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"wasteland tulips"  Painted some tulips I saw growing on some wasteland. #ArtistOnTwitter  https://t.co/NjMgJCXSmp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Wolverhampton or Walsall x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ditto I can't function without music keeps me sane, I need to listen to it when I'm doing my makeup, cooking the dinner and exercising to name a few lmao x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline  https://t.co/TAQotE31JR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi guys have an awesome Thursday and stay safe #goodmorning  https://t.co/WCZyvkhqAt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe it or not society has put gender stereotypes on how people sit on chairs &amp; sofas.  Men are "supposed to" take up lots of space when they sit somewhere and slouch etc  Women are "supposed to" sit prim &amp; proper, back straight and take up as little space as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear men If your masculinity is so fragile you worry that people will think you're feminine simply because of how you sit on a chair then you seriously need to see a psychiatrist to find out why you're so scared of people thinking you're feminine. Sincerely concerned woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person to a woman "you sit like a man" Well no **** she's been on her feet all day the last thing she's going to do is sit with her back straight and knees together all lady like She's going to slouch in her chair take as much space up as possible and relax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a girl, my brother was allowed to go to extra curricular clubs to further his education, I had 2 come straight home &amp; learn how 2 cook  As adults we worked at the same IT company, I was living alone &amp; independent, he still lived at home, dependent on my parents to cook for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is small but it bugs me Instead of saying "you sit like a man/woman" Try saying "you sit like a man/woman I know" It's more neutral and gets rid of gender stereotypes regarding a person's body language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugs me when people say to a person "you sit like *opposite gender of what they identify as* " As Seriously society has now got people sticking gender stereotypes on how someone sits on a freaking chair No that woman doesn't sit like a man, she sits the same way as a man u know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm jealous lol, you have clean sheets and I have my freakishly tall 2 year old who stole my bed so I'm banished to the foot of my bed like a freaking dog lmao. Sweet dreams and stay safe. 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen_Rowe @davidwalliams @RealMattLucas Lmao, that bit on little Britain freaked me out everytime it came on, reminded me of a few disturbing scenes from the horror film 'Grace' 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Yay they can pawn the treasure and use it to pay for the refit themselves and use the money they currently have for the refit to reimburse the tax payers instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good for you lol I love watching cartoons too I love The Simpsons, American Dad, Family Guy and Scooby Doo. Don't think anyone will ever be too old to enjoy cartoons. 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Yes I do I'm having support to get over my fear of being touched as can't even hug my loved ones without feeling panicked &amp; having support with my phobia of being intimate as everytime sex is mentioned on TV, media etc I feel sick, panicky and distressed #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat Over the Easter break I caught up on painting and painted pictures of my nightmares to help with my PTSD, I did an Easter egg hunt with my kid &amp; went to visit my youngest child's grave &amp; decluttered my bedroom.  Was very productive break lol #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I have eaten one as my beloved toddler keeps stealing my Easter eggs before I get chance to eat a full one 🐣🐤🐥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's brilliant! So so proud of you! You're awesome. 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to see my cousin today was an awesome surprise I love love love my cousin! I'm super happy today and keep smiling now I love my beautiful cousin to death. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People seem more bothered by Notre dame than Sri Lanka Notre dame was sad but it was an accident, it can be rebuilt &amp; was just material things that were destroyed no one died But Terrorist attack in Sri Lanka was deliberate, hundreds of people died &amp; lives have been destroyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The power of the binder and a horizontal striped shirt... My breasts are gone. Having a day where my chest dysphoria is driving me crazy so yeah feeling happier now. #bodypositivelgbtq  https://t.co/Y9gWywOOlo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorCeleb She's always on holiday without her kids anyway? Every other news article or interview with her she's been snapped on holiday with her current boyfriend. I haven't had a night off from parenting in nearly 2 years but hey ho that's part of being a parent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm happy got 2nd half of a painting finished today and did two other quick paintings so I'm happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person *sees me working on something* you ok? Me: yeah I'm busy Person: *5 minutes later* you sure you're okay? Me: yeah I'm just concentrating I'm busy Person: *5 minutes later* You sure you're okay you seem off? Me: yes! I'm just freaking concentrating Person: no need to snap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"dancing with the demon's in my head"  #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/XDOEP0I2Wq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"born Into heaven" Painted I did of my nightmare: In the nightmare it was all black and there was a small egg in the middle of the blackness and the egg was moving then the egg broke and out came my youngest child. #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/3hotPr65GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm listening to Ramones whilst I'm Painting. Put a Scooby Doo DVD on to keep my son occupied whilst he eats his sandwich and I relax. I love my being a parent but I've missed painting since he was born as I'm usually too exhausted to Paint when he's finally fell asleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The soul's great escape"  Painting I did of a nightmare I had where my soul was trying to escape through my eye whilst I was still alive &amp; the broken pieces of my pupil embedded in my face. Was disturbing. #mentalhealth #artistsontwitter  https://t.co/xju7gTraNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night, sweet dreams and stay safe 🌵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A man walks around with no shirt on &amp; his nipples showing... No one cares  A woman walks around with a sports bra or bikini top on with her nipples covered ... Everyone loses their minds branding her a slut.   Seriously what the actual f*ck society?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams You should go for it, Teresa May has already turned this country into a joke, at least your jokes would actually be funny and not leave people in poverty. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a relaxing day and try not to get sunburnt lol 🦖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slut shaming women for going out in revealing clothes during the summer is beyond stupid.  She's not dressed like a slut, she's dressed appropriately for the weather. I'd rather see a woman wearing a revealing outfit during summer than see her in a hospital bed with heat stroke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a man post "sun's out, sluts out"  No just no, it's the middle of a heatwave &amp; it's uncomfortably hot in the shade  So his post should say "Sun's out, so she's dressed in weather appropriate clothes to avoid heat stroke"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not ok 2 shame people who hav conditions that affect their periods, some conditions leave people bedridden, losing lots of blood, in agony &amp; a lifetime of medication to manage  Saying they're overreacting as women have been having period's for centuries isn't helpful at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my kids with all my heart and soul but I've missed painting since I became a parent as I rarely have the time but these past few days I've been painting have been amazing. Feel like myself again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Happy easter, hope you have a good day 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Easter to my wonderful followers hope you all have a safe and fun Easter and get to make the most of this sunshine we're having. #HappyEaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing a work out in this heat is killing me, can't stop sweating and feel like I could drink an ocean and still be thirsty but it'll be worth it in the end. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relationship advice: If you catch your partner ogling a woman in a revealing outfit or looking over a garden fence to watch the neighbours sunbathing instead of shouting at the woman for being dressed in a revealing outfit try telling your partner not to be a pervert instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Summer tip:  if you see a person sunbathing, Wearing a revealing outfit, Going for a stroll through nature or a park,  Having an alcoholic drink in the sunshine Please don't sexually harass, rape or cat call them. Just leave them be to enjoy the sunshine in peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning I am currently running on fumes due to lack of sleep thanks to somebody being an asshole so I'm off for a shower and debating whether or not to go out today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it's 1:03am just had a blazing row with my older brother and when I told him to stop stressing me out as it was going to make me have a stress bleed, he thought I was making up the condition for attention until it actually happened in front of him so he nearly fainted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun This is awesome traditional wedding cakes are overrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night, stay safe 🦇🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else see the #pinkmoon tonight? It's so beautiful it's bright orange I love it. Feel so lucky to have seen it normally it's extremely cloudy when we have things like this happen in the UK #PinkMoon  https://t.co/v3kI6hGnax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to have a black eye in time for Easter thanks to my toddler kicking me in the face when he had a random meltdown on the sofa next to me. Can't open my eye and my eyelid feels weird and eyes weeping. #GoodFriday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warm weather tip: Women are allowed to have body hair So if u see a woman with leg hair wearing shorts, keep ur dirty looks, nasty comments &amp; opinions to urself &amp; let her enjoy the sunshine It's not like she going to start shaving her legs in the middle of the street is she?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blazeymc91 I know but men can legally walk away from their parental responsibility if they want to and the mother has to go through the courts to get them to pay  child support when it shouldn't be that way it should be a legal requirement that men have to pay &amp; don't get to just walk away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because I live in the UK where I can get free legal abortions on the NHS doesn't mean I don't care about what's happening in America. Just because I have access to abortion I'm not going to stop fighting for women in the rest of the world who can't get safe abortions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before people start banning abortions they should enforce a law where legally the child's father has to pay half of all medical expenses for the pregnancy and birth, bet they wouldn't ban abortion if it was men getting billed for the cost of forcing the woman to carry to term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to realise about banning abortion: 1) most of the people enforcing abortion bans are cisgender men so will never need an abortion 2) banning abortion just stops safe abortions 3) care homes will be overcrowded as giving them up 4 adoption will be the only other choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inhighdemands Being equal in the relationship and willingness to compromise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd so love to see a ghost TV show where they see ghosts like this I'd laugh my ass off.  https://t.co/Q0uHbFLjLW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I envy my toddler every time they use the toilet everyone claps at their achievement at using the toilet instead of Pooping themselves But everytime I use the toilet no one cheers for me but someone shouts through the bathroom door to remind me to open the window afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brke90 @DailyMailUK Me too, the shops can only do so much to stop gender stereotyping the customers need to do their part as well if their daughter or son wants something that's stereotypically for a different gender just buy it them anyway instead of saying no because it's not gender appropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK I understand how this is sexist ... But there is a simple solution; why doesn't the person buy a girl a football cake if she wants a football cake and buy a pink cake for a boy if they want a pink birthday cake  I decorated my son's birthday cake with pink icing when he asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"BuT wHy DiDnt ThEy RePoRt It StRaIGHt AwAy tho?"  Well victim blamers this is one of the many reasons why rape victims don't always report it straight away they're scared of being killed for reporting the rape. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatsTheDebate @AbuseChat @malesurvivors They only class domestic abuse in a romantic relationship where I live if person's 16 or over which is harmful as teenagers who are younger than 16 are victims of abuse too, when was 14 a girl in my school was beat up by her boyfriend &amp; police classed it as bullying #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @malesurvivors Definition in where I live is Violence, sexual assault or controlling behaviour of someone your in a relationship with which covers relationships like family/romantic partners #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat @malesurvivors #abusetalk  https://t.co/ipHjPbVLEc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Completely agree Guys complaining only the good guys get friend zoned aren't good guys as good people don't become friends with someone just so they can sleep with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a nasty lump in my armpit that's had to be burst so it is bleeding quite a bit and is making my arm and breast burn so I'm under strict orders to take care of it as it heals to prevent infection in the wound. Ouch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People need realise that a person's mental health &amp; trauma is as individual as their finger print so it affects everyone differently, what might not seem so bad to one person can be devastating to another. So people need to stop treating it like a competition of who has it worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I know people need realise that a person's mental health is as individual as their finger print so it affects everyone differently, what might not seem so bad to one person can be devastating to another. It all depends on the person experiencing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I like to think I'm right lol, my eldest cat is a rescue and she's my support pet to cope with my PTSD she nuzzles me whenever I'm sad and wakes me up during night terrors by making a an annoying noise &amp; jumping up the door so the banging wakes me. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hate when people treat trauma like a competition as well. Had someone in a domestic abuse support group do it a few years ago and I ended up shouting at her in the middle of the group to stop trying to make my trauma less valid. It's annoying AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good Morning have a wonderful Wednesday and stay safe. I think the the weather's doesn't even know what it's doing today it's supposed to be hot and windy but it's freezing and weirdly still. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartyrsTweets  https://t.co/5AIJyyyknT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartyrsTweets Is it just me who sees a face in the smoke at the top right of the image?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else notice the faces in the smoke when the spire fell on #NotreDame ? I've circled them in this screenshot from the news footage.  https://t.co/zev2jhEzqa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night and stay safe. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Agreed I have a rescue dog and cats and they're all very affectionate and loving think they're just trying to prove how grateful they are for being given another chance at life. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Ramones whilst working out.  I'm sweating but a good playlist makes it worth whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It's exhausting but at least the house looks bare in a good way lol ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 2year old dancing to Living La Vida Loca is the funniest thing I have seen this year  I'm crying with laughter. I love my little weirdo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all the idiots posting transphobic comments about forcing their agenda on cats, his urethra was blocked it was a necessary life saving surgery. It's not like they voluntarily Gave their cat a sex change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a person waits 2 report a rape, people say "but it was in the past" When a person reports a rape straight away, people say "we can't destroy the rapists future" No1 cares that the memory of the rape will forever be part of the victims past &amp; How it'll affect their future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a great day. I have to give my home it's annual sort out which is going to be exhausting. I sort the entire house out every 4 months and still can't believe the amount of crap that I get rid of despite how spacious the house is it's decieving. Lol 🐧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Being hateful towards the LGBT+ community to please a God that might not even exist Makes about as much sense as boycotting Christmas to please the Easter Bunny. #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been proven all parts of the LGBT+ community do actually exist in humans &amp; in animals   It hasn't been proven that any God actually exists    So it's wrong to tell be hateful towards the LGBT+ community because it's against your religion.  #lgbt #Equality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Got Green Day up full blast  🎵🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok not to believe in:  Easter bunny Santa Claus Werewolves Big foot Mermaids  AS THESE DON'T EXIST  It's NOT okay not to believe in: Homosexuality Gender equality LGBT+ equality Genders outside the binary  AS THESE ACTUALLY EXIST &amp; DESERVE EQUAL RIGHTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Morning, I just woke up lol I slept through 5 alarms but can't complain as I finally had 8 solid hours of sleep. Hope you have a good day 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying you don't believe in homosexuality is the long way of saying you're homophobic  It's okay to say you don't believe in the Easter bunny as he doesn't exist But it's not okay to say you don't believe in love. #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews They don't believe in homosexuality is the long way of saying they're homophobic  It's okay to say they don't believe in the Easter bunny as he doesn't exist But it's not okay to say they don't believe in love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its not as easy for a parent to forgive someone's mistake:  the parent needs to think about their child's safety &amp; risk assess things to protect their child  So if a parent forgives someone &amp; they repeat the mistake &amp; their child gets hurt the parent could end up in legal trouble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tip: If someone was truly sorry for hurting you, they wouldn't repeat the action again and they definitely wouldn't try to justify hurting you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thyquaintwench I understand what you mean but I meant things like someone threatening to rape, abuse someone etc those kind of things they claim were heat of the moment when they're arrested. If that makes sense. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The excuse " it was said/done in the heat of the moment, they didn't think" isn't an excuse as it means the thought/action was already in their brain to begin with at some point and they slipped up when they got too blind by emotion to stop themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorWeirdNews Yay someone's finally spoke up about this as this part of the advert has always confused me I thought maybe it was to show that they won't damage tattoos but why not show someone shaving a leg tattoo to get that point across??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people use the excuse "but people change" when someone does something vile and "out of character"? I changed, I'm a different person to who I was 3 years ago but in no way did those changes give me the urge to abuse, rape or hurt someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person hurts me I spoke out about what happened, Person: the things you say are dangerous you need to learn to shut your mouth  Me: you're right I am dangerous...to people like you because you know when people find out what you did you'll lose everything.  #Metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People can hurt me as much as they want, Victim blame me as much as they want, Destroy my name &amp; reputation,  Have me branded a liar  But  I am not giving up, I'm still going to get up, dust myself off and fight for my dreams.  I AM NOT GIVING UP! I AM NOT DONE FIGHTING YET!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything that has happened the past few days - which quite frankly I think is the calm before the storm due to the aftermath of what's happened - has made me more determined than ever to push for my dreams as I'm not giving up on life due to a scumbag I'm not done fighting yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something horrific happened on Friday night, I reported the incident &amp; I was victim blamed, had smear campaign about me in my hometown by the perpetrator &amp; their family so now I've had to go onto emergency housing &amp; stay with family miles away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely freezing today there's ice on the ground lmao didn't stop me from meditating in the back garden though.

<|startoftext|>Good morning twitter followers how are you all today? #goodmorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a great day 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I've noticed: on #prochoice posts almost all of the pro life people who comment on them saying abortion is murder... Are cisgender men who will never be able to get pregnant therefore never be able to get an abortion...&amp; can legally walk away from anyone they impregnate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love exercise, I am dripping with sweat and in dire need of a lot of water but totally worth every second feel I so alive! #SelfCareSaturday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun She's just having a tantrum and honestly she already sounds like she was being a bridezilla so if she was that bothered about being upstaged by a pregnant woman why didn't she just uninvite her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peoples religion &amp; sexuality are both important but if ur religion expects u 2 choose between being #lgbt or being part of the religion then don't feel bad 4 choosing 2 walk away from your religion 2 be openly LGBT It isn't certain that God exists But Its certain that love exists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SK74469208 @PinkNews They're giving the whole Muslim community a bad name doing this by handing out leaflets saying it's not okay to be a gay Muslim. They're basically telling people to choose between their religion &amp; their sexuality which is why I left Islam years ago as I chose Love over religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews These protesters are giving the Muslim community a bad reputation which is doing more harm than good in the fight to end islamophobia as they're preaching homophobia which is extremely hypocritical expecting equal rights yet not wanting people to treat LGBT people equally<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Survivor tip: If someone ever threatens to rape you or someone else please please please tell someone and make a record of the threat.  It's better to report the incident and have people aware of what that person's said just in case they act on their threat. #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had the night from hell and feel completely numb emotionally from what's happened, my throat is hurting from shouting and my eyes burn from crying so much. Can't believe someone I trusted could stoop so freaking low as to make a sick threat against someone I care about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No matter how angry u are with someone, no matter how much u want to hurt them it is NEVER ok to threaten to rape them &amp; it's NEVER okay to threaten to rape someone they care about e.g family/kids/friends/pets etc Threatening to rape someone to hurt Someone's feelings is NEVER ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today: started off rough,  got a lot better,  went cuckoo in the middle, got a bit better  then ended up being a complete disaster and now I feel numb.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm so far in the closet (in real life) I'm practically in Narnia yet thought it would be a good idea to buy myself a mug with "if it's gay I'm in" printed on.

<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Breaks my heart when people do this as this happened to my rescue dog, the owners tied him to a lamppost and drove off, he was traumatised by it and took months of rehabilitation to make him accept we weren't going to abandon him, had him 9 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're LGBT+ and in the closet &amp; someone uses threatening to Out You to blackmail you... Please talk to someone u can trust to get help &amp; support to stop the blackmail. Whatever u do don't give the blackmailer what they want as their demands will escalate... Get help instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm convinced my cats are trying to give me a hernia as yesterday my eldest cat climbed on my back whilst I was doing press ups and today my youngest cat decided to jump on my abs whilst I was doing crunches.  So ouch ouch and yeah freaking ouch. #internationalpetday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @CG_Drummer Agreed if being drunk makes someone act like an asshole then they should stop drinking as i've never done anything like that when I've been drinking I just laugh a lot at really random things. 😶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CG_Drummer @AidenHatfield That's good that you're good. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not ignoring anyone just having my nails done so hands will be out of use for I'm bit, not having anything fancy done to my nails just my go to glossy black nail varnish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piercing_add1ct Beautiful ❤️ it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield @CG_Drummer Hate people like this in general but especially when they use the fact they've been drinking to excuse their behaviour as it's not an excuse. Hope she's okay and you're a good guy for helping resolve the situation, it's vile being on the recieving end of assholes like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Here is Prince Wispa after my kid had an epic meltdown and threw chocolate mousse at the oven and put my pillow case on the dog. He wasn't bothered by it lmao. 🐩  https://t.co/LFhcwLlezj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drives me nuts when people use the excuse "they were drunk" to excuse someone touching someone who's sober without consent but if the victim was drunk and the attacker was sober it's the victims fault for being drunk. I hate this victim blaming mentality. #MeToo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do religious people think telling LGBT+ people they'll go to hell for being LGBT+ is a bad thing? Sending lGBT+ people 2 a place that's hot &amp; filled with other LGBT+ people sounds more like heaven.  They really want 2 punish them send them 2 heaven its cloudy &amp; full of bigots<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been having a lot of people complain to me about Morrisons supermarket staff being nasty to customers especially since Christmas &amp; it's because sales are down so they're laying off staff &amp; the staff are taking it out on the customers, so be careful if you go in their stores.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the joys of being a goth is that when it rains and my makeup runs instead of ruining my makeup it just adds drama to my look. Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my gosh my 2 year old is break dancing in the the middle of the living room.  I'm crying with laughter. There was no music on or anything apparently he just felt like break dancing because why not? Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just putting this out there kids don't care about their parents genders, sexualities, whether they're unemployed or not, whether their parents a goth, whether their parents have a disability etc, kids just care that their parents are nice to them, take care of them and love them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things I get asked a lot: Does ur gothic makeup scare ur kid? No  Does ur sexuality confuse ur kid? No   Does it bother ur kid that ur a single parent? No ... My kid doesn't care about any of that they just care that I cut the crusts of their grilled cheese sandwich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God gave Eve leaves 2 cover her modesty, In almost all pictures of Eve, only Eves genitals are covered but her breasts aren't, so proof even God didn't see Breasts as a sexual object  Just going 2 point this out next time a man uses the Bible to justify sexualising breastfeeding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night my lovely followers sweet dreams and stay safe tonight #goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Consenting out of "compromise" isn't consent  ... Which basically means consenting to trying a sex act once that you don't want to do as a compromise with your partner to get your partner to stop pestering you to try it #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irritates when people say life isn't tough for teens &amp; people in their 20's as life hasn't even began 2 screw them over Life can be tough for anyone of any age.

<|startoftext|>I feel bad for LGBT+ people who's family are only Supportive For Show Basically when their family pretend to be supportive of them when they're trying to impress someone but behind closed doors are verbally abusive &amp; unaccepting of them. It's worse in a way as it's a head ****<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror There are more important issues in the world than chocolate ducks that are only going to be sold for another few weeks until Easter is over.

<|startoftext|>Self care tip: take care of urself If u want the grass to be greener on ur side, take the time to water it &amp; tend to it so u can smell the flowers that grow in it. If u fertilise it with **** no matter how beautiful the flowers are that grow in it all u will smell is ****<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's wisdom: Grass is always greener on the other side for 2 reasons; 1) the person waters the grass &amp; takes care of it Or 2) they've fertilised it with s***   My point: if u want ur life to be better; take time to actually take care of it instead of filling it with bull****<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lez_Lover22 Meeeee 🦄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Good on him, That burger looks delicious I love pickles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot wait until Easter is over so I can have a year where I don't have to have this conversation with my kid: Me: "You can't have your Easter egg" Kid: "why not?" Me: "because it's not Easter yet!!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eurgh People moan about being friendzoned &amp; complain about how all the good people are put in the friend zone Yet The fact they're moaning about that proves they aren't a good person as a good person wouldn't pretend to be friends with someone just so they can have sex with them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScoFu22 @JohnOberg The water is murky, dull and a weird colour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK This is whats wrong with society idiots don't think before they act The passengers stopped this guy being deported simply because he was being deported but never thought maybe there was a valid reason at to why he was being deported in the first place. He deserves to be deported<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnOberg The water the fish are swimming in looks stagnant and I bet it stinks revolting it looks like it has a rancid sweet stench to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah what #piersmorgan is doing is blatantly transphobic as he's deliberately trying to make a mockery out of transgender people and invalidate their gender by pretending to identify as something we can clearly see he's not as a joke. #lgbt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun Good for her, giving birth is a terrifying, physically &amp; mentally draining experience so she should do it in a way that makes her feel the most comfortable in that situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Self care tip: when writing in your journal, use different colour gel pens &amp; assign a feeling to the colours so when you write in your journal you can keep track of your feelings. E.g. write in; blue ink when you're sad Green when you're happy, Red when you're angry...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun What a scumbag, she went through hell and back, blamed herself for not being able to get pregnant and he never once thought it would be a good idea to tell her the truth? She deserves better than a liar, he knew she was trying to get pregnant so he had enough chances to tell her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when people tell women that if they Pretty much do anything that goes against the female stereotype they won't get a man ... Instead we should tell women that they shouldn't change who they are to find love &amp; anyone who says otherwise isn't worth being with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons mum/parent shaming pics &amp; videos are wrong: 1) its creepy that a stranger videoed/photographed a parent &amp; child &amp; uploaded it to the internet without consent 2) if they're so concerned about the child they'd send the footage to police &amp; CPS not post it online for "likes"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woman at the gym to another woman: aren't you worried that you won't find a man because of how much you work out?  Me interrupts: if a man's masculinity is so fragile he won't date a woman for having muscles &amp; being physically strong then she's better off without him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Self care tip: make sure you wear comfortable work out clothing, when you're exercising, it'll help you stay motivated when you're exercise as it kills your motivation when you're exercising when you have irritating seams, uncomfortable straps &amp; itchy tags on clothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun How can he seriously expect anyone to trust a word him or his wife says?  Hes saying he regrets what he's done but he could easily be lying his ass off to gain entry into the country so he can do a terror attack.  No country should allow them citizenship they're not wort the risk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thursday has been a load of **** My friend's mom has been rushed into a&amp;e, I've got a nasty injury to my foot and my toddler has slipped over &amp; had a bang to the head.  At least I have chocolate ice cream in the freezer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My toddler is being currently being checked for a concussion as he just randomly went out like a light within minutes of his slipping over and I'm currently having my foot checked for signs of nerve damage &amp; broken bones as I have numbness &amp; tingling in my injured foot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So within the past hour my beloved toddler injured my foot so my pinky toe is badly bruised with a small but deep cut across it &amp; my entire leg's gone numb  Also my toddler had a violent meltdown &amp; threw their drink across the floor &amp; slipped in it &amp; hit their head on the floor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Not sure if he's saying this out of protest against Brunei's anti gay laws,  because he's a bigot and it'll get a load of gay people executed or because he wants an excuse to have a gay orgy so he can join in "out of protest"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline My cat does this it's so cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deYook That is the campest thing I've ever seen. Seems like he's taking out his own issues with homosexuality out on the LGBT+ community in Brunei and using religion as an excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More people need to understand that 6 weeks pregnant is just a period being 2 weeks late and not the pregnant person actually knowing they're pregnant for those 6 weeks.  Most pregnant People don't find out they're pregnant until around the 5-6 week mark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugs me when people say to me "you don't need to wear makeup you look good without it" As yeah I know I don't NEED to wear makeup I wear it because I WANT to wear makeup and yeah i know I look good without makeup, I have a strict skin care routine I follow.

<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror I'm against fat shaming but it's cruel to have someone of any body shape ride a donkey in the first place let alone someone who's overweight &amp; could do severe damage to the animal from a single ride.

<|startoftext|>Cardi B admitting drugging people &amp; people are comparing her to Bill Cosby - yes there's a huge difference between raping someone &amp; robbing someone but drugging someone is still a vile thing to do regardless of the genders of the perpetrator &amp; the victims &amp; their motive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saddgay Hi need more followers, I follow back, I just mainly blog about my life and thoughts etc  https://t.co/sCiSvVb59P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People say to LGBT+ people "it's just a phase it'll pass" but no one ever says that to heterosexual people because as a society we've been brainwashed to believe that being a heterosexual cisgender person is the default setting for people &amp; being anything else is abnormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when People say to LGBT+ people "it's just a phase it'll pass eventually" When no it's not just a phase but the fact you think it's just a phase is proof that you've been brainwashed by society to believe that heterosexuality isn't a phase but being LGBT+ is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdventureOfMoto @MetroUK Stuart definitely I love Stuart, he's so harmless and loveable and taken for granted by people he deserves happiness he's an awesome character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdventureOfMoto @MetroUK It's not the fact he cheated that annoyed me so much it's the fact he bitched and whined about being alone and no one loving him throughout the show before that, then he meets someone cheats then bitch &amp; whines about being alone &amp; giving up so wants an arranged marriage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R4M21598724 @MetroUK Yeah probably would do that but kind of hope he doesn't as he's a cheat and a creep and lost all respect for Raj after he cheated on Emily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how people think it's morally wrong to teach kids about LGBT+ issues but think there's nothing wrong with shoving heterosexuality &amp; gender stereotypes down kids throats from birth so much that kids feel ashamed of being anything other than a heterosexual cisgender person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews I love how people think it's morally wrong to teach kids about LGBT+ issues but think there's nothing wrong with shoving heterosexuality &amp; gender stereotypes down kids throats from birth so much that kids feel ashamed of being anything other than a heterosexual cisgender person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK He really didn't think joining a violent terror group in a country that's been destroyed by said terror group would be that bad? Was he living under a rock and not watching the news before he joined?  https://t.co/pTZ7Q5TSh1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK I don't want Raj to have a happy ending. He's a jerk, he spent all those years alone struggling to speak to women &amp; when he finally gets past those issues he cheated on the first decent woman he met. I lost respect for his character after that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R4M21598724 @MetroUK How predictable the show is I wouldn't be surprised or penny has an unplanned pregnancy and a sudden change of heart about becoming a mom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AprilFools day tip: Sexuality and gender identity isn't a joke So Playing a prank &amp; pretending to come out as lgbt+ isn't funny at all as Many people who are #lgbt  are disowned by family, face violence, hate crime homelessness &amp; death simply for coming out so it's not a joke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Convinced my toddler has been a nightmare today as a secret #mothersday test like: Buys me a "best mum ever" mug then thinks "hmmm let's put this to the test to see if you really are the best mum ever and see how far I can push you to see if you'll actually snap mwahaha"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #Mothersday2019 and my toddler has been an absolute nightmare all day so I'm guessing their main mothers day gift to me was to reveal their true identity as the antichrist.  👿👿👿👿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyWanders @DailyMirror Agreed, the comments are revolting and cruel this is a child who's confused and upset and needs support to cope, they don't need to be bullied online &amp; have people play the blame game &amp; blame their parents.

<|startoftext|>Reason I won't smack my kid no matter how naughty or violent they're being: I don't see the logic in using violence to teach my child that violence is not okay.   It makes as much sense as trying to put out a fire with petrol, it won't help at all &amp; just makes it worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in a society where people think it's ok to force heterosexuality down peoples throats from the moment they're born by dressing boys in t-shirts that say "ladies man" etc yet think educating a child that its okay to be something other than heterosexual is a bad thing #LGBT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People who say they're not homophobic they just don't want children learning about LGBT+ people and equality... Are homophobic as they're basically saying that they don't hate LGBT+ people as long as people aren't taught to accept them. #LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews So these protesters say they're not homophobic they just don't want children learning about being LGBT+ people and equality? Yeah they're homophobic as they're basically saying that they don't hate LGBT people as long as children aren't taught to accept them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Honestly Could see this coming off but still an important storyline as it's more common than people realise for people who self harm to get sepsis and fear of getting sepsis is what motivates some people who self harm to seek help.

<|startoftext|>Parents are getting concerned about teaching about safe sex in LGBT+ relationships in sex education lessons as well as hetero sex as it's "not appropriate"  They shud b concerned in making sure they're taught about safe sex, contraception, STDs &amp; consent; regardless of sexuality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people think teaching people about LGBT+ in sex education lessons will magically turn them LGBT+? When I was in school my sex ed teacher put a condom on a banana &amp; 10yrs later I still have no desire to put a condom on a banana or any other phallic shaped fruit or vegetable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews There has to be something seriously wrong with a parent who's so anti-lgbt they're willing to actually disrupt their child's education just to stop their child learning about equality and acceptance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews Thank you Sarah Hewitt-clarkson 👏👏👏👏 if more school across the world had programmes like No Outsiders on the curriculum more LGBT+ would grow up knowing they are normal instead of wishing they were normal because they'd only been taught about heterosexuality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews We need schools 2 teach kids on being LGBT+ as it'll help normalise it, if I'd been taught on LGBT+ when I was in school I wouldnt have attempted suicide &amp; been in denial about my sexuality as long as I did as I would've known how I felt was normal instead of wishing I was normal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Life tip: Self care should come before social media.  If you want to take a break from social media for however long you need to, then do so, don't let anyone make you feel guilty for not replying to them straight away etc, your self care is more important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You literally cannot win when you're a parent.

<|startoftext|>@PinkNews They're giving the homophobes what they want.

<|startoftext|>50 shades of grey franchise is basically a romanticised Law &amp; Order episode as it's story of a sexual sadist with mommy issues who grooms a naïve sexually inexperienced woman who eventually develops Stockholm syndrome &amp; willingly starts a family with her abuser.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts I know especially that part in the book where she was sunbathing topless so as jealous revenge her covered her torso in love bites so she was forced to completely cover up.

<|startoftext|>When you meet someone who also thinks the 50 Shades of Grey franchise are glorified domestic abuse, promote rape culture &amp; are a toxic inaccurate portrayal of BDSM &amp; dom-sub culture.  https://t.co/AWbelboMiD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts Eurgh I know, BDSM is a deeply intimate act that builds trust and emotional connections between partners it's about mutual pleasure in pain not one sadist with mommy issues hurting the other as much as possible.

<|startoftext|>Parents: slut shaming ur kids 4 havin thrush/BV is extremely harmful.

<|startoftext|>People need to stop slut shaming people for having thrush or bacterial vaginosis.

<|startoftext|>Bugs me when people judge my parenting ability because my child is raised on a vegan diet because eating "just vegetables" isn't healthy... Then they complain when their Omni kids won't eat their vegetables. #vegan #plantbased #veganparenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts This is why I hate the 50 shades franchise, it's 50 shades of domestic abuse, rape culture and toxic inaccurate portrayals of BDSM/dom-sub relationships. It teaches people that jealousy is a compliment. If it was set on a council estate it'd be a law &amp; order episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people immediately assume a woman is pregnant because they've told their child not to hit them in the stomach? Like seriously women still want to protect their internal organs even when they're not pregnant &amp; teach their kid not to hit people #ToddlerLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't you just love when someone goes around preaching hate &amp; claims it's freedom of speech when they're called out on it...

<|startoftext|>Shrek life lesson  Sometimes life takes u down a completely different path to what u thought it would be to get to ur happy ending but the happy ending u get is better than the one u imagined.  Fiona thought she'd Marry a prince instead she got Shrek &amp; an even better happy ending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastaughKaren72 @AidenHatfield I know would cool if I he could do Wolverhampton would make my life easier as it's local I'd save money on train fair lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks Could be Martine's dad? As Louis did screw over both Martine and Simone and their dad did see how devastated Simone was when Louis didn't come back? Would also explain why the caller wanted Breda to steal from price slice and why she was caught in the act so easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of saying to a survivor of an abusive relationship: "You weren't together that long so it wasn't that bad"  Instead say   "You weren't together that long but it was still bad"   The first phrase diminishes the abuse. The alternative acknowledges it was bad regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Survivor of abuser tip: there is no set time frame you had to be in the abusive situation for to make the abuse valid. Whether you escaped after the first incident, whether it lasted weeks, months or years it's still valid as abuse there isn't a time frame. #abusetalk #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivacampaigns Have I died and gone to heaven? I was a bit anxious about this year being my first Easter vegan but this post is giving me hope that maybe I won't miss out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts Spring is in the air and I have the flu so been stuck indoors looking out the window at the sunshine with puppy dog eyes. The flu sucks lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herbivore_club I love this post, Next time anyone takes the piddle out of me for eating slowly and savoring my food I can just say "sorry I'm eating like a pig" and just bask in the glow of their confusion. 🐷🐖🐽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Thank you for being here too your tweets are weirdly positive which is a breath of fresh air amongst the negative ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobbydazzler29 @DailyMirror Oh yeah it's definitely a good thing as it's hard for her to lie her way back in when she lacks the inability to think before she speaks, it's just more amusing in a twisted way to see what BS she'll say next as it's like "did she seriously just say that?!" Whenever she speaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents blamed last night's passing out incident on my vegan lifestyle turned out veganism had nothing to do with it, my migraine attacks I've been having for 10 years longer than I've been vegan caused it. The flu &amp; migraine medication don't work well together #vegan #health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline I'm pro choice and even I think She's gone too far. If she didn't want kids that bad she should've used contraception and looked into sterilisation to see if she'd be eligible to be sterilised. 17 in 6 years is reckless under these circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror She really isn't helping herself when she says these things is she? i think her ego is blocking out her common sense in the small part of her brain that's supposed to control what she actually says out loud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Currently have this song going through my head now.  Too little too late for an apology she should've apologised years ago and she's only apologising now not because she's sorry but because she thinks it's what the UK wants to hear.  https://t.co/jTY5QVYOe8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear survivors of rape and abuse  It wasn't your fault you didn't know they were an abuser or rapist when you met them, they didn't have a neon sign over their head saying abuser or rapist did they? No So it wasn't ur fault  Sincerely someone who's been victim blamed too. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A victim blamer commented on one of my Instagram posts about #domesticviolence  "Maybe your mistake was dating an abuser?" Wrong just wrong my mistake wasn't dating an abuser... My exes mistake was abusing me. #Metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews She wants sympathy as she was just a housewife? There are millions of housewives across the globe who do not agree with beheading people or extremism, anyone who agrees with beheading someone doesn't deserve sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me who thinks that Joey didn't get a happy ending like everyone else in FRIENDS? Phoebe got married, Rachel &amp; Ross got back together, Monica &amp; Chandler adopted twins &amp; moved away and Joey ended up alone &amp; even in the spin off series he was alone. #fantheory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror She's a traitor who abandoned the country she was born in to start a family with the terror group who have been attacking us but yeah the UK is so vile &amp; mean because we don't want that traitor back here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkNews The LGBT+ flag is already Inclusive of everyone regardless of skin colour however this is a good flag for those who want to show that they're LGBT of colour like how we have the LGBT flag but can still get flags that represent just lesbian/trans/etc pride individually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent I honestly think this is brilliant it's more like political art and almost satirical than offensive.  It seems like something that would be quite popular if featured in an art gallery he should do an art exhibition based on corruption.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When I was with my abuser he tried 2 convince me &amp; others I was mentally unstable so our baby would be put in care at birth so he could get out of being a father, he even tried 2 convince me I'd blacked out during a "schizophrenic episode" &amp; agreed to give up my baby #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#saturdaysecret time: my ex tried to convince me I had schizophrenia by telling me things like animals/people etc weren't there &amp; I was hallucinating when I wasn't he did this hoping he would convince me &amp; others I was unstable so our baby would be put in care at birth #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaBaboon @knittastically @guardian We like the taste of the food items just not the cruelty, environmental damage, health damage etc so the vegan alternatives give us the tastes we like without the cruelty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Violife #vegan cheese sucks in taste and the packaging is a nightmare to get into but Tesco's vegan cheese is amazing especially their vegan cheese with chillis in it's spicy &amp; melts nicely on a grilled cheese. Some brands are bad but some are good like with all products<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MetroUK The baby is innocent but she went to Syria with the intention of marrying an extremist and having a family with him as much as I hate saying this as the baby is an innocent life but she made a choice to start a family in Syria, she's to blame for the consequences of her actions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hi guys I'll be uploading another short vlog to my YouTube channel later just addressing the survivor shaming issue that there's an unwritten dress code stereotype that Survivors need to abide by. #abusetalk #survivorofabuse #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're promoting female empowerment by havin female humans strip female animals of their reproductive rights &amp; subjecting the animals 2 abuse &amp; death? It's not female empowerment it's teaching females it's ok 2 hurt other females if they're a different species #Vegan #februdairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian She doesn't deserve to be able to prove herself. She was born in the UK &amp; she abandoned the UK to support a terrorist group who are attacking the very country she was born and raised in. She's a traitor and she lost her right for a second chance the moment she got on that plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is beautiful in their own way Everyone is smart in their own way Everyone is talented in their own way.  So embrace your own intelligence, beauty and talents rather than tearing down someone else's because they're different to yours. #ThursdayMotivation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning hope you have a good Thursday i've been up since 3:30am well I was up earlier than that but 3:30 is when I gave up trying to sleep lol. I need to feel less sick very fast as this lack of sleeping &amp; eating sucks. Lmao x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror I think it's perfectly justified she lost her citizenship she MADE THE CHOICE to leave the UK to go to Syria and is still defending what she did even when she tried to argue as to why she thinks should be let back in the UK. She's not sorry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do people treat periods like they are shameful? Periods are just nature's pregnancy tests, sometimes they're positive, sometimes they're negative &amp; sometimes you get a false reading and pregnancy tests aren't shameful therefore periods aren't shameful. #periodtalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people seem so shocked &amp; confused when an abuse/rape survivor wears a skirt/shorts/dress/crop top etc? Like seriously survivors don't have to cover themselves up from top to toe if they don't want to it's not a dress code they can show some skin too. #abusetalk #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drives me nuts when people say "you don't dress like you are a abuse/rape survivor" like seriously there isn't a dress code that all people who've survived rape/abuse have to adhere to, survivors can dress how they want to there isn't a freaking dress code. #abusetalk #MeToo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbuseChat I experienced it badly, I escaped the abuse when I was pregnant &amp; a doctor asked me "if the abuse was that bad why didnt you get an abortion I know I would have" I also get treated like a social outcast for not knowing about my abusers past before we got together.

<|startoftext|>What is wrong with Laurie? Sinead looks stunning how should've been telling her how beautiful she looks not making her feel like dirt. #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mental health can affect a person's periods as the stress, anxiety etc can cause the period to be later than normal, be earlier than normal, cause it to be heavier/lighter than normal, more erratic etc which can cause the person to become anaemic &amp; affect ovulation #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil Signed. I had an eating disorder as a teenager as I was always seeing celebs advertising these diet plans etc and I wanted to be "beautiful" like them them. When I'm happy with my weight now thanks to healthy eating &amp; exercise instead of dangerous dieting fads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK If only she loved her own child that much. How could see put a temporary relationship over the safety of her own baby she created and grew inside her for 9months and was supposed to love for the rest of her life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend told me that People need to realise there's a difference between a bitch and a diva. A bitch is someone who's bitchy in all styles of clothing. A diva is someone's who a bitch only in designer clothes.  Why does this actually make sense to me? #friendship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay want to thank everyone for being so wonderful on my Instagram at my first attempt of making a live video and for the positive feedback. I know it's just a small short video of a close up of my sequinned dress swishing but still thank you #ilovemyfollowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 I know it sucks I hate the human race the world would be a better place if people were just nice to each other and told the truth x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllyMursgirl42 Ditto. I hate when people do this and I hate when people suddenly decide to accuse someone of racism to make the victim come across as even worse. As calling someone a liar is one thing but falsely accusing them of racism is another thing. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toxic person: u tell them xwhat I said I'll tell them ur a liar &amp; get everyone else to say ur lying too. Victim: *tells someone*  Toxic person &amp; peers : *rehearse story &amp; say victims lying*  Person victim told: sorry their story contradicts urs ur a liar Victim: *not surprised*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying I live my life by is: "The Truth Will Always Be The Truth Even If No One Believes It." I live by this phrase so even when people call me a liar to try to save their own ass I still grin like a Cheshire cat as they're saying it as I know I'm telling the truth. #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when narcissistic people do something wrong then get their loved ones and colleagues to lie and defend them so the victim comes across as the liar and comes off as even worse and more twisted than the narcissist originally hoped. #narcissist #abuse #corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having an identity crisis after experiencing trauma is much more common than people realise. The trauma kills off a part of the person you were before the trauma happened, it's completely normal to have an identity crisis it doesn't make you a bad person #recovery #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield My brains still like "whut heh?" Lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I left the abuse I didn't know who I was anymore, the person I used to be didn't exist anymore &amp; I struggled to remember them. I'd look at old photos of myself &amp; it felt like looking at a stranger &amp; no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't find the memories #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friday whoop whoop which means time to party lol or if you're a parent Friday night is the same as any night except the kids get a later bedtime lmao. Hope you all have a safe and fun weekend and I love and appreciate you all. #TGIF #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun way to start the day been keeping in contact with the woman who I saw get verbally attacked on Wednesday and with the help of the store reviewing CCTV footage it's been made apparent it was simply caused by pure jealousy by the attacker towards the victim #exhausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is getting weird now; yesterday it felt like summer how warm it was, now the sun's rising before 8am &amp; yesterday I saw lot's of bees and daisies on the grass during our picnic. It's feeling like summer not winter. #Weather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror She's really going to milk this cow until it's dead isn't she? If it had been someone who wasn't royalty or in the media who did it I doubt she'd care this much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superdrugmobile I'm single but I celebrated with my single friends we do a secret valentine where we choose a friend's name at random and buy them a valentine's Day present and we exchange gifts on valentine's Day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnmarsSarah Good night. 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK They look pale as **** I kind of think that maybe they should just stop doing that before they end up anaemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friend: how'd your valentine's Day go? Me: well I spent last night lying in bed taking a BuzzFeed quiz to find out what type of hotdog I am.  Friend: oh so???? Me: yeaaaahhhhh  #HappyValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I don't know how to mentally process this pic of you lmao.  😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams Happy valentine's Day to you and your cute dog ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It was it was really warm today so I got to walk around with my coat off which was fun as the sun made my dress sparkle, I just kind of wish I'd put my flat shoes in my bag as running round in six inch heels in a park killed my feet. Lmao. Hope your day was fun. 👠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I spent the day with my friends and my son having a picnic up the park. Was fun. Hope you have fun today 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does valentine's Day bring out all the sleeze balls and creeps? seriously dude my eyes are up here, no I don't want a vodka cranberry not all women like them, I don't want your number &amp; dude I wouldn't want to go on a date with you any other day of the year #ValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 2 year old son accidentally kicked me in the face and badly bruised my cheek. I have a big ass bruise already forming on my face. #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The weather's so summery today feels more like Middle of May instead of middle of February #weatherwestmidlands #ValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It feels like summer today so decided to have a spontaneous picnic in the park. It's so much fun #spontaneous #Weathercloud #weatheruk #walsall #ValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Valentines day isn't always a joyous occasion for every1 especially if they're in an abusive relationship so to everyone spending valentine's Day with their abuser...Don't give up hope as one day you will have a valentine's Day that's filled with joy &amp; free from abuse #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I hope so too I went outside the box with my outfit with top to toe blue sequins as meh easy way to stand out when everyone else is wearing red or pink lmao. I look like a mermaid I'm happy. Lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Easier said than done when the dumbasses work and own the local shops I have to do my shopping in lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shelby13754438 @AidenHatfield Thank you and meh Easier said than done as 2 years on the housing list and the only flat that I've been offered still had up the police tape from a murder but would be available to live in after the trial ended. So yeah wasn't accepting that flat lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My valentine's Day outfit I decided to go right outside the box as everyone's wearing red and pink today so I made a statement in blue sequins which has been very well received amongst my followers and loved one. #ValentinesDay  https://t.co/2dGn5hnpao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you all have a wonderful valentine's Day and stay safe and if you hook up use contraception as an unplanned pregnancy isn't an ideal valentine's Day present #pregnancy #valentinesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy valentine's Day my lovely followers, uploading a #valentinesselfie #ValentinesDay  https://t.co/qWlf3vzdhY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When u take ur issues out on someone it doesn't just affect that person, it effects everyone else around them from the people they tell about what u did to the people who witnessed what u did and the people they tell. So next time ur angry don't take it out on someone #life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning and happy valentine's Day have a fun day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy valentine's Day my lovely people and if you're not celebrating today then good morning and I hope you have a wonderful Thursday. #goodmorning #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mental health doesn't just affect a person's mental health it affects their physical health too by affecting how well their body works in general but can also cause insomnia or over sleeping which is harmful or over eating or not eating enough which is also harmful #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I'm always nice to people but I live in a community full of bisexual hating, single parent hating, victim blaming people so literally get pushed to my limit at not ripping someone's head off every time I leave my home. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancesW05 @AbuseChat And homelessness. It was all hell when I escaped but seeing how happy my son is now I wouldn't change a thing as every second of misery lead to the greatest joy of my beautiful son being in a safe home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onedayisurvived Thank you and it really was hard as I was forced to be a stereotypical woman so it made me feel dysphoria as I started loathing my own female anatomy as I was being forced into gender roles and not given the freedom to express my feminity in my own way. If that makes sense? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fear of starting over after escaping abuse is so hard &amp; the recovery isn't pretty as there's; victim blaming, ignorant dumbasses, courts cases, mental health issues, legal appointments etc to deal with but in the long run leaving is the best thing you'll ever do #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no regrets leaving my abuser was the best thing I ever did but I h8 the stigma behind domestic abuse victims &amp; societies attitudes towards them, I get disrespected for it by random people, had to fire 2 ignorant health visitors, report a GP &amp; avoid certain shops #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something difficult after escaping the abuse was that I feel like an outcast in my community as people disrespect me still because they don't understand how didn't I know about my exes violent twisted past before it was too late. I hate victim blaming. #abusetalk #DomesticAbuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no sympathy for Liam he's a pain in the butt so honestly think mercedes could do better than liam but I also think sylver could do better than mercedes. #hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piddles me off when shop assistants are having a bad day so decide to take it out on the customers as I always politely tell them:  "If your job is making you this nasty I can happily have a word with your boss &amp; you won't have a job making you a bitch anymore" #grindsmygears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being bisexual in a town like the 1 I live in is hell &amp; as I always dress immaculately means I stand out like a sore thumb so means I'm a very easy target for assholes to take their problems out on. Moving away will be scary but a fresh start is needed. #wednesdaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>❤️ the town I live in but think I need to move significantly further away then originally planned as I just don't belong in this town anymore I don't fit it in at all it's like being a stranger which annoyingly means I attract drama like flies to poop as I'm an easy target #life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharing a secret with u all: after leavin an abusive relationship I developed gender dysphoria as he forced me to fit the female stereotype so much it made me hate myself for being a woman so I started having gender dysphoria. It passed after a year #abusetalk #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Wednesday my lovely bunch of followers hope you have all had a good day #selfie #wednesdaythoughts  https://t.co/oHCnZ1gimN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield People are assholes at times literally have nothing better to do than insult others because they're bored with their own pathetic lives x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's been a disaster I witnessed a random woman with a child get verbally attacked by an angry shop assistant who was just in a bad mood. Was vile I followed the woman &amp; made sure she was okay, she's traumatised by it still can't believe what happened #Wednesday #bullying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It worked very well, been getting the last of my stuff for valentine's Day so needed to get out early lol I'm excited hehe 🦄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important point of the day: don't let jealousy dictate how you treat people. If you're feeling jealous of someone tearing them down won't make you feel better in the long run, so just talk to them about how you feel &amp; why, you'll feel so much better for it #MentalHealth #selfcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life hack: set the Tune on your alarm on your mobile phone to sounded like a smoke alarm or burglar alarm. Guaranteed nothing will get you out of bed faster in the morning. #lifehack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life hack: wear a stretchy boob tube or strapless spanx under a strapless dress or shirt and discretely pin your dress/shirt to it. It'll stop your dress/shirt constantly slipping down so you won't spend half your night pulling it back up. #lifehack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning, wehey I actually got up early today mainly because I set my alarm to sound like a smoke alarm going off so yeah nothing gets me out of bed faster than thinking the smoke alarms going off. Lmao it worked though. 🦄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LGBT_updates Amen to this. I used to feel ashamed going to church because I'm bisexual I expected my feet to burn or be shunned by the pastor but he didn't care he welcomed me with open arms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning you lovely people I hope you have and fun and safe Wednesday and happy valentine's Day EVE lol.  Yes I know I'm up early today that's what happens when you set the tune on your alarm to sound like a smoke alarm lmao #GoodMorningWorld<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When it comes to recovery, it takes time, it's a long slow process it doesn't just happen over night or at the click of your fingers.

<|startoftext|>Laurie definitely has a type doesn't he? Sienna and Sinead look similar and even their names are similar. Hmm he's still a creep regardless though #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate Laurie, he's blatantly behaving inappropriately with sienna then going round telling everyone Sinead is crazy when she confronts him. I feel so bad for Sienna and Sinead theyre both being played off against each other #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to get my eyebrows waxed they look so scruffy 😭 #ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I did actually, I felt high I was so relaxed afterwards lnao and my skins silky smooth and glowing now so I keep stroking my skin lol. I love a good bubble bath and a meditation session 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I know, still not worth the risk though lol I'm mysterious 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Love this. I had a candlelit bubble bath last night and meditated in it was so relaxing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liberty_chasing @MailOnline Our kids make us proud as society tries to instill these BS theories like single moms raise obese kids and our kids prove it's BS. Kids are tenacious little mites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I never tell people my goals in life until I've achieved it or at least got through the hardest steps in achieving it so no one can try to discourage me. I've noticed when people aren't happy with their own life they try to stop others achieving their own dreams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liberty_chasing @MailOnline I know we are. I've been raising my son alone since I was pregnant and my son is a fitness mad little monkey who rarely stays still and loves joining in when I'm doing my workout and he's always dancing whenever a song comes on he turns any floor into a dancefloor. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is it humid today? It's supposed to be winter and I'm sweating like a pig in heat. #weather #sweating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline Bullsh*t. I'm a single mom and my son's not obese he has a freaking six pack which freaks his health visitor out. He's always on the go and we go to the park at least once a week, has weekly football lessons &amp; is always on the go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The parents need to be arrested and charged with a hate crime as they're protesting against a person's identity and sexuality which is disgusting &amp; wrong.

<|startoftext|>The female/trans man reproductive system isn't gross, Yes periods, cervical mucus, PMS, ovulation is messy &amp; not exactly fun but vaginas, cervixs, uteruses every part of its still beautiful as they create, grow and deliver a human into the world which is something beautiful #life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person : your child is so beautiful. Me: thank you I made them.  Please tell me I'm not the only parent who says this when people compliment their kid? I made my kid I take pride in what I created with my body lol #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do men think pregnancy means 9 months of sex? No! Pregnancy means 9 months of swollen breasts, ligament pains, aches, nausea, heartburn, mood swings, vomiting, exhaustion, change to bowel movements, frequent urination &amp; sex if they actually feel in the mood for it #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent This is just stupid. Being vocal and public about how dangerous it is will discourage more people from doing it during pregnancy. People aren't demonizing these women who do it they're looking out for the welfare of the unborn baby.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chazbeast @AidenHatfield Don't know why this made me laugh, sorry. ,😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a hellish optic migraine last night so I used a placebo effect on myself.

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Very good morning, have an awesome Tuesday. I'm in s super happy mood as I learned last night it's possible to use a placebo affect on myself to cure a migraine &amp; actually worked. So I feel happy and refreshed. 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll reply to everyone's message and replies in the morning but right now I'm so exhausted I feel dizzy so it's bed time for me.  Good night, sleep tight and stay safe and speak to you all in the morning. #goodnight #ilovemyfollowers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cannot decide between four outfits to wear on valentine's Day I'm so stumped! I hate this I'm leaving it up to my Instagram followers to decide I've posted a description of each outfit and they can pick whether I should wear 1, 2, 3 or 4 #ValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay valentine's Day is Thursday 🙀 so I'm going to wear a valentine's Day inspired outfit every day this week just trying to decide what to wear on what day.

<|startoftext|>@CarlBrian29 @TransActualUK @DailyMailUK *eye roll* trans people are people, no one goes around spewing hate and misgendering cisgender people so it's not okay for people to misgender and spew hate at trans people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlBrian29 @TransActualUK @DailyMailUK Are you dense? It clearly states I don't care what gender a person identifies as, I care that People are punished for being nasty to someone because of their gender identity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tipping down with hail. A lot of freaking hail is coming down #Weather #hailstorm #WestMidlands  https://t.co/5DQx4PMMDT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning you were up early for a Sunday lol 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making vegan gingerbread unicorns. Fun way to cheer myself up &amp; keeps my kid entertained decorating them. #vegan #parenting #unicorns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun I understand it was traumatic for her and she was injured and upset but is starting to feel like she's milking it for 15 minutes of fame. If it had been someone who wasn't royalty who had been involved in the accident with her she wouldn't be milking this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea and watching my son running around the living room with his rugby ball I can't believe he's completely fine after last night's accident. It's like nothing even happened yet I'm still shaking. #exhausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Good morning have a peaceful Sunday 🌄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TransActualUK @DailyMailUK People need to realise that it's 2019 people can identify as male, female, both or neither &amp; no one has the right to abuse them. As long as they're not hurting anyone who gives a damn who they identify as? Some women have penis's some men have vaginas. #TransRightsAreHumanRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline This is horrific, can't imagine what his mum is going through right now. How could anyone do that to anyone let alone a defense less child?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sorry for being morbid, think I'm still in shock tbh, he's happy &amp; winding up his cat like nothing happened he's a resilient little kid but he's also fearless so hes more accident prone as he doesn't fear the consequences of things which is terrifying lol hope you have a good day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for the well wishes for me and my son after last night's freak accident. We're at home now and He's 100% fine &amp; having cuddles, I'm still distraught had 0 sleep been crying, shaking &amp; vomiting all night. I've never been so scared in my life. #parenting #godblessthenhs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Thanks, He's more upset by seeing me so upset, I haven't slept, I'm still pale, shaking &amp; being sick. It was an accident the gate behind him wasn't locked properly &amp; he lost his balance &amp; fell. I tried to grab him, I'm fed up of crying he's only a toddler it should've killed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sons had a nasty fall - freak accident. He's been checked over by medical professionals &amp; is unharmed aside from bruising and superficial scratches he's completely fine &amp; smiling. I got injured on my way down to him &amp; was an hysterical wreck but we're both ok #godblessthenhs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night &amp; Saturday from hell, my kid had a freak fall. He's okay aside from a lot of bruises &amp; scratches but I injured my knee cap getting down to him &amp; was an hysterical wreck as I honestly expected he'd be dead or unconscious but he's completely fine 🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not ignoring anyone it's just this exhausted mama needs a candlelit bubble bath, a face mask and a glass of white wine to de-stress and unwind after an exhausting day. I'll reply to you all later my wonderful followers. 💋🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sometimes get disheartened at how big my goals are thinking I'll never achieve them so I break them down into tiny steps &amp; I write up a numbered list of steps and each step I break down into smaller parts E.g.  1: 1a) 1b)  2: 2a)  And focus on each tiny step. #motivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son has finally fell asleep so I'm sneaking off for a bubble bath and a face mask to unwind. Also having a sneaky glass of white wine in the bath. I've got a lot done today and I'm exhausted the cleaning can wait until tomorrow morning. #bubblebath #SaturdayNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorBreaking_ Something about this just doesn't add up. From the moment it hit the news what happened something seemed off. The parents behaviour seems so unusual considered the tragedy that happened. Me &amp; my family have discussed this at lengths and something just isn't adding up at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Praying by Kesha  Rewrite the stars by Zac Efron and zendaya   Runaway by pink<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Fair point but at least the bad music from back then was more tolerable than the bad music from nowadays lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love princess Tiddlywinks so much as she's adorable and fluffy but she's so annoying right now I can't get five minutes to myself and she keeps getting cat hair in my latte lmao ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Son's driving me nuts today I love him but lord have mercy he's making my blood pressure sky rocket to the point I feel dizzy. I love my son but *screams until my throat bleeds* lol #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That's good makes at least one of us who's had fun, my days been productive and got a lot done but my son's been a destructive freakishly strong nightmare all day. i need wine and a bubble bath lol x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah should go for that look in your next music video 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herbivore_club Oohhh I am so going to try this it sounds yummy thank you for the tip ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun It's starting to seem like Gemma Collins is trying to turn dancing on Ice into a the only was is Essex spin off, with all the drama and attention seeking she's doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield That look suits you lol 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exhausted, exhausted and yeah exhausted. Today is the sundayiest Saturday ever. #saturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks It was amazing episode but this scene with Brooke and Mandy was so emotional and sweet, the acting was very natural and was like a real life conversation which is what made it such a lovely scene to Watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life hack: add a splash of alpro chocolate milk to your coffee, it tastes amazing and is a total game changer.  #vegan #coffee #Februdairy #februdairyfree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had a Very productive morning brain storming designs, sketching designs, organising finances to fund prototypes of my designs as once prototypes are done I can reveal my awesome plan to you lovely lot. Also been writing chapter plans for my vlog abuse memoir. #saturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herbivore_club My son's addicted to this he loves it and it's healthier than cows milk based chocolate milk so he can enjoy it without the sugar induced meltdowns. Also it's super tasty adding a splash to coffee. #Februdairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Have fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know you're tired when you try to use the volume button on your mobile phone to turn the brightness Down on it. #SaturdayMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drives me nuts when people treat mental health issues like they're a competition of who-has-them-worse. Saying things like "yeah u were diagnosed at 19 well I was diagnosed at 3 I've had it longer" or "ur on 100mg? Yeah well I'm on the strongest legal dosage" #MentalHealthMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror Is this even legal? The parents paid for the mobile phones, pay for the credit on them, pay for most of the accessories and WiFi it uses yet they're being charged to have it returned by someone who hasn't paid a penny towards the cost of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This is horrible what they've done they've literally decided who's body to search for based on popularity &amp; how well known they are in the media. They've turned a families tragedy into a popularity contest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Petpeeve when ur in a queue &amp; sum1 gets out to do something &amp; it looks like they've left the queue then they get angry that they've lost their place in line. Like seriously you walked 20feet away &amp; had a cigarette whilst chatting to a group of people what was I supposed to think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notwaving @alex_segura I wish I could do that with a buggy, makes it more annoying that they get all huffy about needing to step back off the train/bus so you can get past before they get back on when they wouldn't have to do that if they just had manners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's kind of annoying when people are always in work mode even when they're not at work as it makes it near impossible to have a proper conversation with them without it feeling like you're a client they're pitching themself to. #SaturdayMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friend: its ironic isn't it that you give everyone relationship advice when we need it but you're still single? Me: It's not I'm single as years of helping people deal with their relationship problems has made me realise that I'd rather be single that deal with that bull**** #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night, stay safe. 🦍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK It looks like she's got a piece of wholewheat bread stuck in her teeth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I use this sentence way too much but I actually do prefer the older stuff like cat Stevens, Stevie nicks, Eric Clapton etc as most of the music nowadays is all about sex, asses, partying and using the N word. Older music has deeper more meaningful lyrics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Have an amazing weekend, I'm dealing with my cat being in season and it's like having another baby in the house as she meows whenever I leave the room, follows me everywhere &amp; will only go to sleep if I'm cuddling her lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah i did try with medication thinking I'd feel better once the side effects passed, tried different types/doses to find one that worked but none did as I just couldn't cope with the fact I could only feel &amp; function somewhat normally by being drugged up on medication 🤕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I love this... I do crochet therapy, meditation and exercise to cope. I had to have my  medication stopped as it was making it worse as I ended up depressed about the fact I was on antidepressants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited for dinner: making vegan southern fried chicken substitute, belgian waffles and maple syrup. #vegan #PlantBased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A guest thought it would be funny to sneak in a carton of cows milk &amp; use it to make my cup of tea, they seem to think me vomiting my guts up is funny. As yeah nothings funnier than going against someones beliefs &amp; watching them drink the breast milk of an exploited cow #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline If I was him I'd ask for the ring back and break up with her. As it's not about the ring it's about the person you're marrying and he's marrying a rude mannered woman who cares more about the ring than his feelings. It's not a traditional ring but it's still beautiful &amp; unique<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun There are better ways to stop people feeling ashamed of exploring their own anus that doesn't involve smearing faeces on his face and making himself come across as mentally unstable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield 1) that was predictive text lol, 2) rain does actually have a smell to it, smells kinda salty like when someone accidentally gets water up their nose lol 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I will I'm doing everything at home today rather than going out in this weather, I'm giving my kid his Spanish lessons, getting as much work done on a project before my wrist and eyes give out and film some more chapters on my vlog. Lol productive day ♐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun That is a scary looking pic of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning, have a safe Friday and have fun. 🕷️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do men think feminists hate all men?  They don't they just hate the ones who think they have the right to hurt women... Same way as I'm not afraid of all spiders, I'm just afraid of the types of spider that could kill me.  #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do men tell women that if they don't want to be raped don't be/go somewhere alone with a man unless she's going to have sex with him... Yet bisexual, lesbian, transgender women can be/go somewhere alone with another woman &amp; they don't sexually assault them? #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dumb Excuse someone said to persuade me to cut my son's hair short as boys shouldn't have long hair: "You need to cut his hair off regardless as his hair going in his eyes will make him permanently cross eyed" If this was true every woman on earth would be cross eyed #dumbass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Vegan: *has non vegan guests round*  Guest: *makes a cup of tea, goes to use the milk*  Vegan: what milk do u want? We have almond, soy, rice milk? Sweetened or unsweetened? u choose.

<|startoftext|>Good night, sweet dreams and stay safe my lovely followers. I appreciate all of you so so much. 🕷️🕸️ 💋 #GoodNightTwitterWorld #GoodNightEveryone  https://t.co/HmbHCG8D7e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night. Don't let the bed bugs bite lol 🐞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bugs me that people assume I'm dating someone because I'm listening to love songs... I'm not sometimes I like to listen to soppy love ballads whilst I'm happily single and eating ice cream #relaxation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kale is fun to eat until you end up with the farts and you're scared you'll singe your pets fur off if you don't stop farting #vegan #plantbased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't delay medical treatment you need out of fear of medical staff finding out you've been self harming. You have nothing to be ashamed of and they won't judge you but they will put you in touch with professionals who can help you. #mentalhealth #SuicidePrevention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to share an important mental health tip I learned:  if you've been self harming, don't delay getting medical treatment for whatever reason whether It's a freak accident, illness, injury etc out of fear of the nurses seeing your injuries. They won't judge u. #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It's piddling it down over my end now, can't complain though I love everything about rain, like literally the smell of rain, the smell of nature after a downpour, the sound of it on the roof, how calming it is to watch and the energy in the air. 🌦️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has sylver done something to his eyebrows, they look very different? #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Seriously? It's not like she's butt naked dry humping a sofa cushion, it's a lingerie advertisment what's he think she's going to be wearing a suit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay my lovely bunch I've been very vocal about the abuse I went  through and in the next few weeks I'm putting my plans and drafts into motion &amp; starting a vlog discussing what I went through and my process of recovering from it. #DomesticAbuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making a yummy vegan chicken substitute and kale Carribbean curry with boiled rice for dinner. Super excited #vegan #HealthyFood #plantbased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: *goes through difficult time*  Friend: time for some retail therapy Me: how are new clothes going to make me feel better?  Friend: try these on and trust me Me: *tries it on* oh wow I look smoking ****ING hot wow I'm so happy I could cry.  #FriendshipGoals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need 2 stop saying "I know what ur going through" 2 people who have experienced trauma/mental illness/etc it's not helpful at all as no u don't know what they're going through u know that they're going through trauma/mental illness, ask how u can help instead #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Hope you have fun and mwahaha the sun's shining down my end of the UK it's still freezing cold but at least I'm dry 😛 lmao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got told I look like a sexy corpse and a fit vampire today. I'm on cloud nine right now best compliments ever as corpse/vampire is my inspiration in my day to day normal look hence the over use of blue, black and purple makeup lol #selfie #ThursdayMotivation  https://t.co/0oqJW7cATU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlaStromberg @AidenHatfield Agreed as I used to shout at my counselor whenever she said "I know what you're going through" I'd go mad at her shouting " no you ****ING don't know, you know why I'm hurting but you don't know what I'm going through because of it"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield People shouldn't say "I know what you're going through" as they can't possibly know as situations are unique to the individual but a better thing to say is "I understand what you're going through"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not ignoring anyone just busy will reply later. Also for future reference this is how I usually look when I'm not in a situation where I need to tone it down lol #ThursdayMorning #selfie  https://t.co/QNrSM5ojP0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo Thursday win I got up 3 hours late (PTSD was acting up) yet I'm showered, moisturised, dressed and looking hot and still have time to spare. Hell yes! #ThursdayMorning #selfie  https://t.co/Pj9G2a5qrQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good night all, stay safe, warm and dry as it's piddling  it down outside and sweet dreams. Thank you for all the interactions on my tweets I appreciate it.

<|startoftext|>What the hell is Mac's problem? Mandy has never hurt him so why did he do that to her she's pregnant she has enough to worry about #Hollyoaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems I'd tell you if I thought you needed to use them 😝 jokes everyone's beautiful in their own unique way ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Ahhhhh ok lol I swear I'm not dumb I'm a gigantic ditz when it comes to humans but I'm smart when it comes to knowledge 🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah it was fun actually had a laugh and the nose bleed was cute in the end got me lots of cuddles off junior as he was happy I took care of him. If nose bleeds mean I get cuddles he can cause as many as he wants lol 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You look better without a Snapchat filter as well. I do like doing makeup to mimic Snapchat filters though it's fun and looks weird. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield This tweet made me smile it's very sweet, makes a pleasant change from the doom and gloom news articles on my feed ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I had more friends who love rainy day picnics, like where we put on our rain coats and pack large umbrellas, a waterproof picnic blanket and fill a picnic basket with gingerbread cookies and flasks of hot chocolate and tea so we can cosy up in the rain with our picnic. #life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else love photographing different types of fungus as a hobby or am I just weird? #curious #question #nature<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feel sad now I've washed my makeup off as i really liked it and think I did a good job considering I have a black eye and had to keep stopping every 20seconds because my son was hell bent on p*ssing the cat off. #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off for a much needed shower but I love this design I've done and got to use fake skin to cover my eye up as my right eye muscles are weak so won't stay open properly unless I keep my left eye open so I had to cover it with fake skin patch and blend it in #makeup #weird #selfcare  https://t.co/LpsNefk54w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I don't know what 'slaps' means so yeah I feel old now lol. Your song is brilliant though you should be very proud of yourself 🙂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Oh okay, thank you. Sorry I'm used to people being sarcastic so find it easier to ask if I'm unsure lol sorry. 😶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Sarcasm? 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Thank you, despite having a hangover from hell today's actually been surprisingly  fun. Hope you've had a productive day ♐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important tip: if you know your dog is aggressive towards other animals then keep it on a leash and muzzled when out in public with it.

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I dropped out of school and have no regrets as I now have a beautiful albeit  annoying child and I'm busting my ass off whilst raising my son to persue my dreams.

<|startoftext|>Drives me nuts when I have guests over and they start telling my pets what to do like telling my pets to get off the furniture, get out of certain rooms etc. They're my pets &amp; you're in their home you'll be sitting on the floor before they do. #pettypetpeeve #annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_acorah Good morning to you too and have a happy Tuesday 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_segura Petty pet peeve: People who try to get on the bus or train before letting people get off. It's annoying AF especially when you're trying to get off the bus or train with a buggy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun These are dangerous! They have one in the Morrisons local to me and a bloke accidentally knocked them over, there was broken glass everywhere they had to close the aisle off, took the staff ages to clean it all up was an accident waiting to happen that could've been avoided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning have a fun day 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hangover is triggering memories of when my brother accidentally batted a piece of wood at my face when I was kid. I actually think that hurt less #hungover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Me too they're awesome. I have my first ear piercings stretched it's weirdly addictive, I took them out for a year after one of them was yanked &amp; got infected but ended up putting them back in as I missed them &amp; also ear stretchers look weirdly sexy on people lmao 🐽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mental health tip: never drink alcohol when you're having a bad day mentally as it'll make you feel so so much much worse &amp; you'll end up with a hangover which sucks in general let alone when you're feeling low #TuesdayMotivation #MentalHealthAwareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHugFairy Thank you *hugs back* good morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drives me nuts when loved ones say "anytime you need a day off from the kids let me know and I'll baby sit them for a few hours" and the rare occasion you take them up on their offer suddenly they're busy everyday until the kids gone to university #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone want to come give me a hug? Won't lead to sex or anything just need someone to hug me whilst I eat pancakes and drink tea. #feelingill<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I couldn't find the cat anywhere and noticed the sofa cushion moving. Turned out my son had thought it was funny to unzip the sofa cushion and put her inside it. She wasn't even bothered by it lol #ToddlerLife #parenting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the hardest things I've had to do as a parent is when my child walks in the room when I'm crying because life's just too much &amp; had to put on a brave face &amp; pretend I was okay whilst I cared for my child even when I had mascara tears running down my face #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you survive a traumatic experience it's easy to feel lost in life as you're actually living a part of your life you didn't even think you'd be living when you were faced with the traumatic experience. It's scary. #mentalhealth #ptsd #MentalHealthAwareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been feeling lost for the past 3yrs &amp; finally realised why, I should've died 3yrs ago but I escaped my abuser at the last minute, he made an error, I feel lost as surviving wasn't part of the plan but I did so I'm living a part of my life that I never expected 2 #ptsd #AbuseTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asked my brother to babysit my son whilst I went out to buy a carton of orange juice and took a massive detour and had some silent time on a field near my home to clear my head. Watching the stars &amp; clouds really made me feel calm but made me feel more lost than ever #selfcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The annoying thing about words whether they're good, bad or downright embarrassing is that once said or typed can't be undone which is really freaking annoying. #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems just being honest 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm starting to think I was a female ferret in my past life. Pic explains why. Lmao. This is frustrating. 😠😠😠😠 #frustrated #singleproblems #single  https://t.co/tDtZltDOfd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Your hard works paid off though as your music is amazing, you're so talented and handsome AF lol. It's good that you've been taking time to recharge as burn outs are hellish to have. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things that aren't helpful to say to someone with Post Natal Depression: "u're a mom u have no reason to be sad" "u're ungrateful there are people who can't have kids" "it's just baby blues u'll be okay in a few weeks" "every1 feels down its just your hormones" #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a chance to have a sit down and rest for a bit and wondering what I'm going to have for dinner have absolutely no idea so might just make a quick #vegan Carribbean curry and chips. Quick and simple I like it. #vegan #dinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second appointment of the day done and dusted found out why I've been feeling dizzy I have low blood pressure #selfcare #whoops #feelingsick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally getting a few minutes to chill out on my sofa and yes my desk behind me is sheer chaos lol at least I'm relaxing before my next two consecutive appointments to crack on with my projects #selfie #MondayMotivaton  https://t.co/vadaBRowbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exhausting day working on crocheting a massive Afghan blanket for my mum and also sketching up illustrations for a book I'm making my son based on a story I wrote him to explain the…  https://t.co/eV8AWXy9Hp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK It's not discrimation they're trying to save her! Doing surgery when a person's overweight can put patient at risk of further life threatening complications &amp; can cause the surgery to take longer which in itself is a massive risk to a patient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustIngredients Meeting my friend for the day, Me and my single friends do a secret valentine where we pick a name at random and have to buy them a valentine's Day present and we exchange gifts on valentine's Day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never felt such overwhelming relief in my life. Feel so much better now just needed to meditate with a glass of wine and I feel so much better than I did never been so close to doing a disappearing act in my life as never felt so god damn frazzled in my life #selfcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's mood exhausted X1000<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning and Big smiles today, I'm staying positive just feel a smidgen sick lol I'm rushed off my feet until 6pm #selfie #exhausted #MondayMorning  https://t.co/8qkjgmgPok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First appointment done and dusted actually managed to get showered, moisturised, dressed and full face of makeup within 10minutes and got to my appointment on time woohoo. Selfie from earlier can't go wrong with blue lipstick &amp; eyeliner #MondayMotivaton  https://t.co/ADXPE0dhl8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Morning early bird, have a good day, I'm still in bed I have 3 appointments and no desire to get up and deal with a load of grumpy repairmen, literally have 8 minutes to shower, get dressed &amp; do makeup &amp; head out not going to happen lmao 🦍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son's decided to cover the landing floor in purple chalk like literally the entire landing floor, banister, stair gate, bathroom door, bedroom doors it's freaking everywhere. May God have mercy on my soul it's going to take hours to clean up. #parenting #fml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life with a toddler summed up in one pic the little asshole covered the landing floor in purple chalk when I was using the toilet this is just a small segment #toddlers #terribletwos…  https://t.co/e9ietBqhNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if I should feel guilty for asking my brother to watch my son for me whilst I clean up the downstairs bathroom but instead of cleaning I've built a fort with the sofa cushions and been playing an online game instead #SorryNotSorry #idontfeelguilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bring_It_or_ I know I want to definitely get a small black Star and a solid black silhouette of Noah's ark on my wrists to represent my kids but I really want something else done on my back and have no idea what though x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something people need to stop assuming with mental illness is that every memory that's triggered is a sad one it's not always the case sometimes happy memories are triggered that make them smile or laugh to themself. People with mental illness can feel happiness too #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upped my ear stretcher sizes again almost at my maximum size in my left ear I can go up to (go any bigger than the maximum size I've set myself I'll have to take out my second piercing and I don't want to lol) I'm a third of the way there with my right ear. #piercings #goals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really want a tattoo but I'm so indecisive about what I want and honestly how much I love changing up my look scared I'll get bored of it and regret it because I can't change it. #tattoos #decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally think ear stretchers are so sexy. Literally one of my favourite body modifications, love playing with them and if I'm dating someone with them I'm a sucker for kissing them. Lol #bodymodification #piercings #earstretching #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bisexual problems: when you get a crush on a man and a woman at the same time and all you can think is "Why God why?" #lgbt #bisexual #bisexualproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Yeah lol one of the joys of having a kid is that my YouTube suggestions are very weird at times sometimes it suggests good songs other times it suggests annoying kids channels could go either way lol 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Quite irritating is an understatement it sometimes makes me wish The Purge was real lol 🦇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that people expect women to dress nice and do their makeup when they're having repairmen/plumbers etc at their home. The repairmen are being paid to do a repair not judge a beauty pageant a woman shouldn't be expected to look immaculate if she doesn't want to #feminist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield For me it was listening to Cat Stevens, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac, the rolling stones etc I grew up listening to them and they're my go to, to listen to when I'm stressed and need to unwind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already looking forward to cooking dinner making #vegan sweet and sour rice #vegancooking #plantbased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay @AidenHatfield  look what showed up in my suggestions on YouTube lol... And can tell my toddlers been on my phone by the other suggestions  #music #aidenhatfield  https://t.co/QbAZZqqPM4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think a baby screaming bloody murder because it's pooped it's nappy is permission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daily_Express The world's gone mad. That's how kids end up with horrific nappy rash and infections as does she really think a little one in a poopy nappy will consent to having it's nappy changed when they're too busy playing with their toys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror That poor dog, dogs are living things not fashion accessories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror What fresh hell is this? Seriously it's not racist they were sweeping chimneys I'd be more surprised if they came out looking pristine and squeaky clean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sometimeswesay That's so sweet and hadn't thought of that 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield love this post as people have a tendency to treat people with mental illness like they're fragile &amp; delicate &amp; will break at the slightest thing. It's annoying as it's hard for someone to feel normal when they're being treated like they're not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's important task: find out where the hell I'm going to put two bonsai trees and a 6 foot indoor tree in my small bedroom. Lmao this is going to be fun #trees #selflove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm noticing a tree theme today, to celebrate 3 years since escaping my abuser my family have bought me 3 trees, 2 small bonsai trees and a large 6 foot indoor coconut palm. I'm so confused lmao. #abusetalk #feelingpositive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems and I hope so lol I'm super happy today lol 🕷️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield It did actually gave me something to focus on and could turn it up loud enough to drown out the sound of my swearing as core exercises burn like hell but are weirdly addictive to do. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning you lovely bunch of people! Have a wonderful day and stay safe and warm it's freezing out and take care if you're driving the roads are icy. #goodmorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOOHOO!!!! Today is exactly 3yrs since I escaped an abusive relationship and began a 2+year long fight for justice and it's almost a year since I got justice for the abuse. Time to celebrate with my beautiful child that we survived that evil monster. #abusetalk #celebrate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning and yay congrats on your lie in have a relaxing Sunday 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayneRyman It's okay and all is well in my world at the moment 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night and stay safe 🦉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayneRyman You ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Added This is Never Ending @AidenHatfield to my workout playlist on youtube, love getting lost in music when I'm exercising, makes it easier to get through it without giving up &amp; it's a good way to keep warm everyone's b*tchin their cold &amp; I'm sweating &amp; need a cold shower #music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrsstrict36 @AidenHatfield @ollyofficial Ditto I don't get love ones lol I just get crushes on souls not physical looks if that makes sense? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrsstrict36 @AidenHatfield @ollyofficial I don't have celeb/star crushes or crushes in general lol I only get crushes on people once I get to know the person so find it almost impossible to have a crush as my brains like "yes they're attractive physically but what's their soul like?" lol I'm a bit weird 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh balls just remembered I haven't had dinner today how the hell could I have forgotten to eat? My kids had dinner just forgot to make myself anything what the heck? #SaturdayThoughts #exhausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Haha lol sorry, I was out cold last night was exhausted so my kid let me have a lie in for once and didn't completely destroy the house when I was sleeping which now I think of it is very unnerving lmao. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I know lol he's a cutie and a bit of a fluffy weirdo lol 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts I'm the same, I always get emotional when I get to the last chapter of a really good book knowing ive almost finished reading it. Wish it'd never end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's main thought process: "oh dear *** I'm going to throw up I'm going to throw up" ... "Oh wait I'm fine"... "No I'm not where's the bin" *bleurgh* #feelingsick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pigletish Yeah quite a few; toxic friends, my cousin's brother in law who kept sexually harassing me, a homophobic cousin, former work colleagues who were back stabbers... To name a few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better angle of jigsaw puzzle makeup I did last night to de-stress my family think it looks good but creepy and my son thinks it's funny lol he chose my hat lol #makeup #stressrelief #selfcare #selfie  https://t.co/2rJXCFyK1O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I do to de-stress I create and experiment with weird makeup looks it helps me unwind as I have to concentrate. #makeup #Selfcare #stressrelief #mentalhealth  https://t.co/x2WZB4c17J<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You definitely deserve it, self care comes first have a fun day. 🙂 I'm watching all the ice age films and eating crumpets my version of self care. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiccatreecrafts My weekend: Exhausting and feel weirdly over it and I'm not sure why. I'm staying positive though. 🌛🌚🌜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I have a dog and 2 cats, this is wispa my clingy mommy's boy. He's a rescue had him for 9years #DogsAreBetterThanPeople  https://t.co/0hZpLefOhu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching ice age with my son. I love ice age it's so funny. Hmmm why can't I find a soulmate who acts just like Sid the sloth #iceage #RelationshipGoals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw a memory on Facebook from 3 years ago when I secretly uploaded a photo of an orange because I was overwhelmed with excitement at my abuser allowing me to eat a piece of fruit... Outside his house, on a wall in the dark, cold, wind and pouring rain. #Depressing #abusetalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollyoaks @officialmal_ Happy birthday 🎉 🎉🎉🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This woman should have her dog taken off her #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so cute when cattle farmers contact vegans trying to defend slaughtering cows because the plant based dairy industry is damaging their cruel way of life #vegan #Februdairy #Februdairy19 #veganlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #Februdairy19 I've decided to give almond milk a try as I usually only drink soy milk so this will be interesting to see if it's as nice as everyone claims #vegan #Februdairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying you're not homophobic because you watch LGBT porn still makes you homophobic as there's a big difference between watching actors have LGBT sex on screen for your pleasure &amp; actually interacting with a LGBT person without intending to gain sexual gratification from it #lgbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying you're not homophobic because you watch lesbian porn means you are homophobic because you've fetishized lesbians. Turning LGBT into a fetish is homophobic because it's a person's identity not a fetish for strangers to get pleasure out of #lgbt #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good morning and have a fun Saturday, You were up early lol I'm still in bed. 🐢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so exhausted I accidentally used my glitter body lotion instead of my normal lotion so my beds going to look like a freaking disco ball in the morning so I think it's time I got some sleep. Good night and stay safe you lovely people. 🦉 #fail #goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Good night and sweet dreams 🌚🦉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrsstrict36 Thank you and likewise x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right you lovely bunch I'm off for a much needed shower as I decided to turn my face into a jigsaw puzzle with makeup because why not? Lmao (pic on Instagram)  anyways I'll reply to everyone once I'm no longer creepy looking lol #shower #makeup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parenting summed up: when my child's awake I'm mentally pleading with them to go to sleep so I can relax and then the moment they go to sleep I complain I'm bored because they're not awake to entertain me #Parents #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a smidge bored when my son was with his uncle so I decided to turn myself into a jigsaw puzzle only took five minutes lol you can tell #jigsawpuzzle #makeup #creativemakeup…  https://t.co/tkOxWpdEea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm happy I'm now raising my son vegan but since he's started eating more greens he won't stop farting, they're mostly silent so I just keep having random wafts of nauseating farts #vegan #veganparenting #parenting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield No problems, I was just being honest 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield I agree with you, I understand that it's easy for people to bring others down as misery loves company but people don't seem to realise that misery might love company but there's nothing that says that company has to feel fed up too. Positive people create positive energy ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield You have yourself to thank for it, you're very talented 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenHatfield Drives me nuts when people say that as the people saying it don't know what's going on in the person's mind so what might not seem so bad to them can be triggering or difficult for the person going through it. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did they have to state that it was a gay porn star as if it being a heterosexual porn star would've somehow made the situation better? They could have just said porn star? #lgbt #lgbtequality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish people would stop telling me I "need" to my son's hair cut because he's a boy. NO! I'm not distressing my son by cutting his hair he chooses to have long to fit a gender stereotype, why don't I cut those assholes hair without consent &amp; see if they like it, #feelingangry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not ignoring anyone just very tired and busy will reply to people later ☺️☺️ #followers #exhausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited for dinner, making vegan jerk chicken (substitute), rice and peas with chilli &amp; garlic mushrooms. #vegan #feelinghungry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention people: we need to stop telling people to take it as compliment when someone sexually harasses them. Sexual harassment isn't a compliment it's upsetting. Telling someone they're beautiful is a compliment, telling someone they should do porn isn't! #femaleempowerment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun She might love him but he clearly doesn't love her if he's willing to do this to her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK Tickling seriously? What next wiping their nose? My son loves being tickled it makes him happy and he laughs so much and his laugh makes us laugh as it's the cutest noise. There's nothing wrong with tickling as long as you stop when they child asks you to.<|endoftext|>
