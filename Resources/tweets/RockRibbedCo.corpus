<|startoftext|>That’s why I never call them liberals anymore. They used to be the party of... do whatever makes you feel good. Now they’re the party of... we’ll tell you what feels good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think we should go through and verify every vote to ensure that Russia was not interfering in our election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rushlimbaugh I would love to see @MattWalshBlog fill in for you as a guest host someday. He'd be perfect for your audience.   @BoSnerdley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog The thing that hurts me the most is thinking about all the good times I had with my dad watching Bears games. That love for me is gone, so difficult for me and my son to do the same. I pray they can drop all this shit and just play football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a @KingJames flop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaChanda @EWErickson You would’ve preferred the @JoeBiden method by not banning flights from China? The Pelosi - come on down to Chinatown there’s nothing to worry about. And even Deblasio telling everyone not to be scared and keep using the subway and public transportation. Can’t have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Villages always reppin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladbible @MattWalshBlog if this is typical behavior, I was underestimating your bravery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The left are already plotting ways to say it's rigged. I think they already know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way I'll watch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has been a GoFundMe set up for anyone that would like to help donate to the "Parading for @realDonaldTrump " rally in the suburbs of Chicago  https://t.co/sruSzscWtp  Going to be even better than the last one!! DM me if you'd like to be invited to the private Facebook group.  https://t.co/2bHIRNECYo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbystarbuck @tom67004408 I saw that too. Only way they think they can win is to deceive and lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto Tell that to my children's school. We have to fill out a form online stating that he does not have a temperature. Then also have to fill one out in paper for him to bring with. This is more than out of control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq @MikkiSm56095348 @AZachParkinson @mattmargolis Let's see if you can find 30 people to cheer that. They did their best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodFamilyJesus I still can't get an ad posted in Facebook - if it has anything to do with Trump or MAGA. When I strip those words out they get approved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodFamilyJesus Wow what a compliment - thank you so much!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No denial. Just change the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr If there was one word to describe him. I would have to use lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QTAnon1 I remember when humans touched other humans, and smiled at each other. This is what sports used to do for us,  bring us all together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorningAnswer Oh no. Nobody explained to her what her DNA results meant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you can promote the political organization BLM, but on the same document it says political affiliated slogans are not allowed. Makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glockamorra @Onlyafool1 @THR Take a look at ABC NBC CBS CNN, they are all loaded with past ministration Democrat operatives. So by your theory news in the United States is propaganda for the Democratic Party. I can't disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just launched my website and I wear one of my @realDonaldTrump shirts everywhere I go in the suburbs of Chicago. I thought I was going to be harassed but I get more thumbs up and nods than I'd ever imagine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher So proud of him to earn that, but it makes it that much sweeter to know it gets your panties in such a bunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishrygirl Hilarious, you do realize that each state decides this not the federal government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld I know you were being sarcastic about @JoeBiden stepping aside cause of his white male privilege and righteously giving it to a woman of color - but you just predicted the future. There has to be a plan for Joe to pass the torch and identity politics is all they know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly what drove me to start my business. I have no fear of what they are going to call me anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best part about this is that everyone cheering this on has no idea how bad Biden actually sounds. If you think mispronouncing and correcting a couple words is even in the same ballpark as @JoeBiden trying to put a sentence together you are lying to yourself. Which I'm ok with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GrahamAllen_1 Would have been nice to have a follow-up question about what specifically the administration said that was racist or was calling for the attacks on Chinese people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aknox92 @politicalmath @heckyessica Other than @billburr and @DaveChappelle he’s the funniest guy I’ve seen on stage in three years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heckyessica I remember when @nbcsnl was funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones Either this video is brilliant at exposing and explaining what an abortion actually is, or it was put together by the worst marketing team I have ever come across.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom Out of all the years I listened to you the media distortion was the problem. Now it seems that you are siding with them?  It's either - they are full of shit, or you believe them. Can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nick_Clamorgan @MAGA2ARIGHTS @AOC You can tell she doesn't know what she's talking about. Bullshit artist, and not a very good one. One of those people that knows every answer to every question. She'd be the perfect person to ask a question about how she feels on a fake topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGuest @NicolleDWallace If everything is stunning...  nothing is stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJones_tm Ends justify the means for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"They're not listening to anything any of us have to say" I guess they never read the story about the boy who called wolf.<|endoftext|>
