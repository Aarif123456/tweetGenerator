<|startoftext|>@Matty93369485 Nonsense!  Obama got the Nobel prize just as he took office (before bombing).

<|startoftext|>@Siudan2 @rk70534 I disagree, neo-liberalism will last as long as there are enough mugs who buys the doctrine. At the end of the day mainstream media control public opinion. For the establishment its all about giving enough crumbs to enough plebs to keep it going.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dallo100 Corbyn certainly has many followers to do it but he won't.

<|startoftext|>@dallo100 Starmer's cabinet is full of awful ppl.
