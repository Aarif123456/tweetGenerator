<|startoftext|>Q3: Is there survey that supports the need for 3 04 language policy, to benefit the students. Even if it is suggested as cursory learning, why is there a stringent exit criteria for the language courses?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If equal education for all is the motive, then why cant NCERT share the syllabus and amend the wherever local information and knowledge needed. For example, Language subjects, History etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without understanding the ground reality, the NEP sweetens the proposal with Montessori like education and every page has reference to NCERT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is an emphasis of 3-4 language, for students as young as 6 years. Without lifting the economy of the poor people, what is the motivation for the students to study,  1) His or her Mother tonguge 2) English 3) 3rd language and 4) 4th language (as some recommend)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While 60-85% of students are from villages (depending on states) and the bottom 20-40% are students from very poor community, where is the inclusive approach? Politicians, spiritual leaders, and others talk of inclusiveness, but there is no 'walk the talk'.<|endoftext|>
