<|startoftext|>@KeiraSavage00 A government is only as good as its opposition. Sadly we don’t have one in Vic. We need someone tough to take the LNP reigns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniferdahl1 @rachelbaxendale @JoshFrydenberg @Joe_Hildebrand @DanielAndrewsMP Nope 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniferdahl1 @rachelbaxendale @JoshFrydenberg @Joe_Hildebrand Ask @DanielAndrewsMP There’s no such thing as luck with this ‘wildly infectious indiscriminate virus’. 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good words. The only point I’d argue, the PM provided much needed financial assistance, however, more pressure was required from the top office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBlackVelvet @jacsvoice 👏👏 I’ll grab a feed and a good coffee next time I’m in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielBleakley @GideonCRozner @JoshFrydenberg Wonder how many died in a car accident #coviddeath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Zero my arse 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrumpyOLSoldier Agreed 100%. Absolutely amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruth Bader Ginsberg won her Senate confirmation, 96 votes to 0 with more than 40 Republican votes. Amy Coney Barrett, did not get the support of 1 Democrat. #wow. Says a lot about the Democrats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Righto. First stop, Paul Dimmatina’s pub for a beer. Just to wish him well. #melbournelockdown #melbourne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who needs a #vaccine? The flu has magically disappeared this year 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 5000 tests. All negative!! A seriously wildly infectious virus this is. #melbournelockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OzraeliAvi 🙇‍♂️oh no. It means I have to succumb to watching a piece of the project 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lisa_Wilkinson @theprojecttv Really?? Attacking strong confident women is now your thing! Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1135 tests with zero cases from this wildly infectious killing virus. #melbournelockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Anzac Day, Easter, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, AFL, an empty MCG, no BBQs in the back yard, or Melbourne Cup. Drones over your house 👀 . Have I missed anything? Will be Christmas soon. #SackDanAndrews #DictatorDan #melbournelockdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Victorian Government has gone rogue. You know it. #melbournelockdown2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D1Kastell @DanielAndrewsMP We’ve had 8 months to get the contact tracing to some sort of standard. I’m guessing, it’s not at the standard one would hope for from a civilised wealthy country like Australia. Perhaps the government $$ are being wrongly distributed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronInBendigo 0.2 in regional Vic and yet, masks still compulsory. 🤷‍♂️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People comparing Hunter and Ivanka. I haven’t seen Ivanka with a crack pipe and a hooker hanging off her. #JustSaying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Renadevisingh @DanielAndrewsMP The deal was, cases under 5 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m confused. @DanielAndrewsMP doesn't make sense. Even when Melbourne opens, there will be outbreaks (as Dan keeps saying) &amp; he can't shut Melb down every time.... So why keep it shut for this outbreak?? 🤥 #melbournelockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedjjam No leadership shills whatsoever. Just dictatorial skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedjjam That took a while. 🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Danger will have more chance of winning a flag going back to the crows now. Cats too old. #aflgrandfinal2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats Tigers. Been way too good for so long now. Well played. #aflgrandfinal2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dangerfield. Always playing for frees. Perhaps he should play the ball like Dusty. #aflgrandfinal2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dangerfield. Poorly coached or poorly played? Bit of both I think. #AFLTigersCats #aflgrandfinal2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>United Security Pty Ltd (think hotel fiasco) is owned by one Henry Pinskier, who is a factional member of the McNamara branch of the Labor Party. His daughter Abby Pinskier, works for Daniel Andrews as an adviser in the Office of the Premier. Nothing to see. ($33mil)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HARDENUPBOXING One thing for certain. All stats are skewed. Too many lies in this world so it’s hard to believe what’s real  anymore. Therein lies the problem. Flu is also suddenly cured in Victoria too.  No more flu deaths. Now classed as Covid! Who knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HARDENUPBOXING Maybe closed border 🤷‍♂️😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HARDENUPBOXING Questions we don’t ask? How many would have died from the flu or the co-morbidities anyway? Sweden had a very mild flu season the past few years &amp; was due for a large spike &amp; more deaths. 1 thing for certain, we need some herd immunity of which our Govt isn’t allowing us to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterWallaceAU I’d love to play footy on this prick. Woops didn’t mean that whack to the back of the head....for the 5th time today 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dan Andrews on Frydenberg, “he’s not a leader, he’s just a Liberal”. Dan wouldn’t know leadership if it smacked him is the face. A leader gives hope and unity of which, Dan has given none. #auspol #DictatorDan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love the way Dan continually talks down to us all. FMD. We’re all a bunch of kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRHewson He’s not being attacked for this at all. He’s being attacked because the lack of due process by his government has led to the deaths of over 800 Victorians. In addition, has left the state reeling. Jobs for the boys is not good governance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedjjam Trekking. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan’s little world. Won’t reveal anything about easing lockdown restrictions till he has all the facts but hasn’t got all the facts about these kiwis, but happy to discuss it. 🤷‍♂️😷#melbournelockdown #DictatorDan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aus_spirit He makes himself look stupid and  incompetent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedjjam I don’t think she’s playing for gotcha moments. Just explaining the inept ‘ALP’ investigation. #CoverUp. And exposing the truth. The rest will follow. 2 down. More to come✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedjjam As usual....yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedjjam He pretty much called the Chief of Defence a liar. Squirming his way out of a royal commission and didn’t want to ack his own press release.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GrumpyOLSoldier All starts at the top. Look at the fear mongering by our very own ‘so called’ leader @DanielAndrewsMP.  He would never lead the charge from the trenches but would be happy to send everyone else over. (Or under the bus).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pocketpingpong @TimSmithMP @scepticsinc @VictoriaPolice Agreed wholeheartedly. But as stated elsewhere, there’s a heightened sense of fear &amp; intimidation at the moment. Continual threats from leaders do not help the situation. Normal is no longer normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoamaBagel @TimSmithMP @scepticsinc @VictoriaPolice No, not saying what she did is right, but to a young girl, there’s definitely a heightened state of fear &amp; intimidation around at the moment. She should have just complied.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alabasterade @billshortenmp No pity? Every tax advantage is slowly eroding. Hardly a fair system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @billshortenmp I think my sums are right. Let’s talk tax breaks: $35,000 pays $3,247pa $45,000 pays $6,307pa $200,000 pays $67,097pa (10x more than $45K, 20x more than $35K earners).  High earrners are well &amp; truly deserved of a break. #auspol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @ncb_cfc. I’m so impressed someone went up and showed respect. Gone up in my books 👍 #AFLPiesDons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1629senSA Wow. Really. Maybe don’t play the boundary line &amp; wait for all the defenders to get back before kicking the ball forward. That could be a start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7AFL Sack the man in the picture would be a great start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First coach sacked this year has to be Don Pyke. #Spud #AFLNorthCrows<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsAust @billshortenmp @AustralianLabor What’s the point? Coal is sold to other countries at record rates to keep their power prices low &amp; energy reliable.

<|startoftext|>@yorkie2906 #c2tc it was great. Even better as I was the first to ever use it. Lol. I learnt 1 thing. My model D needs new seat rollers!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Clarke_Melissa maybe you can address productivity gains for payrises in parliament ala the rest of us. Govt. lost about $58B last year. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniapolak thought it started 3 weeks ago!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkie2906 shinhouse. HM at ut2 18spm. 1:33!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkie2906 I just had 8 days off. 1st row back was hard!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HM at 18Spm. UT2. StConcept today. Concept2. Beats running with buggered knees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rellejune spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parilla pub for dinner. Does anyone even know where that is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clarke_Melissa all of which the Govt has failed at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Concept2_AU never tried the ski. Nice wrk. I have energy level 0 but will try and liven up with 60m @ 2:05. Rowpro is good stuff. Cheers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rellejune go swannieeeees!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/LPFRc1X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelistmanager give port a break. Just leave him there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adelaidecrowsne phew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictoriaPolice assisting police with their enquiries!!  Cmon, why is it always written this way? You mean he was arrested for being a twit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFL_KatrinaGill Do you think Port Adel should recruit Fev wirh a 12 month contract? Might generate interest in the club (bums on seats)!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twisst I had the time zone wrong. Went back out 1/2 hour later and sure enough the cloud rolled in. Lol. Will persist. Thanks 4 ur help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggroverr @twisst21 Doh!  Central time!  I'll wait another 1/2 hour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twisst21 Are times correct? Beautiful clear sky and nothing to be seen at 6:57pm This evening in Australia. Cheers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelistmanager the AFL is turning into a joke. The scores are outrageous. 5 years ago the comp was so even. 2 extra teams will solve this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adelaidecrowsne now that's good news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFL_KatrinaGill goos call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AW693 no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adelaide_FC I was in Melb in 91 and saw terrible losses. Tonight was worse!  Where to now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelistmanager the umpiring was shocking this week. Are there any umpires that have actually played a game of footy. I doubt it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeromeKeegan ;-((<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeromeKeegan nice draw BTW!  And of course, no stiffy, no win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AWNeilMitchell you bet there is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adelaide_FC not again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelistmanager $10...yeah right! Maxwell innocent....year right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickmalthouse is this really you Mr Malthouse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AWNeilMitchell the only answer they will give, is the answer to the question they want you to hear! Work that out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AWNeilMitchell very little interest. It will be the 'so called' high income earners footing the bill again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twisst I don't seem to get any updates on ISS passing my loc!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AWNeilMitchell because a few abuse, all have to pay!  Interesting concept. Like rising fuel, it will become a scotoma. I like a quiet sip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorKarl what's going on to make them so high?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adelaide_FC and he's been a pretty dammed good player for us!  Well done pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adelaide_FC Wayne Carey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adelaidecrowsne no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3AWNeilMitchell Neil. It doesn't matter how bad the politician, one can get by with great leadership. Which, we have not had for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvescovi @sfgate finally an understanding of what a cloud is!  Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have premium tix to see the crows v dogs next week. Is it really worth going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twisst47 bugger. Always too cloudy this time if the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeromeKeegan no more zaharakis re tweets thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adelaidecrowsne no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniapolak I'm excited for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniapolak WHAT?  Your unbelievable girl. Good on ya!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Angus Houston. You did the Country and the RAAF a wonderful service. A true gentleman. Good luck with your future endeavors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not watching another Crows game whilst Craig is the coach. I've held my tongue for too long now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HudsonRumpf thank mate. I'll check it out. Unfortunately, until then, I'll put up with the family pretending they like my cooking....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniapolak if you ever make it back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love cooking but am a shithouse cook. I do, however, make the best pancakes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniapolak I'm learning this thing. Didn't know you can reply to peeps!  How you doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta see a bloke bout a dog!  Good Ozzie slang!<|endoftext|>
