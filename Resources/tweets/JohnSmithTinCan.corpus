<|startoftext|>@fesshole I can remember one of our primary school teachers making a young lass stand at the front of a class while shouting at her "How do you not know your own birthday" Made her stand there that long the kid pissed herself, and then got 'the bat' for doing that. 😱 70's teachers eh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fesshole What kind of 'juice'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anon20214 @moores_andy @syptweet What I mean by that, is that the police and the public, deep down, know the reason we have armed police outside of shopping centers is the threat of religious extremists, specifically Islamic, wanting to target them, but in out tip toe society, SYP wouldn't say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK How did it ever come to this? When we work that out, the solution may come.  15 yr old lad, gone, and for what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roryfitz15 That clip, just comes around every now and again and reminds me it's what the internet was invented for. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@titchlynn @BBCSport They've let the racists win? Who has, Sir Les Ferdinand who is suggesting we move on from knee bending to something more productive that is actually meaningful and becomes productive. You know, Sir Les Ferdi, black footballer, now DOF at QPR. Is Sir Les wrong Karen?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bunney_91 @BBCSport They've?  Allowed?  We live in a free country, people have the right to express their views, it might not fit yours but that's a healthy thing isn't it? To debate, talk, discuss, not order.  Do you want the Millwall players to be ordered to kneel?  Adolf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fesshole I discovered the same today, not so much the lonely part but watching Arsenal tv along with the sky game. Grown men crying over football.   I thought Darren was the only one. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fez100  Where did you go? Why block me before I could even read your final words of wisdom?  What a strange thing to do. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moores_andy @syptweet No, no I don't, but last I heard we don't shoot shoplifters in the UK. Point been, how much this country has changed in the last ten years or so that shoppers require protection from armed police.  And we all know why.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fesshole They reach your chest? 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fez100 @MillwallFC Here you go again, telling people what to do. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fez100 @MillwallFC I think the point I was making is that there is more to life than football. People have a right to express their opinion no matter what Millwall, Darren Fez, BLM, the BBC or anyone else, thinks about it.   And on that score, I am correct. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@syptweet We are all in this together and in the main I try to keep positive about our boys and girls in blue, but could you tell us what you're protecting us from. Bullets don't stop a virus, so who are you ready to fire at if you are required, specifically. Xmas shopping has changed. 🎅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teresadg0 Seems so. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fez100 @MillwallFC No I think the point you're missing is that automatically you've labelled anyone who booed yesterday as racist thugs. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fez100 @MillwallFC Many people, of all colours, have criticized BLM, Darren. Have none of them, in your opinion, got a right to speak out against it, if that's what they wish to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillwallFC Stupid move. Those that want to boo will now boo louder and longer. The fans are the life and blood of the club, &amp; there are few if any more passionate than Millwall fans about their area, or their football club  Nobody, thankfully, has a divine right to tell anyone what to think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilHay_ Did a job in us in the 2nd half, we live and learn.  MOT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMcWilliams_UK @LeeHurstComic He copies the clothing style of his hero, Tommy Robinson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArchRose90 Which is exactly what Sir Les Ferdi said and got criticized for it.  Secondary to that, your banner is surely the best of the year. Priti Patel just wants you. 👍🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Holbornlolz Has he been arrested for his @UKLabour  initiation?  Seems a tad unfair. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@harryzed Not so sure there is any gloating to be had. If anything 2020 has proved to us, or let's be honest, confirmed what most of us think, is that politics in Britain is rotten to the core, no matter what colour flag they choose to wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales @SileER Interesting how we found out about George Micheal's charity work AFTER he passed away.  The bloke did it on the quiet, because he wanted to help.   Many 'celebs' could learn from this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@P_flake @fesshole Worked in a hospital back in the day, quite often had people brought in that 'accidentally' had 'stuff' in and around their balloon knot. 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fesshole Did you accidentally do this the first time or did you do it on porpoise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SLAPNTICKLE3 @EssexPR @metpoliceuk Definitely double standards going on as it was throughout the summer with the protests in which certain groups appeared to be untouchable compared to others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@singhandhissock @SherePanjabUK @charlton_school They should, but they won't. Been here with my Grandson, the schools, from our experience, do nothing. Why, I don't know, their excuses regards the amount of paper work involved to reluctance to confront parents were feeble at best.  What happens to the boy in this is pure wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tdwoodhead @Michael_Green__ @MGbutlufchappy @PhilHay_ I had read at the time that he had said " mark the black boy"   Black in Spanish is Negra as far as I'm aware.   Although I can fully understand the upset caused, is there not an element of defence for Casilla regards him saying what is natural to him in his native language?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If @LozzaFox is a  'controversial actor ' because he speaks out on his opinion, does that instantly make @AshleyBanjo a 'controversial dancer ' ?

<|startoftext|>@RITGK @LUFC There's a brain condition, in that what a person thinks is then sent as a sound or a word for the human to pronounce or sing, but it suffers along the way and the sound becomes distorted from what the brain first thought. Condition is called Comingfromboroitus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoohaAboutMaths @ThatTimWalker We're doomed then. Order more fencing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Yep, let's just shut the world down for three years till the vaccine (that may not work) gets rolled out. At the same time let people with serious illness rot in their homes, that's if the oncoming financial meltdown that will ultimately arrive hasn't already forced them out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you supporting this @JimWhite ? @AmandaHolden ?   The longer you stay silent on this element of BLM, I'll presume you  both are.  'They're blasting at the police!'   https://t.co/oLrDH0VFQ9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#covidbriefing  Give over @BorisJohnson . You're just lining us up for the bigger announcement in two weeks time.  Lockdown till April, teachers running round saying they've already been told officially that the kids WILL NOT BE RETURNING after half term.  Just say it Bozza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I scroll down your news menu out of 40 different news 'stories' 23 of them, TWENTY THREE, are covid related.  Would you @SkyNews agree you're kind of going a little over the top with your coverage?  See how the media work people. 🤔😉 #Covid19UK 🤧  https://t.co/tWqRK5d9hD<|endoftext|>
