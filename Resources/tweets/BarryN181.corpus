<|startoftext|>@CynReyes @JoeNBC @SteveKornacki Biden is still up by a little over 14,000 votes. The ones that are coming in are a trickle, and not many left.  Trump has not met the threshold to overtake Biden for several days. Many of the latest drops are like 51/49, so Trump goes up like 50 votes or so. Biden won AZ.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats I hope you have a good plan for these next two years.   MAGA nation isn’t going anywhere, and Trump (or whoever succeeds him) will be running their campaign against you 24/7.  Meanwhile, if you don’t win the Senate, McConnell won’t even let you name a post office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LandonWinter5 @KICKAHA2577 @NativeToPangaea @IlhanMN And that doesn’t have the power to change this, even if any of his lawsuits had merit (they don’t).  This was a decisive win.

<|startoftext|>@brahmresnik OK, these assholes are not going to take the tiki shit away from us regular white guys with marginal style.   I will not have it.

<|startoftext|>Great Article  https://t.co/7G0w3AoQFR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRivard @BenjaminPDixon Good programs, but need better marketing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNomikiShow @BWestbrookAZ8 @NomikiKonst I agree, but I think marketing is still the major achilles’ heel. I really think things like “defund the police” &amp; fear of “socialism” is what kills us.   The policies are fine, people like them. But if you say “defund the police”, you’re already starting the race a mile behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear hear. De-legitimize all of these hacks. Their 15 minutes have expired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei  https://t.co/C9NIK9B2lI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieserota I disagree. I think “defund the police“ killed it for a lot of hopeful races. And “Socialism” is the icing on the cake.   Mind you, these are good policies, and if you spell out the ideas without actually saying “defund the police” it’s popular.  Democrats need MARKETING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBlackMedia1 @IlhanMN Ya hate to see it. 😏😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Totally agree. @TheDemocrats need to keep this in mind for Georgia Senate runoffs over the next couple of months.   Money is going to flow in there in an endless supply, but easy to lose as some of the other expensive races showed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOLAnews @SierraClub That map can’t be right, there is no sharpie drawing on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iqtodabal @MerrittKelly1 @RBReich @JustVent6 But for the damage Marmalade Mussolini has done to the State Dept., EPA, Dept of Ed, Energy, FDA, fucking ICE!!! etc. etc., I’d agree with you.   Joe Biden has at least two years of work just to fix all of that, and executive orders.   Then take a HARD look at 2022 Senate map.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Any bets on how much money Georgia media markets are going to take in over the next 3 months?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0N3L0V3 @Nobody_special1 @johncusack Without the Senate, you can GUARANTEE no large scale changes anytime soon at all.   But Biden in there is important, because there are a lot of executive actions that need to be overturned, and a lot of agencies that need to be rebuilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDScholten All Dems. But it can be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerMolloy @BWestbrookAZ8 @clairecmc I think one thing we can take away is that a LOT of people don’t vote based on policies. If you come across as the tougher “tough guy“ you probably bag 25% of the electorate right there. We are just dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shawkins74 @PpollingNumbers I hope to hell a lot of you people realize that you have been conned. You’ve been told a fabric of lies for four years, and it’s about goddamn time that we be done with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shawkins74 @PpollingNumbers I’ll tell you why. It’s because the remaining votes are mail in ballots. Trump told people to not use mail in. His people listened. Democrats didn’t.  The reason mail in ballots are slow to count, is because you have to check the signatures, and open the envelopes, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏🏼👏🏼😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NobleBirth @mitchgx @brahmresnik It’s truly outstanding, and 100% true. Yet, there he is, still in congress. The attacks on public education for so many years are really catching up with us as a society.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BWestbrookAZ8 @DemConvention You make fair points, and I am not saying you are wrong.

That sort of thing is appealing to a whole lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BWestbrookAZ8 @DemConvention I think there is merit in trying to appeal to moderate republicans in this way. We need a giant win in November if we want change.

<|startoftext|>@EMarmande @bjz82 @caseyp__ @billmaher Trump made it political. The no mask wearing bullshit has cost tens of thousands of lives.

<|startoftext|>@krispierson @ProjectLincoln I’m happy about it, glad he is supporting Biden. But he is basically pointing out the Democrats have run the country better than Republicans over the last 60 years, or whatever? I mean, yeah George. I agree with you. 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jzink0883 @Sentient_Onion @RBReich So because the employees of Amazon pay the taxes that they are supposed to, that takes Amazon off the hook? Come on.  One man makes $9 million per hour. I’m sorry, but it’s just immoral.<|endoftext|>

Anyway increasing the tax burden on large corp. is the way to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyberinger @Public_Citizen @McDonaldsCorp Not trying to simplify causes of diabetes, or diminish the experience of people who struggle w/ it.

<|startoftext|>@PunditCatGeorge @brianstelter @SpiroAgnewGhost @BoutrousTed The lawyers he’s probably using are doing just fine. But the clerks, judges, all of the support staff.

<|startoftext|>@ejmontini @azcentral I like presidents with a sense of humor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker All I’m saying, is the 99% needs to call out the 1%. How are you supposed to not lump them all together if the 99% is going to huddle around and protect the thugs?  and yeah, I’m here for political discussions and I am a liberal. Not really an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker I don’t have any “agenda”.  I am just a private citizen that expects the police who are charged with protecting and serving to do just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker Also, I think your perspective is a little off. This is not the behavior that is expected of professional police.  Police can arrest him, they can handcuff him etc and there are a plethora of ways they are trained in which they could detain him.   These are just thugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker Attacking the press? Shooting at people who are sitting on their own private front steps? Yeah I don’t think so. This is not the country we want.   and PS, rioting looks a lot different.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker Everybody’s got problems, no one is pure as the wind driven snow. But cops are held to a higher standard because of the authority entrusted to them.   The behavior of MANY cops all across the country in the wake of #GeorgeFloyd is nothing short of appaling. MAJOR reform is needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JT3hree @St_Lucius @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker Thanks for your service btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKellvis @damphair1 @DaleHammers3 @St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker I’d be on board with that if all the good cops called out the bad cops. If the “99%” of good cops are unwilling to seperate themselves from the “1%” of “bad apples” how are we suppsed to differentiate between the two?  Good cops need to draw a line in the sand.  #professionalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@St_Lucius @JT3hree @SportsJunkie716 @BrettFavre @Moosewakker I think it’s a pretty fair assumption that a person with a burr up their ass about Colin Kaepernick in June of 2020 might have some racist feelings to work out.   Tillman died defending the very ideals Kaepernick displayed, and I bet would support the movment if he were alive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Reedy @smotus @julia_azari @FiveThirtyEight Um how about 3.   More than 5 people on a stage means that NOTHING of substance comes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smotus @NateSilver538 @julia_azari @FiveThirtyEight Great article and interesting problem. With that many candidates, a debate is not a good format. Using polling to get into the debate is probably a good threshold, but should be more town halls etc. to separate the leaders prior to the debates. God knows we have plenty of time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To say I am confused as to why the folks back home keep voting this guy in, is an understatement. What has he done for #Iowa?   @Scholten4Iowa is a breath of fresh air though, even leaving Steve King’s craziness aside.  https://t.co/cMFDugGT6v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meechebucco @CaptainsLogAz @Scholten4Iowa @allinwithchris Yeah. Also important for the rest of us to not paint with two broad of a brush. There are good people all over the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanPachkofsky @MikeRLoRusso I wouldn’t be surprised either, but it would be sure great if she would just go away and let a new generation take over the party. It’s obvious that she is viscerally hated by a lot of people, although I’m not totally sure why.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meechebucco @CaptainsLogAz @Scholten4Iowa @allinwithchris These days it seems like there’s a lot more of that “right wing rage” back home which makes me sad. I don’t know, but I suspect it’s from the vitriol spewed by right wing media creating demons to blame for anything that has ever gone wrong for people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meechebucco @CaptainsLogAz @Scholten4Iowa @allinwithchris I certainly hope not. I grew up in that district in a very small town and people pride themselves on being “Iowa nice“. While yeah, it’s not very diverse, people always have been fairly respectful of each other in the past.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m excited to read the book, I’m excited that Mr. Woodward wrote it, but I feel it just falls into the standard narrative. Trump pretty much said it all on the call, “I guess I’ll have another bad book. Oh well.” Everybody back to their respective corners. #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2: It’s a book. @realDonaldTrump + his supporters- along with a lot of other folks out there (and there’s a lot), don’t read books and aren’t going to get this message. At all. They view book people as elitist and untrustworthy. “Them, not us.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Intelligent folks like Bob Woodward speak in nuance and use subtle language. It’s time for the #media to understand that a lot of Americans, unfortunately, don’t pick up on nuance. Direct, bold, blatant language is all that is understood. Example: #YouLie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a couple of problems with this. @BillKristol @realBobWoodward   Number 1: Trump approached that recorded conversation as a PR piece. His supporters are going to say that everything he said is true, and Bob never actually refuted it. It becomes a fuzzy picture.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk Improve. I want the school board elected by the people, and I don’t want someone making a profit on our kids education. Thats pretty much the deal. Like it or don’t, I don’t care but we’re all better off with good public schools. I’d also rather the money go there than prisons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk This is my last arguement on this because it’s too big of a world out there to be spending so much time on twitter, but surely you can see the fallacy of that statement. I mean, cmon! You take resources ($) away, the school is going to suck. You add resourses it’s going to..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk  https://t.co/VaEtRK96gs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk All the more reason to devote resources to public schools, and stop allowing these for-profit schools and charter schools to siphon off of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk I don’t like “school choice” as it is marketed to me. I think people are free to choose whatever school they want, but if they are choosing something other than the public school system they need to pay for it themselves. Over 90% of Arizona kids go to public schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk No education is my single issue. I vote for Arizona politicians almost exclusively on this issue. I want more money for public schools and I don’t want my tax dollars going to private / for profit schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieRoberts @azcentral Unfollowing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_klootwyk Yeah I’m not affiliated in any way, but I have been a single issue voter since I came to Arizona. It’s exciting to have attention to an issue I care about. I’m also not a teacher I’m also not a parent, and I am in an upper tax bracket.. 🤯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaurieRoberts @azcentral @LaurieRoberts you ask the wrong questions while laying out the fix right there. You could add a bit more taxes to business and a bit more tax to the wealthy.

<|startoftext|>@LaurieRoberts @azcentral “I understand how we got here, with deep cuts to corporate taxes and far too many tax credits that suck up money...

Prop 123 was a scam, and this state government has CONSISTENTLY given our public schools the middle finger while propping up charter schools. The prime directive is always tax cuts, so lets see who pays. 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Once again, you are not the star of the show. #dealwithit  Maybe use your energy towards helping those in need?  https://t.co/IHRp4xb5pE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@megrherbert I can confirm that they were super awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano I'd like a nice distraction from all these distractions. Maybe impeachment hearings would do it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megrherbert I've got a pretty mean recipe for that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously good phrasing as well I might add...  https://t.co/ml9vVHT51Z<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reno wants Rodney @Dbacks!! Oblige them! @danbickley @Vincemarotta @JarrettGC @CallMeMaloney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dbacks thumbs down on Rodney!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billmaher Thanks @billmaher ! The stigma of single needs to be talked about. Everyone else gets their whiny soapbox, it feels great to also have one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bickley_Marotta @Vincemarotta @danbickley Your idea of Monterey is a good one. #bigsur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Dbacks are DY-NO-MITE!  https://t.co/8bkw0GZOZ3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dbacks That's the pitching performance we have been waiting for! Way to go Zach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bickley_Marotta Nailed it on the steak sauce as well. That's just good science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spiritAFA @SpiritMEC_ALPA @SpiritPilots Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlaskaMECALPA @AlaskaAir @SpiritAirlines Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bickley_Marotta This poll is obviously excluding the accuracy of the baseball strike zone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bickley_Marotta If they can make a decent deal with someone, for sure trade Greinke. He has yet to give a $200 million performance. #WhatDidRandyEarn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davematthewsbnd You guys should check out the western US. It's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great start to the season @Dbacks !! Let's keep it going! #GoDbacks #grit<|endoftext|>
