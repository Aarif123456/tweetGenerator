<|startoftext|>Pakistan keeps talking about Muslim ummah but now they look frightened on possible truce between 2 rich sunni countries, Saudi Arabia &amp; Qatar.  If this happens then Turkey will become completely isolated in sunni world &amp; Pakistan's support to Turkey will become a huge liability.  https://t.co/PTL7OhkMSY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They even tried to put forward the thought of accepting Isreal from their mouthpiece @HassanNisar and tested waters.  But if you see the comments on this video, and reaction in public you can easily make out that nobody is buying this possibility.   https://t.co/lbWwFN0SU0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thread on Pakistan    https://t.co/ufKxiQ7F0g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistani establishment is secretly itching to have similer accord with Isreal but their public stand on Isreal and indoctrination against Isreal in common Pakistani people make this shift almost impossible.  And the elephant in the room is still china so Pakistan is helpless.  https://t.co/O3YgU6cW6n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saudi Arabia has more assets in Pakistan compared to any other country.  And relations between Nawaz Sharif and Saudi Royal family are very strong.  If Pakistan establishment goes completely with China and strengthen Shia Iran then Saudi can make Pakistan pay a heavy price.  https://t.co/wRW9UmTL6N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this makes soup completely cooked to fall in for Pakistan.  Sunni majority Pakistan supporting China alliance over US in global war and it included Iran.  But Iran &amp; Saudis are fighting Shia-Sunni war and to win this war 2 sunni ruled state UAE &amp; Bahrain already joined Israel.  https://t.co/8TopNbUDHj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There may not be direct orders to do so from Saudi so but Sunni Mualvis are mobilising mobs on streets to declare Shias as Kaafirs.  Chaos are on the way, because Shias are not like Ahmadiyyas who can be pushed over just like that.  And iran always breathe down Pakistan's neck.  https://t.co/rEGkalTWPG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here the religious mess starts!  Now Pakistani establishment is aginst biggest domestic sunni leader  Nawaz Sharif and richest Sunni Country Saudi Arabia at the same time.  On top of that Imran Khan has become a fan boy of Turkey (arch rival of middle-east sunni world).  https://t.co/relMqE6KTz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On other hand China wanted to become a major player in middle east and starts using Pakistan as it's pawn.  First they announce 400B $ investment plan in Iran and then they wanted to give a shock to Saudi Arbia for being in US camp.  So Shah Mahmood Qureshi¬†episode happened!  https://t.co/dPDyLeazzH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now things start getting worse on religious front i.e. Islam the main piller of Pakistan's existence.  Army establishment decides to go with Imran Khan and tries to find new ways out.  In this hiest they started relying too much on China and suddenly became anti Saudi Arabia.  https://t.co/a2hN6S20kC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why we saw Nawaz Sharif's eviction from jail in November and his transfer to London against the wish of Handsome Imran Khan.  But after that things didn't go as expected by Pakistani Army's wish.  Nawaz Sharif stood firm on segregation of powers between govt &amp; Army stand.  https://t.co/6K6HMfeavu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Nawaz Sharif was tired of mickey mouse game he has been playing with Army for 3 decades.  Though he was brought by same Army but he grew spine while being in office of Prime Minister and realized without throwing Army from Pakistan govt offices PMLN &amp; Pakistan have no future.  https://t.co/rDCpR2aoGk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was brought for following reasons!  1. To dislodge Nawaz Sharif with a puppet. 2. Increase Pakistan's global acceptance with already famous new PM face eductaed in western world.  But within 1 year Pakistan Army realised his utility is over so they started parleys with Sharif.  https://t.co/Liv0QYotow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conflict between Punjabi Sunni leader Nawaz Sharif and Army establishment has tossed all religious, social &amp; political eqautions in Pakistan in the air.  Though Army establishment tried to persuade Sharif last year in Nov-Dec for truce but he was adment on Civilian supremacy.  https://t.co/nnmTfBM4VA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But quickly after the independence things started to change but still hatred among Shia and Sunni was not on the groud level.  But Punjabi Sunnis systematically snatched powers from Shias especially Mujahir Shias who were running the Pakistan due to better Urdu &amp; education.  https://t.co/2esIDcgDKX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets start with first factor Islam!  Islam is the core of Pakistan and it's doctrine. But Islam in Pakistan was very different than Islam in Middle East, Turkey or Iran.  That's why at the time of independence Brits successfully planted a Shia leader on sunni majority country.  https://t.co/0yHlkXzO0S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But due to various big global events and Pakistan Amry's refusal to loosen grip on Pakistan's internal and external matters has created a new and most dangerous mess in Pakistan's history.  And due to this 7 factors mentioned above have started conflicting with each other.  https://t.co/ob7YVJJQrP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan's domestic politics is dominated and driven by following factors!  1. Islam 2 Military 3. Geo Political importance &amp; location of Pakistan 4. Atomic Bomb 5. Military industrial complex 6. Punjabi dominance on everything 7. India a forver enemy.  #PakistanPolitics  https://t.co/4U5MYmQswf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know how many people in India are keeping tab on dangerous turn #Pakistan domestic politics is taking due to various external &amp; internal reasons.

<|startoftext|>It is very sad to see how India keeps loosing narrative war on every front.  Internal or external, we keep sleeping till we start feeling suffocated.  India has been seen as a enemy country in Nepal despite being main employment centre, dharmic sibling, biggest trade partner etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By this statement he is trying to kill 2 birds with 1 bullete,  1. He is again trying to paint India as dharmic cheater Country (after geographical one)  2. Motivating Nepali Hindus to denounce Ayodhya as birth place of Lord Ram and discredit Ram Mandir Temple &amp; movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Communists in Nepal never bothered about Lord Ram or Ram Mandir in Ayodhya till way to build a grand temple was not cleared by Supreme Court of India.  And now they are raking up this issue to dilute the importance of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the hearts &amp; minds of Nepali Hindus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What K P Oli said is a part of narrative build by Jihadi-Commununist nexus to confuse Hindus in Nepal and discredit new Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.  Indian government has to become tough on this pawn of China and who is peddling anti Hindu narative by dividing their faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimesNow @SachinPilot @sumanthraman Will he also count what Congress gave to Rahul and Priyanka.  This shows their attitude as they think party gave and not earned by person concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@33X6ClKNEDQVmhV @TimesNow @asadowaisi Typo! But why you wrote your father's name while replying to my tweet.

<|startoftext|>@IndoPac_Info @TwitterSupport They have shadow banned millions of account criticising left and far left world over.  And China is the last bastion of Communists.  Twitter should disclose it's commitment &amp; devotion towards Communism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimesNow @asadowaisi And Pakistanis will believe what Indian radio broadcaster will say just because it is in urdu.  @asadowaisi better you eat Aurangabad famous paan rather than advising Indian government on its communications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we expect something big out of this meeting?  @Anirudh_Astro ji you predicted something about @sundarpichai?  Is it related to that?  @narendramodi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Maharashtra gave overwhelming mandate to Congress and NCP to form a government.  And it was never a mandate for BJP-Shivsena combine with Devendra Phadnavis as their CM.  Right Yashvant Ji.  #RajasthanPoliticalCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrontalAssault1 And two terrorists likned with ISIS arrested in Pune by NIA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Breaking!

<|startoftext|>If it happens then it will be the biggest nightmare for CCP's China.  Russia is not the biggest challenge for US rather Russia is victim of defence  technology espinose by China.

<|startoftext|>@Chellaney If US puts sanctions on China then this so called masterstroke from Beijing will become a joke.  So plz do not always praise China as if they are the one who know strategy and Indians are stupid.  Mr. Chellaney you have serious inferiority complex.<|endoftext|>
