<|startoftext|>@JradRabel I agree. I just don’t understand ads like that.   It’s like whats black culture? Blues music? Well, the guitar is a spanish instrument. Is it rap music?

<|startoftext|>@___fr06 @CeJayGe @regularcorrect @WashTimes It does matter. Because they null/void your claim of said privilege. This conversation is mind numbing and stupid.

<|startoftext|>@niecyma2 @CeJayGe @regularcorrect @WashTimes Anecdotal. Not every scenario is the same. I mean OJ Simpson would have been convicted for example.

<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics CNN playing the race card again. Anyone shocked?   More minorities reportedly voted for Trump this time. Many blacks are Democrats. The race was a Republican vs democrat.

<|startoftext|>@Phil61044386 @ABC Nazi? You just called Thomas Sowell an Uncle Tom? 😂 You’re the #racist.  https://t.co/RPoM2hlY1n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubySJM @KarenAttiah Just watch it. He’s addressing many topics. Yes, he is an economist too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @Phil61044386 Racism sells. Keep pushing is ABC!   Buying and selling fear!   The #media has a stake in #racism.  They profit from it. If the media went away we wouldn’t have half the “divide” we have now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAJTOURE @icecube He’s referencing #ThomasSowell.   When did white folks become so brazen to call a black man an Uncle Tom? This amazes me.  https://t.co/BL0P0xUcwl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil61044386 @KimCJorgensen @nytimes Uncle Tom? Wow. Being a highly regarded intellectual, supremely educated and actually knowing what one is talking about is being an Uncle Tom? White people saying this is astonishing. I highly doubt you could hold a candle to this man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SwaggyZ33 @CNN @donlemon Again not quite voter suppression.   Don’t commit a felon and you won’t have this issue. There is nuance to this as well. It’s not just someone literally preventing someone from voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaggyZ33 @CNN @donlemon You say false? 😂 There is only one definition. It’s not an opinion. No one is being prevented to vote. You can vote early and have ample time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/I811yklITq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaggyZ33 @CNN @donlemon It’s quite literally not. Additionally, you would have to assume you know who is voting for who. At any rate...waiting in line is not suppression. You still cast your vote. You act like waiting in line is something new. This is Democrat’s attempt to push mail in voting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GatriotP @Booglitarian Undergrad, Masters and a Law Degree. She’s aight. Ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatriotP @Booglitarian Yeah, I vowed not to start with FB and my sister got me on it years back. to be honest I try to see am I really getting anything out of it. My wife hates it. She blames social media for a lot of society’s current ails. She’s not wrong either. Time/energy management is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian @GatriotP But then I have decent interactions like this and I second guess haha. Sheesh. What a world we live in now days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian @GatriotP I think I’ll pull the plug completely one day or at least consolidate to only one  I always think to myself I could be doing something more productive in real life than arguing with a faceless person over the internet to try to get my point across<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatriotP @Booglitarian Everything aside. Many of my successful friends aren’t on social media unless it helps them with business.   It’s a time waster. Most importantly. Toxic interactions. Data collection. Etc.  I’ve considered just deleting it all together.   Thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AmyConeyBarrett is at the top of her game. She kills the lefts narrative entirely.   In every manner obliterates it.   YET, the left doesn’t care as she doesn’t ascribe to their doctrine.   Let that sink in.   #Democrats #hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian Oh and very important, find a wife who has good money sense and believes in the same values with that regard. My wife is very money savvy. Im lucky that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian Oh and learn about money! Sorry I just love talking about it and being a cheerleader! We all can succeed. People just don’t have the skill set or will. But it’s a available to anyone who wants it. Have a good one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian I have been in real estate 15 years now. I own my own company. A friend who couldnt pay his heat bill in his 20s now owns about 50 properties &amp; does pretty well. focused/positive. Stay away from negative ppl. Do it with integrity/ listen to ppl who are succeeding in said areas.👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian Remember there is no guarantees too. But this is the best route for take. Real estate creates a lot of wealth too. Passive income. Set yourself up for the future. Best wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian My wife’s parents invested and they are retired and get 300k on dividends a year alone.   Trust your gut and the process. Have someone who knows what they are doing handle it or guide you that you trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EDeacsa @Lulsace @EvolutionGlobe @kosovays Portrait of yourself is fitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian Yes. 30% a month is taken and invested into various stocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian Always invest first.   Rich people invest first and more.   Poor people don’t understand that concept.   30% of my income goes into investing no matter how much I make.  And I always live below my means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EDeacsa @Lulsace @EvolutionGlobe @kosovays You guys call yourself progressive yet you reference laws no longer applicable and summon grievances from centuries ago that have nothing to do with you with regard to governing now and you’re probably a white person 😂 stay in your lane.

<|startoftext|>@smellycarney We have to remind teens not to eat Tide pods but let them vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HornballChris @CNN Ppl like you think the only white people are racist and everything is racist. I grew up in a black neighborhood I can promise you that’s not the case. Also I’ve been a minority in another country. So open your eyes shut your mouth/use your brain stop being divisive at every turn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EDeacsa @Lulsace @EvolutionGlobe @kosovays Slavery still continues in AFRICA and other countries TODAY. Slavery has been going on for thousands of years.   America which today is so famously called being built on white supremacy(which it wasn’t)ABOLISHED slavery. 600k+ men died abolishing slavery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EDeacsa @Lulsace @EvolutionGlobe @kosovays After hundreds and hundreds of years of slavery and it’s being fairly new to the Trans Atlantic. Yes. The Barbary slave trade(Arabs/Africans owning white slaves), slavery in the Middle East all the way back to Mesopotamia.  Slavery was abolished relatively fast by a WHITE nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HornballChris @CNN You just can’t wait to call anything and everything racist with 0 evidence of it. Wonder why that is 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MiteiRober @CNN Surely but we don’t know the situation and the media is using it to push a narrative. There is no proof literally ZERO this had to do with race. Same as George Floyd &amp; many of the others. It’s like anytime something happens to a black person it’s automatically racism.   It’s not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmadjemon @AmericaHellYes @CNN Not committing crimes is “about white”?   Sounds pretty racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmadjemon @AmericaHellYes @CNN Don’t commit crimes 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiteiRober @CNN 🤦‍♂️ Sad you people vote. You love your identity politics. First off you need proof it’s due to race. Which you don’t have. Second, there are no “systemic race laws” about walking a cuffed individual along side a horse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Booglitarian My friend got banned for this...”hateful conduct”   Twitter is kind of a joke. They have mad amounts of porn and Antifa uses it to mobilize quickly, etc but ban someone for something this benign,  https://t.co/SvUkz8C3BW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CimaronH @CholeraFan Agree 100%. I recall teenage punk rockers talking about punching Nazis when there actually were none it was more just a rallying cry and a reason to be aggressive with no real sense of what they were talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CholeraFan “You’re not this if you’re aren’t this” 😂 All group tribal/thinking.  Says the groups preaching about equality. How ironic.   #BLM are just racists/communists who want to be the ones barking the orders.  F U c K #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crybabybtzzz People mad about things that happened 500 + hundred years ago with the verosity as if it happened to them personally and 5 minutes ago 😂 people are bored, stupid and need to get a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite part about ppl who speak about racism &amp; how everything is, is when they pretend that when they are in large groups of their “own”, they don’t have the same prejudices towards a minority that comes across their path.  #racism #BLM  Black ppl are NOT excluded from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray Darn white supremacy at it again. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN What a crock. Where are these supposed white supremacists???   The only terrors in the streets are under the umbrella of #Antifa and #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProletariatRis1 @LaCosaNostraDam @Picus_Blog @emberblaine @ndrewkellyborel @JoeBiden All your communist leaders killed millions of their own people.   Also, how does he know you’re even white? Lol You could be a number of things. These folks are parrots. Their ideology is rooted in jealousy and ego. Collectivist group thinkers. Not individuals. How embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProletariatRis1 @LaCosaNostraDam @Picus_Blog @emberblaine @ndrewkellyborel @JoeBiden You people literally think everyone is a white supremacist if they don’t concede to your philosophy with literally 0 evidence. You’re lacking any sense of rational thought in an attempt to push your agenda. Mao killed millions. Lenin killed millions. Your plight is lacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaCosaNostraDam He’s like one of the nicest people! Damn white people moving about being white and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaCosaNostraDam @ReginaA1981 She sounds like a MoRoN.  Proof black people use racism to try to garner power. This is a slow persons take.  Not evey white person is a racist the same as not every POC isn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurok_kurok74 @LaCosaNostraDam @zoecalp @CoryBooker Biden using the incident from Charlottesville to push the tired narrative? You have BLM and Antifa burning and looting.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Biden you still using incident from Charlottesville to push your tired narrative? You have BLM and Antifa burning and looting. Attacking people in the streets.

<|startoftext|>@RamonAlonsoJr @LaCosaNostraDam @jamesfunk202 @Christinefor24 @AndrewYang Why is everyone who is white a racist? Seriously answer this question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmarreck @blucollrpatriot @MsBlaireWhite You are wrong. These groups that you’re talking about are very small and the number of them are declining. They aren’t out in the streets rioting and looting. And being violent. How convenient for you to not see this. I doubt you have ever seen a white supremacists in your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmarreck @MsBlaireWhite You’re kidding right?Then so is white supremacy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BApplebelly @_NiaJoy_ You guys don’t know anything about the law. For it to be murder it has to show intent. The police were indeed shot at first. There is nuance to this that matters more than a stupid meme oversimplifying it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@__miisst @johncardillo You implied by speaking Spanish that you are not white. 😂 It’s patently ignorant. You did that. Not me.   Just be white. Being white is cool too. White people speak Spanish. It’s their native language. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__miisst @johncardillo Lol 😂 Exactly! I hope they buy it so you can fit in!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaCosaNostraDam @brizzle1995 @johncardillo You said nothing about race. The fact they brought up race says more about them. Anyone can be a criminal period.

<|startoftext|>@Ramenshaman69 @LaCosaNostraDam Being white has nothing to do with it. Unless you’re a racist. Which it sounds like you are. Being respectful is a virtue as I’m sure you want to be respected. More people should learn this. Maybe you should start bud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaCosaNostraDam @fleccas Interesting that a lot of these people are anti religion yet seem to have found one in this “movement”. They are die hard worshippers. #BlackLivesMatter terrorizes innocent people.<|endoftext|>
