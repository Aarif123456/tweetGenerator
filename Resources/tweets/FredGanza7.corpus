<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ This this this ✊🏾✊🏾!  The media is so representative *only* of the white community that when it comes to spotting serious flaws like racism (subtle or obvious) the media simply are blind. Or at worse (though likely) the media white middle class simply don’t care! It’s a tragedy❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@planetjedward Haha to be honest after my plea for @planetjedward to speak up against white supremacy and fact @Keir_Starmer courted a racist white supremacist today on #lbc - I will take this post as their response!   Noones taking this away from me!  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ #SayNoToRacism #BlackLivesMatter ✊🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Haha meanwhile the leader of the opposition came out all guns blazing that he was proud that it was labour wo pioneered the deportation scheme!  Black peoples in UK let’s just say it how it is: we’re in this fight against racism largely alone! The media/right wing/Keir dont care  https://t.co/EzkHDOzW8C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl And let’s all be observant for his racist Cheerleaders 📣 who come out in his defence!  Also the way the middle class white media blissfully sat all Sunday sipping Prosecco and only came online to moan that London is now tier 3 and how upset they are - let that sink in also🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redflareinfo @PatrickWDixon - it gets worse - how did LBC fail their due diligence? Bringing on someone who’s definitely NOT from Cambridge. Who is also affiliated to neoNazi groups!?  And is this crime of “association/shared platform” similar to the one levelled against someone recently?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m sorry but this explanation/justification doesn’t even make sense - did Keir register during the interview that what was said racist and a white supremacy conspiracy? If he did- what stopped him addressing it LIVE?   This after the fact statement is I’m afraid UNSATISFACTORY👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Please ask them for us Patrick !?  I’m old enough to remember being told that it’s essential that we SHOULD listen to complaints and concerns of minorities (Jews) - I remember thinking “absolutely”. But why isn’t this privilege allowed to be extended to other minorities 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hapoelorient @andrewfeinstein Careful - the Labour Party NewLeadership might suspend you (if you’re a member) for speaking fir the wrong side/team... they suspended #NaomiWimborneIdrissi for being Jewish but an advocate for Jeremy ...  Meanwhile 💯 agree with your statement! Solidarity ❤️✊🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraSmithCrewe @LBC Strong “opposition”’from who is the question!  Her majesty’s humble opposition as declared a policy of abstain at all costs, if faced with antiblack/Islam racism - nod at all costs!   This is the reality of where we are! A governing right wing party, and a Tory-lite opposition🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman Do you guys also remember when they tried to dig into a card Jeremy gave boris for Christmas- alleging that there were AS tones?  There has been every effort to “imagine what Jeremy meant/said/thought” in absence of proof and evidence.   But for Keir, even with evidence: excuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis I dont understand why we need to be charitable to him.  He quite literally allowed a white supremacy racist ideology to be voiced on NATIONAL radio to millions of listeners. His silence gave it a pass✅  Sometimes to help a friend you call out their mistakes not give them charity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis I understand the circumstances you’re describing, however the challenge I’m making is that today the example we’ve seen was NOT subtle, it was plain and obvious. Also Keir has declared himself the person who is going to ROOT OUT all racism - yet today he deliberately failed🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnunns The fact they seem to think this is an adequate response to Keirs blindspot to antiblack antiBAME racism is truly insulting to those of us who face antiBAME racism  Theres something very #AnimalFarm about this delayed explanation/justification! Some animals more equal than others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel_Grigg @NadiaWhittomeMP Good question 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla @siennamarla @Keir_Starmer had the chance to “reject” racist conspiracy theory live when it happened he FAILED to do so.   How utterly thick and gullible do they think we are? This is not #AnimalFarm where the pigs commit wrongs and then justify their wrongdoing the next day❌👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemgilbert Meanwhile many moons ago Keir and his circle of cheerleaders were the same characters hounding another politician for having a “blindspot” for racism, for being slow to react, for FAILING to act steadfastly!  The hypocrisy stinks to high heaven and back - reading this tweet❌👎🏾❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon For real! I read this tweet from them over and over and still struggled to comprehend how a grown person came up with it!  It is actually disturbing 👎🏾👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@le_bassett Interesting comment, but I’d challenge it by saying: I don’t think the issue is Jeremy cult. Ultimately it was the ideas that Jeremy brought to the forefront of politics. It would have transformed the nation.  The weakness is that there seems noone able to carry the ideas forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner @AngelaRayner are you aware of the white supremacy racism stuff that occur on LBC today involving the Labour Party leadership @Keir_Starmer   Do you have something to say about the situation? (FYI Silence is complicity)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Wow that’s huge!   Nice one mate! ✊🏾✊🏾🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon They really love keeping us in suspense dont they?   I’m pretty sure I’ve just seen Lammy tweeting stuff aimed at Tories. And Angela was online tweeting to Ash re: Islamaphobia... we know they’re online 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Before I cut off twitter for the day - can someone confirm:  Has @DavidLammy @AngelaRayner @lisanandy etc etc called out this white supremacy racism yet? And called for the suspension of people who bring the party into disrepute by being on the same platform as racists?  🤔 hmm  https://t.co/uM7lKHppy0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @planetjedward - politicians have failed to condemn and call out white supremacy racism.   I’ve known you guys to be steadfast in defending what is right - can you please spread the word that white supremacy racism is wrong: ALL the time!  Kind regards,  Fred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenriNyakarundi @KigaliList @rrainfo It’s amazing how adding statistics 📈 and analysis makes the picture clearer!   Imagine a 10fold increase - meanwhile salaries have not risen, Covid19 is ruining every aspect of peoples lives, food costs are rising...none ngo lets increase house costs by 10fold!   Rwanda urinziza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews let me get this straight: LBC/NickF should lose their jobs for platforming white supremacy racist. But Keir can get away with courting a white supremacist racist by merely making a retrospective clarification.  If the regulator should shut down LBC, voters should SHUT DOWN Keir  https://t.co/YtlnXOwTm4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samfoster99 Good, I agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunny_hundal @michaeljswalker Lol - I love the pace of change with which we now DO NOT require potential PMs to challenge racism! Or share platforms with racists ...  Couple of weeks ago Diane was dragged for a zoom call, last year labour lost election bcoz JC “shared platforms”. But now Keir can do both🤷🏾‍♂️😂  https://t.co/jMNqEYoIa3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the kind of “to be honest”/ “to be fair” to XYZ....  That I’m prepared to accept!  The failure to call out/challenge white supremacy conspiracy theories is UNACCEPTABLE!  I cannot believe the solution to woo Red Wall is for the party to adopt white supremacy theories🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@e500v @RichRevol QWhite interesting indeed that middle class England has come out to explain *for Keir* how Keir was feeling at the time.  They tried the “Nick was speaking over and Keir couldn’t hear”- that was debunked So then they tried the “he may have been flustered” They going the xtra mile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samfoster99 Is this supposed to make us commend keirs failure to call out racism?  Are you commending Keir in his failure to address racism?   If you’re not white, how are you supposed to have confidence in Keir following today’s lack of leadership?   Also I thought he wanted to root racism?  https://t.co/q6TU9owvgw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerNF @0Calamity Thank You! I appreciate your answer to my question.   I would expect people who are indeed antiracist to say exactly what you said you would do: CALL it out! The privilege of being a politician gives him extra responsibility for doing exactly that! He could one day be a PM🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerNF @0Calamity They do say silence is complicit!   Would u act similarly if presented with white supremacy racism?   Today’s actions (lack thereof) on LBC by Keir are equivalent to Trumps ProudBoys moment  Both were presented with racist ideologies, both pretended they didn’t hear the question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerNF @0Calamity Normalised in the mind and attitude of a QC in human rights! Let that sink in for a bit   The person in this interview is a “forensic” former QC in human rights! He won his ticket on his ambitious plans to “root out racism” in the labourparty! Yet here we are.. he’s blind to it🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/TGEL6pUMLi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project_Coup In short yes @Project_Coup  Recall, #LBC is that one unique channel that once upon a time employed with pleasure Farage and K Hopkins. There was once a time where: Nick Ferrari, Farage, K Hopkins would all have sessions within 24hrs of each other!  Imagine the crowds that draws🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesEFoster Dont let it take over mate!   Collect receipts, pause, log off - go for a walk/jog/   Return later to deal with anything you wish to deal with!   Solidarity ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis why is it hard for anyone who see/hears racism to say “excuse but I disagree with ur comment”  If you are walking along and see a child fall of a bike, are you going to walk past because it’s “awkward” to stop and help?  This is SO WEAK, jellyfish have stronger backbone than this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labourlewis Kudos to @labourlewis for commenting - but I challenge Clive to directly seek clarification from his party’s leadership!  Does Keir recognise racism and white supremacy conspiracies, does he agree or disagree with them! (Note silence is complicity). We deserve the right to know🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elusiveman01 Haha @UKLabour and @Keir_Starmer inner circle are giving us the RoyalFamily William-Kate vs Harry-Meghan drama!  If Harry visits a war memorial on Remembrance Day - apparently Harry is undermining William!  If Meghan looks beautiful without makeup, she’s making Kate look ugly🤷🏾‍♂️🤣  https://t.co/yJpCJld95e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Today on #LBC we saw #KeirStarmer ‘s equivalent to trumps ProudBoys moment   Keir was presented with an ideology/statement that he KNOWS full well is racist and has racist intent - he deliberately failed to comment on it!  BAME people voting/cheering Keir - HOW YOU DOIN?🤷🏾‍♂️❌👎🏾👎🏾  https://t.co/bWjHk1kLOv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ @Keir_Starmer I thought he took that “unconscious bias training” course and @UKLabour reassured us that he had “passed” the course! Based on this interview today I would suggest: 1) either he failed or  2) he’s indeed racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solma_ahmed @Keir_Starmer Today @Keir_Starmer simply confirmed my concerns about his attitude towards racism directed at BAME people - he is blind to it!  It is frankly incredible that the crime levelled against Jeremy that JC had a “blindspot for AS” is the same problem Keir &amp; his cheerleaders have🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Haha 😂. I want to see the peoples who called Jeremy out for “standing on a platform with racists” to be the ones that lead this argument...  Without further ado therefore, all those who formed ChangeUk et al and the media - the stage is all yours!   Round of applause everybody🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misslucyp 2/ where are they to call out the racism? The fact that Keir is “sharing platforms” with a racist presenter and indeed agreeing with a white supremacy conspiracy theory?  Where are the journalists who were there to provide receipts against Jeremy?   Answer: They’re NOT bothered🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/GK0lLcyR2N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misslucyp In many ways, what is interesting is that the Keir cheerleaders are PROVING (to the gullible and naive who needed *more* evidence) that all their previous cries about “racism must be rooted out” was partisan and politically and ideologically motivated!  Where’s Hodge/Riley et al?  https://t.co/2DOQZw3hxs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasebyjason @nowt2tweet Because I agree with what you’ve just said - let me just follow you. I think we could get on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani @Keir_Starmer Probably because  1) he’s sympathetic to what the lady said - which makes Keir a racist frankly  2) the desperation for red well bigots means labours new policy is agreeing with racist remarks  3) there’s a pattern here from Keir of objective ignorance to BAME racism  That’s all  https://t.co/LSqXELlSSu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwalker99 @samfoster99 Moreover it’s not just blissful ignorance; weekly Keir engages with a presenter NickF who is hostile to non-white people, who emboldens racist! One could very accurately say: #KeirStarmer shared platform with racist people and fails to condemn racism! But the cheerleaders are🤐🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwalker99 @samfoster99 Too distressed to hear a racist conspiracy theory.  It’s incredible and breathtaking how shallow these people are. Fair dos Jeremy was called out for being on stages with AS people; but today Keirites are out in public trying to explain away Keirs blissful ignorance to racism🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwalker99 @samfoster99 Haha 😂, it’s only Monday, and #Keirstarmer cheerleaders 📣 are already having an abNORMAL one...  In ones desperate need to defend &amp; absolve Keir, he initially lied that NF was talking over and Keir couldnt hear; that was disproven. Now he suggests Keir was too distressed🤣🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Not even when she pretends that racism is a myth and that black peoples exaggerate their experiences!? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trickyjabs Hmm surely not the £3 which sounds like it would be affordable to most people - the rich and the less wealthy... on other hand the £900++ sounds like it’s divisionism - if you’re wealthy welcome, if your poor - fuck off?!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC So they’re not being suspended then? For bringing the party into disrepute?  Right .... so only MPs and members suspected to be friendly to Jeremy get suspended ....... got it.   How trés Stalinist🤷🏾‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misanthropicc92 Did you catch the bit where Keir is presented with “white replacement theory” by a racist white person, and Keir  blissfully leaves the white replacement theory unchallenged- in doing so Keir deliberately gives credence to the theory!  So Keir basically encourages racist theories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman Is this the same (racist white supremacy) lady .... that Sir Abstentions was speaking to ? And he deliberately and specifically failed to address the white supremacy and white replacement theory?  Sir Abstentions shows his *colours* AGAIN, yet people tell me to give him chances👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AssedBaig Your son is a good lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman The way centrists and Keir cheerleaders 📣 have come out attacking peace and justice initiative should be the biggest sign people who really want a change need to realise it’s time to do something about the messed up electoral landscape!  Its time to raise profile of candidates🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Haha so hilarious how these Charles and Camilla alibis are being wheeled out.   One alibi says camilla is the most thoughtful person that has ever lived and that she only does something when it’s RIGHT: so cheating behind #PrincessDiana back was “thoughtful and right”?🤣🤷🏾‍♂️❌👎🏾  https://t.co/QmHyVfGKYW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla Hahaha 🤣 what a shocker   White replacement theory not challenged by Sir Abstentions- @siennamarla are you at all surprised?   If you are, that’s hilarious  https://t.co/T3iqshjMPy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 Solidarity !!  The trolls - they're just noise.  Stay safe, see you soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon For that, sincerely I am grateful. And I am glad that going forward you recognise that her noise on racism is truly disingenuous!  And the credit that Keir's NewLeadership want to enshrine her with regards to fight against racism is: 1) insulting to black people 2) breathtaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Henceforth I’ll be observing the way you’ll be calling out Hodge for her links to antiblack racism from which she’s made financial capital — I know you’re steadfast against “all forms of racism” - you’ve reassured me of this previously.   Actions speak louder than words!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon 🙄Patrick, Have a good night.   I’m done talking about a woman who has financially benefitted from seeing people who look like me (black) in SA abused and refused their human rights! If she’s the kind of member you and Keir want labour to have - that says more about you guys. End<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 @lordofintent Well said ...  Do you want to know a secret?  They DO NOT care about you, me or anyone (BAME) who is not their friend: whether they’re friendly due to personal relationships or financially.   All the “racism (AS) needs to be rooted out” choir have lost their vocal cords today🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Omg you’re really not getting the point!  I’ll try again for the final time: 1) Hodge has a KNOWN and PROVEN link to antiblack racism in apartheid South Africa: she made money from it 2) for some reason; this truth is not investigated or highlighted by the media - shock horror🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Lol  Do you know what, I’m good. Hodge has ruined the end of this day for me, so I want to end this conversation.  As I said: the fact you’re here trying to justify not being aware of someone’s links to antiblack racism, but you kno every allegation levelled against JC is telling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Yes what you choose to see - the issue pertaining to apartheid has been there for DECADES!  And you should be asking yourself why you werent aware of it, rather than trying to justify your ignorance of the facts.  1) the links to antiblack racism are real and factual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Haha Patrick seriously - are you kidding me right now?  I don’t really care about her and Jeremys drama -   Making money from discriminating and killing black people is not a side issue: it’s a core issue I’m afraid!   Once again, here we have black experiences being belittled🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick- this information has not magically appeared tonight because I mentioned it.   It’s been available for decades! The so called “left” that Hodge loves to malign has been saying it for decades - did you listen to them? If you had you would have known about this sooner! Alas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon The point I’m making is:   The factionalism of labour leads everyone who are vested on either side of the trenches to be blind to the issues within their ranks!  Hodges family ties to antiblack racism IS KNOWN by the black community! If people bothered to listen to us; you’d know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hodge is not exactly an obscure name in LabourParty ... if anyone was bothered to read her up - they would have done so! It starts by not taking people at face value ...  Anyway, let’s not ruin this Sunday any further. In conclusion the biggest antiracism mouth has racism links🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Didnt you just say you weren’t aware of Hodges apartheid racism links ? How can you say you’ve fairly critiqued her if you were oblivious to her financial links to antiblack racism? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  You were blissfully unaware of her links to antiblack racism.🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Fact you weren’t even aware of it is a clear sign of what is desired by bad faith factors - create hysteria about others whilst hiding their own horrendous history.   There’s more than meets the eye to everything that’s going on; I encourage you to scrutinise all parties equally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Some of us are tired of seeing Trojan horses preaching a gospel that they don’t themselves follow. And it is even more hurtful when people like you and others who say you’re anti all that’s bad only focusing on one side of things - Hodges apartheid links are factual - period🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Surprise surprise - so you weren’t aware?  Has it ever occurred that just because people shout loudest about racism it doesn’t make them angels?  Yes fact of the matter is: Hodge and her family were financially invested in antiblack racism called apartheid!   Read it up🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m simply asking you a question?  Hodge hasn’t just said “blue collar-ish things” - she’s made money from racism! And has the audacity to preach about racism affecting herself   Spell it out 📣📣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon lol are you trying to school me on whether or not M Hodge has any links to apartheid SouthAfrica and whether or not her family has made money from antiblack racism?   Are we really going on this expedition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Anyway like I said - I really don’t want to argue (again) about the state of racism in the Labour Party!   Back to your name-dropped comment about the left labour like Kerry Anne etc. (JC allies) pitting minority against minority - look closer to home: Keir et al🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!  The end 👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Where did you drop names like ... let’s say Margaret Hodge and the wealth she’s begotten from apartheid South Africa - aka racism ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Like I don’t even want to argue about this (again🧐)- it’s so irritating when the topic of racism comes up and for some reason current labour cheerleaders always want to paint🎨the labour left as the problem!  It’s NOT labour left in power, it’s not labour left pitting minorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon You deliberately banged on about Kerry Anne and Galloway... Keirs name not anyone allied to Keir featured in your rebuke this evening.  Upon me commenting you’ve detailed further to then include “left in general” - your initial rebuke was squarely aimed at JeremyC alliance! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I have seen Keirs cheerleaders do more to pit minority against minority than I have seen the people youve alleged  Virtually every sanctimonious Keir cheerleader who was vocal about AS has been quiet about antiblack and Islamophobia racism! That’s what pitting minority looks like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon The “left” “pit minority against minority”  I don’t know whether to laugh or not Patrick - and what does the right labour do about minorities ? Treat them equally?   It’s actually quite insulting to see this take from you considering we’ve had debates about this topic previously  https://t.co/3s5wWjUn59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duncanjdavis A lot f truth was said in @duncanjdavis tweet!   A LOT of truth!  Also note how the people who were shouting about end to racism (AS) have all gone mysteriously quite... I guess ending racism was not what they actually wanted.  It was operation: end JC  https://t.co/Cbbt3K7Spz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer The fact that blairites have a carnival whenever Keir opens his mouth - even if all he’s saying is “labour will abstain AGAIN” says all there is to say about Keir and his ideology.  Keir is the macron of UK - the big pretender who comes in and unleashes madness 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorganPaulett Has anyone noticed how the people who were shouting from rooftops about “kinder/ better/“ politics and putting an end to racism (AS).... are today either 1) mute and silent because they clearly don’t care about racism across the board or 2) are actually annoyed at idea of “peace”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer To be honest - that appears to be the only solution to what’s going on - it’s very clear that the current “left voices” are like oil and water - they just will just not mix - no matter the amount of shaking, there remains an unbridgeable rift! Keir isn’t going to bridge it🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer Exactly! I think it’s going to be more of a think tank... And also I suspect a way of reminding the likes of Sir Abstentions that the core values are still stark and that millions of people agree with him. It will most likely also function as “soft power” pressure group I think🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer It’s not quite a new party from what I can see and gather.   It’s the ultimate Jeremy - focusing on the real issues - that actually cause hardship for the vast majority of people: inequality, poverty, poor wages, racism etc.   And he’s right: it doesn’t have to be this way at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukasMukasPukas They’re mad at the idea of “peace” 🤨🤨🧐  Interesting reactions from “normal” people 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl I think they’ve done more than just support this government - they helped to ELECT this government! Lest we all forget that many Keir cheerleaders 📣- actively campaigned against labour last year! Seats like Kensington were lost by 150 to tories because labour right chose LibDems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn I wonder what dictatorial suspension @Keir_Starmer and his butchers are going to put on peoples for talking about/discussing the #JeremyCorbyn project now...  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  We’ve already seen Labour block charity donations to poor children overseas, this will fall within the bracket?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hxmzaliy Let him drown in the hot water - it I what it is - self inflicted madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmcdonnellMP Haha 😂  JohnMcDonnell the hype man!   I’m here for this!  https://t.co/ViGCG0EJOa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @emmadentcoad Labourleft need to be prepared to suffer temporary pain, to achieve greater goal! 1) oust rubbish lab MPs even if it means a Tory MP holds the seat for one election cycle!   Labour right; now that I think about it were bloody smart last year! They kno they can unseat shit tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @emmadentcoad In the end what labour right did was 1) they decided that enough was enough and that 2) if they have to burn the party to bring down JC and prevent this nation being a truly kinder nation they would take the risk! They voted for Tories/LibDems to achieve their end goal: end of JC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @emmadentcoad Also frankly at this rate Labour/Tory - what actually is the difference between Keirs dictatorship and abuse of power and tories? We are getting Keir abstaining (therefore voting) for your y policies anyway! So keirs labour is Tory approval!  Labour right need to be ousted! 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl At end of the day, what you have suggested is EXACTLY what the labour right did to labour left in last years election - take what happened to Kensington? Labour right got behind LibDems and caused @emmadentcoad (left) to lose seat by 150 to tories!   We need to get SMART 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @thetwerkinggirl you have touched onto something which we in UK have failed to clock onto for ages! we are so busy with toying with “voting for lesser of 2 evils” than actually thinking “hold on a min, what if we get a STRONG well KNOWN local candidate to run as independent”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Baddiel Arcuri actually got herself a pay cheque &amp; business promotion after spreading her lower limbs!  Not really sure what cheques we got .... sod all! ? Clap for key workers followed by pay freezes? Welfare freeze followed by tories accusing poor people of using benefits for brothels?  https://t.co/GM8wun7oES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 @BasileUwimana For a young man who is to some extent talent, and clearly educated Basile surprises me... his attitude is very biased and subjective! He’s the epitome of being carved and moulded by a system! He’s the perfect robot; well programmed to clap/cheer/defend but NEVER challenge! 🐑🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elusiveman01 There are certain fake characters in labour right now - if given a choice between their bullshittery and a Tory barefaced liar - I’d actually pick a Tory! A know a Tory is a twat inside and out, labour MPs pretend to be with you, once in power - they don’t know you! Bun Lammy🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@margarethodge Translation:   a year ago, I campaigned my damn hardest to ensure the Labour Party lost because I didn’t like its leader.

<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba I don’t think anyone has pretended he was some angel who didn’t commit a crime - have you read the statement from his legal counsel after his execution? They summarise it well and explains what everyone is saying.   At end of the day he didn’t commit the murders in legal terms 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@raphaeldogg To think that people don’t get this simple point is actually bizarre!   Tories vote tories -period!   And the red wall that voted tories - in part did so because allegedly non white immigrants (and polish) are a problem -racism and bigotry! Not sure its a hill for lab to die on🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba Also it’s my understanding that #BrandonBernard didn’t actually do the “shooting to kill” - someone shot the victims dead, the bodies were placed in a boot? And then he was pushed by the gang to light up the car! He was accessory to murder but not the actual murderer🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba Interesting take🧐  I don’t think he’s become a martyr at all, the issue that Americans are shouting about is that they have a system that fails to take into account remorse and genuine change (the UK system does). 2) he’s being used as conduit for USA to ask for end to death pen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy The answer is absolutely NOT. Secondly, Ive worked in retail before, and I currently work in public sector - I’ve never ever had to resort to “that Asian one/ that Chinese one/ that white one/ that (anything) one”   Please just stop the gaslighting and belittling of the situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @BellRibeiroAddy Deal!! 🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy In the setting of the football incident- I suspect everyone knew the black persons name (which is an advantage you wouldn’t have in let’s say a restaurant).  Are you telling me on a round table of: Obama, macron, merkel, Boris, trump, Trudeau - a waiter has to say “the black one”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy John with all due respect, you’re now really starting to drag this issue down the wrong path. everyone who’s been tweeting you since the incident is MERELY saying just bcoz someone is “black” Doesn’t mean there aren’t other ways to describe the individual - they are RIGHT🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @BellRibeiroAddy For my name twin baby Fred, I just want to big up his dad @Martin_Abrams for being a legend and a man of principles!  When covid is over and we’re allowed to meet people again: a drink (alcoholic or otherwise) on me. It’s great to be acquainted with good people!   Good vibes🙌🏽❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misanthropicc92 Is he suggesting here that racism towards black and racism towards Jewish people are essentially 2 issues at opposite ends of a seesaw and that Jeremy being antiblack is always incompatible with fighting against antisemitism? I.e to support Jews, one must ditch the blacks? Damn🙈  https://t.co/HZB3CILyy0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @BellRibeiroAddy I’m here for the commitment to the cause that Martin has - bringing along his baby!

<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb @RwandaHealth Genetic causes  - Blounts disease  - Osteochondrodysplasia  Other: Osteomalacia - which can be caused by many different nutritional causes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb @RwandaHealth Well it depends what age you try to correct the rickets - if a child already has deformed legs 🦵 that are very deformed - trying to correct malnutrition retrospectively is not going to do very much 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Anyway I need more info to make medical judgements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb Can you find me the article that has ruled out rickets - there are other disease that cause bone malformation in children - these diseases are genetic ... Nonese are those kids related ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb Tekereza insina uko iteye inside. Imagine rero uteretse kunsina amashami yigiti cy’avoka ... what would happen to the insina? Cyagondama 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  That’s how rickets works from malnutrition and lack of calcium and vitamins D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb Kids bone start of as soft cartilaginous tissue that solidifies with age. To solidify body deposits calcium and other minerals to make the bones hard! Without calcium the bones retain their “softness”, the body weight causes bones to deform due to pressure, resulting in deformity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @WhyNotNgb Rickets is NOT a communicable disease.   Rickets is caused by malnutrition - deficiency of calcium and vitamin D  Reference: I’m a doctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhyNotNgb @WhyNotNgb don’t listen to the bullshit about vaccinations - this is caused by lack of calcium the diet - it’s called “rickets” in English<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imranahmadkhan Haha “an insult to whom”?

<|startoftext|>@JermainJackman @onebiggins @AmysFoundation Wonderful picture and a great momento to hold on to from a legend!

<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Haha  Is this the discovery of the decade?🤷🏾‍♂️🙈  Peak white Britain trolling here!🇬🇧🇬🇧  As matter of fact I have curious question - in that charity that tried to help #GrenfellTower  victims, how many in the management and senior positions are people of colour/black?

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @theleftycrank @UKLabour **In Theory** ✊🏾 indeed.  We’ll keep waiting, we’ve already been waiting for decades anyway, another 12months won’t hurt, I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @theleftycrank @UKLabour As long they can also *kindly* remember to sort out racism then I’ll feel included in this so called “places and people”  They failed my “people” deliberately and catastrophically in 2020 already by making our concerns and experiences third class. Maybe there’s hope in 2021🧐🤨🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @theleftycrank @UKLabour I have the same curiosity. Because until you shed light on what “places and people” meant I had no clue, because I certainly don’t get the message - but then again, it evidently wasn’t aimed at me, so no surprise I didn’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichRevol @theleftycrank @UKLabour Well if it’s a continuum of “Labour supports British military killing and torturing abroad with no repercussions” - then I guess it’s a subtle wink to Britain first indeed!

Waba ufite umugati ukawima umwana wibyariye? Waba ufite amata ukayima umwana wibyariye?  Blaming the parents is the easy way out of government responsibilities; in my opinion🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @BakerReports @mwasa @RwandaNorth @Rwanda_Child They better get to work then.  Iyo ugiye mubyaro akabona utwana twambaye bodaboda - and when you speak to parents about food and water usanga byose ari “kwibwimana tubona ibishyimbo na kawunga” do you think anything is being done from these agency level?   My observation is: NO🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @BakerReports @mwasa Exactly brother - nuko bimeze - most of these cases are PREVENTABLE!  Dukeneye ko abategetsi bagira the same reaction as you and me - wenda something can change! Naho ubundi this is going to continue.  We need RDB for children welfare; sinzi ushinzwe urubyiruko- but they firing❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @BakerReports @mwasa @RwandaNorth I think the country needs a very serious sit down and think of solutions!Otherwise it’s an embarrassment as well- we boast of infrastructure but our children are being handicapped by malnutrition? We need detailed research into the problem, and creative solutions. Si non: sad😢❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @BakerReports @mwasa Deformed from the weight of the body that causes the soft bones to bend against the pressure from the weight.   Prevention: adequate calcium and vitamin D provision to children at risk!  Birababaje kubona ibi bintu - deformed for life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @BakerReports @mwasa This is likely due to malnutrition.  Children are born with very soft bones that harden with age. In order to harden bones need calcium amongst other minerals. As you know calcium is gotten through diet.  Without adequate calcium and vitamin D - children’s bones become deformed❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD I’m commenting on the meaning of “intent” &amp; “motive”’in legal terms- NOTHING else!  If there’s an audio of me saying “I am going to kill you” and indeed you’re murdered at some point, the judiciary can investigate my audio as evidence of “intent” and  motive to kill. That’s ALL🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidBegnaud Lol Americans - y’all are weird AF - referencing Jesus and God? I thought one of the 10 commandments was “thou shalt not kill”?

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @TheReal_JesusC 💯agree with this statement.

<|startoftext|>@theleftycrank @UKLabour Why wasn’t there an “all of them” option ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @TheReal_JesusC Oh Jesus - just reread and you’re spot on! Haha let me get a coffee- not sure I’ll survive this night shift if I can barely read a tweet!  Yes you’re right - labour does have a BAD record on race and all issues pertaining to racism and discrimination 😎😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @TheReal_JesusC Hmm I’m not sure “labour has a good record on race” is a hill I’d want to die on considering the antisemitism and antiblack and islamaphobia crisis that the labour is in - apart from antisemitism, it’s pretending the other issues aren’t even a thing!   It’s NOT a good record🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @TheReal_JesusC I’d argue that “centrists” are indeed centrists in every sense of the word.  When it comes to issues such as racism, often there’s major ignorance and indifference! @TheReal_JesusC if you and I were white, we’d probably not recognise the disingenuousness.

<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili Facing the UK and the global beyond!

<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Have you worked out who abused Palestinian people at @redbridgelabour yet?

Any policy or investment idea iba implemented if it will benefit abapoliticians, inyungu zabaturage ziza nyama or never at all!   Ndabona 21st century colonialism ari voluntary kabisa🤷🏾‍♂️🧐😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delices21 @Allenkab3 Nonese urwanda nurwande? Abanyarwanda or abaetranger bahaze iyo baturuka?  Ninde wahinze imisozi yurwanda from centuries ago? Americans cyangwa abanyarwanda?   Ibi bintu byo kugurisha igihugu meanwhile abanyarwanda batanabasha kubona amazi n’ikijumba ntago aribyo namba! Wapi❌🤯  https://t.co/oQCHoaXDR7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 abaturage paying imisoro to pay salaries - ariko abari kwirira akanyama from taxpayers money, ntacyo bamariye abaturage!  Its a one way relationship😒  Biteye iseseme vraiment! Abaturage murwanda baragowe!  It’s like kuba inka muri farm: produce milk all time even with no food🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kay_hallsworth @MedwayGirl74 @ExplorerJust It does indeed look like a Sparrow hawk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Bigatuma ngaruka kuri question ya Parliament, aba MPs bamariye iki abaturage? How do these policies get approved? Who is REPRESENTING the interests and opinions of the people?  Hari something in rwanda which is fakenews: Parliamentary representation is a MYTH/lie/Facade/pretend🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Njye ndi confused kabisa - pendant pandemic - kw’isi hose governments are trying to ameliorate ubuzima bwabaturage, where possible discounts are applied... rents are being cancelled, bank charges relaxed - ariko murwanda rwagasabo ngo price RISES?!   Really? koko? Vraiment?❌🧐🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes I second this sentiment!   At least Boris doesn’t wear an anorak on a rainy/cloudy day -which shows just how much respect Boris has for .... British people, unlike Jeremy! How disrespectful of Jeremy!   Also Boris is the least racist candidate, and PritiPatel is kindest human🙌🏽🇬🇧  https://t.co/JKoDofRblp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenW69808657 When receipts 🧾 come calling .... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa That’s right ✊🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  https://t.co/SWVlEX84O4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel_Grigg Apparently Boris was the best for the country and the least “racist”....  Fast forward to 2020🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - they’re regretting their investment😂❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Wasnt he the safest hands that some of your friends were telling us to vote for in Dec 2019? As opposed to What as then the Labour Party.  Apparently he was Safest for economy and “least racist”.   The dividends in 2020 are atrocious lol🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤐  https://t.co/M2rr6xtgHl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Haha 😂Brits must be so simple   “Oh look Prince William and his wife Kate had the vaccine on their way to Scotland on a railway! So therefore it must be the best thing in the world with a royal seal- let’s all queue up and get it”💂‍♀️   Long live Will&amp;Kate🇬🇧.  Curse Harry&amp;Meghan🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elusiveman01 That’s just the way it is.... 😭  (damn world deliberately designed to disadvantage the black community)  https://t.co/aDtoa4i5O9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoundShopOwen Take care mate! Don’t listen to the noise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkins_carole @mojos55 It is actually palpable ... wow - walruses to the left 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes What do we need to do?😄👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy I think all people in this country appreciate his contribution to ending nazism - noone is in ANY doubt of that. And credit to him and his contemporaries. However Lammy posts without caveats which is a grave insult to his victims! It’s photoshopping history ❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy so yes after this debate, which has remarkably actually been in good faith (thank you) - forgive us who aren’t white or Jewish from posing the question “what was pioneering about?”  For some people the pioneering stuff was how quick they could see rice grow and disappear🤷🏾‍♂️🤐🤐❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy I think the conclusion here frankly is he was whitesupremacist and racist.  Did all his good works for the betterment of white people, a side effect is that nonwhite people have also come to benefit post his death as an incidental conduit. That’s the conclusion really: INCIDENTAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy Just imagine your dad telling you stories about being “kind, generous, compassionate, all loving” and then his job is also to enslave nonwhite people, make nonwhite people plant tea, rice, spices all to be shipped to UK while natives of the colony starve to death! Yaay🇬🇧kindness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy He was a pioneer in Europe then -not the ex colonies. Do you even recognise that whilst he was championing ECHR he was simultaneously killed people outside Europe?  Haha😆 the sheer cognitive dissonance here is breathtaking. Thou shall not kill fellow Europeans, but Bengal?🇬🇧💂‍♀️🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy There are many men, who enriched their nations and a particular race of people, whilst killing with impunity other people they perceived to be “lesser” than them... the history books are there🤷🏾‍♂️  If your measure is “as long as he’s nice to me, to hell with others” its a problem❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy So the answer is Nothing then. Because whilst he created and championed ECHR, he simultaneously looted, killed, disrespected HUMAN BEINGS that did NOT look like him or others around him in Europe.   In other words: he looked out for HIS own people, and fucked the colonies🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy Creating ECHR whilst simultaneously killing people who don’t look like you (because they don’t look like you) ... makes you frankly no different to people like Colston who killed black people as slaves to then bring money Bristol to build schools for poor white British people🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DavidLammy I think you’ll notice I specifically asked for evidence from the ex colonies which indeed Bengal would fall under - and according to you; he was a “cold murderous twat” - so when you’re a descendant of non white people from ex colonies - what is PIONEERING about him?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/TkzzmrO20x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Lol @DavidLammy remind me again - who was a pioneer in HUMAN RIGHTS?   And exactly what deeds did they do to showcase their pioneering skills in human rights .... signpost me the evidence done in the ex colonies and towards people of ex colonies.  Kind regards  https://t.co/cTsxplggQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@didierdrogba @dembabafoot One thing I will say about all the fiasco around what happened is that I am finally proud to see black players MORE prepared to SPEAK OUT about what they find uncomfortable and disrespectful, rather than have to🤐🤫and hold the pain inside!  Bravo @dembabafoot #AchilleWebo✊🏾👏🏾🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 What’s going on is simple: 1) apparently the red wall wooing game requires black MPs/ members to have amnesia about history  2) it apparently also requires following Sir Abstentions leadership without question or else you get fired  3) @DavidLammy will do anything to climb ladder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlansman @UnwinPaul @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour Haha 😆 fantasy world<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peterjukes @RealNatalieRowe You havent actually explained why u did the following in the following sequence: 1) Posted something u knew to be (deliberately or otherwise) inaccurate/ambiguous to 82.7K followers 2) BLOCKED the person whom what you said related to  Miss Marple/Mr Poirot/Colombo etc are needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @byLine This 2020 has been a revealing year is all I can say frankly @RealNatalieRowe!  Push comes to shove; these people will remind us which bed they’d rather get into!  Their knight Keir has set pace: lie to us, make us think they’re our confidant, our reps, antiracist- its lies🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe Jeeeeez!  **Checks popcorn stock**  https://t.co/x22rQXOKej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjukes @RealNatalieRowe Ahhh I see, shame you didn't just say exactly what happened as it actually happened 4 years ago - in the first place then....  Then there's the blocking; how many people tell truth about an event followed by BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK🤷🤷?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @peterjukes Hold them to account @RealNatalieRowe   HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT!  Lies, libel, mistruths etc. (spread to 1000s of followers DELIBERATELY) cannot be whitewashed by (retrospective) unblocking, deletion of evidence and with a fake "OF COURSE I DIDN'T MEAN...."  Justice is delicious  https://t.co/ElHcm1vSyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjukes @RealNatalieRowe haha the "Of course I didn't mean bla bla XYZ"  The classic to go to when these people do wrong, and rather than actually take ownership of their mistakes, they try to gaslight and twist narratives.  Even more incredible is the fact he'd initially blocked &amp; deleted evidence🤥❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregianjohnson Someone please confirm this is true — because I’ve just seen wasteman #Farage the Kent coastguard - chatting bollox about the “death” of fight against antiblack racism - aka #BLM ✊🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirk1978 @jonlansman @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour One thing I really dislike about the Brexit discourse within LabourParty quarters is the fact that the movement wants to damn anyone who was on the opposite argument. Democracy is exactly what it says on the tin: DEMOCRACY; contrasting opinions. Labour is stuck in perpetual wars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @skwawkbox @PatrickWDixon - did you ever get any further information on this? The Labour CLP that blocked a charity motion to raise funds for Palestinian children 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theleftycrank I’ve reached that conclusion already.   Better the devil you KNOW 💯 is the devil (Tories) ..... than the devil disguised in angelic feathers but is actually just a damn devil as hard as tories with added disingenuous bullshit and lies upon lies upon abstentions 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gletherby Isn’t there allegedly a “forensic” opposition, much adored by the media and blue tickers ?? Whatever happened that forensic stuff? Passed best use by date?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acatherwoodnews Remember when they told us that a PROVEN bully #Pritipatel was the “kindest and most considerate person that they had ever ever worked with”  So now that Emily doesn’t align with his ideology she’s aggressive and a bully🤷🏾‍♂️.  PROVEN bullies =kindest person ever.  Behold🇬🇧2020🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein Meanwhile when asked to comment on the American elections the day after the election - @DominicRaab said “It’s not for UK to intervene in another country’s democratic process”  Make of the hypocrisy what you will: 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Haha translation: “White people should only show solidarity in the methods approved by Farage, anything else doesn’t count and it will be called communist/Marxist”  Said a fascist by the name of Farage, the coast guard of Kent  How about: NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I’m considering the greens 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Dear Labour Party cheerleaders 📣 : when you try to come for me  - don’t start debates/arguments you cannot start and finish with intellect and grace!  How you gonna hype and then do a runner simultaneously?  Definition of wasteman: 👇🏾  https://t.co/SzM8Yx5R6Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer Racism is nothing to do with “internal machinations of the Labour Party” - racism is real for victims and it has nothing to do with internal fights inside labour: it has everything to do with racist people being racist and inflicting harm on their victims. Racism is real - period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer When I see racists in his party dealt with steadfastly - with tangible and visible actions and consequences , I’ll give him credit.  Meanwhile Unfortunately, you do not dictate which day of the week I can talk about racism and homelessness ; that decision is entirely mine🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer I’d expect homeless people to be bothered about racism yes, as I would expect people who face racism to also be bothered about homelessness - do you find it hard to both? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer People suffer from impact of racism on a daily as much as people suffer from the impact of homelessness. Multitasking in ones speech is not that hard:  Homelessness and racism have both seen a RISE and the impact on the victims is deep and hard; politicians need to deal with both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer Both homelessness and racism have seen a spike in the last few years, so excuse me for asking why there’s tolerated incidences of racism in the Labour Party - a party that portrays itself as being on the right side of society. Harbouring racism is NOT being on the right side🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @Keir_Starmer Actually if you can read you will correctly notice that I said “or” - NOT “but”  Please learn some comprehension before coming for me! 👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Or face racism in the Labour Party or beyond .... wouldn’t you agree @Keir_Starmer 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fez100 @Lionhearted70 @AyoCaesar Mate, the accusations are of course never true: they (wielders of power) make up stories and allegations from thin air, they have machines (media/newspapers/journalists/fake witnesses) that they deploy to give their stories credit. When the latter fails: They MURDER/Assassinate🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 How is twitter saying you've only got 2 followers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lionhearted70 @AyoCaesar Exactly 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!  Not to mention the murdered 1000s upon 1000s of people who wanted to resist imperialism/colonialism/slavery and found themselves as shooting targets, jailed, thrown overboard etc! The white racists who go on TV to gaslight really need a major history lesson! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Happy birthday @MatthewStadlen 🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar 2/ we saw this phenomenon with things such as slavery, imperialism and colonialism - any resistance to the "dominant white' agenda was met with massacres. Mandela was called a 'terrorist' and the Tories wanted him executed. This tarnishing of protest groups is tried and tested❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar 1/ Extremely well said @AyoCaesar - throughout history as we know it; there is a common theme that repeats itself: In a community where 1 group dominates another - ANY effort for CHANGE by the disadvantaged group is labelled ANTI-XYZ to delegitimise it, to poison the masses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@singharj @HannahB4LiviMP So the lords are able to suspend each other - yet the Lord who was racist towards KamalaHarris - fuck all happened, not 1 Lord even tabled a motion ..hahah   UK you continue to show us that you really relish the principle of racism and white supremacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ haha lol someone actually said "seeing people showing that they have no time for racism and discrimination in 2020 made "them" feel like they're being "marginalised"?  Haha words fail me.  A call to end racism and discrimination makes some British people feel "marginalised"? LOL  https://t.co/NVfCB0RsNg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thomaschattwill @paultinay  - here’s the story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @ashton_hewitt “Fuck em all black c**ts”  Says all there is to say. No ambiguity.  #Millwall #MillwallFC 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/q9LxMNhEqd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashton_hewitt @paultinay according to blue tickers, Farage, Tory MPs - the #MillwallFC fans were only booing because although they “love” black people and hold them “dear to their hearts” - they “just” wanted to watch the football.🤣  Meanwhile here’s an isolated insight into what they think🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/z3BbWYk60x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy He has been getting stuck indeed for daring to comment on things which we should all comment on. Far too many people prefer the comfort of silence in the face of what is Objectively wrong and unacceptable.   Kudos to him for sticking by his principles 👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeeveyZ22 @officialbarnesy To be fair - having understood your explanation - I do understand what you’re saying.   Meanwhile racism is alive and kicking in 🇬🇧, and I’m 💯 here day and night for anyone such as @officialbarnesy who are prepared to stare at racists in the face and tell them to do one ☝🏾!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams The only thank you frontline staff want and need is better pay, better working conditions, better work life balance....  a PR stunt by Kate and William to outperform/overshadow #HarryandMeghan is the last thing they need!  Their presence won’t stop wealth inequality or racism👋🏽❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeeveyZ22 @officialbarnesy Your initial post to him mentioned nothing about cancelled events (I accept Id feel same way about paid for but cancelled events with no refunds). Your initial tweet comes across as though you’re pissed off with him for being steadfast in critiquing racism! (Everyone should be)  https://t.co/dFTAA0KNg7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Hmm if you actually read their statement - the “dismayed and saddened” part of the statement is the least important part. The most important part their attempt to actually justify their fans #MillwallFC stands in solidarity with its fans. TBH  https://t.co/I7BdTcitUv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Haha Jesus - this Charlene lady is trying to drag @officialbarnesy because he didn’t sign something for her?  So on balance scales ⚖️: John should pretend racism is not the biggest plight that still stains society in 2020 and focus on why he’s not signed at her request?

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 The situation we have is this: over the last few decades the equilibrium has shifted such that NOW far right wingism (aka fascism and racists) are no longer viewed negatively, the media and those who run media in cahoots with governments have twisted the narrative. It’s fucked🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @mkainerugaba Haha  Interesting question.  https://t.co/EGKXtLKmsN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthernMand @Liam_Baxter31 @DaneBaptweets Well you’re more than welcome to time travel decades all you like. Some of us are moving forward!  See you never again as you will be decades in the past! Adios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Hahaha 😆😆😆  This is some funny shit - @Keir_Starmer your party is riddled with antiblack racism - until you actually do something constructive about it - as you’re doing with antisemitism - you can have SEVERAL seats and a sofa bed!   Disingenuous seems to flow in your vessels  https://t.co/AqueHDrgPF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthernMand @Liam_Baxter31 @DaneBaptweets Who questioned the good deeds of people in history?   The topic of discussion is: is racism STILL a problem in the uk? The answer is: Yes   Do people still continue to be harassed, discriminated, harmed, killed by racism in 21st century? Yes   Do we shrug our shoulders? NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liam_Baxter31 @DaneBaptweets FYI - to all decent people out there- say Hi for a follow! On days like these it’s good to filter through the sieve to find quality people that once covid is over one can actually share a drink with and have a normal constructive debate with!  Happy Sunday to all antiracists🙌🏽😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthernMand @Liam_Baxter31 @DaneBaptweets BLM pulled the rug to reveal the racism within the British society that is kept at bay by fakery and disingenuous pleasantries🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  That’s what has happened.  The end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrainOfDoubt @officialbarnesy Right must have misread the sentence “racism is so rare these days” in your tweet!  https://t.co/EQFyhBG305<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy what I endorse and am part of is the chorus of people of all colours who want to see an end to racism and discrimination - that’s what BLM means to me; I don’t have the time or energy to engage with the 0.01% of bad apples on either side of the debate. Waste of time and energy❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy I haven’t even ever heard of that - if I did hear it I’d obviously call it out.   Which black peoples have you personally heard saying that? For which you can categorically confirm it was said? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrainOfDoubt @officialbarnesy HahHa oh Lord “racism is SO RARE these days” they said 😆😆😆😆  https://t.co/uwoDjS9Kxc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy I get what you’re saying; but do u really think Farage et al and Millwall are the ones being honest and impartial here?  At end of the day when it comes to conversations about “EXPERIENCES” we need to be able to listen to those who actually do the experiencing first and foremost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan @FurqanReisen The conservatives (only?)   I’m afraid you may be viewing things from an old lens - racism is a problem within all current British parties - @UKLabour included 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BennnyH solidarity to you! And May he RIP 🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Can someone please explain why black people asking to be treated fairly in the western society where white peoples dominate all sectors of society is “Marxist”   Who armed racists with these terms?   21st century has been an interesting one: fascism is well and truly emboldened🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Lol 🤷🏾‍♂️   Angela try again  https://t.co/HusbgoJOMb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy Amen 🙏🏽 to that mate!   And that’s the reality of the matter - there are a large proportion of us who want the same thing: genuine parity between all people.   We need to avoid being taken by the current created by racists and truth deniers like Farage et al. DONT FALL for it✊🏾✊🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liam_Baxter31 @DaneBaptweets It’s incredible how triggered White Britain can be - which incidentally confirms the underlying visceral racism! They get goose bumps when they hear/see anything that challenges racism. They find reasons to complain and get angry ...   Racism is alive and kicking in 🇬🇧. Period❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy If you’re going to take something (whipped up by the right to create drama and division) then allow us also to take farage, Katie H etc as representatives of all British people - who want to do non white people harm and spread racism. In fact haven’t seen many of u call them out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans @EFL @premierleague @BerniceKing  Bernice, remember that white BRITISH politician who tried to misquote your father #MLK? He very quickly deleted his tweet to hide from the rebuke he got, took a twitter break, but like all eels in murky waters, they emerge episodically- here he is again being racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy Well I hasten to remind you- Twitter and what you’re exposed to on twitter is NOT reflection of the real world  And BLM does not speak for all black people. Engage with black people in real life and take it from there. Am I supposed to take Farage as representative of all whites?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 Haha wow - so white peoples are actually saying “Can’t wait for lockdown to end so that racists with England flag tattoos tattooed to their chests and legs can get out again and spread racism and hate” - and people want to preach to us that 🇬🇧 is the least racist place on earth😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HermosaHermano @walegates I agree with @HermosaHermano on this one I’m delighted to say!  Just cast your mind back to days of MLK and Mandela - do you really think “shrug - it is what it is” would have been the advice you give them?   This 21st century mentality is weak and only emboldens racism further❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 They want black people to play for their teams, win for their teams so that they can go to pubs and drink their stomach full of ales whilst simultaneously holding ZERO respect for black peoples and their struggle; absolutely bloody pigs!  2020reminds us why colonialism happened🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl What the f**k - did this white man just say “They (white people) have taken black players to their hearts over the years” we do NOT need to be taken to your hearts thanks: we need the judiciary and system to protect us from your ignorance and racism! Taken to heart you know?! KMT  https://t.co/r1uBFBo1au<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy White people need to stop adding caveats invented in their heads from insecurity! frankly this weird conjecture by white people is unfounded and illustrates that some white people cannot stand the idea of minorities being treated equal. NOONE has said white lives do not matter🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy lol Paul come off it - no black person who says “my life matters, stop treating me as second class” (which is what BLM means) has ever said “my life needs to matter and what white lives need to be degraded” that’s what Farage and racists are trying to portray to create conflict<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_NatashaDevon @LBC Lol I’m not sure how the #Crown paints people in a negative light when they are portraying what factually happened, albeit with some added spark and drama: did Camilla date Charles whilst Diana and  Charles were married?

<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman Heard of this story in last 48hrs - I couldn’t stop myself from returning to it every time I came across it in case I had read the previous post wrongly: a child shot dead😩- and the world bats an eyelid and continues as if everything is business as usual!   Humans are wicked❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skwawkbox @PatrickWDixon - is this normal? The party and leadership Cheered by so many I see on twitter baffles me every day..  Fund raising to support children we all *factually* know are ruined by the ongoing destruction of Palestine is now deemed “OUT of ORDER” by Labours inner circle🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skwawkbox What on Earth .... can someone clarify whether this is true or not? ..  So for confirmation:  Raising funds for Palestinian CHildren is now deemed OUT of ORDER by @UKLabour ?   What the f**k is this newleadership trying to achieve? Is this for the “red wall”? Highly doubt it🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 Why do they hate receipts and truth so much?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ perhaps its because the truth outs them as liars, hypocrites and just vindictive nasty black mambas 🐍🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankevans074 They’ll most likely twist it and say it was a junior member or something equally ridiculous. Or even better they’ll let the storm ⛈ calm down, vaccine will be rolled out, Brexit will happen - the arguments will shift - #Redbridge racism issue will be buried. Watch the space🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankevans074 No not yet - even though they likely already know who it was.   They are probably exploring ways of exonerating him; the situation is: he is most likely a right wing labour member/ centrist. Most likely a big 📣 cheerleader for Sir Abstentions. They’re working out a formula🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liquifidea @AOC If her comments do not apply to you - what’s your problem?  A general comment can a apply (and her comments do apply) to a proportion of a population: not all but a proportion! That’s how statics works!

<|startoftext|>@BullshitSlayer @HoodieRidwan @vnesh89 @IlhanMN Yes yes yes👏🏾  Too much truth in one tweet!   Africans we are so gullible it’s actually tragic!

<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie If they Stand with minorities full heartedly - rather than pretend (which is what they forensically do time and time again).... the labour right, centrists, EU flag bearers etc will be flocking to the liberal democratics, Tories, Greens etc. Faster  than you can blink 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️: FACTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @helensclegel @DanielFooksArt @LabourZaid @OwenJones84 you’ve sidestepped the actual question posed at you, to counterattack a criticism of you by someone... why don’t you just stick to the original issue here which is: people want to know “what exactly did #Naomi do (historically) that you disagree with”  Stay focused🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/PhCypRuSt4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArielElyseGold RIP Ali Abu Alia - sorry we (members of the global community) failed you and your fellow countrymen.

<|startoftext|>@Trickyjabs The major difference that I can see is that it seems that the media is finally no longer interested  in investigating labour anymore!  Its as though miraculously once forensic Keir came to power-the media said “mission complete, now back to silence”   The scrutiny has disappeared<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greggwatson90 Hahaha 🤣  Where was this argument in December 2019 - I wonder indeed 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachshabi The suspension of #NaomiWimborneIdrissi brings into the equation the idea of “good/bad Jewish person” which is a racist and antisemetic endeavour!  @UKLabour is essentially pitting Jews against each other for its ideology reasons which is NOT helpful to rooting out antisemitism❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist @TingedFunny @gem_ste As far as I’m concerned these people are like Americans who proclaim Trump to be the best president there ever was: they see racists and instigators as the “best people there ever was” - what does that make them?!  🥁 roll.... bigots and racists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 In conclusion her apology to the #windrush black community was in vain and her bullshit about “being a minority who faced racism I understand black peoples and their experiences of racism” was also a bloody lie! She’s the executioner to deliver the will of racists! ❌❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Hooray to Mr Abstentions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaniekmelvin They’ve been justifying it believe it or not....  They’ve been saying that she shouldn’t have supported Jeremy. Freedom of to o thought  and expression is now a crime in labour 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant Haha 😂   Yeah abstentions is the pinnacle of opposition! Hooray Keir the infallible messiah 🤣🤣🤣❌❌👉🏾🗑🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen Let’s how it all plays out - but I personally just don’t understand what the forensic NewLeadership is aiming to achieve with this kind of ideological witch-hunt 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Ouch 🔥  https://t.co/32dVlvnw99<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen I hope she gets lawyered up because this is absolute madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen They’ll have to prove (they’ll  have been witnesses) that during the debate - antisemitism offences took place and the chair (Naomi) endorsed or did nothing about the antisemetic offences - otherwise I cannot understand the justification behind this suspension🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen 2/ I fully appreciate the strong sentiments on both sides with regards to Jeremy, but a discussion cannot be labelled illegal because people don’t like Jeremy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen From the way things seems to be in labour- the discussion of Jeremy can be deemed uncomfortable or comfortable depending on your ideology - will the party purge the name “Jeremy corbyn” entirely from all discourse henceforth for eternity? It’s unrealistic I’m afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen Well to your first part: they’re not being dealt with - make of that what you will.   To the second part - I disagree with it - do we live in a Stalinist system where it’s rule by prosecution for political ideology?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen @redbridgelabour Interesting!  Has the party suspended them pending police investigation - isn’t that the process ? Suspension pending investigation .... that’s what labour is doing to everyone else? Suspension pending investigation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen Wishy washy is one way of putting it ...   I’ll trade you: it’s all being made up as they go- and it frankly further tarnishes the fight against AS that they’re so desperately trying to fight!  Are you aware that she’s called a “Kapo” by labour right wing - u kno meaning of kapo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faizashaheen @redbridgelabour @PatrickWDixon  - she’s been dismissed/suspended for supporting restoration of the whip to Jeremy - before this lovely person at @redbridgelabour has even been suspended - is this the forensic methodology at play in labour these days? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @faizashaheen She’s critical of Keir, and supports Jeremy- lol you will I’m afraid struggle to find any other crimes 🤷🏾‍♂️  Oh and she supports Jeremy having the whip restored -as do many other people in and outside labour- is labour going to reprimand everyone who likes Jeremy? This is Stalinism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faizashaheen @PatrickWDixon  are you aware of this - wonder what you’re take is 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faizashaheen Principles and ethics BEFORE knighthoods and promotions- well done @faizashaheen !  If there are any labour MPs, activists, members, counsellors refusing to comment on an *INJUSTICE* in order to remain favourable to Keir and his sponsors- you’re part of the problem in the world🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein And solidarity to you too @andrewfeinstein  - i understand that twitter tried to deplatform you?  I’m pleased to see you back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirk1978 @thetwerkinggirl @UKLabour Not going to lie, he and his sponsors must be cackling whilst they sip whisky🥃! They needed a Trojan horse, someone who said the right things, someone who could keep it up for long enough; out of desperation the left saw hope, they blinked too soon! Keir and his lobby won🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirk1978 @Keir_Starmer Leaves you speechless doesnt it...  it’s actually tragic to see Jewish people now being played ping pong 🏓 by politicians.

<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani And the world is compelled to keep 🤐- for if we speak we’re allegedly being AS.  This violence and abuse of human rights is a permanent stain and we’re all complicit in our silence 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  If god is real; have mercy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helensclegel @Keir_Starmer Bewildering is all I can say at this point of watching the Labour Party implode.

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl That Karen blocked me this morning after I checked her for suggesting that QC Keir is justified to have voted with tories for a bill that encourages British military to commit crimes against humanity abroad - she suggested that lives of foreign peoples can be up for debate!

<|startoftext|>@mwahshoes @feeldalove168 @E8Powell He's sending out his CV to the Tories, UKIP, BrexitParty version 2, and to Keir's newLeadership that he's ready and willing to be the next PritiPatel and ShaunBailey.  I can see him deporting his own cousins if it meant being invited to a shooting weekend on horseback with YT ppl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TingedFunny @KarenStopHate @salomewagaine She's one of those pretenders that draw people like DavidLammy et al. they give you conditional empathy: the moment you criticise their knight QC abstentionist Keir, they remind u that they have the 'power' to platform/deplatform u.

<|startoftext|>@TingedFunny @KarenStopHate @salomewagaine Karen has run away into her echochamber of "i adore QC Keir' and blocked me- not at all surprising, after she outed herself as someone who has a hierarchy for whom should benefit from human rights, and whom should be ignored. Its plain to see why Keir is popular with these people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E8Powell @feeldalove168 I've just had a look at his twitter timeline - just full of attacks towards Jamaicans being deported. Retweets gaslighters and is followed by people who likely trivialise antblack racism.   He seems to forget that Criminal or no criminal - these people were British.  KMT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 Haha, I swear this man was busy detailing his birth, his childhood, mum and dad origins, death of relatives, cities where families reside- very detailed outpouring for someone who doest give a 'fuck' about justifying one's existence  very amusing stuff! Big up StLuciaJamaica🇱🇨🇯🇲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman One would think there's a vendetta against you?  There's a weird knee-jerk reaction from @Twitter - the more these knee-jerk reactions happen, the more they confirm bias. How can they get it wrong twice in less than 1week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @salomewagaine Alright Karen Weird that you need a reminder that human rights is not about majority vs minority - but EVERYONE.  But yeah, you're karen, what else are we to expect?  Crack on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @salomewagaine Oh yes the human rights lawyer bit...

<|startoftext|>@NkurunzizaPete3 @JujuLaBelle The implied proposition was “engaging in one’s own culture likely yields much better outcomes as one is likely to be skilled in the activities whether it be dance or language, compared to imitating cultures learnt from the television of idolised western cultures”.

<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @salomewagaine What an utterly daft stance and hill to die on “because he has a QC title, I’m going to tie myself to his anchor yaaay”  You are duly informed that a small number of people scheduled to depart on the flight were pulled off at 11th hour! I.e. the legality was not fully scrutinised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salomewagaine I find it particularly intriguing that under the hated Jeremy @DavidLammy was empowered to speak loudly and convincingly about #Windrush generation.  Then fast forward under Forensic NewLeadership- Lammy lost his tongue. He’s only got time for LBC to warms seats for NickF etc🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @DavidLammy was too busy cosying up to LBC and everything that disparages black peoples!

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl so its actually happening!?  And mr Knight QC- has said absolutely sod all?  Dont know how other black peoples are feeling- but my conclusion is: Tories hate our guts and do not care one bit. And Keir endorses their hate for us!   How are you all in good conscience voting Labour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @leejamesbrown On a side note - any explanations to why Labour has refused to intervene in a deportation flight that is marred with inconsistency??  Apparently flight leaving in less 24hrs   Calamity doesn’t come close to describing this dead party under new management<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster Meanwhile - tories had to be dragged and begged (literally dragged) to consider the benefits of feeding children ...  Statues over children 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  What a farce of a nation! 😩😩😩  And meanwhile the knight’s policy is abstain abstain and more abstain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @leejamesbrown My final comment on this topic is that: the nation has a system and framework to pass legislation VERY quickly when the national security demands it so: the government would not turn round and say “fine we give up” - it can’t do that coz Lab would then hold them to fire🔥. Sad😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl According to @UKLabour - deportation of black peoples is “grey area” where the party doesn’t know how to react when peoples lives and well-being are being trampled upon... therefore they’d rather abstain from commenting or being helpful.❌  That’s what they think of us: GREY AREA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster Considering she and her party are very aware of the circumstances around these shoddy deportations: attempting to label these black peoples being deport as “grey area” - really does give us an insight into the NewLeadership outlook on black peoples: our wellbeing is a “grey area”  https://t.co/Dr0GtHfGwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeanneWood @Ed_Miliband  mate is that you on the left .... 🧐🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I get your rationale - but I’ve lost track of the amount of times there has been abstentions at every juncture ...  It begs the question: what is the point of there being an opposition?  Virtually every legislative vote - labour has abstained or worse joined the tories 🧐🤨❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Labour can’t simultaneously argue that the government is corrupt, crap, useless, wrong in its methodology and when given the chance - labour then say “well okay we’re going to sit and just abstain.😎😎” It’s cowardly.  What is the point of their criticism of given chance they sit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hmm well you seem to know the system more than me. But I remember a day where the House of Commons &amp; Lords processed a legislation within 24-48hrs... the system allows for emergency legislation from what I observed with Brexit.  I think personally labours abstentions are pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hmm Wouldn’t it be like the Theresa May Brexit legislation that were presented as “this or nothing” but was voted down and amended and brought back? Because irrespective of how the vote ends - the government needs to put a legislation through - the question is the content 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Surely a vote against in the current circumstances is “I don’t agree with this proposition from the government, they need to take this legislation back and rethink and bring it back improved”  Have I missed something more obvious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timpetherick @Keir_Starmer Deports black peoples - add that to the list of treasures 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Not going to lie I am actually shocked by this revelation from @alexsobel  - does he suggest there was no unanimous agreement from the shadow cabinet that the deportations are wrong and therefore they decided as a cabinet led by A forensic human rights QC that they’ll abstain?🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital He hasn’t 🧐🤨  That’s the simple answer   Nor have any of his inner circle or the people who frequently jump up and down that labour has no disregard for minorities and that EHRC recommendations need full implementation 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lottelydia @lottelydia  -thank you for putting it plainly for those who keep telling us about “nuance”  It’s fine and understandable to seek to attract voters - but there has to be MORALS and PRINCIPLES that a party/people stand for!  Human rights shouldn’t be a “hm okay we can waive that”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yuriavimo @BloomMary7 @rutembessa @RadiyoyacuVOA @bbcgahuza Ariko mana.  Njye kutamenya Amakuru ya @rutembessa binrya ahantu! Au moins abagizi banabi nibaconfirmé ukobamugenje, so we can grief and mourn!  Biteye agahinda kutamenya 😣😣😩😤😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour Good luck to the party - I really so minimal hope... and let me add - today is another stab that black peoples won’t forget quick...  Biden only won because the minorities turned out to vote for him. In 🇬🇧 Starmer is telling us he doesn’t care at EVERY juncture: we remember🤷🏾‍♂️🥳😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour Shadow cabinet has to be the strongest and biggest names you’ve got going. You need people that are known (in positive light obviously) by a good proportion of the population. Imagine you and I have no clue who he is - do you really think my parents (who vote Lab) would?❌❌❌⚠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour I don’t even know who he is... when you sent a screenshot - I honestly had to google...   When I saw “shadow Home Secretary” - I wanted to laugh out loud, but the gravity of the situation sank in, and I actually felt pain and grief!   People with NO gravitas as shad home sec?🤯🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour The talent pool must be dire if he’s the best they’ve got. Shadow Home sec is supposed to be a big role ... Patel would eat him for a morning snack🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour You’re now speaking my language. It’s within you, stay that way! Call out bullshit when it presents itself in full glory!  People spend way to much energy trying to extrapolate and explain on behalf of labour “their abstention/inaction *ACTUALLY* meant XYZ” let them explain it🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour If this is part of their long game to woo red wall - then Jesus Christ - I want nothing to do with the party and its new abstentions ethos!  Morals &amp; principles throw the window? In the hope of wooing bigots? The actions (inactions) are deliberately hurtful.   It’s not admirable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour Exactly - that’s the point everyone who is posting in disappointment is trying to make.   Yes we’re aware that unknown names somewhere low in the pecking order have said lukewarm rebukes - but it really cares NO weight whatsoever.  And those who have clout have refused to comment  https://t.co/uXDIgVCFt4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis @UKLabour 2/ it’s very painful for us who are concerned to see what appears to be subtle gaslighting - the facts of the matter remain - with hours to go - labour hasn’t even threatened a legal challenge!  I hasten to add: people’s lives, way of life, normal is at risk!   That’s all🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis I think you’re taking his comment far too literally.  As I said: 3 letters from MPs with zero clout achieves ZERO.  Yes kudos for signposting him to the 1 or 2 junior MPs who have said something, but if that was a comeback to suggest @UKLabour has done something: Please ❌⚠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @labourlewis I’ve got my mulled wine to hand watching it all roast and burn away! Madness   But I must say so far - it’s been 💯 self inflected! Tories haven’t even had to do any PR - it’s been labour eating itself🥳🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable @Keir_Starmer Hahaha🤣   If you’re holding your breath, let me know to standby with an oxygen tank and a Hudson oxygen mask- in the likely scenario that you hold your breath far too long waiting for him to “make good” his promise on racism ... i mean how many memos do you need? He doesn’t care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis Frankly the facts of the matter are: a human rights QC can’t be bothered to do anything about people potentially being embarked on a 1 way flight - the issue at risk is human rights.  3 or even 4 or 5 letters from junior MPs with zero clout simply is NOT good enough.  My god😫🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis I hasten to add: yesterday THE party and the leader of the party couldn’t stop telling the Sikh community how much their cared about their celebrations. But in less than hours, minorities could be on a flight✈️-all their lives turned upside down - and a former human rights QC🤷🏾‍♂️💤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ItCorbyn @labourlewis Patrick Im not sure what to make of this: with the lives at stake, the upheaval at stake, the legality in question- do u genuinely believe ONE junior minister with zero clout posting a letter is an adequate response from the opposition? Risk of Deportation must be foreign to u😒?  https://t.co/MQqwQGBJkU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labourlewis @labourlewis leaving it here is really not enough - what party is labour if they not prepared to back it for you?  If your friends haven’t got your back when your people are being unfairly treated - they’re really as bad as the ones deporting your people!   That’s the tweet🤷🏾‍♂️❌🇯🇲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesuisChancy @AyoCaesar @Keir_Starmer I’ve said this same thing and people tried to convince me otherwise...  The hierarchy is REAL!  It’s not low-key, it’s not subtle... it’s literally glaring at us in the face, but cheerleaders want to convince themselves that “oh he took the knee he’s on our side” soz but not mine  https://t.co/gxT38lxUhP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duncanjdavis The question that needs answering that remains contentious is what “actually” happened during the event. The overspill online afterthefact is a separate issue. We currently have a situation where someone alleges that he was *ABUSED* for specifically being Jewish- did this happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouRegan1 @LouRegan1 weve seen version of events from CLP members who were in the meeting that confirm your version of events and put into question Nadias version and the individual who has allegedly made claims that he was allegedly “abused” -you’re right to challenge. Smears are never OK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani @AaronBastani mate you need to wake up and smell the coffee - yesterday labour didn’t even bother commenting on Palestinian solidarity day- and the Palestinians have been facing daily suffering for decades; what made you naively think they’ll be up speaking for you?   Hierarchy🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilymoonlight @hapoelorient It just beggars belief - I really don’t think I could do politics - there’s no way I could be in within a party that sees suffering and shrugs its shoulders...   NewManagement’s picking and choosing which minority group they support/shun has been revealing this weekend🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlewishAnd Are you surprised? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

No to Palestinian lives  No to black lives  No to victims of war crimes perpetrated by British troops   Yes to Britain first - no ifs no buts!  Yes to everyone who campaigned against labour in recent times  Yes to antiBAME racism 🌹🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hapoelorient @emilymoonlight It just leaves you speechless doesnt it .... only 60 MPs who aren’t tories are bothered about these deportations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imelda_mairead @StenderWorld @PriyamvadaGopal Between the origins of the word/name and the gammon gaslighting about British colonialism and imperialism? ....   Am I missing something here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imelda_mairead @StenderWorld @PriyamvadaGopal I think we are all here asking how India whose national English was not English until Britain arrived came to have a square called Connaught place, and why a British gammon is trying to gaslight about the British empire and what it did to places it colonised. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @EHRC Lol  Another day ... another @UKLabour calamity ... the “Forensic” Newmanagement approach just keeps giving. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  And so the show continues 📺 🍿 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StenderWorld @PriyamvadaGopal Didn't realise Connaught - was an Indian Hindi/Urdu word! 2020 proves to be another educational year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsternweiner Can someone confirm whether what happened in NottsEast -and the counter allegations are being investigated?  Because smears are serious allegations, that shouldnt go unchallenged!   @NadiaWhittomeMP - your credibility is quickly diminishing, though im sure rising in some quarters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @RLong_Bailey 3/ I want to understand why the antenna of attention seem to be functional if the target is JC or people deemed to be supporters of JC.... but miraculously if the culprits are KS fans: the twitter police are fast asleep/ mute/absent/blind/deaf  Someone plz explain this phenomenon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @RLong_Bailey 2/ One was compelled to accept the actions of Keir because indeed AS has to be dealt with. However, then comes the moment, where Keir's cheerleaders suddenly commit the same crime - suddenly, the vocal people/the twitter likes/retweet police are absent from the scene.  WHY? WHY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Theres a pattern Im starting to see develop which really leaves me feeling very uncomfortable about whats going on in Labour. There are people I follow who would be first to call out a tweet/like/retweet that is linked to AS - indeed @Keir_Starmer used @RLong_Bailey as an example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TingedFunny @NadiaWhittomeMP Did someone who said “Palestine is not a thing” agree with her ? @NadiaWhittomeMP you need to reassess yourself and your sponsors- this is trash 🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa All current right wing ideologies that will kill anyone in order to achieve their self aims (and left ones that do the same to be fair)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker @AmmarKazmi_ @paulmasonnews @OwenJones84 @FisherAndrew79 Does your post suggest that Jeremy has never apologised? Because if he has apologised previously he can’t control how those whom receive the apology react to it.  If I wrong you and apologise the way I see fit, you can’t turn and tell me “yes but say it this way”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Lab needs:🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @paultinay  you were on to something mate 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 It’s about today ex colonies started renaming their likes and rivers - the way african lakes are named always leaves me scratching my head ... lake Albert, lake Edward, lake Victoria etc etc .... how many Africans met these characters that the lakes were named after?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Keir_Starmer People keep telling me “oh but you have to give him due credit” “oh he’s great” “oh judge fairly”  Are people kidding me? What’s there to give credit to? What’s being judged “unfairly” .... and lastly what’s “great” about @Keir_Starmer ?  I’ve searched, pondered- nothing found❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexWingrove4 @AvaSantina Are you serious? 😳😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digeeza @AyoCaesar Lol the classic “yeahhh we stole, looted, killed... renamed your country, removed your language and culture .... but yeah fuck off and shut up” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Gotta love the British for their take on  self-reflection on their history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Hahaha🤣   And this same uneducated character will be the first to moan when @nationaltrust tries to tell the historical truth about the empire!  Never mind road names: Britain went overseas and changed peoples’ country names i.e Rhodesia. Named lakes after their queens etc🤷🏾‍♂️🤣❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__mike91 @Icky_84 @Keir_Starmer 24hrs later- he comes out with a📣to talk about Sikhism and his unwavering support for Sikhs -the hierarchy at play from @Keir_Starmer is genuinely disturbing.   Dear Keir &amp; @UKLabour the issue you’re blind to is that minorities have solidarity for each other! U playing games❌👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Haha I’m here for the “let’s skip 29th November: Palestinians? Who are they again? Nope 👎🏾 not getting involved with that shit!”   30th November: “oh hey Minority groups - I’m here to affirm my commitment to you?”  This mans solidarity is very problematic and extremely selective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem @Gabriel_Pogrund Here’s the tweet in question: The @UKLabour said that EVERYONE must accept the findings &amp; recommendations by EHRC in FULL. Those who dont/question/refuse are being suspended. In this quote Mandelson QUESTIONS the EHRC and goes further to suggest its recommendations need editing🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/OyArnazBSi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem @OwenJones84 @Gabriel_Pogrund So in other words - back to the status quo that was judged to be inadequate - where indeed there was allegedly an independent process (on paper)- that could be intervened upon depending on who was being complained about, and what alleged allegation was?  So nothing has changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem @Gabriel_Pogrund In the words of Theresa May: nothing has *materially* changed🤷🏾‍♂️  This clarification neither adds nor takes away from the discussion at large which is that an individual in Labour Party is now advocating for bypassing lessons learnt by EHRC - which are supposed to be implemented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem @OwenJones84 @Gabriel_Pogrund What in the word “independent” remains ambiguous and confusing? The point of the EHRC was to highlight and challenge the flaw in a system that allows politicians and people with vested interests from intervening in what should others be an “independent” process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabriel_Pogrund @OmarSalem @OwenJones84 Lol love to see it - when someone accuses someone of lies and the accused is ready to show the receipts!   Respect to @Gabriel_Pogrund   Gotta check these truth twisters🌪expediently before their twisting gains traction! 🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  https://t.co/Yh92WLPKEf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@expressionessd1 The only person going to hell on a high speed ticket is that lady! Period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabriel_Pogrund It’s all very bizarre really, I’m astonished yesterday and seemingly today labour will continue internal fights and factionalism: Has any labour including y’all that dissect things in threads actually reflected on what #Palestinian going through? It’s all a joke to labour? Sad❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirk1978 Good morning,  The tea is good this morning!   Let’s looking forward to their steadfast suspension 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/AmBIIdrYlv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar @AyoCaesar ask him “what does he think needs to be done to tackle racism in the police, judiciary and uk society?”   I think “BAME” have tried the “ignore the issue and see if it goes away” - but ever since Meghan appeared on the scene: racism has been injected with steroids 🤷🏾‍♂️🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lenetra806 @prime_bee Marinade 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 done right!   The other one ... his dad took him out the fridge before the marinade set! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Big up #HarryandMeghan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_NatashaDevon @_NatashaDevon discovered you today - when you took down the Brenda who thinks she knows #MeghanMarkle on a personal level enough to hurl insults at her calling her: insecure, attention seeking!  You handled it well, you checked her good!  Just thought I’d give you a shout out!🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbdalrahimMF New follower ! Solidarity to you brother! Inshallah you’re safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ @Archimbaldo I’m activating alerts because I’m keen to understand what the issue with the Nottingham east situation is?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bestmum42 @LBC @_NatashaDevon The most bizarre accusations hurled by Brenda is that she was speaking about “Meghans insecurity” as if she knows Meghan on a personal level! What insight does Brenda have about Meghans personal life? Brenda love, your son and daughter-in-law ARE NOT Meghan! Period!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMonehen @UKLabour One☝🏾take home message today has been quite staggering indeed: For first time in many years (and Ive not even been interested in politics for that long) labour has decided in 2020 NOT to unanimously endorse Palestinians and publicly state that they condemn their plight  Revealing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judefkwilkinson @AaronBastani @redbridgelabour 3/ today of all days, an adult who is evidently A MEMBER of the @UKLabour in a senior position with access to passwords and sensitive material despite on #PalestineDay to call Palestinian suffering a hoax... there’s clearly an attitude that gave him the confidence to do so! Mad🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judefkwilkinson @AaronBastani @redbridgelabour 2/ I would argue it’s frankly no different to how in the USA - under Trump certain people felt empowered and emboldened to go out and harass/ abuse/ pour out racism etc!  There are indeed cranks on both sides: but by god: recall what significance today held for #Palestinians 🤷🏾‍♂️🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judefkwilkinson @AaronBastani @redbridgelabour 1/ Self inflicted...  One thing we have to ask ourselves: how is that the current leadership gives empowerment and courage to people such as those at @redbridgelabour to feel emboldened to post this stuff? There’s an apparent environment that appears to encourage this behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Keep talking/tweeting @DawnButlerBrent  you’re making my evening!   🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  https://t.co/XwHVtdg5UY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani @redbridgelabour No more needs to be said/clarified @AaronBastani puts it well.  A grown adult senior in @redbridgelabour sees it fit and appropriate to nullify the lived experiences of people who see their home demolished on a regular, their farms burnt/butchered, sheep ran over. And response?🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/yaQ776ZXdM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber First and foremost - look after numero uno - yourself! The current state of affairs in this nation with covid pandemic can very easily consume the strongly minded.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewGraystone The way you captured the light and green of the leaf 🍃 on a background of grey/black is incredible. For a moment I thought it was a leaf that had been photographed on a dark background (or is it so?)...  Either way great photo 🤷🏾‍♂️🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @UKLabour @redbridgelabour The @UKLabour hasnt even bothered to comment ... in fact I can add that the leader of the LabourParty hasn’t really posted anything of support to the Palestinians today (I think)🧐...   Today was a sign: LabourParty is no longer bothered about Palestine. Tories/Lab now the same🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official Right? The incredible thing is that 1) the @UKLabour member at @redbridgelabour decided to post his 💯DISRESPECT to Palestinians and their lived experiences on the international day of solidarity with Palestine. It’s like someone posting “rwanda genocide was hoax”on our Kwibuka🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimSimonH @redbridgelabour No more needs to be said:  From my understanding of political social media accounts: every borough/ constituency has a pyramid type of organisation.

<|startoftext|>@shirleymush Here are some receipts of how they want to use the #Palestinians to get at their enemies - @redbridgelabour couldn’t have it much clearer about how low they’re prepared to stoop!  Seriously ON THE DAY of solidarity with Palestinians they chose to pour forensic bile acid🤷🏾‍♂️❌!  https://t.co/1fvZds6R5a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMonehen It’s actually more than that: it’s the denial of LIVED experiences of #Palestinian people; more strangely the senior member of @redbridgelabour decided of all days to tweet their tweet today on a day the world “attempts” to remember Palestinians and their suffering! It’s VILE❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour I’m done with this.  As I said: your welcome to interpret it as you wish; that’s your entitlement -   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️tongue in cheek commentary is apparently, no longer a thing. That’s exactly what it was: for someone whom I think we knew each other.   Lesson of 29/11/2020😂  Au dieu 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redbridgelabour Offender needs identifying @redbridgelabour ❌  Also this post is short of an apology that needs to be rightly be made to the #Palestinian people.  On a day of reflection on the suffering Palestinians face, a senior member of your organisation at Redbridge decided to offend🇵🇸🤷🏾‍♂️?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour Jeeez okay.   Farewell 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour your interpretation is a reach! But boy you’re entitled to your interpretation and I’m not even going to bother going forward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour Of course I did - hence I signposted to show you wag1 in @redbridgelabour - sorry for bringing your attention to anything.  Interaction ends henceforth  https://t.co/v6mMMghUsz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour When did I say @viewsfromleft personally doesn’t care about Palestinians?

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour I didn’t come for you, I signposted you to the tweet - that’s all!  I came for the idiot who chose to malign and disrespect Palestinians   The end 🇵🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour @UKLabour 4) whoever posted that shit is in your party and has access to the account of @redbridgelabour social media account!   5) what was posted is abominable callous and plain disrespect towards the Palestinians! And for it to have happened of all days today says all there’s is to know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker @redbridgelabour 1) I have been to a @UKLabour meeting, 2) I have walked the damn streets in the rain trying to get your party elected   3) don’t you dare insult my intelligence with regards to what I think about Palestinians and their suffering!  Rather than finding the racist you coming for me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitDinosaur @thetwerkinggirl Haha it’s okay - I understood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @michaeljswalker Hmm the @redbridgelabour twitter account *actually* not “one person” trolling.  And trolling about the deaths and suffering of Palestinians is not “trolling” It’s abominable.  We see the solidarity y’all have for Palestinians though haha - what a party 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faizashaheen @redbridgelabour @UKLabour @AngelaRayner @NadiaWhittomeMP @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent @HackneyAbbott @labourlewis @RichardBurgon   Labour .... this was “not one person” - it was a local labour twitter page<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker No words 😶   @viewsfromleft mate sort your people out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsobel @alexsobel I have a curious question how did the situation become such that one nation was created and another has its nationhood up for the debate? the nation that once existed no longer exists as a “nation” and here we are posting meaningless tweets about it all?  🤯🤷🏾‍♂️ Bizarre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare @Hardeep216 This week has been a revelation. Also it’s so crazy to see that all it took for @UKLabour to take the conservatives stance on Palestine🇵🇸 was for JC to be chased away from the limelight...  Today the Labour Party did NOT unanimously post solidarity🤷🏾‍♂️❌  Mad🤯  Earned a follow! 🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP @UN @NadiaWhittomeMP with respect - where has your beloved party been today ?   Today should have been a day where the #Palestinian people are rendered full solidarity! Look at the calamity of it all: at 21:15 after all the @UKLabour drama is when we now offer our solidarity? Really?  https://t.co/7BuAQFW1pX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitDinosaur @thetwerkinggirl I’m guessing white supremacy and apartheid (politics by racism) is no longer a thing in 21st century then?   Because last time I checked - racism and white supremacy were still live and kicking... and apartheid by definition is rule influenced by racism and inequality: also alive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity Be careful - tonight not only is forensic Keir on a hunt for antiKeirs  - he’s hired twitter to aid him on his quest - people being suspended for saying racism white supremacy are a thing in 21st western world - it’s mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexJamesNicola @piersmorgan Shouldn’t the police being pursuing him for breaking the rules ? I thought it was a 10,000£  charge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @JewishLabour Anyone going to wish #Palestinians a happy solidarity day ...   ....   Is that a no?  https://t.co/Y41XAcpFO5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlewishAnd What a random tweet - hmm I think you’ll recognise Palestinians are largely being uprooted, made homeless, made to lose all they held dear...  An iPhone 12, unlimited internet access and twitter accounts to “voice” their feelings may *just* not be a luxury they hold...fuckin hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraSmithCrewe It’s always refreshing to see quotes from important people in history actually used appropriately. Rather than when tories and other fake pretenders try to gaslight and have to be corrected by the descendants of the great people!  Yes @LauraSmithCrewe 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸  https://t.co/UgAYV6jews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Good point lol 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl “Rice”? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Is this some sort of vegan rice ? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay Exactly! Haha mate so many tories have blocked me too, even though I’ve never had any exchange wit them - it’s utterly weird.  Politicians too afraid to engage with British citizens - how very noble and brave! 🤷🏾‍♂️  The political class of 21st century UK is an embarrassment 🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay Also would you not argue they reach their echo chambers?   Take tories few weeks ago tweeting about their belief that poor people spend welfare money on brothels and drugs and then tories coming out talking about “how compassionate and great to work with XYZ” is? Just bizarre❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IGIHE Hahaha ahwiii cyakora rwose Genda Rwanda uri nziza.

Aho bavanye ibi binyoma ngo park is getting too packed- simpazi🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay Spot on mate! They think a tweet is equivalent to standing in parliament, getting legislation done, challenging orthodoxy...   In many ways social media has made politicians lazy! A word limited tweet is now measured equally to a statement in Parliament<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ indeed ... materially what has she done? What’s she achieved ?   Has she stopped a demolition? Has she secured shelter for the displaced? Has she achieved a stoppage to the annexations?   Indeed what has she done?   Answer: she tweeted and then turned a kettle on and chilled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elusiveman01 Green snakes in green tall grass - I don’t think anyone saw it coming mate!   Moral of the story is: tories ? Labour ? All crafted from the same clay: liars 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisanandy Haha lol 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I guess a tweet will do!   Gracious for your “solidarity”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Where’s #Morrisons at?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie She’s made it clear: she’s that friend that will date and shag your ex when he/she dumps you, and she will smile about it, as you spiral into depression ! She will then label you insane and mad 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Translation: she’s a snake 🐍 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsternweiner Can some1 please ask @UKLabour if at any point today the party intends on wishing solidarity to #Palestinian people... @lisanandy ?   Or at very least, can labour be transparent as tories that Palestinian lives and their experiences henceforth mean nothing to them. Clarity needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solma_ahmed @AngelaRayner @jeremycorbyn Lesson: in politics your enemies will be the ones to tap you on the back and even offer you a kiss on the cheek. When the day comes to get one over you: they’ll do it with a smile on their face and with no regrets whatsoever   Exhibit A: @AngelaRayner and the forensic Keir🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla Genuine question - have I missed something or is today NOT the international solidarity day for the #Palestinians 🤷🏾‍♂️? Has @UKLabour actually done or said anything helpful today towards the Palestinians who perpetually continue to endure hardship, uprooting, demolition @lisanandy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie It’s typical for people with asthma to tend to see their asthma worsen during the autumn winter seasons - also can’t imagine masks are helping if you already have a condition that is associated with breathing problems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @Nigel_Farage Haha I love the way Farage the Kent coast guard is now complaining that suddenly the police is unfair... has he tried being non-white in the Uk for the last many decades? Where the police, judiciary, employers, society etc all treat you as second class?🤷🏾‍♂️  Answer: NO! He’s racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry One of the very few things I agree with Femi on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mowords I was thinking exactly that: what is she seriously on about? Which black parson has argued that there aren’t bad black peoples? Or that all white people are bad?   Asking for history of colonialism to be taught accurately has nothing to do with “all black people are good” 🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulEmbery @thetwerkinggirl Controversial and divisive for who?  Only morons who think racism is “debatable” see things from this angle. The one and only message that BLM ✊🏾 said was and remains: treat black peoples with the respect they deserve in all walks of life: judiciary, jobs, and stop racism! End❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seismically Hahahaa   “I thought this was the suburbs?”  My girl be like “nah this is the HOOD”🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/35uXLZZSqR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 What on Earth is “semiracist”   Can someone explain what the hell “SEMI RACIST” is?   And I am bloody not buying the “I have black friends” bullshit!  FYI just because you have black colleagues at work/ your kids have black classmates etc does NOT mean you have Black friends❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl 2/ can you imagine being at a concert and the person you’ve gone to see starts insighting hatred and racism ... would you stay at that concert ? (I suppose those who stayed agreed with his rant which makes them all damn racist) #Stormzy was damn right about this nation 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🇬🇧❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Was never aware- found out today about this racism wasteman!   Had the misfortune of reading his words about “are there any foreigners here? If yes fuck off” - I’m astounded. And what is way too damn annoying is that whilst he was ranting about black peoples: white people chilled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graemello7 @SecretG53334081 @LiamThorpECHO @oswaldgutenberg Okay we get it - racism against black peoples is up for debate and frankly can be ignored as far as you’re concerned- you don’t have to pretend you’re bothered/care...  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Georgiii364 @feeldalove168 I find it astonishing and “interesting” how the same peoples who claim “oh it was ages ago/ oh he was on drugs” never have time for when a nonWhite person is accused of crime: they’re the first to say “shouldn’t have done XYZ” oh and I bet they’re the same clowns who hound Meghan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Graemello7 @SecretG53334081 @LiamThorpECHO @oswaldgutenberg Forgiveness is an individual personal act - you can forgive whom ever you choose to, it doesn’t mean others have to act similarly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ I have to say- Im now in 2 minds about @NadiaWhittomeMP -her own actions and statement about the individual to whom the motions concern and what she is now objecting against are now contradictory. In many ways the CLP are doing exactly what she’s done in her statements previously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @guardian Also I feel that 🇬🇧 needs a massive overhaul of all elements of the education system. Comprehensives need to be more rigorous, parents need to take more ownership in educating their children. There shouldn’t be the massive disparity we see between Grammar and comp🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @guardian Hmm fair enough, what you say isn’t untrue, however I take issue with Bercow bringing the guillotine for grammar schools whilst remaining quiet on private schools - if the argument is that grammar schools are unfair in society, what on Earth are private schools? God’s gift to UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian If that’s the argument - Private school must go first.  grammar school provide children from average/poor backgrounds with a chance to attend relatively high achieving schools. Grammar schools have a good record of getting top grades.   It is private schools that are unfair 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graemello7 @SecretG53334081 @LiamThorpECHO @oswaldgutenberg Is if Hitler suddenly says he tolerates Jewish people - do you suggest we are supposed to cheer and rejoice and give Hitler a  knighthood for his “tolerance” towards non Aryan people?  GTFOH🏃🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guardian @guardian here's a translation for you: "55% of the British population say that being asked to treat black people with the respect they deserve makes them feel anxious and uncomfortable.

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IanDunt @TomSwarbrick1 Mate absolutely   It’s so infuriating- they simultaneously champion themselves as righteous and generous and well meaning and “why can’t we all just get along” and then they also defend far right ideology that results in casualties🤷🏾‍♂️. When questioned? “Oh move on nothing to see”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IanDunt @TomSwarbrick1 He will caveat it with “as someone who used to work for the last Home Secretary/Prime minister: I KNOW her to be an AMAZING women and I don’t regret working for her”  The amount of times ive heard Tom give some gaslight explanation to why he supported a racist gov🤷🏾‍♂️!

<|startoftext|>@PaulbernalUK @StevePeers ...

<|startoftext|>@crookedfootball Most intriguingly watch for the lack of “breaking news” headlines from media outlets   This Wednesday is going to be a business as usual day as far as media is concerned ... this is the problem with this nation: the media and politicians pick and choose which racism is important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimesScary @soniasodha Exactly this!  They got away with it because the population at large and the media that hardly represents black peoples allowed them to get away with it.  Our current PM has written openly antiblack racist literature; media pretty much sold Boris as the best man in the UK🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha Why did it take this long for this conclusion to be reached?  We’ve had to live through how many Tory home secs/ prime ministers for this reality to be spelt out to those who wanted to ignore it?  It was plain as a summers day from the start that this was racist/discrimination❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl Lol yea, so did all tories about their Queen PritiPatel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl I don’t know anything about her,  And I’ll refrain from commenting about her personally. What is can say is there’s another split which is interesting. I’m just hear to comment on the “Ive known X for XYZ years and she’s as great as my mum therefore everyone else piss off” tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl Haha   I love the speed at which the Labour Party deploy the Tory taught mantra of: “Ive known X for XYZ years and she’s utterly marvellous, anyone who disagrees with my personal bias can fuck off”  Bravo Labour 👏🏾 🙌🏽 🎉   Totally admirable and very very democratic indeed❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JAACable Being a labour member must be painful.  I’m glad I only watch in dismay from the fence. Even from the fence it’s painful and disturbing. Must be terrible as a member   This party is a mess - everyone hates everyone more than they hate tories - pathetic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @mrjamesob Racists over last few years have felt emboldened... they were used to an environment where they can gaslight to the nth degree and face no consequences.

<|startoftext|>@S1imN3ddy Neither do we...  and ironically those who championed him as the forensic unifier are part of the disunity brigade ...   The party is definitely A LOT more divided!

<|startoftext|>@RidgeOnSunday @SkyNews Journalists are asking Tories about #PritiPatelBullying issue in a way that allows them to revert to “PM has addressed it move on”  They need to ask “@RishiSunak in ur department do you SHOUT and SWEAR at staff? Has your department had to be sued for driving staff to suicide🤷🏾‍♂️❌?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckettUnite @Keir_Starmer He wants to forensically abstain because opposing the government is being opposition of opposition sake... in conclusion he will push for abstention and anyone who dares vote against his wishes will have whip removed 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@montie The government wasn’t really thinking about the taxpayer when they were putting out their business contracts to their mates were they? Suddenly government must pay people adequately because it might be “unfair” hahah - tories are simply hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carryonkeith @MartinRemains Also what’s with the “alleged” it’s bloody been confirmed !!  Why is the media utterly useless?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar It’s similar to things like HIV where people find out incidentally that they’re positive for the virus despite to the best of their knowledge never having had symptoms. Therefore they don’t even recall where they may have count virus. Those would be termed asymptomatic cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar It means that the mass testing picked up people who tested POSITIVE for the virus but were exhibiting NO symptoms of the virus at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius363 @jrschlosberg Jo killed a fox for the banter and bragged about it on twitter hoping he’d get likes and retweets by blue tick centrists ....   Lest we forget what human being Jo is ...  Pass it on 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timpetherick @Keir_Starmer ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  When truth is spoken, I have to acknowledge it and .... love it !!! Sooo @timpetherick I love this !!  https://t.co/eetVm0WpFQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @edwardpoole1975 @expressionessd1 🤔🤔🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/L5rmxXjRVT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Exactly this point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 It’s mad mate! Absolutely mad!  Also can’t believe she’s literally broken the ministerial code so many times ... she’s dreadful.  Tories love to moan about Diane being incompetent, the only separator between the two is that: Priti is incompetent and callous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 You’re probably right about women leaders in general... but on this Patel thing - she is a bully and the report suggests so, and the fact the home Office HAS PAID out damages suggests there’s evidence to prove that ... she does not deserve any squaring around and shielding 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Boris hasnt got much talent thats the problem. Boris’ government is short of talent. Also it’s ideology and direction is so dangerous, Boris and DomCummings need people who just do what they’re told.  They have new incomers who want to prove loyalty. It’s dangerous for the nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 So a bully is allowed if “their ability overrides everything”? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Also I get it you may prefer managers who walk on the line of acceptable/unacceptable - but the whole workplace is not about how one individual who enjoys rough treatment. A workplace has to be safe for ALL staff.   Bullying or behaviours that ride on the edge aren’t acceptable🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Well not sure is crass -Boris wanted an independent investigator (jury do the same thing), Sir AlexAllan found #PritiPatel did indeed bully (juries make decisions and communicate it to a judge). Boris heard the conclusion and decided to toss it to the side. How is it bad analogy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Notwithstanding of course a report funded by the prime minister looked at the evidence and indeed concluded that she did bully staff.   What you’re all doing is: a jury was asked to look at evidence, it gave a conclusion, you’re now decided jury shouldn’t have bothered. Well🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 I’m concerned that people are deciding to throw themselves behind #PritiPatel with zero regard for the people she has bullied. The selectiveness of the support Ive seen on twitter is nauseating: you’re all parading for the proven bully and suggesting victims are liars! It’s crass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 It’s not that mate, I’ve equally worked under different people medicine was not my first job by any stretch of the imagination: no matter how “assertive” managers want to be there’s an absolute FINE LINE you will NOT shout and swear at me and expect me to bow and kneel!❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Lol 😂   Anyway I’m done with this topic.   Needless to say: we fundamentally disagree on the meaning and impact of bullying. If one of my colleagues tried to commit suicide because of a senior staff, I’d want to see the staff face consequences   Happy Saturday. 🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 No need to apologise, it’s eye opening to say the least. A report funded by the prime minister proved she did bully her staff, and the home office has paid out to someone who nearly committed suicide because of #PritiPatel behaviour. I remain dumbfounded that there’s disagreement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 You might tolerate bullying - that’s your prerogative. I categorically do not, irrespective of the work environment. Whether it be in banking, army, education and or indeed government.   Lastly every work place has a code of conduct unless you work in a primitive jungle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Im not going to patronise you by defining bullying because I know you’re fully aware of what bullying is. Your interpretation of this #PritiPatel bullying crisis is one I do not agree with in any form whatsoever.  You’re lending your support to someone who’s been proven a bully👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Paul, at work consultants readily bully and intimidate Junior doctors, it leads to patient safety problems where a junior is too scared to call out something and in end patient gets inappropriate treatment. It s happened before. There’s a case study of wrong kidney removed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 I’m sorry but calling out BULLYING has nothing to do with “suppressing personality” and if ones personality is that of being a bully that drives people to near suicide: it’s not us who are wrong to call it out, it’s the bully who is wrong for having a disgusting personality🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 So from this you’re more prepared to take the words of the BULLY who has already accepted she did bully because she “apologised” - people do not tend to apologise for nothing. Secondly you must be under impression #SirAlexAllan made the allegations up and the victims lied 🤥?  🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 There’s a catalogue of issues with #PritiPatel and her #bullying and I am truly gobsmacked to see people coming in the defence of a bully.  My last point: you wouldn’t like your friends or family being bullied at work, (unless I’m wrong).  https://t.co/O8wGjRd7iY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 The report wasnt done to identify sexual harassment: it was done to identify whether a minister bullied her staff. The report found that she DID BULLY people. Also you seem to be unaware that someone is suing the home office for almost committing suicide due to Priti behaviour🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 Harassment and swearing is bullying and the employment code do conduct states clearly that it’s not permitted.   Bullying does NOT constitute “being stern” the report done by an independent hired by the PM found that #PritiPatel did indeed BULLY colleagues.  Why are you spinning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 2/ I hasten to add: #PritiPatel worked in 3 separate ministries and all 3 departments reported a pattern of behaviour of intimidation, harassment, shouting and swearing! I go to work to fulfill my duties as an employee- I dont go to work to get shouted and sworn at! ❌to bullying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 FYI employment CODE of CONDUCT set the record straight that BULLYING, harassment, discrimination is NOT ever acceptable.  All this gaslighting you guys are trying to do really is shameful. One day your relatives/friends/children will be in jobs: do you welcome them being bullied?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @expressionessd1 I told him straight “Your vote for a rightwing racist party puts MY life at risk!  So don’t come chatting to me as if we’re friends when you vote for people who would within a heartbeat cause me harm!   He spent rest of day trying to be👍🏼reminding me trump lost Georgia! Lol 😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Whataboutery is only allowed if the right is trying to evade responsibility.  How on Earth people are defending bullying is an absolute mystery. FYI rightwing this is not about stopping your glorious brexit: this is about BULLYING in the work place! It’s NOT okay! Stop the BS❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @kelechnekoff All charities should dissociate from the conservatives because this week they’ve shown that they stand for INjustice.  As a matter of fact all churches should do the same.   But alas this country seems to be stuck in a wicked spell. Blind to racism, blind to corruption etc.🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @expressionessd1 Indeed! At work, someone who very clearly voted Tories tried to speak to me about “omg why does Jeremy have such an issue with racism” I had to be like “STOP❌❌ right there” And I told him the shopping list of racism in tories (that he was appaz unaware of). He went silent🤔🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@expressionessd1 @feeldalove168 I can hazard a guess: They were thinking - Britain first -  Deport people who don’t look like us or have roots that can be traced to beyond Queen Victoria.   They were so desperate to cause harm to others, they inadvertently voted for a corrupt party, that only cares about itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha The thing is this: @andrealeadsom not long ago had a meltdown about bullying in HoC with regards... and indeed another tory few weeks ago nearly had a seizure about “scum” - and the whole party went into synchronised chorus about it, they also cried about “that woman” by Jeremy🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl I’ve the same question? Why does pronouncing oneself in January require taxpayers to donate money?  Does Biden and Kamala have no legs to walk into their respective new houses? Do they suddenly have no money to buy food etc?  Also their party donors gave them millions anyway🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_herriett @Georgiii364 I mean... you are aware of the circumstances under which she was last time fired by Theresa May?   Corruption and having unsolicited meetings with foreign politicians outside her remit of minister!   She’s self entirely, she’s an INTENTIONAL bully and indeed intentionally corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 Sir AlexAllan made an error of giving them a spin line....the one (literally ONE) clause they’ve all been spinning into a woollen jumper to cushion #PritiBully is the “unintentional” line  It now transpires from a ex senior civil servant that Priti was aware of her victims views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor I did indeed suspect something ODD; when the spin line “unintentional” was picked up by Tories and spun into a woollen jumper to cushion #PritiBully!  It’s actually clear that Priti KNEW the impact of her behaviour and #SirAlexAllen knew that. But he threw Tories a lifeline! ❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour At end of the day, by not challenging poor behaviour, poor decisions, inadequate responses in a timely manner - we embolden these power hungry leaders.  In the end we end up with egotistical, intransigent party leaders; who act on behalf of lobbyists with massive biases! It’s bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour Indeed; therein lies the problem: in this nation on both sides we keep electing leaders with mediocre personalities, and who ultimately show us that theyre not up to the job. Rather than calling them out and holding them to account, we give them a pass. In end?🤷🏾‍♂️someone gets hurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour Okay - but what’s your leadership doing?   I recall us all concluding that ultimately JeremyCorbyn bore The responsibility of putting procedures into action (which he failed to do in timely manner) - the onus is not on the volunteers and campaigners.  Leader has duty of care 🤷🏾‍♂️☝🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour The ministerial code is a red herring here - BULLYING is WRONG ALL the time. Whether it’s students doing it, MPs, party members, party staffers, ministers, Prime ministers, CEOs, women/men etc.  There’s too much focus on the nuance rather than: victims of bullying hurt the same🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour So what are people doing to hold their forensic to account?   Because I’m seeing a lot of “can talk the talk, but can’t walk the walk”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour I therefore can’t see how Labour voters  can be simultaneously gobsmacked about conservatives today ... whilst full heartedly throwing their hearts, souls and weight behind a leadership that also remains silent on issues of racism - and only acts selectively on racism.   🤷🏾‍♂️❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @UKLabour And what .... so; labour doesn’t have a duty of care towards its members (including those who aren’t white or Jewish?)  Because the way things are looking based on actions taken vs actions not taken: if you are one of the above 2 - your grievances may be heard, if not: shut up🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon On what leg was labour standing on having a go at conservatives re: #PritiBully when what #DianeAbbott #DawnButler #CliveLewis etc have highlighted in @UKLabour pertaining to antiblack racism haven’t been solved?   I really need cheerleaders 📣of #Newleadership to explain this ☝🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Civil servants are apparently being bullied by #PritiBully  and you came out throwing your weight behind the BULLY on international day against bullying ... let that sink in.  At this rate, we don’t need any components from fakers and sponsors of ministerial code breakers! ❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @UKLabour   Dear Labour Party, whilst you’re prepared to stay silent on this kind of bullying from labour right towards the labour left.  You can all take several seats and apply super glue on your rear-ends whilst you’re at it!   Your party is plagued by bullying❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilHarding Hear hear 👏🏾👏🏾  I full heartedly agree with everything in this tweet.  When you look at al events that have occurred in labour since his coming to power - especially if you’re a minority group, @NeilHarding summary is pretty accurate. If you’re black/Muslim you’re back of queue❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable well done! Need the motivation to do half of what you do on my days off 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan We must fire #PritiPatel the #bully if we care about bullying in the workplace...  Pass it on! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraSmithCrewe @pritipatel I really cannot understand and believe that the prime minister has on 20/11/2020 endorsed bullying in the work place. Everyone that #PritiBully has bullied should now legally sue the home officer for emotional and psychological harassment in the work place. The report CONFIRMS it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LfcBecky Hahah Osborne, Sajid are definitely trying wayyyy too hard! Osborne looks like he’s got leg deformity!   Keith ... no comment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sathnam I’m astonished ... incidentally the man who resigned gave #PritiPatel the bully a spin line “unintentional” ...  I suspect the author of the report unwittingly added in the word “unintentional” to give Patel a degree of grace as he had anticipated she’d resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Hear hear 👌🏾👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S1imN3ddy When you’re fundamentally maligned- you don’t just take a “hit”  Would you plead guilty to a crime you fundamentally and honesty haven’t committed on a condition of 3month   I categorically wouldn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S1imN3ddy How is Jeremy standing up against unfair dismissal anything to do with tories?  If at work your employer simply due to personal issues with you decides to 1) libel you, 2) destroy your reputation and 3) fire you on unlawful grounds- are you going to grab a cardboard box and pack?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobYoungMP @pritipatel Haha🤣The joys of being “young”’and immature indeed .... is that you get given a script of what to read out at the assembly ... and when you do a reasonable job of not messing up the script, you get a round of applause from your form tutor and you get a merit from headmaster 🥇👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 This what we all need to be telling bullies to do — which is to get lost and resign !!  This country has really descended into corruption and chaos now that the government is actively encouraging bullying and corruption!   Well done British people for voting for this nightmare❌  https://t.co/S1nXZqJjVy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Thats precisely what shes saying. She’s probably deliberately erased from her selectively empty brain what antiblack racism has led to over the centuries; in her wee brain: slavery against black people was “Lol”, apartheid was “meh who cares”, colonialism was “fab”🤷🏾‍♂️  Shes racist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @labour @jeremycorbyn We were all wrong 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @labour @jeremycorbyn He was antiwar, pro solidarity, pro Palestinians - everything the status quo doesnt particularly want.  The media, the tories and the right wing of labour ALL went against him. Any and every allegation against him was hyped up by the media. The British in end voted for the lies🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official @labour #KeirStarmer has 1) broken the very principle that the EHRC ruled was a problem under Jeremy which was “political interference in complaints process” 2) he has completely ignored reports showing Labour Party in institutionally racist towards black and Muslims -what does that say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott Yes 🙌🏽 aunty @HackneyAbbott !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla Bravo to the #NEC and #CLPs they’re the ones upholding due process and procedure! Whilst the leader and his inner circle trying to bulldoze the rules to fit their biases!   Not so #forensic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Speechless at this, This seals my reflection on not rendering support to the Labour Party under its current form and leadership any time soon.  I tried, but I cannot support a bullying culture that pigeonholes minorities into important vs least important, it’s a big NO NO NO❌‼️  https://t.co/ZVcdefRksI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatAldgate Hear hear 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Live good lives, look after each other, be compassionate towards the rest of the world and be antiracist.   Leave the racism to Forensics who seem to have a skill in creating hierarchies of minorities: from most loved to least loved: people of colour at bottom🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solma_ahmed That would be, bcoz of the following: 1) Many white people who pretend to be antiracist are conditionally antiracist- in other words: they will stand up for you as a minority ONLY if you lick their rear end, and put up with their banter 2) Keir has made it clear there's hierarchy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjyNtheMonkey I’m all for it!  I’m going to consider green at the next election that’s for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @gsjosan Leaves you speechless doesnt it ?  We’re breaking the procedures we’re vowed to improve and protect .... how does that work out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @gsjosan I’m genuinely beginning to lose it with labour - just arrived home from work thinking I’d seen enough for the day .... lo and behold new chaos concerning *drum roll: process and procedure and failure thereof “  I thought that the new messiah was deemed to be “forensic”? Madness🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gsjosan @PatrickWDixon   Confidential proceedings leaked by NewLeadership - what’s actually going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gsjosan Much respect for speaking out and setting the record straight!  There’s something absolutely rotten about the NewLeadership and this post paints an interesting picture of what’s lurking beneath the veneers of “Forensicness”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjyNtheMonkey Interesting, because I’ve been contemplating green too... tories are a no go zone.... LibDems can never 👎🏾 be trusted   And labour is also a new no go zone - full of self entitled dictators who think the whole party must revolve around their dreams and fantasies❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MATTxLAW No need to apologise: but for decent people who voted #KeirStarmer; picture this: In the last 2 weeks reports have come out that labour has issues with anti Islam racism/discrimination and Antiblack racism😵  MrForensic has up till now NOT made one comment: he’s NOT antiracist🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaniekmelvin I genuinely now have come to the conclusion that the “war” is manufactured. I cannot for the life of me comprehend why the left and right of labour cannot focus on the same goals: 1) both agree that racism in all forms is wrong 2) both agree tories are shit   Why cant they focus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjyNtheMonkey Curious - what’s your alternative?   I’m the same ... need recommendations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @60perre @RespectIsVital @Keir_Starmer I think you should reflect on the language and rhetoric that is contained within the #LabourLeaks: language of hate, desire to “purge” “shoot” “burn” people considered to be “left” (they referral to the left is “cranks”) - if you observe closely you’ll see those character traits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @60perre @RespectIsVital @Keir_Starmer Just read all replies after half hour of being busy; what is evident is that labour is stuck in perpetual self-damage; on all sides. What is particularly interesting is the actions of the LabourRight- all the accusations of “extremism/radical” hurled at Left i strong on the right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Deborahpower5 @RespectIsVital @Keir_Starmer Anyway ... so can someone help me with something... with all the shenanigans taken into account: what do we think today does for labour going forward?  Has this resolved issues? Caused more issues? What do we as people who don’t want tories in again do? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott  https://t.co/leOFG2hc4s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott I didn’t put anything in your mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @RespectIsVital @Keir_Starmer Which “independent” process.... how can it be called independent when his hands have been all over it from the beginning to end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott Incidentally ur last paragraph resonates with what JC said: opponents of labour took advantage of the antisemitism crisis and used it like a football to whitewash their own issues of racism.  What I want to know is why EHRC has not found Tories racist yet despite clear evidence🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott Lol they been given an opportunity on a platter - why shouldn’t they take it?   The whole handling by labour has been abysmal. The #EHRC concludes that political interference were root cause of problems under JC and KS now commits the same crime...   It’s a dogs breakfast🤷🏾‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman You came back on interesting day, today a serpent tied itself in knots and in effort to untangle itself, it bit itself and simultaneously spat venom at bystanders trying to help. And despite undoing one knot, it remains knotted at the tail end...   It’s an interesting day 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ I look forward to voting Green at the next election - thats what I’ll be doing 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital #Forensic #KeirStarmer did actually create this trap and he fell into it.... I really don’t blame the Tories anymore..  This attack line was handed to the tories on a platter. Frankly, I think Tories are right to enjoy the cake!   Keirs handling has been ABYSMAL 💯! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant 1) yeah  1 indeed is too many  2) if you’re going to carry on this mantra of the term “exaggeration” was unfounded you need to have the stats to reference your argument. Just because there’s 1 racist doesn’t make the rest guilty. The crisis was exaggerated by opponents - period🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DurstApologist Lol that’s not what I said at all. I was just curious when I saw someone that I know having his account screenshot and tweeted left right and centre. So I thought I’d give you a heads up - that is all.   Nothing more 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant What proportion of the labour membership were/are guilty of antisemitism? In mathematical terms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveNickSmith This is me this evening  https://t.co/F8OagSbs8l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist @PatrickWDixon why you screenshot in this 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant He had never said that antisemitism was exaggerated, he had criticised the media and political opponents (in and out) of the Labour Party of playing football with the whole tragic situation.... can everyone stop all this bullshit twisting of what was actually said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @Keir_Starmer @LabourMuslims This is the biggest travesty of this whole “labour is against ALL racism” bullshit!  I’ll most likely vote against labour - solely because of this clear evidence of racism and selectivity in labour! Labour under Keir is actually deliberately ignorant of all forms of racism bar AS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@People4Bernie @jeremycorbyn Oh wow @People4Bernie came through!   Love to see it!  Two men who protested and got arrested protesting against racism!   I Stan #BernieSanders 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  https://t.co/XUn8pEkmKV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity Good summary, if I may say so myself   👏🏾👏🏾  https://t.co/Cfg4L8RPxO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire Lol🤷🏾‍♂️🤣 What on Earth are you talking about?  Jeremy puts his principles first: which are of you hadn’t noticed: being steadfastly against all forms of racism He defended himself against unfair charges and the “process” has deemed hit fit to return to the party. What’s the issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Begs therefore the question: was this saga “really” about “process” or was it deliberate and erroneously calculated mathematics to get rid of #JeremyCorbyn at all costs?  Surely if it was about process, and the process concludes JC can rejoin; we should all “respect” process🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labourlewis Are you suggesting .... the glorious erudite #EHRC somehow turned a blind eye? How ever could they? They seem to spot the slightest antisemitic word/statement/phrase/sentence/gesture in the Labour Party .... how on earth did they miss a case of “antisemitism”? Oh it wasn’t JC🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ How you doinnnnnnnnn 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/20tMwSU9zm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl What’s this got to do with Jeremy Corbyn!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessicaelgot Who leaked it to? A reliable source ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maria4CarmsEast So confidentiality is also not a thing in the #Forensic NewLeadership?  Shock horror 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  All leaked names should should get their lawyers and sue as certain people sued when the #LabourLeaks report was leaked!  Also can someone please explain what is so “Forensic” about Keir?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Due process has not been followed whatsoever: we dont need to be convinced because the facts are as you say: PROCESS was NOT followed! End of story!  Also it’s ironic and very rich that the same crime pitted on Jeremy of political “interference” is exactly what’s going on today🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/4PgfrRH4Y3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani Excellent summary, The irony of all ironies is that the biggest crime that Jeremy allegedly committed was that he and his inner circles apparently frequently interfered in the processes rather than allow the process to be independent of “politics” - yet here we are.... forensic🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@celtjules66 @jeremycorbyn They made sure to whip up the most obscure accusations such as “omg look Jeremy sent Boris a Christmas card, what if the card is AS” media be like “breaking news jeremys card to Boris may have hint of AS”  Meanwhile his fight against racism i.e protest against apartheid hidden🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ledbettercarly Wonderful news!  And So the journey to psychological emancipation continues!   Bravo 👏🏾 #Barbados<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @Bob_in_NYorks How can anyone be “pressured”’to toss “LEGAL” ballots?  The act of tossing legal ballots is ironically ILLEGAL!  He needs to face legal prosecution for acts intended to corrupt the election system!  It appears many grown ups in the USA really aren’t all that smart after all🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🙅🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wirralphil1 Nothing wrong with that. It’s a free world, and disagree is not a bad thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solma_ahmed @LabourMuslims Facts! If the Forensic leader cannot spare 1min to compose a message of endorsement for the report which identifies racism and discrimination towards people of the Islam faith; how are we supposed to have confidence in him? Also people aren’t blind to his enthusiasm for AS issues  https://t.co/UKRSh4BR8z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wirralphil1 I think he was faced with a fork junction: either massively explain (with dilutional effect) what he meant or stick to his horses and be chastised out of the party with the racists in labour-Right gloating once he’s expelled.  Personally I think he did right thing: it’s “words”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wirralphil1 I think its all to do with drafting a statement that is legally watertight - I dont think Jeremy is rowing back from the essence of what is reality  words are simply just words - we all know Jeremy is AntiRACISM in all forms all the time‼️  I think we should not read too deeply🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 2/ lives in Russia and China are only protected from western episodic bombing because these nations respectively have nuclear weapons .... the west has to think thrice before even shooting a Russian coastguard boat.   It’s all about military, minerals, nuclear and money 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 Truth, nothing but the truth.  What is clear to those who are want to see it: is that the nations that coined the term “all lives are equal” did not really mean it. It’s just a facade. Lives in Africa, South America, Middle East are very much negotiable and dispensable🤷🏾‍♂️😩  https://t.co/kO4hNijjUQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @UKLabour What Ava said - facts facts facts and more facts!   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/fVhFdQNaNL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @BoardofDeputies @Martin_Abrams thank you for keeping it real!  🙏🏽👍🏼👍🏼  https://t.co/UVoJeiDYpv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @siennamarla As far as I remember the Jewish community went long way to explain that Israel does not automatically equal “Judaism” and that it’s possible to talk about Israel the nation critically.  So, I’m confused as to why everyone is jumping on her comments. UN has also used the same term<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @siennamarla Either way - what’s happened is that they knee jerk reacted ... and now they’re having row back and finding ways of diffusing the problem... in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Regardless of the geopolitics involved - Palestinians are not collateral damage ...   Gotta see the human lives involved in political and war games ... not the names or races of the nations involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m glad we’re able to end this conversation in good humour.  But take what I said seriously, don’t fall into traps of comparing and contrasting racism; personally I think when priorities start, we end up with hierarchies which pits minorities against each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon That’s all you had to say. Instead you really went on a Duke of Edinburg expedition to try tell me that I was wrong in reading it the way you wrote it.  Seriously mate you can do better than this. I hold you on high regard, don’t drag up us this hill 🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon In Rwanda for example: natives discriminated and killed natives - it was ONE country committing apartheid on itself we could argue.  In South Africa, it was a foreign nation committing apartheid against the native population.  That’s all there is to it. Stop the roundabouts❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick there’s nothing wrong with saying - “perhaps my terminology was off or incorrect” rather than trying to make it as if I’m the one who’s confused.  White South Africans are NOT native. It wasn’t one country committing apartheid on ITSELF. SouthAfrica was not Rwandagenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon How is Middle East Palestine-Israel different? You’re going to try tell me that Palestinians aren’t native either - that’s what you just tried to school me on with South Africa - trying to tell me that white and black peoples in South Africa are equally native? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick when an empire comes and colonises your nation and rules over you with threat of death - it’s not called a “unity of one people”  Also you’re raising my blood pressure now, so I’m done with this discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Okay, I don’t want to shift from one issue of frustration to another - especially where my people in Africa are concerned.  Black South Africans did not ask to he discovered, enslaved and racially profiled in their own fatherland.  Have you even been to South Africa?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon You said “apartheid happened ONE country against ITS OWN people “  In South Africa: it was not “ITS own people”  Foreigners came to South Africa, established political control and then racially disadvantaged the native population. Going as far as jailing them in their own nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Read your own text Patrick  https://t.co/DW65veaquI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m dead 😵   So Patrick you’re telling me that In South Africa, apartheid happened to “one people” of the same nation?  💯wrong! AFRICAN black people are native to South Africa, the white population is NOT.  Don’t gaslight my people please. That’s insulting and disappointing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick, in what ways was apartheid in South Africa ... and treatment of Palestinians in the Middle East different...  I’m now curious to understanding of the term “Apartheid” and what it means for populations affected by it...   Genuine question 🙋🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Good! At least we fundamentally agree on this.  🤷🏾‍♂️🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick if racism in all forms is “evil” - then it doesn’t “simplify” anything when we say that ALL forms of racism are terrible and must be rooted out.  I can’t believe you really want me to drag this. Saying antisemitism, antiblack antimuslim racism is WRONG doesn’t diminish AS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon 2/ so please spare me the “they’re roughly equivalent but not quite the same” malarkey - which translates to “but AS is more important” which results in other peoples being thrown to the side.  If you’re going to be antiracism, have the same energy EVERY day for all victims🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Also I don’t want to fall out over this   I’ll stick to my principles: ALL forms of racism are disgusting and need equal force in dealing with them: victims of racism suffer the same whether Jewish, black, Muslim etc. It doesn’t matter what the “ism” is: the pain is the same🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon That’s not how you come across this evening I’m afraid.  All I’m going to finish off with is: when you start stratifying and prioritising one form over another - you naturally end up with the EHRC!  So stop sounding like you’d be part of the problem.  That’s how I’m reading it🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I got it from what you’ve been explaining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon “It’s roughly equivalent... BUT is it the same” is what you said.  I didn’t invent words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon And you wonder why EHRC was blind to antiblack and antimuslim racism ?  From what you’re tweeting tonight, if you were in EHRC you’d have the same bias and probably also ignore everyone else: apparently because we’re not as unique<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m wrong to suggest that all racism is wrong and that all racism should be rooted out with equal force?  I see you 😎😎  You’ve made yourself clear in these series of tweets. Fine AS supersedes all other racism and discrimination!  Rest of us to the back of the queue.  Gracias😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon And with that you I’ll summarise that you seem to think that no other minorities face discrimination, racism and abuse!  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Well it is what it is.   Thanks for the clarification. With attitudes like this, I can see that I’ll be singing #BlackLivesMatter for a very long time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hmmm Patrick - last time i remember people accused JEREMY of being ENTIRELY responsible for EVERYTHING even things that HE was NOT in direct control of because he was the “Leader”   Why are you now wanting to absolve Keir of responsibility of the “process”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤣  Madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hmm i would challenge you on this: when you start stratifying and pigeonholing minorities you end up with the situation we have now where antisemitism is ranked #1 priority and everyone else must come second! That’s BS! All racism is WRONG period! Fight against racism EQUALLY‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon It wasn’t over exuberance - it was deliberate. The issue here is that people are constantly trying to give the benefit of the doubt when it’s unnecessary. I don’t think people help labour/Keir by being mute observers.  You’ll end up with another intransigent leader: as was JC🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Well sounds like you need to speak to starmer and his cheerleaders who are now ..... in “Leadership” ...   “FORENSIC NewLeadership” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Not even sure why people bother getting excited about “forensics” who can’t really even do a botched job of ensuring equality ❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Who said that?  what I wont do is take my eye off the ball: lives at stake  Peoples lives are being destroyed on daily basis: people are RIGHT to call out failure of the rest of the world to call a spade a spade.   Sorry but people are homeless when they previously had shelter🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Lol I think labour under starmer disagrees with you. as we exchange this evening, a labour member is being investigated for criticising Israel re: treatment of Palestinians.... so your own tweet has been contradicted by labour 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon If you haven’t been following the news - today labour is investigating someone for saying what the rest of the world is saying: that there’s an apartheid situation in that region of the world, if you don’t know what apartheid “really” means, I suggest a visit to SouthAfrica🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Well if so called “friend of Palestine” sits back and sip a glass of wine whilst Palestinians were being bulldozed - we have the right to call it out for what it is: INDIFFERENCE.  If someone bulldozed your family, makes you homeless, should we sit mute🤐🙅🏼‍♂️🛌   This is serious😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Patrick come off it   A meaningless “title” and waking the walk is very very different.  do you know what happened in Palestine the night of the American election?   Where was the “friend of Palestine”  Are you kidding me right now?  Do I need to post references of what happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Lool  So laughable... not so long ago your party used to abstain on all Tory bills ... why the hell are you blabbing now?  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani Hahaha 🤣   You went from “ahh Starmer sounded amazing talking about his dad” to “investigate oneself very very quickly @AaronBastani !  Sometimes it’s best to stick to instinct, we all know that starmer is a snake 🐍...   That’s all there is to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFielder1 @siennamarla Very good point 🤨🤨  There seems to be an operation purge anyone “we” (Keirites and Blairites)  don’t liken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyHammer61 @Paul_Yorks @susannareid100 @GMB @MattHancock @piersmorgan Thank you 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyPenny3 @susannareid100 @GMB @MattHancock @piersmorgan And I think you need to go find someone else to spar with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealgary58 @susannareid100 @GMB @MattHancock @piersmorgan How amusing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @MattHancock @piersmorgan @susannareid100 😳Oh what’s this? @GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 getting more out of the government in one interview than the other news channels have done over the last 6months  As a Dr there had been no clarity on parking, and our hospital was planning on INCREASING charges‼️⁉️ Thanks @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl The worst part of that period was seeing the DarrenGrimes et al jumping for joy as they realised that their version of society: inequality, greed, hate, gaslighting, bullying, racism, corruption, rule by dictatorship was going to be unleashed on the country!   That was hard😰🤮🤧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissPotkin Haha this is hilarious made me chuckle!!  The glee and excitement on the kids face is everything 🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RacistLabour @MerryMichaelW Hmm how about: will abstain on most bills that safeguard “foreigners” human rights .... and hmm 🤔 will ignore racism complaints (if they’re coming from black and Muslim people): Britain First!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Oh Almost forgot... Will be pro business, forensic etc 🤷🏾‍♂️  How about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@multiplebears Can we see the finished product at some point? And can you do before and after?  It’s also something I’m interested in❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curtisreah @davidschneider @curtisreah thanks for putting it very plainly for those who are deliberately trying to play the “what’s all the fuss about” games!  It was a deliberate and calculated story by the DailyMail. It won’t surprise me if tories and GuyFawkes all the rightwing vitriol were behind it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusLogicall It’s as though BLACK people achieving beyond deliberately set limits and traps really really winds up white Britain ...  Why else would non-white success trigger so much anger and rage?   It’s not just depressing, it’s EYE OPENING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wigapedia @lewis_goodall Exactly!  As you’ve pointed out there’s a running theme ... #MeghanMarkle and #MarcusRashford have something in common and it is not .... drum 🥁 roll....   Being “working class”....  Not liking the way @lewis_goodall is trying to gaslight here! Call it what it is: racism! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Correction: A BLACK man, who has single handled shamed a conservatives government ... Does well; and white Britain has a seizure about it.  Meanwhile white British Lords make racist comments and the same newspaper bats an eyelid 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  It’s nothing to do with “working class”❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Syriana_ Might as well extend that to DailyMail and significant parts of the UK population 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I mean it’s not like DailyMail reads and finds itself .... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARMilani_ Now let’s hazard a guess at which political wing will have tasked the daily Mail with this brief ....  Starts with a C ... ends with an S .... sometimes colloquially referred to as T...IES😏 The party that thinks poor people spend food vouchers in brothels and drug dens 🥳🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 @MarcusRashford They overlooked the fact that not everyone is not a gammon in this country.  They forgot that Trump lost last week and that racism and white supremacy is no longer the season’s trend.   Did you see the way tories have come out to claim @LewisHamilton ‘s win?... 🤨🤨  Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @thetwerkinggirl What really frustrates me about these fence sitting liberals’ solidarity for non-white minorities” is that they never seem to STOP🛑and genuinely “UNDERSTAND” where people are coming from in their commentary/criticism.   They only listen/care, if we speak against tories &amp;Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson @LewisHamilton Hahahaha   Who is us? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Boris, you’ll find that the “us” you’re referring to find @LewisHamilton to be “woke” because he cares about #BlackLivesMatter and #BreonnaTaylor etc ... so I think Lewis could do without fake congratulations from a racist like you and your party🤷🏾‍♂️👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Haha  Did a white woman just declare she’s no longer a fan of @thetwerkinggirl .... because Ava is telling her truth about Sir I care about racism expect when it’s targeted towards black people and Muslims - all of whom happen to NOT be white minority groups?  Julie, we’re good👋🏽  https://t.co/RtcrU7Rqpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meenalsworld The absolute vibe 🥳🥳🥳  (Ps happy Diwali 🪔)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ Have u only just clocked? There’s a hierarchy in races/minority groups. Muslims, BLACK, Roma etc come very much at the bottom of the list.   Where you ever previously in doubt about it?!  Secondly, until blacks/Muslims get real representation in media/politics, forget equality🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hasanpatel @monderram How weird ... ive just been on a run around the same route 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Lol   are you that gutted about the results that you have to go out of your way to tweet like this to take away from everyone else who’s celebrating?  Sad desperate times🤷🏾‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorbynistaTeen Congratulations to you @CorbynistaTeen 🥳👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal This is so delicious 😋!!! @PriyamvadaGopal have you considered getting this printed and frame it on a massive frame?  Put it this way: there’s nothing better than seeing a far right white organisation having to apologise for inciting hate on a decent lady of colour! This is 👏🏾🥳  https://t.co/ht82OWgmt5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy Exactly!  Can you imagine if in my profession, I was patronised by my white counterparts that “being a consultant is out of your capabilities, stand back and let white peoples progress to consultant level... because they’re white...”  I take issue with his comment 💯! ❌❌👉🏾 🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Exactly! The issue isn’t the colour of the officers - it’s the nature and systemic flaws within the organisation. To that effect therefore there are rubbish white/black/asian/ etc colour officers!   What needs to change is the systemic flaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @officialbarnesy Kudos to him - and I’m normally up for debates as you know. However that comment from Mr Fox is simply deliberately insulting! What is he trying to suggest that black people are forever incapable of running organisation as managers?   I’m afraid I find that deliberately insulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy @officialbarnesy why you bothering with these gaslighters who are insulting black peoples like this?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC Precisely!   The most obvious racism was completely ignored and the more obscure type was duly spotted - and kudos for that.   Once again begs the question- why is antiblack racism ignored when it’s so in our faces?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  My suggestion is that it’s deliberate/carelessness 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC 3/ how and why did they miss antiblack racism whilst readily recognising antisemitism? What is so dramatically different between the 2? What drove them to be acutely aware of one form of racism; yet simultaneously so ignorant of another relatable racism? Thats what I want to kno<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC 2/ but on another form of racism- a racism that is not new to the field - antiblack racism has been going on for centuries- perpetrated largely by Europeans, it’s therefore very surprising indeed that EHRC were unable to spot, recognise antiblack racism.   It begs questioning ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC I’ve only just got a free moment, it’s been. A crazy shift.  Anyway back to the #EHRC debate; ultimately the organisation has ONE purpose, that purpose is very plain, straightforward and clear.  They’ve shown that they can do their job properly: Exhibit A - AS  1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC Ill respond coherently in a bit. Just driving into work! On night shifts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC I beg to differ - but that’s just life, if you were black you wouldn’t be giving this lukewarm summary ... it’s easy to judge things that don’t affect your directly indeed very neutrally - hence the perpetual issue of racism in Europe and the west to be frank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC In conclusion vindicates the suspicion most of us have had:  BIAS and hierarchy in the way people in this nation view racism and inequality. Moreover cementing in my mind as a black person that my grievances WILL be IGNORED by people and organisations who otherwise protect others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @nadinebh_ I think we need to call it what it is really, and we move away from walking on eggshells on this topic:  Take parent with 2 children, both children tell parent “I’m being bullied at school” and the parent indeed shows great concern about child A, but neglects child B. It’s BIAS🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @miqdaad @EHRC And what conclusion do we hence draw about an organisation which only a few weeks ago showed itself to be steadfast in identifying issues of antisemitism &amp; giving essential recommendations to combat it. But simultaneously completely missed a very stark injustice: antiblack racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miqdaad @EHRC @PatrickWDixon curious to hear your comment on this... a publication which has stealthily gone largely unnoticed... that the EHRC - an organisation set up to spot, recognise and prevent discrimination seems to have a blindspot for... 🥁 roll please....ANTIBLACK racism🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ discuss  https://t.co/3XQUxG3x0k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @nadinebh_ I understand now, sorry about the excitement yesterday.   But I’m just frustrated at the way injustice seems to run in this country.  One group lobbies for its own interests, when those interests are protected: to tell with other victims of racism and injustice: it’s NOT right!🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlewishAnd @Sathnam Gotta love the way people are SUBJECTIVELY critical of governments:  Public with vested personal interests: critical critical critical 🤯🤬🤯🤬  Government: does something that favours THEIR religion/political ideology/ racial culture: 🥳❤️🤑  Subjective public: faith restored💃🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner More words on twitter....   What actions in parliament are you doing about it ... that’s all that matters ultimately.... surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianEPayne You’re being very naive and frankly focusing on a red herring. The communication department fundamentally doesn’t change the ideology and policies of the government and its party!  It merely changes how they verbalise their policies.   It doesn’t change the callousness/corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonClarkeMP @mattlodder Exhibit A: Britain burnt virtually all data and archives in eastAfrica when they have independence to protect itself and its monarch against shame!  The only people who photoshopped history is Britain and its elite in an attempt to paint a rosy picture! We will not allow the lies  https://t.co/1nNW33UsX6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonClarkeMP @mattlodder @SimonClarkeMP stop the nonsense! The history of Britain that is projected outwards is a history of winner writes it all: slave trade? Britain outs of statues of the masters not the victims! Colonialism? Britain burnt  archives DELIBERATELY to hide its atrocities!  TELL ALL TRUTH  https://t.co/j4uoSUtUq7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber No need to apologise. Nevertheless apology accept 💯!!  Moral of the story for all of us: We should learn to be understanding of others, especially those in different circumstances. Listen to others concerns and give credit to grievances. Be positive and have integrity🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ A confirmation of what many of us black peoples have known for decades   They (Britain and it’s institutions and middle classes) DO NOT CARE!  Antiblack racism doesn’t affect them in anyway Whatsoever. Makes you wonder what makes AS so different to the British society...? Race?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @nadinebh_ Well I’m sure you’d agree that an organisation that has a REMIT and responsibility to spot, recognise and address issues of racism across ALL minorities groups: not just Jewish community- who is so damned by this report of clear and blatant deliberate ignorance is to be shamed🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @nadinebh_ This summary means the #EHRC isnt fit for purpose and Must accept its culpability in deliberately letting a group of people down because it didn’t deem them high profile enough.  How would you feel if your parents treated your siblings much more favourably? That’s what’s happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @nadinebh_ What you’re saying therefore is: there was elements of favouritism/inequality.   If your organisation sole purpose of being is to investigate inequality and racism against minorities- how do you sit down and decide: Jewish issues- 10/10 effort... black peoples? Hmm fuck that🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Definitely. Nkurikije how #WhereIsRutembesa akora, Twitter was part of his daily routine. Hari igihe yigeze kurwara, ariko he was still posting, atubwira ko amerewe nabi. Rero mpamya ko: Niyo yaba ari muri hospital for indwara runaka -yari kuba yarapostinze!  Something is WRONG😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 Meanwhile .... the HumanRightsLwayer who is forensic.... abstained on a bill that gives spy cops more power... and protects them against prosecution.  Let that sink in.....  #NewLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist @ChantayyJayy Is that AdamWagner who is apparently kind to the world and is qualified in law? It appears he’s qualified in laws that benefit his and his cohort: religious and racial....anything beyond that: falls outside his professional and ethical remits! Black? Antiblack racism? Who cares❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Why should the taxpayer pay for MPs/Lords expenses .... i mean they’re wealthy enough to pay for their own lunches/coffees/hotels etc.?  Guess it’s time to end expenses for the rich then? And divert that man to ensuring all children continue to have free transport 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg @ShaunBaileyUK Nope 👎🏾   It’s a no from us! We’re not voting for your Trojan horse.  Thanks for the offer though 🙌🏽  https://t.co/kfi5q6tJUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews But when asked by journalists, #BorisJohnson was UNABLE to specify which antivax argument that any of the 670,000 went towards.... in others - they’ve made up an explanation for the money, and it still doesn’t square the circle!   In conclusion: CORRUPTION 😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman *** yes ***  Despite its sole purpose being to spot, recognise, reprimand and prevent racism and impact of racism on a given community.  Strangely they’ve shown themselves to be zealous in combating one type of racism: AS. But simultaneously they’re BLIND to antiblack racism😂❌  https://t.co/BiwraBtMH7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ 1/ One thing that has become starkly obvious over the last few years/several months is that: lack of REPRESENTATION is MAJOR problem for black people! Our Black MPs are to be seen but not heard (attacks Diane/Dawn get), we have NO-ONE in the MSM media to rep us!   Change needed🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl His explanation is lies  A couple of days ago @EmilyThornberry was asked by “The MEDIA” about the #JeremyCorbyn suspension - she rightly explained that she cannot comment due to “due process”   Being “asked on media” doesn’t give a free pass to political intervention!  Lies🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 This lady giving me #MackaDiamond vibes   Haha good vibes! You have to give Jamaicans a big up for staying true to their music - no matter what age!   🇯🇲💪🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JAACable A fair question can however be asked about HOW an organisation whose sole objective is to spot, recognise and help prevent discrimination and inequality seems able to function steadfastly where one type of racism is concerned and....seemingly be blind towards another racism?  WHY  https://t.co/9SzPY8G7AG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent you can count on those of us who are 1) affected by antiblack racism in the UK and 2) who care about rooting out “ALL” forms of racism to do the right thing and a) retweet and b) ask questions about how antiblack racism is readily ignored in the uk!   WHY WHY🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Yes but im confused ... if the EHRC can be so steadfast in recognition of racism towards a select community say ... Against Jewish community, and impress us all by getting it spot on, with appropriate recommendations. How did glorious #EHRC “miss” antiblack racism/discrimination?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarcusLogicall @paultinay How long do we have to tolerate racism? In the name of “tradition”🤔  As far as I’m concerned racism is “very bad” - racism is a conduit for harm, discrimination, hate and for some it can be fatal I can’t see how Britain shouts from rooftops about things like AS, but antiblack?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KmcgarryMcgarry @officialbarnesy Kevin - if you have an issue with my post - absolutely get lost!   King regards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Say it louder @officialbarnesy for the white people in the back of the room with their headphones on paying no attention whatsoever.  Black peoples have for far too long allowed nonBlack people to drive the narrative of antiblack racism!  If we don’t own the convo we get gaslit🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/cDR7gYfYnR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ Quite moving ... it’s mad to think that indeed entitled supremacists have it in their (twisted greedy minds) that LOCAL INDIGENOUS people cannot look after their own nations, this becomes particularly acute when the victim nation has MINERALS/OIL🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  The greed of the West 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusLogicall In other words: #Stormzy was right - Britain has a massive blindspot for racism - because they’d rather relive the empire - which was founded on looting &amp; supremacy.  It’s fine if that’s what people want, but when those who are victims of racism call it out: let’s not get upset😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusLogicall The British system of governance is showing symptoms of being out of touch with modern 🇬🇧, but those whose interests it advances use the “its tradition  and cannot be touched” - well this tradition is now showing its racist and bigoted, was #stormzy right about racism perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 The quayside used to be such a busy! Pitch and piano - was always heaving! I’m theres a Zizzis as well down there if I remember right - with a view of the railways bridges !   I do miss Newcastle 😟!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusLogicall So is Britain really saying that even if a Hitler emerged in the House of Lords - they wouldn’t remove him because “he’s a lord” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I think Britain needs to have a conversation with itself - also Ps we pay for this! We have money to pay for racist lords, but none for poor kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 What’s happened to the Quayside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusLogicall Wait ... people think that the reason he has resigned is because he’s .... 🥁 roll.... “WHITE”?

<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY Ps: Loved your interview with that American lady that was trying to take your around in circles of nonsense.

<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY You missed out canada - which I believe was one of his first calls....@adamboultonSKY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Well to be honest, if the media hadnt spent so many years shoe-shining the brogues of conservatives and right-wingers - perhaps we wouldnt be here.  When you allow a monster to grow and strengthen, never be surprised when at end, the monster crushes you and pushes you to the side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miqdaad #Maajid is that minority person, who after years and years of being sidelined, bullied, rejected by the cool kids, is finally accepted because the cool kids have something they want to exploit..

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews At least #GregClarke had the grace to APOLOGISE and follow it up with meaningful actions (FYI we dont pay taxes to keep him fed)...

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Regret even listening to the clip -For context I had to. Whichever [White person] thinks that that video is "SOOO IMPORTANT" really needs to get off the bus! It appears that they caught the wrong bus, this aint the DLR y'all were looking for. This is like the Eva latina comment🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsMutai @ckanimba @rutembessa @ItsMutai Asante sana kabisa! Thank you so much! Help us find this man. Lets make something very clear: If @rutembessa has been kidnapped or worse: his ONLY enemy that would want to harm him resides (or comes from) nowhere else but Rwanda. God may he be alive! Keep up updated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 Once you get to know labour - even superficially as I did on that day: it’s very clear to see where the likes of #KeirStarmer emerged from. The party has a pyramid structure: white middle class privately educated at top, as you go down you get everyone else fitting in pigeonhole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 I had the chance once to be invited by a friend of mine (white middle class) (I’m black) to go campaign for labour Dec2019: it was First time considering labour and first time ever campaigning.  As soon as we gathered: you could see the pyramid: white careerist at top, VERY ODD🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP @nationaltrust Ironically, it’s the British white population who “sanitised” and whitewashed history to fit their narrative. Do those tories want to tell the world about “Operstion legacy” in Africa?

<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @MatthewStadlen whilst full heartedly agree that there are good people throughout the world:  There are rhetorical questions that can be asked about “generosity/kindness of people” who after weighing up options are comfortable to elect: someone who’s a threat to another’s life🤔  https://t.co/iQUK4903B9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @KilclooneyJohn @LordSpeaker @UKHouseofLords @DUPleader   This @KilclooneyJohn was racist towards @SenKamalaHarris, there is now evidence emerging that this is not the first time he has expressed bigotry towards people of Indian heritage re: @LeoVaradkar  Why are UK institutions not firing him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaudiaWebbe Have you seen the way white people commenting are all like "oh that's not nice"   Sorry but, I am tired of people walking on egg shells around the concept of RACISM, and trying to reduce it to "gaffes/misspeaking/" etc  Also frankly, an apology is not enough. We pay him for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DUPleader Im sorry BUT, why are white people commenting on this refusing to call it: “RACISM”. @KilclooneyJohn was able to CORRECTLY name #Biden (white man) but deliberately failed to identify an AMERICAN woman of colour!   Failing to call it out for what it is: RACISM: is inadequate ❌🙅🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judicaelle_ @ramaisibo Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Hadn’t even seen the hair touch by Kate... god can you imagine the accusations of disrespect that would be hurled at Meghan if she was to so rudely adjust her physical appearance during a commemoration ??   Alas it’s Kate, the white princess - she can do absolutely no wrong🤷🏾‍♂️🙌🏽🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @TheTrashiesUK I can suddenly see and imagine what the racist greedy white supremacists who sat in Berlin dividing up Africa looked like... Pigs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster Thanks, On point 1) Britain needs to therefore decide if this institution @UKHouseofLords is viable in its current state  A LORD is racist, and theres nothing that can be done about it? If Hitler was a member, would they keep him a member because of silly convention? @LordSpeaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KilclooneyJohn @UKHouseofLords @LordSpeaker  I am afraid, permitting a racist to remain a member of your house shows that Britain is indeed NOT serious about racism and therefore your organisation is institutionally racist @KilclooneyJohn's apology further reinforces the racism:   End this now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster All i want to know today is: 1) Why has the House of Lord not fired this racist of a white man 2) Why has which ever party he represents NOT also reprimanded him 3) Why has the media not raised the volume yet?  This is exactly how in Britain racists get away with racism.  Silence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan On this one @piersmorgan is spot on At end of the day: UK needs to tell us what country it is: Ultimately is it a perpetually racist country, or is it trying to deal with its issues of racism. A "LORD" who gets paid by Taxpayers cannot be racist and we permit  @KilclooneyJohn❌🗑️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy A white BRITISH 'lord'  Dear white Britain, you do a lot of asking Muslims to condemn and denounce extremism, but apart from the odd "oh wow cant believe i've just seen this tweet" then back to normal.... What are white British people doing about their white supremacists in HoL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusLogicall @SholaMos1 @KamalaHarris Over stuffed pigs - that's what they look like. Vile creatures, full of white supremacy tendencies, and they let the mask slip.  2020 and Trump has been a learning curve.

<|startoftext|>@KaiseratCB @FurqanReisen Every day that goes by, I dislike PrinceWilliam more and more. He would have been aware of his little brother's request to be involved in the commemorations, and he would have been in position to argue on behalf of his brother. By the looks of things: William shunned Harry! Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanktoptiger2 @iamntyrell @EvaLongoria Exactly! Its just incorrect- what she alleged! I have nothing wrong with her biggin up her latina sisters who perhaps did vote for Biden, but she should have done that by keeping black women/people out of her mouth. She started a weird Latina vs black people which isnt healthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent What #KatyPerry shows in her tweet is that:  As a white woman, living in a country where white men run things, the presence of a white supremacist and the voting for him is a matter of “difference in opinion”. To nonWhite people; it was a matter of life/death/ChildCages etc❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FurqanReisen Yes but Kate is not black - and the British white population only have seizures when a white prince marries a black woman ... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neutralmilkscot Suspicion- I always struggling with this word... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman And indeed, the media has a blind spot for them.  The media and right wing go out of their way to attack genuine antiracists - whilst hosting neonazis dressed in suits!   This image sums up the UK right now: genuine racists embraced, genuine antiracists maligned and smeared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @BBC lol - no MLK was a black man who fought against white brutality against black people. Don’t tarnish his spirit by juxtaposition to Trump a racist!   Secondly: 100+ witnesses, poll watchers  etc. Until we’ve been made privy to those eye witness accounts: it’s still no evidence😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 The explanation doesnt really make sense @SholaMos1 . Ive just re-listened to what she said .... her sentence made zero (absolutely zero%) mention of Latino MEN, secondly Eva has a good grasp of the English language - how she confused herself mid speech, doesn’t make sense at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein When the liars, truth twisters 🌪 come to the fore, light always wins!  Don’t waste your breath and time on clearly twisted being: full of unfounded hate - probably a racist in real life.   @andrewfeinstein - solidarity to you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott @Jesse_Norman Frequently disagree with much Isabel says - but on this - she’s 💯 spot!  Shame question werent asked sooner though. Boris’ government has been misusing taxpayers money for a while now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamntyrell The most irritating thing is that in her desperation to salvage the face of Latino population who would rather vote for an antiblack racist (probs because they perceive themselves to be that bit closer to being white); she trampled over black peoples who worked damn hard 🧐👉🏾🗑❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamntyrell What is she on about ?? The maths doesn’t really stack up with her “heroines” argument! And frankly neither does what we saw ... I.e. Florida - high in Latino population: Trumo won, Georgia high in Black people- swung to Biden. @EvaLongoria - girl check your statistics before 📣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookedbusy For all its worth, I’d rather a royalfamily that speaks about injustices such as racism, instead of a demure hand waving but says nothing useful royalfamily lounging in palaces doing nothing uselful for society. Ps being patron of charities, wearing a military uniform is not work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookedbusy @FurqanReisen @RoyalFamily 2/ William has got to be THE ABSOLUTE worst big brother to have.  William sees the racists in this nation hunting #PrinceHarry at EVERY juncture of life: Harry marries: his child called a chimp - will? Says nothing! Harry attends memorial gets abuse. will? Meh 😒! Useless man👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookedbusy @FurqanReisen @RoyalFamily Interestingly is the fact that Piers and Britain royalists had ZERO issues with: Kate and William publishing their photographs of the event. No issue of Boris, Keir starmer, Priti Patel etc publishing their photographs -but GOD forbid #HarryandMeghan publish theirs: hell on Earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theousherwood Haha alright sir Keith 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂  The unity from USA that you want to emulate in the uk - is not happening any time soon,  you and your cheerleaders made that prospect of unity that much harder to achieve.   But yes, crack on with the empty platitudes 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @BBC Where’s the evidence though?!  Haha just because racist trump doesn’t like the result doesn’t mean every allegation is biblical fact.  Bring facts or be questioned to prove allegations, it’s as simple as that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @susannareid100 why is GMB even giving this story time? It’s clearly another Piers attempt to whip up hate towards Harry &amp; Meghan:  Here’s what we know: Britain’s white population is obsessed with negatively comparing H&amp;M to W&amp;K. If H hadn’t DailyMail would be criticising! STOP❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelharriot It’s incredible isn’t it... they hate the phrase “black power” - it apparently invokes imagery of violence, reparations, revenge etc...yet they aren’t threatened by the phrase “white supremacy” apparently we’re snowflakes for being offended by it!

<|startoftext|>@KimJohnsonMP You realise #vanjones worked with trump ... and throughout was all smiles?  Do you actually keep up with current affairs? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨🤨🤨  https://t.co/1rIaLrXUSl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @jreynoldsMP 😂 Patrick - policy advisor 🥳🥳🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I think in 2019- what  killed it was the internal fighting, the splinter groups (deliberate or otherwise) that really cost labour everything.  The manifesto was costed, but labour wanted to split down the "Second referendum" route and the AS route.  In the end: scrabbled eggs🥳🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon As I eluded to, over the last 5-10years, Tories have been the arbiter of the economic argument. They've planted their roots and spread their version of society: fend for yourself.  The population has swallowed this up, and the media leaves it unchallenged.  its mental!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon But you're right: they have lost the argument frequently - and what they need to do is find ways to say: Look we can afford to have public services whilst also having a good economy. We can balance the books and fund XYZ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I think the issue is: in the last 5-10years or so: we have had a British population that is geared more towards a conservative methodology where the economy is concerned. Also we have had a media that is Tory friendly: so ANY "left" economy argument is rubbished - hence they lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon But welcomes TonyBlair today and all those who shoeshine Tony's brogues. So in a lawyerish way: he's also a gaslighter. That aside: I think its an unfair judgement on the "left" that they dont talk about: economy, emergency services, crime reduction - they literally talk about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Time will tell. But I'd rather not have to vote for a newLeadership that is now more sympathetic with TonyBlair and all his deeds including Iraq war. That's not the type of values I hold dear, and therefore, if thats their version of 'centre right messaging' i dont want it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Agreed! At end of the day: one have to question this FPTP malarkey and how it fits with true democracy. Forcing ourselves to hold our noses and vote for people/parties we dont entirely agree with does not strike me as democratic. Its a weird pseudo-democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon He's definitely not united the party, his rhetoric, actions and attitudes actually suggest he's not particularly interested in uniting the party. He seems to believe that he will be able to woo enough tories, LibDems to completely relinquish the "left". That seems to be the aim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Perhaps now that NewLeadership is a lot more centre, it will draw more LibDem coordination - that would be the dream i guess? But I would rather we just advocated for a change from FPTP system, I dont want to be forced to hold my nose and vote for Keir or anyone else i dont trust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I cannot see that happening ANY time soon in the UK. Weirdly right-wings are better able to coalesce when push comes to shove (i.e. at elections). On the labour side of things - there are too many 'purists' Left and centrists alike.  Keir is proving to be very divisive also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @talkRADIO No one cares  Farage... go police Kent coast or something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Confession: I was never a labour voter, switched to labour in Autumn 2019 because I could see Boris was a monster (I’ve been vindicated in my fears). I started following you around autumn 2019. I also have 0% trust in Keir - especially as a black Brit. But we have to learn from🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OmarJimenez The ex president 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent What on earth is the media trying to achieve here? He is NOT "a complex and difficult figure"  He is a 100% a MURDERER! M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R  He killed #ReevaSteenkamp in cold blood, with no reasonable explanation.  Stop trying to whitewash his crime!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherirObscurite Hahaha music to my ears!  Shame this is not in front of the whitehouse though... he'd have an absence seizure on hearing this glorious sing along! Even better if it was sang from BlackLivesMatter Avenue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba Agreed mate.. what was the actual point of ToK? So ironic because it was supposed to impart "knowledge". In my school we had a philosophy old school teacher who LOVED it... it was weird AF!  But I have to say, IB did definitely created a more holistic me, more than ALevels would<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba God, the bloody IB... when the ToK curveball hit to ruin my life! ToK.... Extended Essay... 6 subjects, a mandatory language ....  It was a JOURNEY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Okay, just watched a youtube clip, I think i'll try this some time soon. I'll let you know how it turns out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan In conclusion: America spends more money on military, waging wars internationally etc.... compared to how much it spends on looking after its population: whether it be healthcare, education or indeed protecting their democracy.  Discovery of the 2020 - shock horror 🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂 #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo Yeah! - with money and investment flowing into the city’ - the authorities need to really work on a master plan ... otherwise in 10-20 years we will be trying to retrospectively rebuild roads, parks etc...   I have to say parks and public squares seems to be forgotten in Rw🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nealvinay Agreed!   Media cannot be purely “political “ all the time - not everyone wants to hear politics 24/7 365.... it has to be holistic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Home made ?🤨🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Hi 👋🏽 #Farage - how’s 🇺🇸? How’s the 10,000 bet?  How’s the presidency going?  And ps - how’s the Kent coast? Any new dinghies ⛵️ arrived yet?   😂😂😂 Good day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asheck @Martin_Abrams Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams What is a ironic and a lesson which centrists don’t seem to want to learn is that - centrists would not win if the left didn’t vote!   Biden flipped Georgia especially because BAME people got out to vote against a fascist racist who instructs white people to go black hunting🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyJayne101 Spot on! They’re from the same mould and indeed same creator created them both and their party’s ideology of xenophobia, racism, greed and corruption. Only difference is in UK, the elites here are able to gaslight with POSH voices.   Britain needs to reflect on their complicity🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl I see how now the PALESTINIAN population is reduced to Enemies of the “west” “bad people”  I take issue with this. One minute a certain section of society preaches about learning to differentiate between good and bad in Israel, but ALL Palestinians are “enemies” &amp; “bad people”❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor So why does Britain and indeed USA find it in their place to comment on .... African elections... Middle Eastern non israel elections... South American nations elections.   What is so different about 🇺🇸 that precludes them from being bombed/criticised - like rest of the world?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyTheManc Where abortion is concerned... where Supreme Court is concerned ...religious liberty is concerned .... where Israel is concerned ...  Can someone explain why israel is part of the picture? Why perhaps other countries aren’t to be concerned? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Has trump lost yet? 🙌🏽🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danbloom1 What 2020 &amp; Trump has unveiled for those who were deliberately or otherwise ignorant is that:  The WEST has rules that it enforces on EVERYONE **except** other white nations and themselves.  If this was Sudan/Somalia/Rwanda/Pakistan/Bolivia UK would be SHOUTING.  This is RACISM🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbydphillip @CNN @jaketapper @DanaBashCNN Hi @abbydphillip - from the UK here.  We've been desperately waiting for a definitive result. How much longer for states such as Georgia to announce?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani Lol... Aaron, the NewLeadership is no different from the current leadership.  Many BAME people come from nations that were affected by wars often endorsed by countries like UK. The bill to give amnesty to British Soldiers for crimes abroad is an affront to many BAME. We're OUT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemyBaho Haha why do simple black people fall for simple things? Biden yafashwe (Campaign) picture avugisha umwana wumwirabura....

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Mike_Fabricant Haha yeah not sure why you chose Nigeria - incidentally a FOXNews die hard pro Trump the racist also drew on Nigeria Africa to invoke “corruption” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - so Hmm yeah, not great.   Africa learnt corruption from the west to be honest. I’m not sure why Africa gets the blame🤨🤨🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Mike_Fabricant The take home message is actually: Fabricant has friends who are disappointed that a modern day fascist who encourages racists to get armed and go out killing hasn’t been voted for... he has friends who vote for racists!

<|startoftext|>@walegates I really hope africans bothered to tune into🇺🇸politics and ideology in the past few years.

<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 Nope!  Trump relies on lies lies lies on steroids!

<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 And PS - next time they desperate: they need to leave #AngelsFromAfrica out of it!

<|startoftext|>@Darius363 There’s one thing that is clear .... from what I saw from @MSNBC - journalists across the western world need to start CHECKING bullshitters -  These people that come out with outlandish remarks need to be asked “where are your receipts! What is the evidence”   If no proof: 🤐 🤫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking Can I hazard a guess all the way from UK ...  Arizona - has more white peoples than Georgia and Pennsylvania - trump reckons white peoples may come out for him in Arizona - but in Georgia and Pennsylvania - he cant he bothered with the black voters - they might vote against him?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nataliemorales These PoC ministers are the worst you’ll ever meet! It’s as though they’ve robots that can be programmed by the white population who truly hold the power! So currently an Indian woman is home office closing borders to immigrants (she’s daughter of immigrants)!   It’s painful ❌🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nataliemorales Interestingly in UK, politicians (especially right wing conservatives) have picked up on this “ambitiousness” and desire to “whitenise”: they welcome a few PoC into their parties, give them roles that involve keeping minorities down! Our home office, minister of equality are PoC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nataliemorales @nataliemorales very very insightful! We have the same here in the UK with PoC - when they finally master English, lose the accents, send kids to prestigious schools (white dominated); they gradually dissociate from the “fresh off the boat” cohort. They shun and reject themselves<|endoftext|>

I’m all game for supporting labour under NewLeadership - but can’t be a blind passenger on this ship! It’s not how to make labour better❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Welcome to NewLeadership rhetoric, attitudes and methodology.  And people were really oblivious to why the likes of TonyBlair, Adonis etc are having the time of their lives now that apparently labour has been “recaptured”  Suddenly with this rhetoric one can see why iraq happened<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar That’s how my symptoms started - followed by chest pain (really bad stabbing chest pain). Followed by fatigue. Tickly couch.  Then loss of smell and taste ... the loss of smell taste lasted longest along with very sensitive lungs - i couldn’t take deep breaths for 4weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie I was driving to work - covering ED this evening, so missed the loop for a bit - but one thing is clear and we should take it as solace: @edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon we’re all decent and agree that all racism and in particular AS has no place in society. Thats the main point🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie I totally understand what you’re saying (it annoys me too). but I feel like thats almost wanting to bury our heads in the sand about what is manifesting itself in western world: the politics of 1930s Europe are returning🤢: white people with power doing harm to those they dislike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie I think on the contrary we need to call it what it is to prevent their version of politics from ever dominating the world again  Trump and “ProudBoys”’are practicing “politics” in what they do: they take prejudice against “the other” and use POWER(politics) to cause harm/ death❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Well that depends on how you want to define “political opinion”. The Nazis were a “political” movement and they were indeed racist! We can’t suddenly extract the concept of “politics” the Nazis.  Nor does accepting that they were political mean that legitimise their views surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Not seeing it for what it is is ignorant. Ultimately you need to engage with people who are regular victims of racism and the associated discrimination that comes with it to fully understand the link racism has to politics and power.   If you’re powerless you can’t harm me🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie That’s a very simplistic way of looking at it I’m afraid.  You and I may be different and we may dislike each other: but neither of us have the power to kill/disadvantage the other. RACISM is when one of us gets the POWER to enact policies that can harm. Racism&amp;politics=🤝simples<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Racism is a unique form of prejudice and discrimination. Everyone can be prejudice against another race/group. But racism has the added layer of “power”. Racism is prejudice juxtaposed to authority to implement policies that discriminate against a race. Racism is tied to politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie One can not argue that all forms of racism are equally abominable and then follow their sentence with a bit/however. The but/however immediately negates the preceding argument. This is exactly what I’ve argued about Keir and his contrasting response to antiblack racism🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Is one race superior to another? Is one suffering superior to another?  There’s a lot of “But ... this is different” arguments and I’m not sure people realise that in doing so, they’re suggesting there’s an inequality in races around the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie No life is superior to another! As indeed (unless you believe otherwise) no race is superior to another. The holocaust was an abomination to man kind: and lessons SHOULD have been learnt. But in 2020 white people are electing presidents who fan flames of racism🤔. Give me a break<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Yes I accept your point - but millions of Iraqis died through no fault of their own because a British white man and his mate in America sat in a room drinking whisky and thought “wouldn’t it be great if we just bombed the shit out of iraq?.... mwahaha indeed sport replied Blair🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie The chilcot inquiry showed that there was No imminent threat and indeed no evidence of weapons of mass destruction- what is a fact is that MILLIONS of Iraqis have suffered the consequences of TonyBlair &amp; Bush wanting to erase Saddam for the banter! We don’t need a court for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie 3/ Boris is a known racist - he’s published materials - there’s absolutely no doubt or two ways about it - do we suggest that antiBAME racism is unique in that its to be ignored and approved?  Why therefore is Boris not dragged by British society at large? What’s unique about AS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie 2/ on the suggestion that Patrick makes- we should expect Keir to readily condemn TonyBlair for killing millions of Iraqis UNLAWFULLY. We should expect every Tory MP to reprimand Boris every time they speak etc. But herein lies the issue: only JC is to be held to this STN -why?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie 1/ I think in fairness to @PatrickWDixon I understand the earnest point he’s trying to make: Jeremy should call out those he knows to be wrong/AS - that is a fair expectation to have.   However one asks why JC and his supporters are expected to be held to different standard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie You &amp; I have the privilege by virtue of our passport of never having to experience what the Palestinians are experiencing on a day to day basis.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Lol “tories” give me a break.Tories are busy voting for bills to prevent victims of military torture from bringing prosecution...

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie TBH what happened is that labour was unable to better articulate its criticism of Israel: obviously I’m referring to annexation, uprooting of Palestinians. This is indeed the prickly and thorny issue where if you speak: you’ve gotta to speak carefully or else you fall into AS🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Very interesting point -who are the socialists (never mind labels even) Who are these spotless clean politicians and what (tangible action) have they done to fight injustices across the world.   If their only action has been: claiming their MPs expenses, abstaining: NO thanks❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie I read the statement: it was worded fine until you got to the “however the media, political opponents in and outside labour etc etc” -that is the part of the statement that has everyone drawing conclusions about the entire statement.  The only thing I would say is: wrong timing🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie I hasten to add: I’m not here defending Jeremy, antisemitism was evidently present in the Labour Party and NOT enough was done to recognise the shameful reality and indeed deal with the problem: thats something JC’s labour will have to accept and deal with.🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤢❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie It read how every individual wanted it to be read: those who hate Jeremy interpreted it in their own twisted way.  That’s the moral of the story really. Which is also the moral of the whole saga - everyone making their own conclusions via prism of their biases - it’s shameful❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Thank you: I think in a roundabout way this final conclusion actually lends credit to JCs statement which was: 1) he accepts the findings of EHRC 2) 1 antisemetic is 1 too many 3) EHRC recommendations need to be implemented ... and finally the crisis was sadly manipulated 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 Why does social media make a difference in whether u stand by your principles/conviction?  This is relatable to the Bill to kill abroad that labour decided to abstain on- either you believe in justice and human rights and you vote against it: or you’re a sheep coz Keir said so🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Right - okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie FYI- the week the UK rabbi sent out letter to the UK population telling us to reject JeremyCorbyn - he travelled to the USA and told the American population and Jewish community to also reject BernieSanders for allegedly the same crimes - can someone show me Bernies antisemitism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Bernie sanders is antisemetic is he? Where’s the receipts? 😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 Ironically MargaretThatcher once said it best- I remember a speech she once did (Im ex Tory) i cant quote her properly: but in paraphrase form: she said something along the lines of “leadership is about CONVICTION- NOT following the crowd. You have to bring people to YOUR belief”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 @People4Bernie Alas it was antiblack racism they were fighting against ... perhaps that’s why they got arrested and indeed why white people don’t give them the credit they deserve for being steadfast fighters against racism. 🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂  Be antiracism, but forget blacks! Is the mantra in motion🇺🇸🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @PatrickWDixon @BenJolly9 This is entirely true - look what was done to @People4Bernie ? The media and far right went as far as calling Bernie who is himself Jewish - antisemetic!   Another interesting parallel: Bernie and Jeremy are the only modern day politicians who got arrested fighting against racism  https://t.co/177jvJnsTQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 Surely then they simply lack integrity and a backbone. The issue I’ve noted in this country is that people/politicians aren’t able to break the mould and stand on their own feet. There’s a tendency to want to be part of a choir.  This is why you end up with “yes” men/women🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @BenJolly9 Why can’t those those disagree with corbyn and still associate themselves with socialism- simply not disagree with jeremyCorbyn but also not feel forced to defend NewAbstentionistLeadership? The 2 are not mutually inclusive 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!  JC is no longer leader, but Keir is no knight❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muntazer_zaidi It was probably the phrase “the Jewish bible” that made him very quickly reassess 🤷🏾‍♂️ If they kept saying “Islamic Quran, any random book, a rock etc..” he would have kept insisting that anyone who doesn’t swear on Christian bible is evil/wrong’un.  Utterly maddening! 🇺🇸👉🏾❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Exactly! Haha! Deluded in their last minute desperation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal I’m just concerned that she’s invoking “AFRICA”  Why can’t she call angels from: London/Paris/Berlin/Zurich/Brussels/Belarus/Warsaw/Amsterdam/Sydney/Toronto/TelAviv/Moscow/Bucharest etc.  They have in History taken african angels: it was in chains, on ships for torture &amp;abuse❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheReal_JesusC But .... one of the evils really and truly is evil! It’s hell on Earth on intravenous steroids! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latifnasser @Louise243 @latifnasser thank you for this - very educational and insightful 💪🏽💪🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sparkyTG @MotherFreds @Femi_Sorry Haha “I’m absolutely gutted and sorry if this is the case” they said - classically the mask drops far sooner than they’d hoped!  https://t.co/SnTjW0uOb7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @Nadine_Writes @Femi_Sorry you must stop hitting the nail - I’m finding myself agreeing with you far too frequently in the last few days!   You’ve totally nailed the argument, and that’s why British people are having seizures and tantrums! Brits love keeping you appearances! They’re fake AS❌🗑  https://t.co/LlZFlfP7xN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sparkyTG @MotherFreds @Femi_Sorry Its not just 1 user, many of us who aren’t white think you’re being disingenuous! Antiblack racism is very much an every day occurrence in this country and white people (not all) engage in it without consequence or regret. Racism in UK is subtle and visceral. Stop gaslighting❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FINALLEVEL Can someone please tell this white woman to leave AFRICA the hell ALONE!  White people have previously in history taken African angels - they took them in chains &amp; ships and enslaved them, killed them, raped them, dehumanised them, used them to build their nations etc!Never again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightWingWatch Can this witch 🧙‍♀️ leave Africa out of her mouth please!  Let Trumps angels come from London/ Paris/ Berlin/Sydney/Hungary/Amsterdam/Zurich/Toronto/Cardiff/Brussels/Krakow etc - but not Africa! Africa and black people have nothing to do with the racist orange monster in DC! 👋🏽❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyvclark20 You call them RACIST!   There are really no two ways about it❌  Its a bit like: if Germany got a second chance to vote on the Nazis (in knowledge of what they stand for and will eventually do to minority groups) and Germans be like “hmm we choose Nazi” -what would you call that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyndiKov It’s crazy!  You would almost assume Americans live in a weird planet where intellect and knowledge is a crime,  It’s honestly reminding me of “The Crucible”... everyone just screaming and howling FakeNews and lies ... America you can do so much better! Quit this madness🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgabrielleu I remember when I was in school (UK) - in English literature we read a book/play called “The Crucible” about the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts...I remember thinking “hmm thank god this is fictional/drama” It’s 2020 and I see American white people behaving like Salem sheep❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ But wants a 'recount' in places he thinks he can win...  He is happy with COUNTING as long as HE is projected to WIN.. But God forbid if it looks like Biden might win.  Total trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyy135 @VanJones68 @nowthisnews @VanJones68  you said it better than most:  Ultimately in the USA, this election boiled down to: Do you reject white supremacy, racism, corruption etc - nearly 50% of the American population said NO, [we accept and endorse racism etc]- that must stab into the heart of PoC in USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyLucasBhana @jrc1921 Why are you dragging black people into your drama?  Black people are categorically discriminated in this country in various sectors of society: judiciary and employment in particular, equalising the privilege is important! So yeah black lives matter!  Find something else to drag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @BenKentish When a beaten man is desperate he starts punching and firing at random- this is #Trump last option - to fire in every direction!  It’s like a rabied dog biting at everything and anything within reach!   I hope🤞🏾@JoeBiden wins, the world needs a break from Trump and his racism❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist Has trump won? Please say NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen In Jesus name 🙏🏽!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 How’s his 10,000 bet going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider In the name of Jesus, May it happen!   @JoeBiden we’re officially holding our breath and praying!   Chase this racist tax avoiding criminal #Trump out of White House!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPugh Exactly  White people voting for someone they KNOW fully well has instigated hate towards minorities - they vote for him knowing that there are minorities who will fall victim to his armed army of hyenas!  Its no different to Germans voting Nazi in 1930s-40s: in full knowledge🧐  https://t.co/Ckfn8el4ff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstyStricklan UK reporting on this election is totally rubbish. Apparently Virginia has reported for Biden, but Sky still chatting nonsense and havent updated their board.   UK is trying to report this election as though its a UK election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hxmzaliy In Jesus name. Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilliamsme Can someone tell British channels @SkyNews : you're slow and reporting it as though this is UK elections - its not working. Sky still has not clocked Virginia has reported for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ do you think florida will announce in next 1hr? Need to sleep, but i want to know how Florida goes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams He didnt mean it.... it was a trick to get past the line ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ I want to really understand the 12% of black people who vote for a man that tells a KKK type of racist organisation to "stand back and standby"   Thanks to Trump, a racist ANYWHERE in the USA feels more empowered to get in their car, grab a gun, and mow down any black person!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realJavedBashir The whole party probably is... And probs half of Keir's cheerleaders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius363 For real!  Its mega irritating seeing these charlatans now chatting s**t about how much they care about a 'better world'  https://t.co/FO1ct4PtCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goddess1345 @viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry Indeed!   I would add that she strikes me as the type of middle England person who most likely doesn’t even recognise Boris’ racism!   Which brings me to the point that for many people in the western world; they only see racism when it affects them or close associates. Terrible❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rwandapolice @gat_steeve FYI legally cameras need to be visible to the public! Hiding is not the answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan That's an endorsement to trump then. Thanks for reminding us what you stand for @piersmorgan: A man who instructs racists to "Stand back and stand by"  Grim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire "Im sick of us pissing on our own achievements"- A genocide in Iraq is not whitewashed by "Oh but look at the icing on the cake that focuses entirely within the borders of the UK"  I would rather Iraqis were ALIVE, and we also had breast cancer screening.  A racist summary indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider God - what a class of people that Britain has handed the privilege of leadership, example setting, and ultimately power to govern our lives. And we not only gave them the privilege - we are also paying taxes to have them speak to us like this!  Utter contempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @KayBurley @henweb Haha When receipts come calling with picture evidence!  @Femi_Sorry drag em mate!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @MargaretFerrier Lol - And daily reminder: DomCummings is still sliding contracts to his mates, despite lying to the population and putting the population at risk with regards to Covid19  @MargaretFerrier you did do wrong, I have to say!  https://t.co/lIhFFyb6vL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Who stopped you mentioning it? Who stopped you mentioning Roman history?  Crack on with it mate, no-one has stopped you! Go add an exhibition to the Imperial Museum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Code_Tap @smsjgdja @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx This guy trying to tell me that apparently Colston statue in Bristol is comprehensively representative of history. And that apparently its our fault that we cant see that Colston &amp; other slave masters, looters of the distant world etc are indeed fully embracing of multiculturism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Loool  The statue needs to tell the truth period - otherwise its called photoshopping history! Sorry to break it to you!  https://t.co/Gazcrohhhd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @thomasmul @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx @Femi_Sorry did NOT say BBC staff should NOT be able to wear the POPPY! He called into question why BBC staff are prevented from showing similar representation with other issues that continue to plague this country: such as unrelenting racism, discrimination towards LGBT etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx "But will never get mentioned will it?"  Who stopped you mentioning it ?  https://t.co/Dq9iFSCMli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Correction- the statue ONLY portrayed that he was 'virtuous' &amp; kind. No mention whatsoever where the money donated to Bristol came from.  My point is plain: This is not a multi-cultural history. As a matter of fact when theres effort to have BHM, Viking Brits get seizures. Racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walegates Can I gatecrash this party for the bottle on the left please!!  In God's name we pray, it will be a wine night! Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Lol.... Statues of slave masters: once again Brits who can trace genes back to Vikings were in uproar- whilst Black people were involved in that history, black people were being killed and enslaved and used as though they were donkeys, Britain was making money and building cities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry They care about their own interests. - The end really.  I don't even think they pretend to care anymore. Lol... it's as simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Meanwhile a neo-nazi white teenager - has been spared jail  despite evidence of his hatred and racism towards people who aren't white ...  And 'some'(admittedly not all) white people are here boasting: UK is least racist country and there is no racism etc etc.  Absolute tosh!❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Lee Rigby's killers are not walking across London.  Not sure who your target audience is with this bullshit, but its not washing. Find another echo chamber to wail into<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx I happen to live in the UK - so I will talk about issues in the UK that affect MY daily living, and people of similar backgrounds/race/disadvantage.  I called out Lee Rigby's killers when the incident happened.   POINT IS: despite the wars: RACISM is alive and kicking in UK👉🗑️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry It was the same observation I made few months ago after the 72hr boycott against Wiley and his AS rant. They all returned 72hrs later, then in Bristol a black man was run over by a white racist: No solidarity, no comment, no boycott. Back to their blissful daily routine: 🍷🍾🎉🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry You &amp; me both bro! People like Kay, deliberately or otherwise, are the reason why western nations end up with people like Trump, Boris's conservatives, ViktorOrban etc. They see society through the prism of their own interests, &amp; interests of those SIMILAR to them; others?👉🗑️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaches_melba @feeldalove168 @Nclarke30 @Femi_Sorry @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews Lol, Care to evidence where anyone said it was not remembrance?  ? Peaches Melba?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry There is indeed institutionalised racism in UK, Kay showing us all that its not just isolated to political parties but the population at large. She deliberately chose to ignore the bigger point Femi was highlighting: PARITY in representation. They literally don't care for us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @KayBurley @Femi_Sorry She knows exactly what @Femi_Sorry was saying, but when there's bandwagon to jump on; what do u expect the UK population who allege to trace their roots to vikings to do? Whip up a frenzy about much ado about nothing. Moreover therein she confirms where she stnds on social issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsjgdja @Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Lol - yet despite the win against Hitler's racism - racism is alive and kicking in the UK- FYI #StephenLawrence did not die in London secondary to a suicide. He was killed by white racists, the white police officers destroyed and covered up evidence to whitewash the investigation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 Hahaha 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ Mate I don’t know how you find the receipts, but I always take time to read your tweets and they never disappoint!  https://t.co/bPYOIlYNOg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LewisHamilton Big up @LewisHamilton   Lewis, if you’re keen when you’re next in London - drink on me (obviously when Covid has settled and we’re allowed)!  I’ve immense respect and admiration for all that you do and continue to do with regards to empowering black people! #LewisHamilton ✊🏽✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonAshworth @DrRosena Its what u get when you spend your whole political chances of 2020 on abstaining on every tory policy idea! The monster you appease eventually gets used to getting their own wa - once they’re done: they wash the floor with you!  Behold the Frankenstein emboldened by NewLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Black people would be just fine if white people stayed within their borders actually.  But no... white Europe needed a well you drink from, they needed minerals to steal, they needed black people to enslave to do their labour for them, they needed petrol!  Shut up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Let me guess ... this neonazi is not .... black/Muslim/asian🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Haha 😂   And white people love to tell us we’ve got a chip on our shoulders when we take notice of actions done by white peoples in favour of white criminals, and what white peoples do against nonwhite criminals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flashella10 @thetwerkinggirl Amen to this prayer 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flashella10 @thetwerkinggirl Absolutely!  it’s infuriating how many people who are not direct victims of his hatred give him a pass “oh he’s great with the economy”- yes so was Hitler/Mussolini for those who directly benefited! So many white people enabling this modern day fascist because they’re not victims<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Why do they never roll these things out in their leafy postcodes? How about starting with Somerset? Oxfordshire? Cheltenham? Cambridgeshire? Westminster?  I’m sure the rich need to ensure they’re safe from the virus!  Why the sudden kindness to the poor?  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyMercerUK ** correction** Labour will abstain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @EssexPR Indeed it’s a massive “throw hands in air due to being overwhelmed and asking “what do we do now” Financially speaking it’s going to cost a hella alot of💰. However another fact we have to deal with is that asymptomatic young people are spreading the virus. Frank debates needed🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl And they most likely make jokes about the person of colour when he is around or even absent.  I’ve got close white circles and I’ve witnessed this behaviour. The classic “I’m sure Fred wouldn’t mind me saying (Insert something racist/borderline).  BAME sheep need to wake up!🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I agree with this conclusion: there’s most likely no need to test asymptomatic patients from a public finances point of view.  With that said: it doesn’t remove the fact that many younger people are asymptomatic but infectious and are indeed super spreaders.  Its tough this virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR So your conclusion is? Don’t test? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Lol 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl If 1930s had twitter - Trump is definitely the Nazi of 2020. Whips up racial tensions, is directly racist himself. And he portrays himself as “not political elite” that’s what he’s solid to his brainless racist sheep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattymonkey @feeldalove168 @Nclarke30 @Femi_Sorry @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews I’m not on twitter seeking for your awards - I’m afraid.  Feel free to refund your award 🥇   👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Healer1official Emphasis on “IF” it was a “normal” country 🤷🏾‍♂️😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @Nclarke30 @Femi_Sorry @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews The biggest irony is that @Femi_Sorry wasn’t even calling for the poppy not to be worn: he was purely asking why is it okay for BBC to engage in some political campaigns such as wars and remembrance thereof: but not other issues such as racism, discrimination that plagues UK😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spoonhead123 @fennell962 @piersmorgan “Went to Eton” needs to revert back to what it always meant: selfish, probably only thinks of self, out of touch with the realities that plague the least well off people in the country. Never had to go by with toast for supper due to poverty.  Entitled from birth to adulthood🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alidogan_uk @LabourList It is indeed ironic that the exact issue levelled against #JeremyCorbyn “INTERFERENCE” into procedural matters, is the exact issue causing problems today... but this time round: the interference is approved by media, tories, Jeremys opponents. The hypocrisy is very revealing 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HumanistReport The way these racists drag Christianity into their evil makes me want to hand a resignation notice to my Christian faith  @TuckerCarlson literally said “AMEN” to mob rule? Trump represents racism, hatred, greed- every damn thing Jesus taught against, he has audacity to say amen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DayoNtwari @Baker_Reports Correct @DayoNtwari ! It is never permissible for medical records to be released to this detailed extent without the patients permission! Prisoner or no prisoner- Doctors have a duty of confidentiality unless a patient recklessly poses an immediate threat to gen public! This is❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @TomSwarbrick1 @LBC God -he really annoys me- he chats and projects himself as this “analytical and forensic” character. Uses his relatively young age (compared to the other white supremacist on LBC: Ferrari &amp;Dale) to come across as though he’s very decent. BUT push comes to shove: Tories&amp;Trump❤️🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyTheManc Nazi 1930s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Yes, and black people have lost count how many Black people were killed by white people through slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, civil rights movements etc. Its a shame Britain burnt evidence in  #OperationLegacy   Enjoy your terraced house and your poppy. Goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Haha, how hilarious🤣 race relations are set back by people who engage in racism. FYI- #StephenLawrence did not commit suicide - he was killed by white racists. The Eltham police involved in the case destroyed evidence to protect the white racists.  Black ppl do not need ur house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Right... Black lives being equal to white lives - is 'pure hatred'  That's a new one. What else have you got up your sleeves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili A "secure Israel".... and "Viable" palestine?  What a baffling sentence. viable, but not secure Palestine?   Lol okay then... how nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Lool  What are we hateful and resentful of?  https://t.co/1W9mHdbfFg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx I hasten to add, no-one (absolutely no-one) has said they're not proud of the 'stolen lives' Racism is act of hate perpetrated by horrible people with power, against people of different races - resulting in abuse/discrimination. It is not the victims fault that there is racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @LadyTruth20 @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Apparently despite being patriots &amp;very proud to be British, they struggle to write and articulate themselves in their 'native' language. Huge shame that direct descendants of the Vikings etc cannot excel in the native language. For some of us, English is 5th language, but we try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx I'll stay happy in my knowledge of what it's like to be non-white in England!  I live my life and i know what struggles I go through - you dont know my life or Femis. Meanwhile you can also live your own reality. Every man (&amp;woman) for themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Hahaha 😂   “In 2020 there’s equality” she said👍🏼👍🏼  Haha alright! That was hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyTruth20 @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx @Femi_Sorry  did not stop anyone wearing a poppy. So please refrain with the hyperbole. Femi asked a reasonable question. Precisely the heroes died for a better world of equality: yet in 2020 we dont have that equality. A lot of the poppy police engage in racism as shown tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx 👊🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Indeed playground stuff🤷🏾‍♂️  Anyway bro: wishing you a good evening. Let’s play and hope the Hitler to black people in USA loses the election tomorrow.  Ironically 99.9% of those jumping on Femi are people who support trump! A man who resembles everything the soldiers died fighting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Code_Tap @PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx They all come out barking when things they’re passionate about (white history) is commented on (in a non glorifying way)... but the same characters will be sipping 🍷&amp;🍾when white racists belittle apartheid/slave trade/ colonialism! Apparently we have a chip on our shoulders🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Yep - I suspect Femi set out to make a good point: which was basically why does BBC censor its staff - and inadvertently create a weird bias: where bbc dictates what causes staff can be supportive of: which is not acceptable. BBC is not a private enterprise neither! 🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx Im going to guess that all the exchange is about this tweet @Femi_Sorry?  Given it comes across crass/ belittling of the great wars: but my interpretation of this tweet is: Femi was asking bbc why one type of campaign is permissible and others banned?

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx I’m trying to genuinely find the root of the exchanges: because it’s getting very extreme - is this to do with the poppy ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx I’ve seen him being threatened with deportation, death, abuse, etc etc etc.  Is this because he commented on “virtue signalling” ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bella___Trixxx @Femi_Sorry I asked @Femi_Sorry a question.  Don’t get it twisted   Care to clarify who Femi attacked please?   Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @Bella___Trixxx What’s going on? Why is there a tirade or attacks?!  Just finished work, and I’m walking to the car only seeing attack after attack ...  @Femi_Sorry kilonshele mate?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Have you upset Native Britain? Those with roots as far as the vikings 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatHeywood @Peston If the prince can get infected and casually choose to lie about it, not report himself to the app - why do they think the public will be forthcoming?  The elites in this country have thus far shown the public that following rules is for the birds! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe Get your refund !! They will definitely try some trick with your food! 🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl @PeoplesMomentum So the suggestion that there was media and political opponent manipulation and exaggeration of the situation - was a correct statement.  Do you need to be kicked out of the Labour Party for essentially echoing what was said by a certain somebody?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I don’t see how this differs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ People who think there is no difference are in absolute denial. Also They need to understand that us saying “Biden is a better choice than trump” doesn’t mean we love Biden! They’re both shit, but trump is a modern day Hitler to some communities! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!   There’s a difference 🙅🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imnotwealthy @helen_wrigley @KayBurley @AndyBurnhamGM The problem is that in the uk the balance is massively skewed towards profits for private companies! And there’s minimal subsidies from gov.  At some point, we as a nation have to decide how best to serve the population at large and at what cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imnotwealthy @helen_wrigley @KayBurley @AndyBurnhamGM Very fair point, and I agree with you, however UK is not the only country in Europe with rural communities. My grandparents live in Europe - in a rural place, their transport is MUCH than British costs! Not just the transport, every utility. So why does UK operate so differently?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @f_mols Absolutely! Spot on. All those protein shakes and steroids do nothing good for internal organs. They may give external results - but they do absolutely no good internally. I suspect this young man had ego higher than Eiffel Tower, obsession with men like trump: in end it took him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @spencermorgan93 Crikey @MichaelRosenYes this disease really hit your hard! Pleased to see you doing tremendously better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @AndyBurnhamGM Well well well .... so privatisation is suddenly acceptable to talk about now Jeremys is not the author of the words!  @AndyBurnhamGM the price discrepancy in transport: bus, trains, trams etc. Are all thanks to private companies running for profit! Jeremy tried to tell us this🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adilray The ideas suggested in the tweet you’re responding to are untrue. Cancer surgery/treatment remains relatively unaffected- we still admit cancer patients for surgical treatments (in my trust, and I’m led to believe across the NHS). Moreover other serious conditions are treated too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 Another day - where receipts 🧾 hold them truth, whilst the individual chats bollox!   Well done 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ FYI whilst William deceiving the country - everyone else is expected to be honest on the Covid19 app so as to help the country mitigate this virus!  Once again we have high ranking elites in the uk Charting their own rules, whilst the rest of the country facing fines etc🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat @alexnunns The main issue isn’t even whether he did or didn’t - the question is: was there “political interference “ from “up above” - a crime often levelled against JC. The events of what happened suggest there was interference from above which prejudices due process - it’s illegal 😎🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnunns @holski_beat Do you have the hard evidence for this direct statement 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews So... everyone else can now also refuse to use the Covid-19 app, refuse to reveal their diagnosis and continue their daily life- What a bloody great example to set the country.  This country is doomed: run and symbolically represented by wastemen who think they're above the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONGOLDENDOND1 @tef0306 @Women2Dc @JoeBiden @roysilber @corcorangroup Either way, cancer or no cancer, the footage we have seen shows that the man is ABSOLUTELY vile, and a danger to the general public. Going around destroying private property and accosting people he has no relationship with.  When caught out: he pulls cancer/racial/family excuses?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texas_happy @Women2Dc @AOC @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley Of course you're right, which makes one doubt the veracity of what this woman harasser alleged in his explanatory message Someone with stage4 cancer on chemo tends to be far more humble, and keeping well away from infections that can attack a weakened immune system  He's an idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 Y'alls country dont love you  I feel for Americans who arent of the white race  We all know what would happen if these traffic creators were people of colour - NYPD/helicopters/bullets/New channels - would all be there in a heartbeat.

<|startoftext|>@Women2Dc @JoeBiden @roysilber @corcorangroup @RexChapman hi Rex, can you up this make Karen please? He verbally and physically threatened an innocent woman, then went on Facebook to libel her call her antisemetic to mention but a few!  Hot up this liar please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tef0306 @Women2Dc @JoeBiden @roysilber @corcorangroup I thought he lied and said that “he normally drives past Biden posters and leaves them in peace... and that he only attacked Shipiros because of underlying animosity between the 2! Fact your parents posters were pulled down suggest he’s lying through his teeth and fingers!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Women2Dc @AOC @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley Dear @Women2Dc - I’m not sure how I came across your thread, but Im glad I did! Well done for making the truth public! You should NOT be threatened like this.  Moreover as a doctor, it is disappointing to see this man use his diagnosis as an excuse to harass!  Solidarity to you❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabriel_Pogrund @alexnunns General discipline or otherwise, doesn’t justify “political interference”. Keir proudly announced on television that “he” had acted decisively and that “he” had no choice. He was furthermore asked about how Jeremy was informed of the suspension, he couldn’t clarify.   It’s a mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmergMedDr @JuliaHB1 She’s horrid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnunns @Gabriel_Pogrund They cant unsay or undo what they said/did. They 100% linked it to the EHRC and AS.  I can’t see how they can backtrack now.   They misread the wind: they thought EHRC was the stars aligning in their favour to finally extinguish JC. Keir proudly spoke of his actions At the time🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SWAtlasHoover What harm did it cause exactly? 😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️  Is speaking to people and the media a crime? 😂😂 Maybe you want to question the politics of the country that dictates whom you can and can’t speak to ?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl His firing (political decision or otherwise) is what exploded an already volatile situation.  If forensic Keir was trying to act tough and cutthroat to woo voters - he now needs to be man enough to carry on the battle he’s ignited!  NOBODY wanted this situation. Keir created it🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM @JoeBiden @AndyBurnhamGM don’t get too excited, Biden is somewhat better than Trump, but he’s definitely no messiah!   We’re all rooting for Trump to lose, that’s all🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Hey Farage, how’s it going buddy?  I think a new party is needed - why don’t you start the “Against Lockdown Party”?  Oh before I forget to ask: How’s the Kent coast? Any dinghies this weekend?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein @campbellclaret This is why I cant blindly give Keir my vote. Sometimes youve got to keep reminding people not to take your sympathies for weakness/desperation. If people arent held to account - such as JC In his heyday- they go on to become intransigent and unbending. Have to correct from onset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein @campbellclaret I appreciate your efforts though - you strike me as someone who wants to care/genuinely cares. I’ve given up on staying silent watching people asking me for support/solidarity in one regard when they themselves offer solidarity to noone else. I can’t give a blank cheque no more❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein @campbellclaret Yet he’s seen as the brighter light by some fighters against racism.  The fight seem to end when their own personal interest: family friends are on safe ground. It’s the titanic equivalence of Rose’s fiancée getting himself on a life boat, then who cares about others?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein @campbellclaret He’s done worse than that: he’s written text saying Africa is shithole that requires the “return of white people” to sort “them” out. He’s referred to black peoples as “picanninie” a derogatory apartheid era term for black peoples! Boris is a known racist thru and thru.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein This the kind of bollox that really grates me to the core! How can people be here fighting every battle against one type of minority and then turn a blind eye to other victims of other evils? And go as far as endorsing a racist KKK promoter!?   It just doesn’t make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein So let’s all be honest - “most” are out here for their own interests! Trump to black people is the return of apartheid, colonisation, slavery, but I see people who accuse Jeremy of AS retweeting trump and Farage! Are you kidding me?  So long as they’re good🤷🏾‍♂️ to hell with others?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein Well sadly you’ll find that’s not the case. Ive watched/observed the loudest “OMG racism is wrong; Jeremy is an enabler of racism” also preach how Trump is the best thing that’s ever happened for Middle East and he’s exactly what the world needs! So long his victims aren’t them🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @andrewfeinstein Trump is quite literally a threat to everyone, and the black community knows that more than anyone else - he’s asked ProudBoys to stand back and stand by - when asked to condemn white supremacy attacks against black peoples.  But alas, people aren’t black, who cares🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hxmzaliy Was asking myself the same question 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Not to mention the bills abstained on by Labour would in retrospect do even more to FAIL stephenLawrence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein @PatrickWDixon - what’s your take on this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ They raise a very valid point, but then proceed to over season with what is clearly personal bias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ I think I’ll struggle.  I also want to know which keirites called out Keir for his tortoise 🐢 pace with addressing antiblack racism - 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fennell962 @piersmorgan Well done, you caught on - eventually  https://t.co/C9HCX0Ev6L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ That’s a good question!   And notice that you haven’t reached to malign everyone else whilst making a good point!  No quotation marks to dog whistle, no suggestive language, just straight forward question. Many should learn 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ I didn’t question whether or not various people were or weren’t antisemitic. I questioned the painting of Everyone with the sins of others🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Then I asked you: in light of Boris being an known racist with written material that prove his racism - are all tories racist?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOBSUKWIDE @piersmorgan Pending an investigation ** addendum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ Yep that’s AS and obviously wrong there’s no disputing that. But I don’t see how that crime is then painted over anyone and  everyone else...  the meeting isn’t about “hey let’s all get together for a party”, it’s diverse people talking about an action they deemed inappropriate🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ They need to go for the antisemetic people and leave everyone else alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ On that basis: Boris has said antiblack racism material, is every Tory MP and voter antiblack racist?  Keir has acted inadequately in the eyes of many black peoples against antiblack racism in labour - are all labour MPs and voters antiblack racists?  Generalisation needs to stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ He may do, but the author of the tweet certainly didn’t mean in an endearing way. He meant it in a crass dog whistle way. It was an attempt to tarnish everyone with AS and it’s denial - which Donald, nor Diane nor anyone else has done. But alas people will keeping reaching for🌟s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ It’s their way of maligning people without legally naming them to prevent libel cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ Indeed! Diane included<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ Well each to their own. Most others can read through it,   “Party elders” - it’s really not rocket 🚀 quantum physics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ Well these people need to better word their tweets! Because the way it’s written is generalised and suggestive! And “elders” in quotation marks - we all know that’s heading and what it’s supposed to insinuate 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein They tend to lie - to exaggerate reality and create a narrative.  Interestingly their attempt to gaslight, lie, almost lends credit to what JC said about the media’s handling of the whole situation: who exactly did they reach out to that allegedly refused to reply? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @stevelapsl @lauren1995x__ Lol ... is the argument that Jeremy should never have counsel? Should never have friends? Should never grave advocates?  So anyone who says something nice about Jeremy is by default of the argument being made an AS/denier🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Odd stuff going on, Jeremy really triggers some😐😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fennell962 @piersmorgan Good for you!  And your dividends are pretty rubbish!  Better luck next time maybe 👋🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fennell962 @piersmorgan He hasn’t failed on just the pandemic though lol He was a liar before the election, he remains a liar. He puts his ego, party and lobby groups before anyone else! He used London mayor budget to pay for sex with Acuri. Oh and he’s an unrepentant racist - you still voted for him!🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Did you vote for him?   Haha many of us didn’t because we could see the writing on the wall.   Keep the charlatan you guys voted into number 10🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️💪🏽💪🏽😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sensible_George @rachshabi @LucienDissake He said: he accepted the EHRC findings and that 1 antisemetic person is 1 too many.  He said the media and political opponents may have used the crisis to batter labour -which Tories of course did.  Tories threw their racism towards BAME people under bus to kick labour 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist At this rate, based on the actions/evidences I’ve seen since Jeremys departure - I much prefer @AndyBurnhamGM to Forensic abstentionist Sir Keir.   Also Andy seems to lead with conviction not game playing. In many ways: Andys intergrity is what lost him the race. Keir is a player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Loool 😂😂😂  So @SadiqKhan is now a Puppet?   Did labour achieve the deal or did Sadiq achieve the deal? Don’t steal Sadiqs achievement for your political spins on social media guys.... it doesn’t look cool at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarDisciple @Georgiii364 I thought he’d emigrated to Spain? Why did he come back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachshabi @LucienDissake To be fair the conclusion that can be drawn from your thread and many similar threads is that: Like anyone on earth, Jeremy is entitled to speak (its a human right after all), the issue seems to be that its HIM who spoke, and that he said something society doesnt want him to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Great! You've inspired me to get my act together and finally get my fitness sorted. I have been finding excuses after excuses - no more!  Urakoze mate!! Keep it up and keep safe! One day tugomba gusangira akantu gakonje<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis @rachshabi @judeinlondon2 I agree with this conclusion. We live in an era where people can malign you, your words, your statement and spin things out of proportion. Secondly everyone is deliberately doing exactly what JC said the media did: exaggerate/spin based on one's bias. FYI JC agreed with the EHRC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKibasi Medic here: my annual leave was suspended throughout the entire first wave- I caught covid19 whilst doing my work as Dr, ended up nearly admitted due to symptoms.

<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Ok the contrary what does he deserve? Our scorn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uk_domain_names Also - for a bed to be fully functional it needs nurses and doctors.

<|startoftext|>@YourtrashPoet @uzacahandi Haha Sha its hilarious kabisa!   We need to learn to appreciate OUR own culture!

<|startoftext|>@soniasodha What exactly are we undermining?

We’ve seen the vast majority of Tory Ethnics and what they think about discrimination faced by BAME ... apparently we make it all up! There’s no racism apparently. Did StephenLawrence killed himself?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @samisam147 I wish it could be taxi for the whole cohort of Westminster.... government and majority of opposition too.   The country needs a reset!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @samisam147 Haha Forensic DietBoris🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂  He’s got the personality and character of plain flour frankly.   I just want to know how some of these Tory disciples couldn’t see through the smokescreen.... oh yeah that’s right they were taken by the ideology of me,myself and I before anyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelechnekoff Yeah when Jezza suggested it.... the tories laughed, the media ridiculed, Labour Judases laughed along with tories.  Apparently Jezza was in Fantasy land - said JessPhilips et al...   Yet here we are .... Jezza vindicated 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!  @jeremycorbyn kill em with kindness mate! 🙅🏾‍♂️😎😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guessweredone Who on earth has said they do not “understand the hurt and distress [that those affected face?]”  @AngelaRayner you’re chatting sheer horse manure here! Absolute lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisam147 Hahaha   The best part of this is her Parting words “wow .... that will work out great won’t it?”  Can she tells about her beloved BorisJohnson? Because we’re living a boris Johnson and conservatives world - and she’s moaning... it’s not Jeremys Britain! It’s the Tory Britain😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARMilani_ Mate we wish we had you instead 😇 Ps happy weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @emilyhewertson Well as I said - conservatives have been blocking people for months - I’m surprised Emily only clocked on to politicians blocking - only when she herself was blocked by a political opposing ideology 😎😎🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @emilyhewertson Haha 😂  Where was Emily et al when tories like NadineDorries went around blocking people?! Or when Tories post tweets and disable replies😂😂😂  Oh .... nowhere.   But oh shock horror - someone else blocks tories - “omg look at these leftist snowflakes”🤣🤣  Laughable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPugh Back in the days where kids bus ticket was 40p, and a weekly ticket was a green paper card - chewing gum used to be 20p.... just saying!  Ohh and adult ticket on a bus was 70p in those days!  Early 2000s. And leisure centres had libraries, pools all subsidised!  Take me back😇🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Youre overthinking it🤔 The whole situation is a mess: the failure of the system was a mess, the people who run the system and failed to deal with complaints are part of the problem - who are they? What was their motive?  A lot remains unexplained. That’s what’s needs exploration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsternweiner Question we have all been pondering. I want #KeirStarmer to explain why as far as he is concerned there’s only one type of racism that deserves his unmatched determination and effort. All other forms of discrimination and racism seem tolerable and “debatable”.  Disgusting 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serialTweeper @halimamdee @FirstLadyRwanda I was confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_i0n @lordofintent @Keir_Starmer I am struggling to understand - how can this be true when the yoGov poll apparently showed that his popularity soared after knifing JC?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl A dead fish has character &amp; personality.  I would describe at as a personality &amp; character of plain flour. PLAIN damn FLOUR.

<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster @Keir_Starmer Whatever is said - he’ll whip to abstain... so not sure why there’s this new forensic approach anyway. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Opposition not for opposition sake apparently 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson You said that as if the country “ever” did see mental health as important as physical health. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy @zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn I didnt respond in offensive way, I told you what I think about apartheid and those who enabled it for decades.  If that upsets you, then that says a lot about your views of black peoples and this experience of racism.   And yes, don’t gaslight me with “thatcher was great for SA”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy @zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn Hahahahaha   Do you expect me to rejoice that enablers of racism got bored and eventually decided to ask white racists to stop being racist??   Find someone else to piss off this evening 👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy @zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn At no point from the premise of my comment did I single out any MP - I said the Conservative party and therefore ideology was to malign Mandela and there were leaflets spread by tories in the day to have Mandela killed!  Whats the last British colony Rhodesia got to do with Jermy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy @zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn Do your own research if you need to know which political party and ideology wanted to have Mandela executed - not sure where you’re trying to take this conversation.  South Africans for decades faced subhuman treatment up till 1994 - Britain was a supporter of the racist regime🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPugh @Keir_Starmer United in disappointment we stand! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂  https://t.co/kcCzZolerE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy @zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn Tories were demanding Mandela be killed Jeremycorbyn was a steadfast supporter of Africans in their request for independence &amp; respect. He remains so to this day. We have the receipts. Not sure what clarifications needed to be added. FYI tories continue to gaslight black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen What @MatthewStadlen said.   Period!  Everyone who’s turning a blind eye to the “ProudBoys stand by and stand back” rhetoric is complicit in enabling racism!   Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his rhetoric and there are lives at stake!  It’s as simple as that🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/rX121U4GqX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Exactly!  And this NewLeadership makes it clearer and clearer at every juncture that if you’re a person of colour, your complaints are AT THE BACK of the QUEUE. And those he’s wooing back into part similarly don’t get a toss about BAME discrimination and issues!  Bun the gaslight  https://t.co/Doie6ooiP3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemyBaho What @RemyBaho said .... and I don’t even think people should be surprised.  A lot of these rappers etc aren’t even educated.

<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker The best line was their line about trump.... 😂😂  “Hmm yeah 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔 soz trump internally wants to see black peoples shot and maimed ... but in Middle East at least he’s achieved “peace”🤷🏾‍♂️  Peace for whom exactly? Who’s more prosperous in Middle East thanks to trump’s peace? 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LanceForman @AJSchonfield @BoardofDeputies @BoDPres Love how some people view politicians through the prism of their own personal interests, facts are: Trump has been a danger to everyone else: especially the black community of USA. He instructs ProudBoys (racists) to stand by. So long as he's nice to Jews, to hell every1 else?❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anthonyvclark20 The entire black and Asian cohort in the Conservatives of Britain are doing exactly that! White racists no longer need to pour out their acid, they have maids who will do it for them! They just sit back and applaud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PMLEGEND KMT! And they use them to gaslight us!   I cant wait to see back of these Tories!  https://t.co/TdJ0nFnwgm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PMLEGEND Selfish ways over humanity is a good summary  But, when Kemi a black woman is WHEELED out to say white privilege is a MYTH? What we supposed to take from that?  She basically regurgitates what I imagine Michael Gove wants to say, but they kno if Gove says it, its gonna sound SHIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PMLEGEND The tories have been extremely clever, and the like of Priti/Cleverly (not so cleverly), Bim, Kemi etc. have been too caught up in tokenism to realise what is happening.  The tories are using BAME people as trojan horses to gaslight the entire BAME community. Their ignorance is🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @bbcquestiontime @CPhilpOfficial @Bonn1eGreer @BBCOne @Scaramucci Is there a full version of this anywhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 You're not alone.  Tory and Labour are pretty much in the dustbin (Tories already in the landfill)  I have genuinely had to start low-key reading up Green Party. That's how desperate times have got.  It will be: Green Party, abstain, or strategically be abroad at time of election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 I will not even lie, hearing that mans name often gives me yawn vibes. Zero vibes... zeroooo I might have to abstain when election comes  https://t.co/EuAopCyjTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eyeswideopen69 @WalterKovacs69 So in this tweet, are you suggesting, he should have just played dumb, even if he had something to say/ask/clarify?  I agree with the vast majority of your thread, but your wrong on the conclusion you draw. FYI JC agreed with the EHRC findings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 Oh yes? care to expand on this allegation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelEmG @benjaminbutter Literally this... so if this was 1930s-1940s, commenting against Nazism would be viewed as "taking sides?"  WTAF!?  This impartiality bullshit is a load of horse manure. Fighting against racism and discriminations not POLITICAL, it is morally correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 Only one MP in 🇬🇧 has receipts of their fight against racism and for a better world. During the days black peoples were treated like subhumans in the 80-90s, Jeremy was on street protesting! Tories were asking for Mandela to be executed. Many lab MPs didn’t care!  Truth matters🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/HnsQGNaNie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana @jeremycorbyn FYI for all the haters who are undoubtedly about to jump on any positive comment regarding #JeremyCorbyn  - there’s ONLY one MP in the commons who has receipts for fighting against racism- it’s Jeremy. While he campaigned against apartheid, tories wanted Mandela executed.  Bye👋🏽  https://t.co/3jjoDuSEeP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman @Bob_in_NYorks @andrewfeinstein Ohh .... is this “THE” @andrewfeinstein ??  I had no idea he was South African! 👋🏽 Hey Andrew💪🏽😎  Today I’ve been reflecting on the fact that in the whole MPs cohort- #JeremyCorbyn is the only MP who has receipts for fighting’s against Apartheid. Tories wanted Mandela dead🙅🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/N3im4qh0PS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani They only care as long as it’s aimed at furthering the outcomes they wish to see happen.   Otherwise, bloody cares about process?😂🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @jeremycorbyn Same here!  Its astonishing the way those who were in cahoots with racist apartheid South Africa are the same people instructing us to throw stones at someone who despite his white privilege - marched for end to antiblack racism! Sorry but my stones aint going nowhere!🙅🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 The one MP still in the dusty House of Commons who has receipts for standing up against racism is indeed - @jeremycorbyn !  Whilst the tories were campaigning for Mandela to be excuted, drawn and quartered- Jeremy was out there getting arrested to speak up for black peoples🤷🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/toOhpBLTGe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joejglenton I’ll add this @joejglenton - the only sitting MP in the British House of Commons who actually has receipts and evidence for their fight against racism is 🥁roll🥁 @jeremycorbyn  Notwithstanding solidarity to the Jewish community who were failed by a flawed and weak system🙅🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/1VvbvC99AZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity  https://t.co/W35V7lpoKa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stavvers @0Calamity Have people really forgotten that the bbc new boss is a Tory?! Did we all miss this detail when he came to power ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @RespectIsVital is precisely it. What I now see is that there is a two pronged approach by #KeirStarmer 1) how labour deals with antisemitism 2) how labour deals with other forms of racism Keir said: those who question/gaslight DO NOT belong, yet antiblack racists remain within🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott At this point - All I’ll say is: 1) Solidarity with the Jewish community who were clearly failed repeatedly!  2) labour needs to make it clear that ALL racism is wrong, and equal robust action will be taken against anti-anyone else 3) FYI JC campaigned against apartheid!  Bye🤷🏾‍♂️👋🏽  https://t.co/9SxstKDbBf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani To be honest- at this rate, I might as well go back and rejoin the conservatives. Because What’s the actual point?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Today is a weird day 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LordJohnMann What about the MP who was caught in a secret footage saying she’d accept millions to make up stuff about another  British member of Parliament? What should today be for her?  https://t.co/OZicc7OHxm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford A term uniquely used by the conservatives, UKIP, right wing people to show their disagreement with an idea or proposition that shows them up to be callous and vile.  For example: suggesting tories should feed hungry kids, but there’s no profit to be made. Or acknowledging racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USMAN84kg @walegates In an American world - run by trump, and cheered on by ProudBoys and the KKK and racists around the western world.  🇺🇸 USA is a leading power not just in foreign wars but also racism and enabling racism! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lonnyicee @DigitalNegus "And you aint ho-ho-ho" **Plus head tilt**  I was not ready for her comebacks! She thinks on her feet!  The best part was also "You're in the ghetto" haha  https://t.co/BI1dIP5vcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashtredame @NatalieFoskett sorry to hear that BAME being offered a leg up in a society that puts so many barriers in their path is infuriating.  FYI, at uni there were many scholarships for people from different backgrounds, there was 1 ONLY for GIRL- I didnt cry about it as a male! Grow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Was it planted from seedling? It looks great by the way.... and it’s a great memento.    I also planted an avocado tree back in Africa when I was about 3, whenever I go visit, it’s incredible to see the tree standing proud, providing avocados every year! Incredible! 💪🏽💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward @lewis_goodall Was this Conservatives way of helping Bristol remain out of lockdown? Meanwhile Manchester and Liverpool - Tier 3 plus plus plus! Bracket (No money for Manchester! Or poor kids in Manchester)  The political game playing couldn’t be more starkly obvious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani He had to get a suit measured 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Didn’t I hear that the next day he was at the same location for suit fitting.  I would be keen to hear from the cyclist - whilst he waited with him: beyond the “oh I’m sorry I nearly killed you, hope you’re alright” - what’s Keir like?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD Mfite amatsiko how this case will be dealt with .. and what due process will be done for people charged by this man!   If there’s no investigation - it will be weakness in the system in my opinion. It will same as cutting a weed but not uprooting the weed! It grows back 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD Because ibaze nawe - someone who has spent years judging others and sending people to jail is secretly a bigger criminal than those he condemns to life in prison... Ubwo se koko - urumva adafite responsibility to be punished ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD It definitely will have an impact, however for the justice of the population, there needs to be consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD All his work still need to be investigated - there’s huge conflict of interest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD It will be interesting to see how he judged cases of similar nature to his own crimes! Did he find them not guilty? Did he find them guilty and what verdict did he recommend! There has to be an investigation into his professional work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD It 100% has to be revised because what we know now is that this judge (harya he was supreme?) was judging crimes that he himself commits! Rero his judgement is biased and skewed!   And what has to be done is auditing of his judgements and cases! Verdicts and sentences 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba This is called a “meal”😳😳🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Jesu help some people!   Some Brits have reinvented the meaning of “bangers and mash” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤭🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD So ... let me get this straight - someone who passes judgements on others, is himself a criminal?  Everyone who has been judged and sentenced by this man should have their cases re-done, because uyu muntu numunyabyaga wo murwego rwohejuru!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo Dont get me wrong- I agree with you! Foreign powers hosting killers and murdered is NOT acceptable or defendable.  But I think sometimes we lose sight of the other picture by overly focusing on one ill. There are multiple ills in Africa and rwanda specifically. Lets criticise all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo In that case it’s ironic because isn’t that what happened in Rwanda in recent history? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  At one point Africans have to learn the game and learn to jump past the traps. But we don’t - we sleep walk into the traps because of greed and thirst for what power brings with it🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo Okay let me change the word “nice” to “fair”   The leadership has a choice to be “fair” to its population, but chooses not to. Is pretending to be a democracy whilst also having been wielders of power from 1994 to 2020 fair? And anyone who questions is an enemy of the state ?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo Rwandan leadership has the individual choice to be choose how it treats its people.  It can choose who it gives privileges in business and ease of doing business. It can choose the type of government it wants to have. They’ve chosen to be THE only government since 1994/2001🤷🏾‍♂️!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo I think fundamentally our leaders are personally democratic or not. Your point is like saying your decision to be kind and nice to me is dependent on whether an external force forces you to be. Ask yourself: “Do I want to be nice to Fred, and what should I do to show that”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nairobichik @JolyonMaugham The best thing is that they host corruption, engage in the proceeds of corruption , while simultaneously telling their ignorant population that corruption is something UK does not tolerate!  UK moans about Russia but also hosts Russian billionaires.   UK population is blind🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @MailOnline How ironic that the one party that snatched milk away was not the Labour Party - but indeed the Tories. And in 2020, whilst the tories vote for millions to repaint Boris✈️, millions to redo Queens palaces, pay rise for MPs, millions for Tory business mates, ❌no meals for kids❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo China at least calls itself communist - and those who know history know what comes with chinese communism. I don’t think the Chinese pretend they’re a democracy with regular elections. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Meanwhile murwanda 😂😂😂 elected ngo with 97.9% etc<|endoftext|>

Haven't you seen the way they treat @SayeedaWarsi  - a woman of colour who is senior in the Tory party? She's independently spoken they would NEVER give her leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @AyoCaesar Really!? Haha😂 To be fair I hate getting into BMW &amp; Audis that are quite low, its like getting into a hole.  Most people get SUV though because it gives a sense of being above everyone else. Whenever you venture into leafy postcodes where mummy &amp; daddy have ponies it’s all SUV😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham 3/ that is why in🇬🇧we collectively (media and the general population) are blind to corruption that stares us in the face!  Also we have a weird mentality of proportionality: that Western corruption “is surely nothing like Russian/African corruption”, this means we give a pass🤷🏾‍♂️✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham 2/ growing up I remember being led to believe that corruption only happens in African nations, Russia, China. Our elites have created this weird image that we should only associate corruption with ABROAD. This means that subconsciously the population becomes blind to issues here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham I think the answer is that our elites- who are often head to toe immersed in corruption (note corruption doesn’t only mean fiddling millions, even fiddling expenses is corruption) - our elites form part of government and media control. They indoctrinate us to se corruption abroad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayeedaWarsi is @SayeedaWarsi really suggesting Asian parents want their children to become filthy rich and once at the top of their game: to engage in tax havens, hiding wealth, voting to starve children (baring in mind most Asians start like any other immigrants: from the bottom🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rezaaslan What they’re doing is what cuckoo birds do: laying their eggs in other nests to be able to derail everything once they lose the election! They want to make sure they have representation and Trojan horses in key departments, so that even when not in power they can skew democracy🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly @RishiSunak Is it wheel out the ethnics day in the Tory party today?  The starving children crisis is getting so sticky... it’s time for a distraction?

<|startoftext|>@avocadamn This is actually mad. I used to travel through Bexleyheath (which I think is part of bexley borough) - it definitely has rich and poor areas - to think that the rich in bexley have decided to completely disregard and starve the poor is astonishing! I’ll always side eye Bexley now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster These Tories are just vile - EVERYONE wants to deal with the cause of poverty at THE CORE!  The issue is that on the surface (during the PANDEMIC) - on the surface children from the poorest families in the UK have become ACUTELY vulnerable. Its about solving an ACUTE problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudSocialist The UK (a country that shares the so called 'special relationship' with the USA) is a close second for top nations who are most propagandized<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock @BimAfolami Haha “opportunities for everyone”  So u think a child with poor nutrition will attain top grades that enables them to get that top job?  Or that people discriminated by your PM as letterbox bank robbers/ picanninie smiles have same chances as Boris’ children?   Lies lies lies😂❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotteeIsFat @BorisJohnson Kudos to organisers of this protest!  It is very accurate indeed!  Thousands if not millions of children during this pandemic will be settling in for empty plates! A plate of toast &amp; butter might as well be empty because there’s no nutritional value!

<|startoftext|>@schnuckster What has become very evident since the NewLeadership took over is that social media management/campaign was taken away from a young vibrant team that understands how social media works (remember how good labour was with social media back in 2017?) - it’s been given to a pensioner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Colaco Number plate on that car doesn’t look British 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjukes The truth is: tories care about NO-ONE but themselves! They are all about self interest before anyone else! The self interest is evident in finances - MPs claim expenses for meals - but they can’t bless CHILDREN with same privilege! They want to keep taxes! They’re disgusting❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjukes Let me give you examples that confirm the sheer disingenuousness of these tories and their crocodile tears: where were they when DianeAbbott was forced to hide in toilet due to Tory racism? Or when DarrenGrimes nodded to “Damned blacks” or when DawnButler office was attacked?❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Haha  Touché   Side note, I appreciate no-one likes being called anything (least of all the LOVERS of free speech Tories/Rightwing), where were these tories when Grimes smiled to “damned blacks” or where was their sympathy when Dawns office was racially targeted?  ❌🤷🏾‍♂️NOWHERE🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon With Africa, and indeed the so called 3rdworld/developing world- the reasons are very complex and western powers are always implicated.

<|startoftext|>@BenKentish This statement is so laughable.. "Many conservative MPs privately endorse extending free school meals" YET.....

They voted AGAINST🤷  https://t.co/EAQRM78ZwO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans So .... were you wrong to malign poor people?   Is this supposed to be an apology? Retraction of allegations?   Also have you formally apologised to the school you maligned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Legitimate question 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyMercerUK What does “Your type” mean?  You recognise that similarly “YOUR TYPE” voted to starve children, then subsequently YOUR TYPE tried to boast about it: referring to working class as people who spend vouchers on brothels? Guess what Boris did with Mayoral budget? PAID Acuri for Sex🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward Did he quite literally say in this footage “ousting the corner shops” 😟😖😖   So this is why back in early 2000s we lost bakeries and butchers to horrid supermarkets that were located miles away?!   The pride with which he said “ousting the corner shops”😭😢!  How depressing!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Notwithstanding last week we finally got confirmation that #BorisJohnson as mayor of London had sexual relations with #Acuri and subsequently used London budge to pay off Acuri with a business deal.   So ironically it is the conservatives who use Taxpayers vouchers for brothels🤭  https://t.co/tu0F0Ernnf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen The last few days have been genuinely traumatic. The debates before the vote were crazy- A Tory MP maligned Marcus calling him a “virtue signaller”, he called feeding children “nationalising”. And today Ben alleged poor people spend vouchers on Drugs/Brothels!  Breathtaking😳🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daphne_parkin @DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford Not to mention we pay taxes to provide the government with the MEANS to protect each and every British citizen. Instead this Tory government spends it repainting Boris planes, paying off sex with Acuri, MPs expenses, privatising everything. But kids? No let them eat toast🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Surely what is needed for accountability therefore is for the expenses to always be broken down - money spent on staff (and who the staff are... wives/nieces/nephews/ children - really?) and money on furniture, paper, pens etc - all to be documented. None of this rounded values🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama No MBE/knighthood/lordship can buy someone whos not political. Tories and frankly labour have a major challenge with this Marcus guy- he's like  fire that wont go off despite pouring water at it. Tories tried the MBE extinguisher and failed. then they tried insulting him - fail🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford 1) Anyone can argue a case with spin. Do we need to bring the receipts of his comments? They're freely available.  2) Vote was: does gov feed children - Gov voted No - so what do you call that? Feeding? or starving? 3) When did I say you agreed with the decision? Dont ASSUME👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Punkage In the 21st century- UK is the 5th largest economy in the world Britain can at the drop of a hat start bombing any given country for MILLIONS per bomb Britain can also apparently afford to repaint a Boris plane for 10M for the banter. And to up Queens pocket money. Kids food?Nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @BBradley_Mans 1) He lied - so I don't know what on earth you're on about. He alleged there was "DUPLICATION" - there was NO such thing❌AT ALL. It was CAUSE and EFFECT a) Gov voted to starve children, this led to b) @MarcusRashford  rallying troops to chip in, businesses responded! He SPUN it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili @BBradley_Mans @faisalislam It's such a shame that media really just FAIL at holding people to account. Faisal has now allowed him to SPIN, the spin has been "enabled" and rubber stamped, now he's going to go spreading his "bit on BBC" to his fans saying "see lads and lasses - i set the record straight"🤬😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster I was disappointed that  @faisalislam  did not challenge him on the sequence of events!❌  There was no damn duplication - one event led to another. Government REFUSED to feed children, as a consequence local businesses and charities are HAVING to step in (as alternative sources)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HowardDLeigh @amandamilling @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner Lol 'chair of a number of charities' thanks to your party - your charities will have to fork out more to feed the less well off.  It is utterly laughable.  Moreover, would you like to comment on your party's MP suggesting that poor people spend vouchers on drug dens/brothels?🧐🤔  https://t.co/Gm3vX6shvO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster haha - thanks for the heads up - just tuned in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markjenkinsonmp @AngelaRayner Dear @markjenkinsonmp are you therefore confirming that @BBradley_Mans DID as a matter of fact suggest that food vouchers are spent on drugs and brothels by the poor. (FYI: the vouchers can only be redeemed in supermarkets for specified food items only) Ben ur Fbook post is lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Yes but what if food vouchers that only work in supermarkets for fruit/veg/milk/bread were to be spent in a brothel or drug den? Tories are apparently concerned that the impossible might be possible - that's why they voted to starve children - allegedly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford Just going to put it out there.... I am sick and tired of squares/hospitals/roads/parks being named after meek/demure/boring/hand-wavers-on-a-chariot type of people.  I think @MarcusRashford has well and truly earned his spot for recognition beyond gaslighting MBE titles!  😎👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miqdaad But there's a TWIST- in his weird 1984 attempt at explaining himself - he fails to include screenshots of the twitter thread in question. Where all the brackets and caveats he has used in his facebook explanation are TOTALLY absent. i.e. he did not mention (ONLY IN SUPERMARKETS!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans Ahh ... someone hacked his account and typed for him (without his knowledge or approval). Typed a tweet on his behalf about people using vouchers to pay for brothels!  Who tweeted for you Mr MP?  It's very easy, if it wasn't you, tell us who it was, it will all go away! Vanish  https://t.co/p3J5hGj67K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford I politely said cheerio, it wasn't enough.   I'll formally have to say goodbye!  Bye, and good night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarajaneoreilly Gosh, youve made me cast my eyes back to when I was younger My brother had a friend from his primry school, who used to come round at weekends because he had grown to realise that every weekend we had massive family meals/BBQs. We later learnt of poverty back home😰He was welcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford Alright, you can go shoe shine Boris' brogues somewhere else. Leave my TL. Goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford Well then let them go private, and they can bring in 'so much money' to fund themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford Ask Her Majesty the Queen; her children and their children and their - why they 'decide not to work and expect governments to pay'  Or why the Lords can sign off expenses for turning up to sit on leather chairs, have a giggle, then book BlackCabs on the taxpayer's cheque.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans Clearly private education hasn't been value for money.  It goes:  Angela comma. Not Angela full stop.  Get a refund mate, it really wasn't value for money.  Moreover, you'll note that Angela provided receipts that prove that you said EXACTLY what you said!  Receipts don't lie😎👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMo91059490 @DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford Hahaha  yeah, in that case, if people shouldnt expect Governments to ensure British people are fed - they should kindly return our taxes!  I pay high rate tax for children to be fed, NHS to function properly, schools to be good quality, welfare to be proper. If not, refund! Ta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Thatcher has been reincarnated- and she has fans &amp; voters - that's what has happened. I now wonder in hindsight who the bigger danger was after all: at the election of December 2019.  cheaper: brodband/uniFees/utilities/transport/protectedNHS -appaz was more dangerous than Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraunandRed @BBradley_Mans @BorisJohnson You were right to challenge the language used. it is nothing short of libel, and worst of all it undermines and maligns the members of the school: children, teachers, parents and local community alike. The MP of the local area should be seeking reprimand at earliest opportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent @MarcusRashford He's exemplary- there are no other ways to put it or words to say.    His ethics, drive &amp; determination to stand for those who need a platform is what every politician should be programmed to do. Alas Tory NickyMorgan last night told us that her partys politics is gameplaying❌🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans I think a governor at the school you maligned and misrepresented has asked you to apologise and correct your allegations.  Also @BraunandRed - I think it will be appropriate for the school to formally write to the PM @BorisJohnson to seek immediate reprimand🤷🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 To think work class people in so called "red wall" &amp; other places such as North East etc. voted Conservatives because they felt 'Tories best represented their lives'   I just want to laugh out loud, whilst simultaneously trying to feel sympathy for them!  Xenophobia is a flop🤷  https://t.co/f2xpJiDT0z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evolvepolitics Don't forget there's also always money for the Monarchy - the queen already have a multitude of palaces/castles. She gets free security, butlers, servants etc. Her children are equally fed for free The conservatives would vote for an increase in the monarchy's pay in a heartbeat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Punkage I do agree that the quality and nutrition of McD is bollox - but for some families right now, especially in light of Tory vote against feeding children: for some the choice is: butter toast for breakfast, 1£ pizza from Iceland, toast for snack, and chips for dinner. Some worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlyons02 @ITVNewsPolitics @RishiSunak I live in the UK, a country whose government votes to NOT❌feed children who most require it. Whilst the same government votes for multi million pound Boris plane✈️ paint job. And indeed the tories are the biggest enthusiasts for Queen getting yearly payrise from taxpayer🤷🏾‍♂️ you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay What we are seeing since the government voted to starve children, is that everyone who has something to offer/give is saying "Hey, I own a cafe, I can offer free sandwiches"..."Hey Im a local pizza/kebab I can offer XYZ". Can't shoot those trying to help, shoot those who failed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford Sorry who are you?  Answering on behalf of Marcus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 oh... so she's a conservative councillor is she? Why was she introduced the other as "an ordinary British citizen"? Nothing ordinary at all... I must say- I did smell something rather odd from her demeanour - she didn't come across as ordinary in the slightest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlyons02 @ITVNewsPolitics @RishiSunak This is why people have principles - that you either stand by,... or you sell yourself to the devil to make an extra tenner.  What's more important: starving children because the motion was a Labour motion, or feeding children because British children require nutrition?  Choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay It's a complete scandal indeed that the country's considerate population has had to resort to these alternatives to feed kids. The blame lies in 1direction in my view: Governmnt- the one that was apparently elected with an 80 seat majority: to promote UK's interests home &amp; abroad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay Government publicly refused to provide just that: healthy meals - now those who are bothered to “try and help” are now trying to provide second best alternative 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Berate the government for failing on its duty 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneyGodley Yes they have ...  I mean in the House Of Commons they’ve already started to malign him as a “virtue-signaller” - we all know what they were trying to deliver to their twisted voters!  We don’t need to come out and curse him literally for us to be able to read between the lines🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveBakerHW And simultaneously voting against feeding children 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Yaaay all cheer for Steve - he’s been working ever so hard for Great Britain!

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @edwardpoole1975 Lol In the words of DianeAbbott- Keir has the legal &amp; legitimate mandate now.  It doesnt mean people cannot express “their” interpretation of what on earth went down at the last election - the Trojan horses etc.  One doesn’t have to align with your beliefs, nor must u with others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @cononeilluk Exactly - they’ve let the mask slip - all the gaslighting that they’ve done over the years - over in one sentence!   The tragic thing is however, those who don’t usually vote Tory who did last year - out of desperation to see fewer “immigrants” will fail to click the obvious 🤷🏾‍♂️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dog_nothing @Independent He has a soul!!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cononeilluk @viewsfromleft That is indeed the logical conclusion from what Nicky said! It is also nauseating that the party that bangs on about “Labour needs to stop playing party politics during a pandemic” Have categorically and emphatically playing party politics in a pandemic with CHILDREN’s poverty❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Haha I’m here for this part of the thread - the point is that Biden hasn’t grown on anybody - the situation is that ANYTHING right now is better option than Trump the racist!

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @bbcquestiontime @bphillipsonMP @BBCOne @NickyMorgan01 Oh absolutely, that is indeed the biggest irony! The “WORD” and many other words that weren’t used that could be used: perfectly describe the tories of this government! Some of them alleged that feeding children is “nationalising children” (whatever that’s meant to mean) - ❌❌🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afuahirsch The white coloniser played this game well it works like a charm!  In every nation they colonised - they always selected ONE isolated group to sponsor/support!

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @bbcquestiontime @bphillipsonMP @BBCOne astonished listen to this BS from @NickyMorgan01  In conclusion: the party that bangs on about “Labour must stop playing party politics and put management of the pandemic as priority” PLAYED party politics with feeding children because lab member used a word they didn’t like?❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 The other question is: if it wasn’t brexit and the orchestrated character assassination against Jeremy by Rightwing characters in cahoots with angry Labour Trojan horses - what else lost labour the election?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NabeelaAkh @ArchRose90 Absolutely! It’s infuriating!  I find it particularly ironic when social class climbers are the ones who shout the loudest!

<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @DurstApologist Ive been reflecting on todays vote and how catastrophic the loss is. In many ways, #KeirStarmer over the months, because of his NewLeadershipForensicAbstentions - he has NOT even managed to attract wavering Tories who may be tempted. There's no 'this alternative is kinder/better"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Its the ones who also say "Immigrants come here and are served first while British children and the veterans are starving and struggling to make ends meet" These tories put more energy into shielding DomCummings than they have put in safeguarding BRITISH children!

<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Dear🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, &amp; Tory voters specifically. May I focus you on the fact that: Tories enthusiastically voted to provide millions to 1) REPAINT a BORIS PLANE, 2) Boris spent MILLIONS on a phantom BRIDGE &amp; SEX, 3) Tories enthusiastically agree with increasing Queen's taxpayer salary Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSegalov I am trying to process what just happened in parliament and I am struggling to accept it. The 5th largest economy in the world: that can afford to drop endless bombs on any given enemy country - no questions - at a drop of a coin - just refused to feed its own children?  REALLY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @MarcusRashford Im not sure how celebrities function, whether or not they're mates in private  But I think @MarcusRashford needs to reach other to other decent celebrities and organise some sort of Millionaire footballers/F1 drivers etc. "Help poor children fund" @LewisHamilton ??

<|startoftext|>@WinterfellT @lewis_goodall Lol ... "It's making her more" sounds like she's still sympathetic to conservatives.  I'm not sure how any decent British person who has allegedly worked with the poor and vulnerable, can still be in consideration/thought about whether or not Tories are the party to vote for. Odd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Frankly - even if she did - she was right - the behaviour of the tory MP has been nothing short of deplorable.  If she did - then, we will say it for her: He's scum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_rugamba @Mr_rugamba they should have never got it wrong in the 1st place! Their role is to "Be there for the people" making sure people are not cheated/overcharged.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Agreed, although: MPs need to have a major backbone. At end of the day: it wasn't Boris/Keir who elected them - it was the constituents - and they elected the MP for a reason. At forefront of an MPs HoC action should be: To what extent am I betraying my values/constituents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie Whaaaaat ?! Another abstention from the forensic... what exactly is a called a forensic for?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Both sides are guilty of it, also we have young MPs with no experience, no gravitas whose only purpose is to say “how high” when asked to JUMP by their leader! The DennisSkinners on both sides no longer exist. Its largely “I need to impress Boris/Keir, I’ll vote anything he says”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon It’s honestly pathetic! On my drive from work, I was asking myself “what he hell is wrong with UK”  It dawned on me today UK has one of the most ideological parties in modern history! Their not let by principles/ convictions but rather cult-like sheep behaviour to a leader🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArchRose90 lol the elitism coming from #toryscum tonight is astonishing. In reference to #AngelaRayner, a tory cheerleader suggestively drops in 'councilEstate' reference to draw on Angela's working class background.

<|startoftext|>@NAkufoAddo Which protestors committed violence? @NAkufoAddo you need to be very clear in this circumstance: Do you agree with SARS “remaining” in situ or do you believe in #EndSARS - there’s really no “two” sides to this debate and problem!

<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani that’s not true @AaronBastani   He has told us who and what he is: 1) forensic- doesn’t ask me in what profession however  2) he believes in breaches of human rights - he whipped strongly for his party to thumbs up a Tory bill  3) he cares about racism - unless you’re black/Diane<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @zahyonofficial @_iamivie Agreed! Also these gaslighters have tendency to shout “why has race always got to be dragged into the argument?” Hmm duh because its the antiblack/BAME racism that prevents BAME achieving their potential.

<|startoftext|>@Ebure1971 @mike_adama @zahyonofficial @_iamivie @BBCPolitics Have people broken down the layers of privilege that this black MP has vs an average black person: who doesn’t speak English fluently, who’s parents weren’t rich enough to afford Oxford?

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Hey Kent Coast Guard   If you didn’t realise - it wasn’t about “#AndyBurnham pushing HIS luck” it was Andy fighting for the people of Manchester to get appropriate support for during a lockdown that will decimate businesses in the region.

<|startoftext|>@BlewishAnd exactly what Im wondering. At young age when I was in first term of yr10 I had privilege of travelling to Berlin on a history trip- I visited sachsenhausen conc camp where I learnt A LOT about the Holocaust &amp; nazism - NO absolutely NO Nazi is handsome juxtaposed to their evil❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanternsBlue @civetta @TheSocialistDad @HackneyAbbott Sincerely agree with everything in your tweet!  Lawyers who turn blind eye to human rights abuses and give thumbs up 👍🏼 to laws and bills breaching humans are just NOT the ones - irrespective of how desperately I want tories out and labour to win next election! ❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMattWain extraordinary- so despite gassing Jews, rounding Jewish people, labelling them with a star, marching them into trains destined for gas Chambers: it’s apparently totally normally to find the perpetrators of a holocaust intensely desirable.  All because they want to defend a friend  https://t.co/veNp8YyJQT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@civetta @TheSocialistDad @HackneyAbbott Lol people are really starting to reach! That was not the focus of Dianes dialogue. The focus was whether Keir was a schemer - which Brexit evidence shows he may have been.  https://t.co/ldsuAlRRgA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital But yes accept your point re: Aaron and the whole situation.  But people need to realise that they’re really playing around with offence. One minute it’s offensive because it’s Jeremys ally. The next it’s fine because the author hates Jeremy!   This cannot be right 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital precisely my point.  Last night whether they like it or not, they let the mask slip.  It appears to be the case that offence is taken depending on who’s said something.  Aaron’s comments were based on Mandelson own words - but they tried to pin AS on him🤷🏾‍♂️. Meanwhile Nazi are hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Exhibition B: Enuled rightly having to apologise for her stupid, holocaust belittling comments   Last night people who normally hound the likes of Aaron and Jeremy Corbyn were surprisingly silent. Some even came  to her defence because she’s not Jeremy or deemed “left”  Go figure  https://t.co/g3O0P6vMJz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Exhibition A: what Enuled said about Nazi officers 👮‍♀️  https://t.co/oqbxYIQJ3w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Also on a side note, I find it particularly telling that certain characters are out to hound Aaron for his factually correct statement (based on Mandelsons own words)- but last night were silent when Enuled said that she found Nazi gassers and murderers to have been very handsome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital I agree on that point. But I do frankly think everyone is jumping on Aaron for point score and ideological reasons - we have evidence from the horses mouth that say “I am not, and was ever raised as such” but to make a point against Aaron people are extrapolating&amp; reaching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon For a government that is exploring wave generators for the English Channel - I think they sleep pretty soundly! 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Yes but Mandelson has literally said he’s not - apart from when he’s pushed to be patriotic if the nation is apparently under attack. 🤷🏾‍♂️ As per attached  https://t.co/vEwv5ZYzjI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital I’m struggling to understand how we can have on one hand the man in question being asked to identify and he personally categorically setting the record straight, and when Aaron references the mans own words - that’s rubbished 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️... I mean what’s that about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital So the thing Ive heard about “only females pass down the “ethno” part is .... ?? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Also I don’t think Aaron was being antisemitic, Mandelson has on record rejected the label, so based on the mans own words - Aaron’s statement cannot be magnified to AS... anyway that’s my view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital So what’s this passage about ... where the man in question he isn’t? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I’m now actually confused - is he isn’t he?  https://t.co/I6AmpPbLUt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsobel @AaronBastani @jonah_o_ Am I actually seeing an MP at 00:39 tweeting and swearing much ado about nothing?!  Is this the extra work for which MPs are planning on getting a pay rise.  Alex definitely going down in my estimations, started the night he nodded to licence to kill🤔🤔  https://t.co/peByLgNyWZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Archimbaldo @HowUpsetting @AaronBastani So Mandelson saying he does not identify as such is not good enough? Lol - what an odd 2020 this year is ....   the man says I’m not (apart from when he wants to be patriotic), but society wants to placate a label he has seemingly himself refused🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔  Very odd indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian What took them so long? If they can suddenly pluck them out of Thin air in 2020 - what stopped them hiring them fairly and professionally all the past years?  I guess it’s one way of subtling admitting they’ve systematically been disenfranchising black peoples! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Lol okay 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/FcXtYJQR2Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Beg your pardon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willuminare People can have different opinions about the same problem - if you hadnt noticed - disagreements happen in a liberal democratic society.

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Do you know what- Im good, this conversation is beginning to drain the good vibes I had today  Let me go back to focusing on good vibes such as: #Bolivia having ousted a neonazi rightwing govrnmnt.  Labour debates are more draining than being stuck in quicksand. Have a good night  https://t.co/my01pxdiXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott I am not being cagey, I am being straight up with you - it is what it is - people said what they said, and I watched the election campaign.  I am not making up what I saw/remember - don't patronise/insult my intelligence. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Well... sorry for saying it how it was... I mean you do realise I was alive and adult enough to vote at the last election Dec2019, and I remember what certain high profile labour members who are Blairites said? Some advocated for TORIES, some LibDems, some even formed new parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @fjgm_ @lauren1995x__ Let me guess, is it worse than someone saying "Nazi concentration camp officers/murderers were 'handsome'?  I await confirmation and references to what was actually said. (and of course who said it and who is reacting to what was said).... Labour seems to be filled with tribalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Diane is relevant- because in case u forgot this entire debate is our reaction to what Diane said- which according to your initial tweet u disagree with. I happen to agree with what she said bcoz its also the conclusion I drew about NewLeadership.  Its nothing t do with tribalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Well Those 80 seats... Dismantling and peeling away at the factors would take far too long. But boy - Jeremy would have been far better than this Tory gov that many Blairites encouraged people to vote for instead of Jeremy.  Alas we are where we are. Tories to stay for time being  https://t.co/uFdsTN8fVJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott Hahaha   @HackneyAbbott bravo!  https://t.co/GWfs3thJrO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott There's nothing tribal about it:  Diane spoke her truth, and we saw the same thing she concluded.  Sorry it doesn't align with your perspective. The two contrasting views can co-exist.  In the words of IainDale: Why cant we all just get along  Lool  https://t.co/FAEUIZ3iW3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster @HackneyAbbott haha   You heard what she said:  Keir... HAD A PROJECT OF HIS OWN!  That's Diane's truth - and she's entitled to speak her truth.  Do you wish to cancel her sir?  https://t.co/Lj1YmIARMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DawnHFoster The meme of the night is actually:  @HackneyAbbott speak ur truth  The characters who preached SecondRef/PeoplesVotes/"We're going to form our own splinter group to undermine leadership etc" very quickly dropped brexit as soon as the stars aligned in their favour"  We see thru it  https://t.co/VMuiPu9LoO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Im here for the way she desperately tried to mince her words, but in the end decided: F**K this:  KEIR HAD A PROJECT OF HIS OWN!  And by god he did: remember all the threats from Keir/Thornberry/Lammy/Chuka et al "we're gonna form our own 2ndref/peoplevote" groups? @Keir_Starmer  https://t.co/nojQBFWWTu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight @lewis_goodall @BBCTwo Love the way #DianeAbbott really tried to mince her words "I.. think... thaaaat.....Keeii.... f**K this "KEIR HAD A PROJECT OF HIS OWN!🙃"  There I said it, come at me!🤷  Love it  @HackneyAbbott  -speak your truth. And for the record Diane we see it too! "2ndvote/PeopleVote😋😎"  https://t.co/twq9diPKlB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Love the way #DianeAbbott really tried to mince her words "I.. think..... thaaaaaat.....Keeii.... f**K this "KEIR HAD A PROJECT OF HIS OWN!"

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Anyone want to inform @MichaelPayneUK the very obvious: @HackneyAbbott said: "Keir is leader who won fair and square and he has a mandate now"  Also where was this energy when under Jeremy, it was operation "dismantle Jeremy" rather than "TheresaMay is our opponent" disingenuous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Is this debate still ongoing? Jesus He shouldn't have done it It came across disrespectful He didnt do it jokingly/banter - it was simply disrespectful. It may not be because she was a woman - however it doesn't change that it was crass!  Can we all just move on now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliMortell @Trickyjabs @PatriciaArceGu2 I remember seeing this video of her being humiliated and frankly tortured in public view by the rightwing neonazis that temporarily took over #Bolvia - so good to see the follow up and that her dignity has been restored!!  Viva #Bolvia  And best wishes to @PatriciaArceGu2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Never been to Bolivia, but after all this - i've educated myself on its cultural diversity.   Once covid is over, it's on my list of places to visit. A country and people that tells neonazis to do one, is definitely worth visiting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe I literally thought the same ... I’ve seen this video doing the rounds .... and I’m just like 🤔🤔 🙄🙄🤔🤔  Also when he said “from my white mum I got the “being on time skills” 🤔🤔🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/9bicRdEETR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Who throws away a notebook relating to a criminal investigation..... a CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION into how innocent people died in a preventable fire?!  Can someone tell me how this manager votes politically - that would be quite telling 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @melaniekmelvin Tell me about it - I don’t know why they make it so so complex ...  But in this hypothetical question I think 1a would be Pneumonia and 1b would be covid19  1c could be stuff such as diabetes, COPD, etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AissaCyiza @RwandaParliamnt @FrankHabineza @AissaCyiza - we salute you!   Rwose tubarize! Parliament yurwanda finalement imeze iki?  Role ya ba MPs is what exactly?

<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @melaniekmelvin (I think)  @edwardpoole1975 would that sequence order be right? Or have I got it wrong?   I often hate completing death certificates! What came first chicken or egg 😰🤷🏾‍♂️⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @melaniekmelvin @edwardpoole1975 is right on this one The covid19 led to the pneumonia and therefore both would be on the death certificate. The real question that you’re asking is: in what order would covid19 and pneumonia appear on the certificate? Pneumonia caused the death, covid contributed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @pc_notwiz @Nigel_Farage Are people still going on about this? Haven’t we all seen that the vicar of the church provided more details about the incident - and Farage and his cult are whipping up imaginary flames🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Lastly noone supports crime/vandalism, if the church wants to press charges they would⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Yes agreed, calling someone out doesn't necessarily mean we hate/dislike them, it's simply saying "Look I agree with &gt;50% of what you say/believe in - but on this point: WTF were you thinking? That's not okay!"  Both sides of the divide need to learn to reprimand their mates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Yeah - This had me feeling the same way. First line of the tweet, i thought .... hmm okay?  Then the last 2 sentences, I thought: hmm... 🧐 WTF.  I get it she's pissed off at state of UK politics, we all are. But wars to remove governments - I dont think that's ever gonna happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzoozSueco @Healer1official @NadiaKabalira Ngo 'collateral' victims? COLLATERAL? COLLATERAL???  Wow   Speechless kabisa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrbartington @OxfordshireCC Gutted to hear this- I dont even know you in person, nor do I live in Oxford -but you strike me as someone who's truly decent and passionate about better transport all round - cycling much included. Shame that you've felt the need to relinquish yourself from the role! Best wishes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I am at the moment of being like, "Do you know what??.... Let the Tories give it to them🤷🤔" - a particular age group voted for this government and its ideology.  We are all now shafted with 1) corruption from above like never before, 2) cuts everywhere 3) extreme rightwingism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evoespueblo @eddygraham39 It is good to see that there are some people who are not easily bought by fake promises from destabilising western foreign powers. Unfortunately not all 'recurrent' victims of imperialism across the world (esp Africa/Middle East) have learnt this lesson.  Congrats #Bolivia 🇧🇴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBeigeSirKeir You forgot ViktorOrban 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Nigel_Farage Couldn’t agree more!  It’s quite astonishing that someone who’s actions and ideology couldn’t be further removed from what Jesus taught in the bible that Farage alleges to believe in ... is the one shouting from the hilltops “omg omg omg our religion/ culture”   Absolute gaslight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Hi Nigel Farage - quick question: When was the last time you went to church? When was the last time you helped the poor, when was the last time you donated to the church, when was the last time you went to confessions?   Oh and before I forget: Nigel how’s the Kent coast today?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamyoung Bills that breach human rights couldnt do it. home office who wants to build wave generators to drown immigrants couldnt do it  Craziest thing about all this- as the tories popularity grows- one at some point has t realise: tories are VOTED in.

<|startoftext|>@JohnFielder1 @lordofintent Immensely better.  The healthcare system NHS already has expertise in contact tracing - we’ve been doing it for decades for notifiable diseases.

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Jeremy corbyn congratulates #Bolvia ... @Andrew_Adonis - Tony Blair’s pet jackRusselTerrior starts barking a load of bollox  (In the process maligns all Bolivians who voted against rightwing neoNazis of Bolivia)  A few moments the same Adonis tries to congratulate Bolivia  Twat🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/olBiLe86OB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @YasminQureshiMP @StevePeers see above 👆🏽👆🏽 I’ve retracted my statement when Patrick highlighted to me the sequence of events.  https://t.co/59nXazucMY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeanineAnez How much of Bolivian democracy did you have in mind when .... you ascended to power via a coup?   FYI: Illegal coups are not democratic means of gaining power....  However, well done for having respect for the election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ayeshahazarika @ShaunBaileyUK this is pathetic!  And learn to use less apostrophes and more complete compound sentences! Bloody hell!   This looks like a year 5 project!   Also you need a life - stop dreaming of @SadiqKhan 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @BorisJohnson Frankly #JohnSentamu might as well reject it - this is an insult.  What we needed confirming is that Boris and his government are wholly racist! That’s the moral of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster Moreover - I want to know what #claireFox has done for the diverse population of the UK to merit a peerage — ahead of #JohnSentamu ?  Someone please provide evidence and references to how ClaireFox and KateHoey have done exceptionally more than John.   I await 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Nerd_CB @edwardpoole1975 What we have in Britain today is a media whether it’s Television or radio - that is largely sympathetic to conservatives.  The current conservatives are vocally and secretly rightwing than they’ve ever displayed publicly before.  The tories are allied to Trump/ViktorOrban 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Nerd_CB @edwardpoole1975 Indeed and who whips up the trumpian cult behaviour?  LBC - all their prime hour slots are manned by rightwing presenters: Ferrari, IainDale, AndrewPrice (and FYI LBC has a record for having hired KatieHopkins and Farage)  TalkRADIO: Julia and MikeGraham (he’s vile) 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nkureddy @IGIHE This was my question! Ko bitera hejuru binunuba, ubusanzwe babona ibyo bavuga bifite ubuziranenge bwuzuye 100/100?   Wapi ❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialSimon_B @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson Hahaha oh yes Farage garage in Kent! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nerd_CB @PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 Exactly!  It’s only water off a ducks back because Boris is enabled by the media.  When you have a whole proxy radio media that is now largely rightwing (LBC, TalkRADIO) etc. And a low-key biased bbc - you end up with ALL tories being like water off ducks back smooth🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoubleDownNews Yikes the most striking thing I saw in this video which is extremely painful is that the division is: WHITE (fairer) skin rightWingism vs local native indigenous peoples - absolutely disgusting!  And to think USA UK et al were all in bed with the “whiter fairer skin” neoNazis🤢❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson Hey Nigel Farage - quick question mate:  How’s the Kent coast looking today? Any dinghies ⛵️ yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 Haha lol  Well to be fair I meant dramas such as “Boris sweeps with Acuri while still married and whilst courting his current fiancé - and then pays Acuri off with massive business grant”  Or “Boris writes material suggest Africa needs second coming of colonialism” etc. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 She may have had charisma of a dying cat, but she was to a large extent ditched by the media.. in fairness to her apart from “my fave pastime is running in wheat field” she didn’t have many other dramas. Meanwhile Boris- media deliberately failed to scrutinise🤫. Only Jeremy was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @RURA_RWANDA You are spot on here! What some countries have done to mitigate this issue is that the government has relaxed tax collections from businesses which means the businesses can afford to keep prices low. Issue in Rwanda - leta wants to continue business as usual🤷🏾‍♂️. That’s the problem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist Yep indeed  This is how you end up with historians such as #Starkey doing his utmost to malign and gaslight black people: calling them “damned” black people, who apparently wouldn’t survive if they went to Africa (but white man can survive there to make money) yeh right🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCkatyaadler @cjfaraway At least they’re honest - meanwhile in England - the government is promoting Brexit backing uselessness into House of Lords .... whilst the virus turns into an avalanche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist I get u now- and I agree with the interconnectedness - evil learns from evil!  Britain has been let off the hook because they’ve also been the historians of their own history! It’s a bit like when MPs used to be the arbiter of their pay rise!   They’ve photoshopped history🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dushpofficial25 @Allenkab3 @RURA_RWANDA Sha erega the answer to this is simple- Leta/ubutegetsi bumenyere abaturage “bakira” sans question!

<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist Britain had a much farther reach in their evil. Britain looted, killed, exploited for centuries. They stopped one form of evil slavetrade becoz apparently “they’d learnt that black people were not commodity” only to return under a different guise (colonialism) to repeat the evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist Glad we agree- Britain did a lot worse.   Im in no doubt Japan was a whole lot of crazy- but lets not be in doubt or try to gaslight by juxtaposing Britain’s evil next to japan in order to minimise Britain’s role. They need to be considered separately for their separate evils👎🏾❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist So in conclusion Britain vs Japan - who did the worst?  Who spread their evil deeds all over the world and pretty much left scars on &gt;50% of the worlds countries ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 @RURA_RWANDA Apotre uzibere politician man- wenda you can actually do some real representation!  Can everyone believe ko apart from ONE MP/politician Habineza- all other members of Parliament are just chilling? No words on a woman beater being appointed  No words on #RURA4TransportFairness 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist Did japan colonise practically parts of every continent, redrew borders, mutilated natives, renamed their nations after their countrymen such as “Rhodes for Rhodesia”? They impose their language on natives? Profited from transporting slaves for centuries?   ?? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JujuLaBelle Lol there’s a lot that needs to be ended - not just #RURA4TransportFairness   You being cancelled and silenced by the mob that came for your jugular recently for having an opinion needs to also be cancelled! The way you were hounded and told not to question authority is NOT ok❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HistoryPolitico @mehdirhasan Right ... I remember at the beginning where This doctor would stand next to trump and watch/listen to trump make false statements about the virus - he would not correct the errors - sorry about the reality is: Fauci played along with trump. The damage was done on his watch🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADreamComeTru4 @mehdirhasan Most people who do not have this doctors accolades could read thru trump way back before he became present.  It’s not just the narcissism, the greed, it’s everything else: the culture wars, the antiblack racism, the nodding to ProudBoys , KKK and the like - could he not see it?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serialTweeper @RURA_RWANDA Hari explanation yatanze which makes no sense Kandi shows that the increases are in favour of abashoramari. Ati &lt;bus going muhanga umuntu aviriyemo kamonyi, bus company yahomba, rero usigaye muri bus must cover cost” this is stupid! RURA Barashaka gutuburira abashoramari🤷🏾‍♂️😂❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan He initially enjoyed the ride whilst he was gaslighting the population about covid...  Did he not have an insight into how insane trump and his gangs are?  He should have kindly rejected the role frankly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman Well, thats messed up. You wont catch that coming from me, thats for certain. My history curriculum was on: Nazi Germany, Civil rights USA, Stalinist Russia, at 6th i covered Mao's china - There was absolutely NOTHING attractive/handsome about murderers. Nothing. Nada. Rien. Zero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman If I saw the thirsting, I would be as critical as I have been about Enuled who is supposed to be Holocaust history ambassador thirsting over 6ft tall Nazi gassers/murderers.  Why would anyone thirst over someone who murdered millions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman But that is the point - the apology has been largely accepted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman Of course, who has said they don't accept it?  People are commenting in broader sense- in which world is it OK to say things like "Omg, Reinhard Heydrich was so gorgeous at 6ft5 tall and blue eyes"  It's belittling the events that happened. I dont think AnnaFrank would agree❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman No-one has refused her apology - stop reaching and assuming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe I’m just curious about the way Tories read through the possible candidates:  #claireFox - White - “does she support Brexit?” .. yes! “Omg great, peerage wooo 🥳   #KateHoey - white? Brexit? Yes yes - wooo 🥳 “peerage”  #JohnSentamu  - is he white? Nope Black🤨... that’s a NO!🇬🇧❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @supergutman @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @ElunedAnderson Did I say you were?  https://t.co/Qt0nP6FoOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @supergutman @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @ElunedAnderson Yes Aryan Nazi, who unleashed nothing but terror, murder &amp; heartache to people he deemed to be "Untermenschen"  Personally, his murderous achievements outweigh any redeeming features (his height, hair and eye colour arent redeeming). And Enuled commented not as a German of 1930s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @supergutman @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @ElunedAnderson Reinhard Heydrich was NOT charismatic and attractive.   He was a tall skinny freak who engaged in mass murder of Europeans based on their race/religion/sexuality   That’s the history and truth of the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @supergutman @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @ElunedAnderson My concluding remark will be the image attached:  From the horses mouth: “nothing can happen until we unite together to end all forms of racism - it can’t be cherrypicked”  Emphasis on “cherrypicked”  Good night all!  Ps: Nazi gassers/killers aren’t hot/handsome- they’re monsters  https://t.co/1wa8QUa4OS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScaryNewDad @supergutman @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Im simply flabbergasted by all the acts of Ignorance that I am witnessing this evening.  We get it: she might be someone you normally like, she might be deep down an ally - HOWEVER let’s get something absolutely clear:  Joking that Nazi killers/gassers were “handsome” is NOT OK❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supergutman @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Are we really putting it up for debate whether glorifying Nazis handsomeness is offensive &amp; belittling of the Holocaust that was orchestrated by Nazis in 1930-40s?  REALLY?  Do we really think that as Jews were offloaded from train carriages they thought: OMG Look how hot he is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrGoodallday @PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson It's literally deflection tactic.   Right on cue comes in FalconMalters to retweet her drivel, to create volume.  NOT working of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Dont even engage with her deflection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baker_Reports @RURA_RWANDA Why did you put leta and abashoramari separately? Leta ntago igira abantu bari members of government/party who are business people?  This poll is inaccurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Apparently by having a wry smile on a photograph, you belittled all those who lost their lives... more so than a person who said the killers/gassers were utterly gorgeous!   Let that sink in. Appaz glorifying the Nazi (who apparently rose bcoz they're handsome💪👍) is chill😎.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Translation: "Omg look look look guys, look, he smiled in that photo - how bad is that guys? Look look! Omg guys he smiled at a memorial museum... see guys, this is the real crime: smiling in a photo.  He smiled in a photo outside a memorial museum! OMG OMG  JeezLouise!🧐🤷🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @MrGoodallday @ElunedAnderson Haha - okay - keep your hair on lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Lol - now being hungover is equivalent to glorifying nazis - give up. seriously   It is getting extremely desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson This is the astonishing part, in her determined effort to defend Enuled- she's failed to recognise the issue at hand which is: BELITTLING of the holocaust - which is (from what i know and hear/read)- antisemitic.  The 'darn handsome' officers: gassed/killed with impunity get it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrGoodallday @ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Its utterly bizarre.  I'm just speechless. She's tried to tell me that its normal to google 'handsome Stalin/Nazis' - apparently she's surprised I've never done it.  Who genuinely sits and starts googling "Handsome Mao/Stalin/Nazis/RobertMugabe/IdiAmin/Mussolini/SlavetradeMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson People tend to apologise when they've made colossal mistakes worthy of an apology   In your own words its quite 'peculiar and telling' that Eluned sees the grave errors she made - whilst you're out here defending the mistakes.  https://t.co/Lf3BYjXYz1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Want to educate me what a trope is Pigeon Feathers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrGoodallday @PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Its crazy to think that a measured response like this from @MrGoodallday is being jumped on, because we're not all fanning over their lead girl Enuled and her transphobic/ antisemetic tropes.  Any trope is unacceptable, but when its accidentally from their friends: "but but but"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScaryNewDad @PigeonFeatherz @MrGoodallday @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Thank you @ScaryNewDad - indeed Antisemitism, (any other type of racism) is WRONG, today, yesterday, tomorrow, ALWAYS.  It is quite extraordinary that one has to remind people of this fact:  RACISM/DISCRIMINATION is wrong. Gaslighting/belittling historical events is also WRONG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson What you're looking for is: A statement can be stupid, unacceptable &amp; extremely offensive. Considering Nazis killed jews &amp; others they considered 'subhuman' mercilessly, I dont think any victim of the Nazis would consider her comment 'okay'.   If you disagree thats ur choice🤷🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Peculiar and telling? How insightful and observant.  Well, we've also observed Enuled's stupid comment that is not remotely acceptable. But of course you're hear to tell us otherwise. Appaz its normal to google "handsome Stalin/Nazi officers" in one's spare time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Hmm ariko rero FirstDaughter rwose hano arakabije - Imana se ijonjora abo iha imigisha?  I thought Jesus came for the good and the bad? and he blessed them all, and he even forgave prostitutes?   Ibi ndumva atari fair kabisa.  Blessed sunday to everyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson You just said people will say things like 'handsome stalin' as tacit support for Stalinism ....  And we had Enuled declaring her lust for Nazi handsome officers.... I mean you said it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson I'm yet to be exposed to 'handsome stalin' On social media - and I have been on it for a few years now  Today is the first day i was exposed to "handsome nazi officers"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson So Eluned was showing 'tacit' support for Nazism then!  🤷  Great, there we are then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Do you know what, I have not ever thought "do you know what would be a great activity? Lets google images Nazi soldiers and young stalin" - so yes, you can be surprised to hear, I have not sat and thought "lets google handsome stalin"   But yeah, great to hear what u get up to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Lol okay Pigeon feathers.  Lets go back to you educating us on how Nazis handsomeness was their appeal to the German population.  References please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @ScaryNewDad @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson I've not met any yet, when I do I will react similarly to as I did when I heard that someone thinks the Nazi lads were bloody stunning!   If you've got any twitter profiles stating how bloody handsome stalin wasthat you want to signpost, please do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson .... hmm let me get this straight: the Nazi officers rose because of their handsomeness? The women and men were so taken by their beauty, they relished more?  And in 2020, lets admire how utterly stunning they were? How they were all so ripped &amp; utterly delightful to have in bed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Your suspicions are thoroughly misplaced...  There’s nothing attractiveness or handsome about a mass murderer.   Sorry but I don’t flex like that. But we’re all different.   What do you rank Stalin then? I’ve heard Stalin was pretty decent when he was in his 20s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Kudos to you and Enuled who see beyond the victims of genocide and see how 10/10 the murderous lads were on a scale of 1-10 to bang or not to bang! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Kudos 👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson Alright - nice to know you have dreams about the handsome men who murdered people in your immediate family tree.   Each to their own fix I guess.   How fit were they on a scale of 1/10?  Kiss/snug/marry?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ each to their absolute own! You crack on pet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PigeonFeatherz @Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson When I last went to Berlin and visited a concentration camp, and I saw the gas chambers, the glasses stolen from Jewish people, the hair cut from Jewish people to dehumanise them, the harrowing stories of kids split from parents- NOT one Nazi office appeared “handsome/gorgeous”❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy I want to know how and in what capacity #ClaireFox and KateHoey have done more than #JohnSentamu for the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 especially in the last 10-20years  Dear Britain please explain: 10marks - extra marks available for evidence and references<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrc1921 Are you for real - that’s the same Eluned ?!  I’m done 🤯🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Falcon_Malteser @ElunedAnderson “Nazi officers are darn handsome!” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Meanwhile cheerleaders be like “it’s alright pet, you did and said nothing wrong!! Cheer for Eluned! Give me E L U N E D! Wooo 🥳... who do we appreciate? Handsomely officers woo🤷🏾‍♂️  Really?  I see antisemitism has taken a new form now🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElunedAnderson Regional Ambassador for .......#Holocaust affairs?....   AMBASSADOR??? 🤔🤔  Also same ambassador be like “nazi officers were Handsome”🥳🥳🥳?   😰🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/xhgBFwGKfy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @TovaOBrien It would would be great if part of the Brexit new trade deal negotiations included trading her for the whole British MSM - LauraK, Peston, whole LBC cast, JuliaHB etc. We’d love to trade the lot of them (and more) for just that one presenter!   Absolutely well done @TovaOBrien 👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoozUK Where can we find news reports like her please?  We will trade: #LauraK, Peston, JuliaHB, the whole LBC cast... and more just for that one presenter!

<|startoftext|>@epidemic27 @AaronBastani @DavidHirsh Tell me about 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @Xavi_Jp_Legacy @Allenkab3 Hmmm that’s an interesting question take.  Gusa I don’t see what they’re blocking... every desired state policies passes through unamended- and it always has painful consequences on the population.  Nzaba ndeba amaherezo of their tactic - Gusa for now it appears unproductive 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xavi_Jp_Legacy @ramaisibo @Allenkab3 Mbaza nkubaze nshuti. They call it opposition for the benefit of telling western powers “hey look at us👋🏽👋🏽 we have women and opposition in government... we are a lovely democracy... keep donations coming please 😊. Thanks 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @Allenkab3 If there’s opposition - based on the policies that get put through and no challenge - the opposition must be “in name only” because they are absent from the scene.  They’re mute. And must be secretly part of the government, and only call themselves opposition for fun and jokes❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @Allenkab3 Can we also add- what is happening is SYMPTOMATIC of a country with single party rule, where there’s no genuine opposition voice to say “Hold on a minute is this decision/policy right? We challenge it in XYZ grounds”  Over last few days citizens have been doing job of opposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyLucasBhana Lool😂  British people: U really need to leave #JacindaAdern and people like #AOC all the way alone because they’re not equivalent to your game playing politicians -who promise one thing, when in position of power do another.

<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani Did he really compare,  1) “give me a million and I’ll find filth on Jeremy”-Ryan  2) elevated BMI disingenuous Gapes   To #jacindaardern ??

<|startoftext|>@DavidHirsh @SenorGomez22 Don’t insult #jacindaardern   Did you just equate an elevated BMI disingenuous Gapes and “give me a million and I’ll expose Jeremy... Ryan”...  to Jacinda?

<|startoftext|>@PaulCharisse @celtjules66 No because when someone nods at a bill that breaches human rights- they definitely won’t be bothered about poor children being failed by capitalism.   Also wasn’t it Keirs labour looking to attract big money donors?   So definitely NOTv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 And that you can win - without wooing racists by abstaining on bills that put into jeopardy human rights of those who are victims of your nations military ...  Take note #keirStarmer - your NewLeadership bollox isn’t the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ardfarna51 @Nigel_Farage @realDonaldTrump Lol okay McNama  Thanks for the lifestory about the 1970s.  We’re in 2020 and black peoples still face discrimination. And there are people running from bombs 💣 and persecution.  My concern is the safety of people who in 2020 are still facing problems!   No time for bigots🤷🏾‍♂️💪🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big up @junesarpong on the @LBC @DavidLammy show right now!   Good comments on #BlackHistoryMonth and good take on the passerby “antiracists” who are actually in the end complicit in their inaction and silence!   👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 I second this!   And can we also learn to agree to disagree without calling each other enemies of governments. Murakoze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Yeah as a I said there are some nasty deranged characters out there! Ideologically driven, full of hate and disregard for opposing ideology- mind you it’s on both side - from my observation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ardfarna51 @Nigel_Farage @realDonaldTrump Arghghghgh   Look it’s a dinghy ⛵️ with the people who are of the Islam faith..  Arghghhhh I’m so scared! The mother and child running away from Yemen/Syria desperate for safety and shelter make me feel sooo scared!   Arghhh help, Farage help, INGERland needs you🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Also i think a lot of it is to spite Keir and his cheerleaders... some of whom frankly are nasty. Saw someone recently glorifying blasting Iraqis .... as part of their anti-left rant 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌  There’s vile characters out there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Haha yeah you’re right - I’ve seen that too... I think it’s a symptom of lefties being like “God why does everyone’s opposition seem better than ours” - it’s almost an envy thing ... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ (I think)  Also it might be a sign that people aren’t as “leftie” as they’re labelled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Like you I’m also curious to see how she uses her mandate - she has the power to potentially go rogue and do a Boris/Cummings - i.e - absolutely wreck those she is ideologically opposed to. I pray and hope she doesn’t take a leaf from Boris/trump type of characters😪😪🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I dont kno much on NewZealand politics to comment on which side of Keir she stands- BUT purely based on limited observation -her handling of white racism, her support for non-white NewZealanders, her rhetoric- she doesn’t strike me as someone who would abstain on human rights🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @doloreselee We won’t and we don’t even need to- because we’re better!  Also they hate us taking ownership of our history and narrative because the word “Compensation/ Reparations” sends shivers down their spines!   They want to continue wearing the crowns and diamonds with blissful ignorance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I think the left of politics are just elated that she didn’t seemingly have to woo racists to win... she didn’t have to abstain important questions to win over decent people 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Hence the contrast with Britain’s Labour Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @doloreselee Of course they dont, they start the whole “but now the world seems to be turning against us, now we’re being made to feel scared”🤷🏾‍♂️ Made to feel scared in a country still run by rich white men!? Really?  They literally see BLM as a threat because it puts us on a par with them🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Also ... perhaps because she just gets on with it? - Gun terrorism in New Zealand against Muslim community by a white racist - she got on top of it, and started gun reforms - meanwhile other white nations be like “we’re least racist/ he was just a kid🤷🏾‍♂️” - COVID-19 handling💪🏽✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liam040404 @Keir_Starmer @jacindaardern @nzlabour I’ll ask again:   What does JC have to do with labour ABSTAINING from voting against a bill that breaches human rights?   Has JC cast a spell that induces paralysis of arms and legs?   What was the spell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @doloreselee Dont get me started on the “get over it/ it was centuries ago” broken records from racists or white people who aren’t racist but can’t face the reality of what their ancestors did:  I always remind them- APARTHEID (politics of antiblack racism) were alive and kicking in 1994🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liam040404 @Keir_Starmer @jacindaardern @nzlabour So what’s JC got to do with the fact that NewLeadership abstained from a licence to kill bill?!  Tell me what that has got to do with JC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feeldalove168 @doloreselee It’s actually mad - I’ve just done a quick google 1855 - that was mid Victorian era - which is NOT that long time ago!  To think that theoretically less than 2-3 generations ago black peoples were on the same bar as donkeys/ bulls/ cats and dogs is actually heartbreaking! 😪🤯😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liam040404 @Keir_Starmer @jacindaardern @nzlabour Yeah it would have passed - so more of a reason that they should have made it clear they do NOT endorse a licence to kill bill by voting against the wretched thing.  Alas they whipped to nod along.  Oh it’s Jeremy corbyn fall that labour abstained? I recall JC saying the contrary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liam040404 @Keir_Starmer @jacindaardern @nzlabour Did she put wave generators in the sea? No she didn’t.   Did she nod at a licence to kill bill of human beings - last time I checked she hadn’t.  Controlling immigration and licence to kill are rather very different.   Immigration into a nation always needs to be controlled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doloreselee @feeldalove168 Sickening 🤢🤢  That’s made me skin shudder<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @jacindaardern @nzlabour FYI for the attention of #NewLeadership of the opposition in Britain - #jacindaardern won because she didn’t sit on her rear end abstaining from bills that breach human rights !   And she’s not wooing racists and Xenophobes neither!   You might want to take a leaf from her book🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsobel Just a quick hint:  #jacindaardern doesnt “abstain” -when she needed to take control of gun laws in #NewZealand  - she did so with conviction and steadfastness!  I haven’t seen Jacinda championing bills that breach human rights- perhaps @alexsobel you want to pass that on to Keir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha In that one speech #jacindaardern has wiped the floor with racist #trump who “tears” communities apart! And clown Boris who just hasn’t got a bloody clue!

<|startoftext|>@mcsweeney_harry It shouldn’t be.... but under #Newleadership - as long as your loyal to #Bossycop and keen on abstaining - you can offend/malign anyone who’s got a dark colour tone, a religion that is not Jewish or perhaps Christianity, to hell with trans people etc.   In conclusion it’s a mess<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m going to say it:   I’d vote for @AndyBurnhamGM in a heartbeat!  He doesn’t make me question my vote, he doesn’t make me stutter or dither in saying I’d like a labour win! And he strikes the right note and cord whenever he speaks!   Perhaps #NewLeadership is needed after all🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timpetherick @AngelaRayner She’s shameless!  Im at the stage where, I’m so sick of Trojan horses in the name of #NewLeadership that If the tories win again and rid us of them, it would be equal evil of all evil anyway! Clearly the only thing that will remove these charlatans will be the tories. The irony😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mukhtar_yassin Some of us saw the writing on the wall from the very start.

<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Let’s guess - you’ll abstain on this too?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 Haha   Then they hailed him as forensic ... yeah 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ turns out he needs to forensically investigate why the party is paralysed and unable to win the argument against DomCummings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnAmaechi @kay_hallsworth It hurt me so much - it made me physically nauseous - and this was in my birth nation in east Africa!   They couldn’t understand why black villagers with no shoes had not come out to drum and dance for them. Their expectations were “not met” 🤢🤢🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kay_hallsworth @JohnAmaechi The privilege is deep and visceral! It’s like a tumour that is permanently adhered in peoples mentality and character. People innocently perceive themselves to be above others subconsciously. We are sadly living in the afterlife of those people who normalised racism/inequality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kay_hallsworth @JohnAmaechi Good point!💡  I now understand what you &amp; @JohnAmaechi are saying!   It’s going to be a long journey! I’m african by heritage, went to Africa on holiday last year, overhead a European family moaning “where are the African villagers to dance and drum for us”🤷🏾‍♂️people aren’t ready<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 @pnyirishema And this is what i said yesterday @Allenkab3 -remember when I said “they want to milk a cow for ever MORE milk even during drought?” -RURA iti “nutanga service haribyo asabwa”- leta needs to relax its tax collections, then transport companies can relax costs! BUT NO: leta wants💰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnAmaechi @kay_hallsworth I think the point Im making is: a good proportion of us recognise that equality for all does not hurt anyone- but I fear we’re being too pragmatic/optimistic  There are people sat somewhere suddenly questioning what will happen to their privilege once it’s a level playing field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @VAR_ikaze @Allenkab3 @RURA_RWANDA @RwandaTrade @SenateofRwanda @RwandaCDeputies @KabandaBertin @rrainfo Sha 🤢🤢❌ - biteye agahinda!

<|startoftext|>@kay_hallsworth @JohnAmaechi It does when certain people have been thriving on racial superiority complex &amp; VIP treatment for centuries.

<|startoftext|>@KatyJayne101 So first it was “take back control of borders” then it was “take back control of our courts”... then it was “take back control of our fish”....then Boris took control and handed it to DomCunmings, Farage got relegated to Kent coast spy, and now its “take back control of money”😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Honore_murenzi @rutembessa @Sunston57868012 @BlaiseMuhumuza @davidbalinda14 That what Im thinking - za bots 🤖 ndabona zasaze on here trying to twist the situation..ntamuntu wari waexplaininga impamvu abicanyi bavugaga mukinyarwanda! “Ryama ryama” is the classic phrase used by adults when punishing kids on the floor- banyarwanda we have all been here❌‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @LonzenRugira Culture is an important thing that should normally be a force for positive evolution and integration and unifying of a community.

<|startoftext|>@GMB @JohnAmaechi @CharlotteHawkns @kategarraway Not sure what’s viral about what he said .... pretty much everyone has been saying this “better opportunities for X race does not mean disadvantage for the race that was already advantaged” ... but hey, if it takes @JohnAmaechi to get the same tired point across - fine! #BLM 🤷🏾‍♂️💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat I have no respect for ANY MP who fell for the “we will aggressively pursue amendments”...have they not seen the “aggressiveness” used in the commons and what it produced?   For those who want reminding it produced: SOD ALL and Keir still whipped to abstain!  Idiots! Idiots ❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stubie81 @Steve_J_Barrett @MarcusRashford The lunacy of his tweet🤢  An adult (idiot) sees Marcus asking gov to ensure children are properly fed.... he then engages with the tweet to say “you’re focusing too much on ensuring children are fed... what about kicking a ball for 90mins!?i prefer when you are kicking a ball”🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baker_Reports @RwandaAgri It means there’s major corruption in Rwanda that has previously gone unchecked for years because the country has a media that is generally about “clap clap 👏🏻, questions never to be asked in case we get arrested/stopped”.  Also it shows the consequences of having mediocre media🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @Gabriel_Pogrund The POWER of the MEDIA and NARRATIVE!🤷🏾‍♂️❌ When this was happening to Jeremy: not only did it become BREAKING NEWS on virtually every channel BBC included, the media narrative was “Jeremy MUST go”. But now that the right/centrists have their man, it’s “Keir is cleansing💪🏻👏🏻💪🏻👏🏻”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dani1987CBLM @jameswjacobs @siennamarla That’s essentially what they did ....   The standard we choose to walk past is the standard we accept, therefore abstaining is agreement.  I.e. If you walk past a child crying because you’ve just seen him/her fall over, and you don’t bother to stop to check, you’re a useless.❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 @Kayitareeddy2 To be honest ntanubwo issue ari isaha, cyangwa mutzig, ikibazo ni absence de consideration pour les peuples rwandais qui souffre de faim (French yanjye namanegeka ariko I tried).

<|startoftext|>@LauraSmithCrewe @MorganPaulett For apparently MANY of them (as evidenced by the votes tonight)   Politics is not about doing the right thing, it’s not about representing the constituents, it’s not about standing up for human rights ... it’s about a weird obsession with a given leader (messiah) - disgusting❌🗑<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 Tonight confirms to me that voting labour under NewLeadership is unfortunately a no!   @CarolineLucas better work on PR because I need an alternative party to vote for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PanopticonGaze Under normal circumstances I’d vote for labour in a heartbeat because the tories are despicable.... but under the Forensic #NewLeadership - I’m afraid it’s looking like  a no  https://t.co/lvZlS6woJM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBerryComedy @JoshBerryComedy can you please do something for how absolutely shit #KeirStarmer is? Please? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mab_Taliesin @jameswjacobs @siennamarla Totally - if something is wrong, and you see it and walk past it, you’re as bad as the person causing the injustice!  So #KeirStarmer abstaining is complicity - we might as well all vote tories because at this rate there is absolutely no opposition! None! #Newleadership shambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla What concessions are needed?   Bloody hell - the answer is rather simple   DO NOT VOTE for this damned Bill!   What is wrong with this NewLeadership stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 More importantly how’s the “Forensic #NewLeadership” going? The leadership that forensically hires illegal war worshippers 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I’d love to hear more about how it’s going by the cheerleaders<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DanCardenMP @viewsfromleft @DawnButlerBrent But why do we even want to be in this situation?

<|startoftext|>@Scouse_Nous How did that very normal and professional comment get your blocked .... that Rosie woman has a problem with reality and modern society!   She genuinely isn’t suitable for the role of “representation”  And for those defending her - labour is a mess if she represents anyone’s views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnandWrites I want her to be my aunty! Hahaha savage and on point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCardenMP As more people rightly come out in his support, on reflection I think Im reaching here BUT: How dissimilar will UK be to USA and the whole #HarryDunn &amp; #annesacoolas drama if UK votes for a bill that provides amnesty to wrongdoings? @viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @DawnButlerBrent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @TheNorthernEcho @GavinHaveryEcho @RespectIsVital  is this your story!?😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Just making sure the references are up to date 😊😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@broseph_stalin Haha the Scandinavian “folklore” bit got me! The characters that are always located far away from the castle within which a good prince/King lives. The characters dressed in disheveled attire, torn boots, mould on face, biting off from a whole baguettes with unclean hands😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DanCardenMP It’s puzzling indeed.  It’s puzzling, annoying, infuriating and just arghghhghgh 😰😰😪  Some of us desperately want to vote anything but Tory and he’s making us question ourselves - that’s not ideal to be frank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DanCardenMP Exactly! And that is the point I have been reflecting on and trying to articulate.  The issue is: WHY are these errors/poor judgements happening in the first place.   As I said; when you juxtapose the appointment next to the ongoing abstentions on licence to kill bill🤷🏾‍♂️NOT GOOd❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EtonOldBoys Lol and despite all of those qualities  He somehow  1) abstains on every Tory bill that suggests breach of international human rights  2) appoints an individual who glorifies the blowing up and maiming of Iraqis ..  Suddenly he’s not all that “more thoughtful/ better briefed”😂❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DanCardenMP My biggest quarm with everything that is going on is that these errors or miscalculations/ poor judgements are happening in first place: 1) why would you abstain on Tory bills that promote abuses of human rights? 2) why do you appoint a war glorifier?  It shouldn’t be happening❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DanCardenMP Haha 😂 (don’t hold the breath mind.....) the wait might be longer than we wish it to be - based on past events and experiences anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @toadmeister @joymorrissey @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Hello racist, how’s it going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Can @UKLabour and its MPs be reminded that: voting this unacceptable Bill down does not mean you’re voting against UK, nor does it mean the bill goes away into blackhole, it means governmnt has to reconsider and make changes! The same way TMay deal had to change when voted down🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa ** notifications activated ** malgre que ndibube ndi kukazi... ndemera mbe distracted kabisa!  This better be a good one ☝🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews But I thought you were part of the bandwagon that told us the #NewLeadership was forensic and exactly what we needed?  The forensicness results in hiring of war-lovers like #AnitaClarke, and the loss of principled people like @DanCardenMP -how do you square that circle ⭕️?   🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCardenMP @PatrickWDixon ... behold 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  What do you think of this development?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryCrosbie5 @DanCardenMP Thanks for the added info, I like him even more now!  Where have such good men and women gone? People who remain true to why they went to politics? People who aren’t for sale? Who aren’t donkeys chasing carrots?  What differentiates NewLeadership from tories today?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCardenMP Didnt kno u prior to this- I do now. Its important to kno people who are steadfast in defending what is RIGHT and be willing to sacrifice promotion and favour in preference for justice!  Bravo👏🏾 @DanCardenMP -we are all observant and we salute your decision!  Shame on the party❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @danieltomsdad 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔 - have you seen this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ @TheMendozaWoman I’m here for the final part of your tweet, she was selected IN SPITE OF of her very known and public views, that is the take home message. Her being removed was a CONSEQUENCE of us being too vocal to the point that we become disruptive to the LOTO, her removal was not their wish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IanDunt friends who have contrasting opinions is normal/healthy. But it depends on what topics u happen to disagree and to what extend u disagree  Moreover friendship is supposed to be enriching, not draining or destructive. Disagreement on art, is not equal to disagreement on racism etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Hey @AngelaRayner how’s the appointment of #NitaClarke going?   Yes that same individual who relishes the opportunity to see Iraqis blown up into dust.... that one selected by Mr Forensic?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Exactly! Bari kudufata nkabana bo muri gardienne!   Umwana wambura ikaramu ya bic ukamuha crayon yavunutse ukamubeshya ngo “akira mwana wa, komeza ushoshanye 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾- bravo mbega dessin nziza cyane... wooow”😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie @Gabriel_Pogrund They’re revealing their inner ideology through the way they’re commenting on this latest Forensic failure by the forensic 🤷🏾‍♂️ I suppose we shouldn’t be entirely surprised they’d rather promote people who relish the opportunity to see Iraqis bombed to dust🤷🏾‍♂️. This new labour is ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiserisaa Meanwhile - you’ve got a new follower!   I’m reflecting on Dec19, Canterbury, people thought they were voting for decency over Tory evil. Turns out the new decency is also the new evil! Canterbury needs to correct this nonsense ❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeahshewrites Looks like FinancePapi is really trying to “reach” and clutching at straws 🌾🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Can I please encourage @JMPSimor and everyone to tag/credit a man named @RespectIsVital who was the individual who did all the detective work to unearth #DomCummings illegal construction and tax avoidance... I’m seeing his work frequently posted by all of us, but No credit given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius363 Her CV of racism, glee for death of Iraqis is what seems to have initially got her approval from forensic #KeirStarmer - noone here will convince me that Keir and labour inner circles were unaware of her views. Also can we all imagine if this was JC and her comments antisemetic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges The party that has throughout Covid19 pandemic defended “Their side” is no other than the conservatives party❌  Has anyone forgotten the #DomCummings pivotal moment in this pandemic?  Where the party, Tory voters, Tory radio/TV commentators and PM ALL defended lawlessness👏🏾❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes How does one “listen a lot” and “work closely” with a community of people by “blanking” members of that said community?  I suspect in months/years to come #KeirStarmer will also tell the black community that he “listens a lot and works with black people” because he knelt “once”❌  https://t.co/dEUjb8fkaI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabriel_Pogrund “After the left identified past comments”- I love the way that through this you confirm that centrists &amp; right wing labour have NO problem whatsoever with pro Tony/Keir being pro killing innocent people😰  Absolutely disgusting! No wonder we have Keir abstaining from Tory Bills❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon This is not about blairite/corbynism/Keirite - it’s about “is someone suitable for a role”  I don’t particularly care about Tony Blair or his previous cabinet and friends- however I do hasten to add his a criminal for the Iraq situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Her views and attitudes on the Iraq war are very evident and disturbing indeed.  Despite that she was appointment. Then you juxtapose that appointment decision to the abstaining being done on all these problematic bills that restrict Iraqis bringing prosecution: it’s NOT good❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Having briefly seen all the screenshots posted by virtually everyone who is concerned about the appointment, it is plain to see that the woman was of a particular ideology. She is not a silent mute character, she’s very vocal in the party. So pardon me if I suggest she was known<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon So you suggest to me that he views were absolutely not known to inner labour circles? Who you trolling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon The amendment has be done because of the backlash &amp; the fact that receipts of what she said all over social media has been brandished as evidence to why shes absolutely NOT suitable for ANY role!  She was initially chosen DESPITE all her views and previous posts! Let that sink in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon In the appointment phase - how did her CV go unread - there’s nothing to praise about the amendment, it’s poor due diligence (in fact there clearly wasn’t any due diligence), people like her, one didn’t even have to dig her Twitter, her views are clearly well known in the party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Oya sha, don’t say that... peutetre tu blague? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingyasili 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I like it when people speaking in philosophical terms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Let me hazard a guess.... that radio station .... used to hire Katie Hopkins and Nigel Farage? It’s a 3 letter abbreviation...?   And let me also guess: the presenter was a white high BMI male? Whose name is also the name of a vehicle 🚗?   How far off am I?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siennamarla The fact that it was made (in first place) shows lack of due diligence on @Keir_Starmer part - he appointed someone who celebrates murders and rejoices at the sound of Iraqis dying innocently! She’s negative energy through and through. His oversight shows he’s not very forensic❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 Ikiri evident is that leta irashaka gukomeza gusoroma imisoro byanze-bikunze. It’s like a farmer expecting a cow to produce ever more litres of milk despite there being a drought and no grass.

<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl And why cant those who malign trans people be asked to leave? As indeed those who were antisemitic were highlighted to the public and asked to do the right thing: apologise and leave?  This tantamount to saying to an abuse woman “I know he’s abusing you, but please stay”❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 It’s under forensic #NewLeadership apparently. With the new leadership, comes new values: antiwar values, respect for everyone’s human rights (even Iraqis) is deemed ‘woke’ and a shame to the party.  “Britain first”, amnesty for the military at all costs is the new mantra.🤷🏾‍♂️😪❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Thank you @davidschneider - I keep highlighting to people that the abbreviation NHS has deliberately been plastered onto Serco Track and trace app to mislead the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorganPaulett Thats a little bit unfair... we know a few things: He will campaign for 1) Limitations of human rights protection of non-British people who want to bring prosecution against UK spies/army, 2) He'll also campaign on most other Tory policies... So we do know some things to be fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn Anyway, really good and healthy exchange tonight -appreciated! Sometimes, people need to be prepared to sit down and say "yeah this is actually a little be f***d, and it does not represent by views/values"🤔🤷  Everyday that passes, I am pushed to consider alternatives: Greens?🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn Emphasis on 'any cost' -I think that 'go for the jugular' vibe is something JC lacked, and all the anchors he'd tied himself (such as AS etc) meant that he just could not push through. Then of course you had internal gerrymandering, ChangeUK etc plotters, it was all gonna explode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPugh @AdamPugh bro, I feel you,.... I have personally run out of "We move" and "hmm lets how it goes next time"   I am just going to have to say, I am outta this. It's getting to a stage, where it is actually mentally and emotionally destructive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn I dont think you were wrong to support labour, there were many other elements that may have made Jeremy not the 'ideal' (not least the AS etc issues), however you have to ask yourself, at the CORE, Jeremy's ethos was right: Opportunities for all, improvement in services etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn Why cant we start our argument from "human rights are human rights, creating bills that encroach on other people's human rights... is not okay, however when in POWER, we would create a better bill by doing XYZ" rather than "this is shit and wrong, but we will vote for it anyway"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn Also, another dangerous misstep that labour voters are being drawn into, is the same one tories have been drawn into with DomCummings, whereby, you witness the party do something UTTERLY unacceptable, but you shut up and toe the line because... you're a sheep.  That's not me❌🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn Pleased to see ur last sentence of this tweet. Irrespective of how desperate we both clearly are to see the end of tory rule, this NewLeadership methodology does NOT resonate with a) my core values and b) politics does not have to be about dirty games. they need to WIN the argmnt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn So, translation, he's turning labour into a disingenuous party, so as to slide into number 10?  Is this the kind of politics that appeals to you? commit to bills that put into jeopardy other people's human rights, in the hopes of gaining votes from bigots, so as to get into #10?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn He is being extremely disingenuous - because voting it down does not mean it goes 'away into a blackhole, never to be seen again' - it means the government goes back to drawing board and ACTUALLY 'amends' their bill.  Conor has said the bill is 'politically driven and imperfect'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn 3/ if clearly amendments of this current bill aren’t possible, if the bill is imperfect (wrong) then it should not be endorsed.  How dumb and thick is today’s labour and it’s unquestioning cheerleaders?   This is not how to hold tories to account!   Utterly weak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn 2/ voting for the bill means labour agrees with the bill.  I cannot for the life of me understand why labour is being so shit and disingenuous with its voters. When Theresa May deal was defeated by Labour, Theresa went back to drawing board and returned with amended version<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @ConorMcGinn 1/ I’ve just taken the liberty to read the full length of what @ConorMcGinn wrote: 99% of it says that the bill is flawed and driven by political ideology, therefore the Bill is IMPROPER, and should be voted down. If voted down, Tories will have to bring back something different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Ive never seen/witnessed anything like this:  On one hand they say bill is not good (imperfect), but they also advocate that the party must vote for something that’s bad.  And the icing on the cake, the victims of future British military/spy actions are now the perpetrators🤷🏾‍♂️❌🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Does @ConorMcGinn suggest that prior to tories tempering with the law- British national security was “in the air”?  Such a ridiculous claim to make! Shambles doesnt even begin to describe this #NewLeadership malarkey. We might as well vote Tory seeing Lab endorses all their bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber What’s happened this time? Thought everything was onwards and upwards since newLeadership   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lewisno1fan @mojidaniels @brenbrenchie Am I going mad ... did I just read that #malala @Malala is a Tory? A party that endeavours you shut out people like her ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EHijacked @MarkSeddon1962 @ThatTimWalker @BorisJohnson Well that’s admirable, it doesn’t change the fact he campaigned for Liberal Democrats initially, pulling out at the very late stages when I suppose he realised the arithmetics didn’t stack well for LibDems.

<|startoftext|>@BullshitSlayer Well, Rwanda has a population of &gt;13,000,000 people- have you been to Rwanda, lived with Rwandans in cities and rural areas to draw your conclusions? If you desperately want a dictatorship where if you run as opposition u end up dead or in jail, go ahead and take it, dont insult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BullshitSlayer Leave Rwanda out of this one please.  Have you spoken to Rwandans about their dictatorship and how they feel about it? 1994 to 2020 with some regime that is ever tightening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 You can bang on till the cows come home to north east about “your kind of black people, and black you know and listen to”- reality is: it won’t change the fact black history will continue to be taught, and that we will continue to say BLM.  And importantly we ain’t going nowhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Indeed, and i have evidence for it too.  But that is not the point of this, you claim i've a political ideology, state me that ideology<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 You are oblivious to fact that this is not the first time we've spoken. Incidentally topic being you trying to malign black historical events &amp; experiences. I have no interest in broadcasting the exchanges to the world, bcoz that's not proper  But do tell, what politcal ideology?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 typo was it? One minute u didnt delete, now u did because apparently it was a typo, you really need to get better with your lies.  In any case, what 'divisive political ideology' are you on about?  The person offended by the term BLM is now talking about 'colour blindness' haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Haha, right - I am racist... says smcbridge360  speak for yourslef<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Haha Lord, quote Morgan Freeman, Quote MLK if you want- I learn about white history every single day, I have been learning white western history throughout my education from Primary to University. I learnt the Tudors/Stuarts/Victorian/WW1/2/German&amp;ItalianUnification and much more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Quote: "Keep politics and religion away from the shopping please"  Christmas is religious, as is Easter...  Both Christmas and Easter happen to be parts of European religion doctrine - Christianity relgion  Who said: "Keep politics and religion away from the shopping please"?😂🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Haha😂- says a man who desperately wants to change what he has said publicly... this reminds me the time you wrote something in DMs that you regretted and you deleted it hoping I hadn’t seen it to help you evade responsibility for words you’d used.  You’ve a track-record: tragic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Nope, Black History has become a thing because Western Nations refuse to celebrate/teach black history, therefore those who are black want to see their history taught. It's not rocket science nor American.  Black history is black history. Racism is racism - the 2 arent the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 So suddenly ur nonsense about "Keep politics and religion away from the shopping please" was a load of shit then?  You meant, keep all this BLM stuff away from my ears/eyes... I will pretend that I also dont want religions in shops, if challenged ill backtrack how Xmas is special<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 And you haven't yet told me how and when you last blasted and refused to shop at John Lewis/Waitrose/Tesco/Morrison/Aldi/Asda/Co-Op/LIDL/M&amp;S/WHSmith/CardFactory/Primark/BHS/Argos/B&amp;Q etc for promoting Christmas/Easter etc. (a religion)....??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 How did I quote you wrong? you said "Keep politics and religion away from the shopping please"  And I said: shops are private enterprise and they can pick and choose what they do/promote with their products shops. its not for you/me to dictate how a shop address racism/inequality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 It's not about pulling the 'R word again' - it's about pointing out the plain obvious. #BlackLivesMatter is an important thing for people who feel that their lives arent valued, any persons/organisations helping the cause are welcome.  If you hate the 'woke' shops, find another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 A "shop" is a private enterprise - it can promote any cause it wishes. You as a client have no business in telling a given shop "you cannot talk about politics/religion". On the topic of religion, when was the last time you went off on one because a shop celebrated Christmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Lol if heating black history months makes you that repulsed, guess you need to find a slightly racist shop then. Sainsbury’s clearly isn’t the one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz Well at the moment, I can tell one thing: NewLeadership May be uniting white people on the centre right/left - meanwhile he definitely shuns many others. So the unity you desire/ think Starmer brings to the table is mythical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat @AndyBurnhamGM There are MANY candidates who aren’t white men in suits who would make great leaders or more likely very very good cabinet ministers!  Also by god our country needs to let go of FPTP system! The system creates this sense of all or nothing, deters voters from being adventurous🤷🏾‍♂️😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat @AndyBurnhamGM The really annoying thing about UK 2020, despite our country being extremely progressive, it seems as a nation there’s a strange lust for white men in fitted suits, there are far better candidates but I feel like their chances are poor because they don’t fit the “leader” mould😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz I’m aware of that mate, but look around you. All the preachers - all the people who start patronising everyone about “fine go risk Tory win by not standing behind Starmer” - they were themselves actively plotting to join LibDems, some even advocated for Tory win.  Yet here we are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz Im as aware of the fact that it leads to a Tory win as labour voters who ditched labour for LiberalDemocrats in Dec2019 did and indeed gave us a Tory government, only this time its the worst Tory party in modern memory... alas we live on. Those who gave us tories now preach to us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz I’ll await those amendments, moreover if the government has a majority and will theoretically win every vote from bill to amendments to final stages, it means it’s even more imperative to vote on principles.   As a voter All I can say is labour abstained on human rights abuses❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat I’ve grown to like @AndyBurnhamGM   Dare I say he seems genuine when he speaks ... I suppose when they’re the underdogs they always speaking with principles and things change when they get power... but at the moment, of all Labour names: I’d settle for Andy for Leader🤷🏾‍♂️  You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz Is that it? 🤪  Is abstentions part of the glorious methodology to rise 20%?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 @CityofKigali Ariko nawe sigaho, how can you contradict #Joly?

Stop lying about our nation @Allenkab3 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ Our country is of milk/honey/equality for all😂🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Mummasuzz I’m curious - in what ways and what damage has he undone. In a tangible sense.   Feel free to enlighten me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @boilerstoker @DontDivideUsNow Hahaha   Apparently saying #BlackLivesMatter is more dangerous than covid - y’all racists have lost it completely!

<|startoftext|>@cmilicich Surely @jacindaardern has earned credit throughout the last few years? regardless of how the election campaigns are going?  Campaigns are always shit.

<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl You did? For what exactly?

Then started to kno her: don’t like much❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster It was all lies and bollox to keep us all quiet, so that the so called “forensic #NewLeadership” wouldn’t look utterly stupid  I’m very pleased I personally didn’t fall for the bullshit.  Called it out on day one and continue to do so: Principles cannot be for sale! Keir is fraud<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UnitePolitics @PatrickWDixon keen to hear your view -  Isn't this what Labour should be saying?  "WHERE ARE THESE HYPOTHETICAL CASES THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO PROTECT AGAINST?"   Why is the UK creating bills in 'anticipation'?   Abstaining is NOT what we should be doing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Angela ur party has spent the last few weeks abstaining at everything. why should tories listen to ur boring voice now?  You enabled and emboldened them, giving them exactly what they wanted at every turn, and it is now you want to say "OMG Tories are a disgrace"? Give it a rest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Translation: He never actually had it in the first place.  Anyone who actually believes that the virus (and its millions of copies) in his body magically appeared and then 48hrs hours later because he 'went to a hospital' it also magically disappeared - is thoroughly dumb/stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirleymush @paulmasonnews Lol  How can someone be a “real leader” if all they do is abstain from policies that negatively impact populations in UK and abroad? How is it leadership to abstain when human rights are up for debate depending on whether victims are British or foreign?  This is NOT leadership❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon This newLeadership method is making swing voters really question their vote  I might be BAME background, and tories are currently an absolute no go zone, but nothing that the newLeadership has been doing resonates with anything I hold as principle! There seems to be on opposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Its disappointing, whilst Ive been overly skeptical of #NewLeadership, ive been so, in the hope that the leadershp will prove me wrong. Prove my skepticism wrong. Its tragic and genuinely disappointing that my skepticism is being vindicated! It means voting labour is questionable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Looks like I’ve been vindicated in my view that the whole abstention nonsense was pointless.   The argument from pro Keir was that labour will bring a ton load of amendments which will alter the bill” it now turns out the amendments are redundant! Keir is hopeless frankly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Weirdly, this sellout gets booked by  NewsChannels to speak on behalf of 'Black' people The same way they book another MixedRace Dominique to speak on behalf of black people.  In the whole BLACK population, they couldnt find black people, only mixed-black Tories could be found🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misanthropicc92 So we end up with people like #PritiPatel in a position to go in TV and talk about african colonialism. we end up with Starkey talking about Black slavery.  Black people through complacency and being gaslit have allowed the perpetrators of the crimes to also be the historians❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misanthropicc92 At end of the day, the reason why you cant just go about bashing holocaust is: the victims of holocaust are the ones who have written post holocaust narrative (rightly so) With black history of abuse/exploitation/murders -black people pass the narrative writing to nonBlack people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misanthropicc92 I’ve had to say it - because I’m tired of these DarrenGrimes defenders gaslighting with “oh the lad was just naive, he’s guilty of nothing”  That’s bollox- the topic of convo was slavery and colonialism - period in history where white peoples mercilessly abused/killed back people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pingachoo @officialbarnesy It appears that way  Im getting annoyed with people commenting on this matter with ignorance. They CLEARLY hvnt seen the video.   My point stands: if you replace the word 'black' with Jews/Jewish/Judaism - NONE absolutely NONE of these Darren defenders would be speaking (rightly)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy 3/ He engaged with antiblack racism during his interview with Starkey. It makes Darren racist. After watching it-Darren deemed the racism to be 'so good' that he 'watched it again', then promoted it to his racist fans!  Would y'all be dismissive if the issue was Antisemitism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy The question is not therefore "was starkey the only problematic individual" the question is: Why did Darren provide a platform to a racist white supremacist who emphatically insulted all black victims of slavery/colonisation. &amp; Why did Darren promote the racism to his Parler fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy @officialbarnesy that's twisting of facts. From your tweet you clearly didnt watch the segment when it aired way back when.  The facts of the matter are: Darren invited a host who spewed antiblack racism, Darren nodded along with the racism, then boasted that Starkey was his HERO  https://t.co/7bHJ3zaOFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@c_dodson_thatch @Martin_Abrams Likewise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_dodson_thatch @Martin_Abrams I didnt ask you to care or change your mind. I simply find your actions abhorrent and unethical with regards to you shooting wild animals because it helps you get sense of 'peace and tranquility'... and apparently it helps you understand meat consumption....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Martin_Abrams Totally!  However, those who apparently 'love' the outdoors and nature, their only way of getting a sense of 'peace and tranquility" is by shooting the wild animals they come across. Apparently it also helps them understand why they eat meat. We're all hypocrites for not shooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Apparently he can only eat meat, if he's shot and killed the animal himself. That's his explanation for why shooting wild free animals brings him 'peace and tranquility"  Astonishing explanation  https://t.co/FCAzByqziE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_dodson_thatch @Martin_Abrams Direct Quote: Chris Dodson said: "[shooting] It brings me peace and tranquility."  Nothing about "In order to eat meat, I must do the killing myself to fully comprehend how animals feel when they're being shot dead. Only after personally shooting wild animals can I consume meat"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_dodson_thatch @Martin_Abrams Lol yeah, like syntax is really the point of this conversation. Crack on with your analysis of syntax and grammar.  I will correct it for you: "Chris loves the ability to shoot to kill wild animals going about their normal lives; seeing animals dead brings him peace &amp; tranquility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams It's beyond words unbelievable that people even have the audacity and confidence to boast about things like this "mwahaha I love the ability to shoot dead defenceless living things, because it brings me a sense of peace and tranquility." WTF? WT actual F?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_dodson_thatch @Martin_Abrams Quote:   In a statement about shooting, Chris Dodson said: "It brings me peace and tranquility."  In other words: shooting dead wild animals brings Chris a sense of peace and tranquility. Disrupting the peace and tranquility of other living things, brings Chris joy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Did he say killing wild animals brings "Peace and tranquility"?  These people are truly mad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodjgrimmer @TheSocialistDad He's not 'all': he is part of a massive coalition of rightwing rich people who only act to enrich/better themselves at expense of others. He and many other rich people are all that is wrong with the UK at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallaceme Lol, correction:  Fight racism, wherever it shows its head - that means fight Grimes the racist who platforms fellow racist white supremacists. Loving it so much that he urges his #Parler fans to watch racist content! #DarrenGrimes - IS racist and complicit in racism too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darryl0008 @darrengrimes_ @timfarron Yes we get it you love racists!    Enjoy 💪🏽💪🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tomhfh “It’s so good (the racism therein) I’m watching it back AGAIN” said #DarrenGrimes  After hearing the racist bigotry, Darren watched it over and over again, then went to Parler to tell his mates to watch it too (spread the racism)  So children, the racist platformer loves racism🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/wzKDRUxfTv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider What I want to know is this: Will nurses etc pay the bills with their MBE titles?

<|startoftext|>@shakimiki @_martianchild @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford Hmm  I think you’ll find @MarcusRashford out his career at stake and spoke out whilst his other millionaire cohorts did nothing!

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer 🤔🤔  @MarcusRashford 1  Leader of opposition 0  Why? Marcus doesnt abstain from fighting for what is RIGHT- if government wants to introduce policies that starve children, Marcus got up and said something.

<|startoftext|>@melaniekmelvin @lordofintent @Keir_Starmer Yeah but yeah but .... what about the plan to woo racists and xenophobes who voted for conservatives in December 19?

<|startoftext|>@timothy_stanley @timothy_stanley why are journalists &amp; white fans of rightWingism trying to create an amnesty for #DarrenGrimes? Here are the facts: He interviewed someone with racist rhetoric, throughput he did NOT distance himself from the rhetoric. He went on to call guest “HERO”- hes racist  https://t.co/ttOxmRiLFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @timfarron “It’s so good (the racism spewed by Starkey) I’m watching it back AGAIN” - said Darren, as he advertised his racist content to his fans on Parler.  Then the world saw the segment, realised it’s racist, then Darren pulls the “I’m too naive and was too tired to challenge” 🧐!Bollox  https://t.co/XMvSFePc2S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkewSpew @timfarron Thank you for producing the receipts I was looking for regarding this racist white supremacist platformer #DarrenGrimes !  All these white people are out in his defence with complete disregard for the events that actually took place! Darren loved his racist hero, and promoted it  https://t.co/hQT5hlB0N4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmateurEconomix @EmporersNewC Heres the receipt for those who havet a clue what’s going on, and also for the avoidance of doubt - it appears Iain Dale and eco are out on a PR damage control for #DarrenGrimes   The message and lesson is simple: Racism is NOT tolerable! Apparently unless you’re rightwing!❌👉🏾🗑  https://t.co/SQdnPunHs5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmporersNewC @EmporersNewC - Do not forget the fact that #DarrenGrimes not only done the interview, listened to every racist bigotry from Starkey, he also nodded to everything Starkey said (EVERYTHING) and he went to Parler to encourage his fans that he loved it (he watching it AGAIN)❌👉🏾🗑  https://t.co/G9dg3sdcbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Tasselli @adamboultonSKY @IainDale Both @IainDale and @adamboultonSKY deliberately choosing to gaslight the public!  #DarrenGrimes was NOT naive, he knowingly done the interview, he NODDED along to EVERY word of racism bigotry uttered by Starkey. Darren run time Parler to tell his fans he loved the interview🤷🏾‍♂️❌🗑  https://t.co/Zx8WmlaUWo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @viewsfromleft For context -lets remember what #DarrenGrimes said about his interview with the racist Starkey prior to the world seeing the whole clip! Grimes was in love with Starkey &amp; all the racism that Starkey expressed! Once interview aired and got negative feedback, he changed his tune  https://t.co/JBoyRtYEoR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan bollox: the interviewer went on Parler to proclaim his undying love for the racist bigotry expressed by his “hero”  What lies coming out of defenders of racism!

<|startoftext|>@DouglasKMurray @metpoliceuk @darrengrimes_ Well may Grimes needs to understand that racism against black peoples is not “banter” for his  parler fans!  He called a white supremacist racist his “hero” and urged his Parler followers to watch the clip because the antiblack rhetoric was “so great”- Mr Grimes can F off 💯times  https://t.co/bpjkeslr8U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Mr Grimes you platforming a racist white supremacist, you went as far as telling your “Parler” fans that #Starkey was your hero for his rhetoric against black peoples!   Damn you a million times!   #prisonforGrimes - music to my ears!  https://t.co/NFUSGOGYTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Fancy that- @IainDale out to defend an individual platforming a white supremacist racist who maligned black people and their experiences.

Anything that is said whether it be legitimately or otherwise - Keirites🤖 will jump on a bizarre and random attack on #JeremyCorbyn! Their obsessive hate for JC is borderline psychotic!  To all Keir🤖: we all scrutinise Keir, get OVER it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @OwenJones84 @mrjamesob @Keir_Starmer 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽  Yes yes yes @viewsfromleft - let’s get the show on the road bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official They need to learn to look beyond the “OMG guys have you heard rwanda now has an airline”... “OMG have you heard road has tarmac roads” (which modern country doesn’t?) “OMG have you heard Rwanda has a president?” (Which country doesn’t?) “omg have you heard rwanda has gorillas”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber 😂  Well maybe labour under newForensicLeadership should be engaging &amp; listening to those who have always been on their side?  The lust and desire to woo Tory voters has really overstepped the line. Labour now ABSTAINS on bills relating to human rights abuses? Just too woo tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Healer1official Why do so many Africans (non rwandans) have this weird obsession with rwanda and it’s politics? Do they bother asking rwandans for their lived experiences of Rwandan politics?  FYI: Rwanda is a country of &gt;10M people, people with opinions, personal experiences. Its not KagameLand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystalwillseeu Go get him👌🏾👏🏾✊🏽 The irony of Fox wanting to boycott @sainsburys is that actually the vast majority of decent people have no time for his bullshit. When challenged he results to insults/fabrication/and public shaming. He tried to throw his so called “close friend” Under a bus👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist @DavidLammy @UKLabour is utterly hopeless!  On one hand the government comes up with mental policies that give military amnesty to commit crimes (against human rights) abroad (breaking international laws) -labour abstains💅🏻🛏.  Then the next day labour be “omg tories are so terrible”🤔😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Haha - it was actually hilarious!  Where’s your sense of humour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏾☝🏾! I dont understand the logic and tactic being used by the opposition on this one! By abstaining from onset and middle, #KeirStarmer is allowing the bill to progress UNAMENDED to final stage. We already kno that push comes to shove tories stick together. It’s a done deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 @TheSocialistDad When receipts come calling 🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @HackneyAbbott Yes👌🏾✊🏽🤷🏾‍♂️  Incidentally, some of us aren’t even necessarily “corbyn fans”- I voted for labour for first time in my life in Dec19 because I predicted Boris was unfit (I’ve been vindicated). My judgement/scrutiny of Keir is nothing to do with JC, but more about his indifference👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I’m biggest frustration is this: we already know whatever tories want - they can get because they have the numbers.  So therefore opposition should be voting on principle. Because this abstaining malarkey is making no difference to whether bill passes or fails.   It’s all tragic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon We are talking about a government led by people who are prepared to lie to the queen.. and break international laws.   I don’t know how anyone would buy any promises made by this administration.  They lie to get their way - havent people learnt a thing from their track record?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Where are those assurances? What are they written on? Dom Cummings handkerchief?   I’ve not heard any assurances made by the government... the government has simply been able to roll though unopposed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Well regrettably this is why I think it should not be whipped - at end of the day this is a principle call. I think and clearly the 18 who rebelled think they JUSTICE trumps “maybe” “what if”   If you, your family, friends etc were victims of war crimes - you wouldn’t be agreeing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Unless I’m too stupid ... I cannot see the wisdom from the opposition.  Also there is an issue of principle- political game playing aside: the question is: is it appropriate for the British military to be exempt or shielded from justified prosecution Victims of their abuse?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon They will definitely be more unanimous- which is even more imperative that the opposition should be making their case at the early stages...labour by abstaining is allowing the bill to pass thru the house unamended. They cant expect to then change the whole bill at last reading🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon The arithmetic shows that if labour had voted against last night - the bill would have been blocked .... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Why we making excuses for abstaining on a bill that removes power from victims to bring prosecution against those who commit crimes against them ?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @djadamsrwanda @wasac_rwanda @RSSB_Rwanda @rpfinkotanyi @PaulKagame I’m driving to work - I’ll get back to this soon ✊🏽✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @djadamsrwanda @wasac_rwanda @RSSB_Rwanda The country need investigative journalism - but they get arrested and disappear to be honest.  The craziest thing is - the corruption from authorities and politicians is not hard to discover, it is just the country lacks functional mechanisms to address it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liebshen15 All possible in the land led by the conservatives who gaslight their voters into voting for them on false prospectus! This nightmare is of course compounded by a new opposition whose raison-d’être is to abstain on everything proposed by the tories!  Britain in 2020 - shitshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @djadamsrwanda Don’t even get me started on this one bro!  The way politicians behind the scenes steal/loot from the people, but then in public they act whiter than Jesus🧐🧐. Worst part of it is that they PROSECUTE the average citizen for crimes that are far smaller than their own corruption❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @djadamsrwanda Hallelujah! You can say this again!  Sadly, FAR TOO MANY grown and educated men and women are prepared to impress mediocre people who abuse peoples’ trust and funds.  It’s good to hear and see that there are some of us who would want to say “No that’s wrong, I’m not doing it”❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhonddaBryant @butwhatifitsall He not choosing to “soldier on” -because he could have soldiered on in isolation at hospital or WH.  He’s choosing to be a narcissist and to politicise this coronavirus case. His media fans have started a narrative “Trump has FIRST hand experience, Biden doesn’t” was it a ploy?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djadamsrwanda @eLHAMiiD I like this! Good message DJ Adams!  I would add: Let’s learn to stand and live by our principles, rather than living by lines drawn for us by others. Those lines are often not a reflection of what we believe in, and we should avoid following them! Be a man, stand on YOUR feet🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaTherms @ChantayyJayy Lol so because their curriculum between year 7-11 touches/mentions Rosa Parks, MLK (as part of American history) and Mary Seacole - that school thinks that it has equally explored th contribution of black peoples to Britain and the world?   You should write a letter back❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 2/ I appreciate it’s easier said than done of course. It will take time.   But the most important thing is allow yourself to go through the process, rather than block it. Blocking it means it re-emerges at a later time.   Wishing you best wishes, inshallah the pain will ease 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 1) Take time to mourn-your emotions and pain aren’t extraordinary (it’s normal process)  2) Try finding ways to be rational about what’s happened: was it expected/ we all pass some day 😢(even tho we wish we could stay forever) 3) find things to grateful/celebrate of the departed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen I saw your tweet earlier about whether we still thought Biden was going to win... I scrolled past it initially. Then I fell upon his latest nonsense where he says “I was able to isolate because BLACK women were stacking grocery shelves for me”  I had to come back: he’s an idiot🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddupreejr its not an issue of articulation, its an issue of “what is in his mind”  At the end of the day, we only say things that our brains have thought through. Noone forced him to say it  He exemplified white &amp; class privilege: “I can safely isolate, while poor Black women stack for me”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 At first reading when I protested and questioned the decision of @UKLabour to abstain on this bill... fans of #NewForensicLeadership told me “you’re missing the bigger picture, labour will force a ton load of amendments at second reading”  Haha- 2nd reading- where’s Labour?🤷🏾‍♂️🧐🕵🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @benjaminbutter Lol but we do have evidence - Mr Fox is disgruntled and pissed off at the idea of black peoples being empowered. Seeing and hearing black peoples being offered opportunities makes his blood boil! He’s therefore antiblack and racist in that order Meanwhile Fox had NO/ZERO evidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marclamonthill @walegates The way he elevates his hands like Jesus... and proclaims “Because a black woman was able to stack the grocery shop” is so patronising and damn right weird. Fact of matter is: grocery shop works are people of all colours. To single out BLACK people as shop stackers is just ❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMattWain At first reading when I protested and questioned the decision of @UKLabour to abstain on this bill... fans of #NewForensicLeadership told me “you’re missing the bigger picture, labour will force a ton load of amendments at second reading”  Haha- 2nd reading- where’s Labour?🤷🏾‍♂️🧐🕵🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DurstApologist What I want to know before I fully cut &amp; move on from @UKLabour is why the hell their opposition is to “sit and abstain” The reason some of us don’t (didn’t) vote conservatives is because we DISAGREE with the ideology and policies, I rejected tories to vote labour! Not to abstain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Thank you @DawnButlerBrent !!   Immense respect for standing up for what is right!

<|startoftext|>@liamyoung Worse thing: he is still symptomatic and contagious.  If he was not ill enough to need hospital in the first place he should’ve stayed at home to safeguard everyone else.

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 More than ignorance, it is major trivialisation of a major injustice done against a race of people.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I dont even think the “intrigue” is genuine certainly not today.   There may have been intrigue when they were courting, before the wedding and immediately after the wedding. However as soon as she started eating avocados/closing car doors/ wearing black nail varnish- it was over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Definitely the former ... not sure about the intrigue part.

<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital It is a badge of honour for him. He has an audience of racists and haters of progress who are ready to applaud all his nonsense.

<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker what a cringe newspaper front page..they’ve clustered the frontpage with imagery of: - Royal family  - “Dame” Mary (hierarchical system glorification) - Trump (a racist white supremacist) - Brexit- a British decision influenced by xenophobia and rightWingism  Fit for cat litter🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst the volume from racist gammons &amp; pretenders who boast about “I have &lt;a&gt; BAME friend, but🤮” is turned up, and tarnishing this accurate tweet, let me say @nicolathorp_ you’re spot on!

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @sainsburys 2/ for some reason anything to do with empowering black people really gets to *certain* white people.

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl what I really want to know from all these racists who are SO disturbed by @sainsburys wishing black peoples “happy black history month”.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Thank u for calling out the bulls**t.  The media has deliberately erroneously called it a 'dinner party' -it was NOT a party.  Also, I just want to clarify something: at my workplace (hospital), the doctors room is a confined space, &gt;6unrelated people- do we need to be sacked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @BigDaddyDore @realDonaldTrump Well, that's a fair question.  I think part of it is the fact that being kind and caring has been labelled as 'woke' and 'liberal agenda' - by no other than people like Trump.  If you say you care about climate change, poverty, equality etc you're labelled Woke/communist. its mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickS615 @BigDaddyDore @chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump @PatrickS615 this point exactly!! The loudest most offensive amass followers, they get media attention, they're made famous by the media, they use twitter/social media as their platforms. They embolden deranged people.   Ironically Trump has empowered racists who want to MURDER🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @BigDaddyDore @realDonaldTrump The vast majority of people are like you) well-meaning, kind and normal.  Twitter is regrettably an environment where the loudest and most offensive people can amass 1000s of followers and they appear to be speaking on behalf of others. Also there are bots with agendas too.🤷🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @BigDaddyDore @realDonaldTrump I do hope you all realise twitter is full of weirdos sat in a cave posting provocative tripe?!   And that aside, if trump and similar enemies of progress want love and sympathy, they quickly need to learn to be nicer to others.  People tend to reap what they sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump Glad to hear it pal. You're a good man. Indeed may we all learn to be kind and compassionate at all times...  But indeed lets also keep our eyes on the ball - because, history has taught us: When Good people choose to do nothing, bad things happen.  We have the power to do better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump He said "Proud boys Stand Back and Stand by" - whatever else he said and didnt say in his mumbling is frankly irrelevant.  And he knows exactly who ProudBoys are, and what their ideology is.  Its like being asked to condemn Nazism, and refusing to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump I agree with you, lets all be kind and loving - and I am 9.9/10 of the time.  But Trump is frankly a no go zone. He's toxic, nasty, uncaring, and he's single handedly responsible for regression in social cohesion in USA in last 4years. He's ideology and mentality is destructive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump I don't wish death on him. But aside from that, what love and care can I offer a man who wants anyone who doesnt like his ideology dead?  Do you think when he was avoiding tax and only paying #750dollars he cared about the millions of Americans with no healthcare? shelter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump I sincerely understand your point about being kind/loving/caring - but the issue at hand here, is that we are talking about a man who has repeatedly shown himself not to care. When Americans were dying he played golf, called it a hoax. When asked to condemn racism - he refuses🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump If u were asked to condemn "white supremacy"- i think you'd grasp the point of the question, if u do condemn them and arent a racist youd unequivocally say "I condemn racism/discrimination white supremacy in the strongest terms". He didnt. I dont see need to explore what he meant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump Im definitely sure he wouldnt. As a black man, he told his racist KKK/Proud boys to "Stand back and stand by" and get armed.  KKK/Proud boys see my skin and relish to see me dead. If that is a prayer from Trump, I'd rather he said the prayer for someone else. I get your point tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @realDonaldTrump Noone is 'rooting' for anyone to die. It is disingenuous to suggest so. People are saying: we werent fans of his previously, we still arent fans of his now. That is all. I didnt pray for him in the past, he didnt pray for me in the past, Im not praying for him now. Simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmcjazz @DavidBegnaud @POTUS Yes, he will 'Be' covid!   Thanks for clarifying what #Trump is: The virus! He indeed is the virus causing harm to everyone else!  I couldnt care less how weak or stronger he comes out of this. He's a loser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PugmomSTC @DavidBegnaud The mask is supposed to do both- help prevent the spread of whatever comes out of your mouth when you speak/sneeze. However it also simultaneously helps with reducing the concentration of virus particles inhaled.  It’s the same concept as a condom- prevent spread/reception of STI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBegnaud Hmmm 🤔   A little bit late for the masks me thinks?!  The man who laughed at Biden 72hrs ago saying “I don’t wear a mask like him (Biden), every time I see him he’s wearing a mask”   Well Mr #Trump, how’s coronaVirus going? Also, the mask was supposed to prevent the infection 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe It’s also my understanding that it wasn’t even a “party” as such?! It was a gathering for a recently bereaved family?   Haters really are trying to milk this “Jeremy was seen sat with more than 6 but less than 10 people” story! At work, I’m with &gt;6people, they going to fine me?❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 The way we medics are expected to usher people out of A&amp;E when they come to hospital with “mild” symptoms that can be managed at home because a hospital is “not a hotel” is astonishing... and now a man who only pays #750dollars yearly for tax is admitted to a special suite?🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @KateWilton1 You’re right ... I think what they’re doing is anticipating “just in case it deteriorated, let’s make sure he’s in appropriate place” - which to be fair I think is expected and normal for a president/ PM (as boris did) - to be precautionarily moved to a place of “safety”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 Sorry to hear about sister in law! That’s dreadful!   But you’re spot on: it does NOT suddenly go from zero to 100 in 1 day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 Speaking as a person who had it: you’re spot on.  It doesn’t SUDDENLY drop on you like a ton of bricks! Although once the symptoms are all there, it can progress unpredictably. But you can’t go from FULLY normal, to suddenly in hospital! That’s bull***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat The one thing that is not happening quickly enough is him losing the election so that he and his corrupt people can go somewhere we never have to see/hear from them.

<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Well well well there we have it ... He told his worshippers to try bleach intravenous... hydroxychloroquine... pray and it will magically disappear...

<|startoftext|>@BeckettUnite Hear hear 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Not sure why people are expecting sudden outpouring of tears and best wishes.  Trumps best wishes 72hrs ago to others was that ProudBoys need t stand by and get ready to shoot and kill people of colour and those who disagree with their idealogy.  He is 👉🏾🗑❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Melania quite literally practicing what she preaches #BeBest - NOT!   These people have a polished facade on, but beneath the mask they’re pure heartless evil.

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 I would also say - people need to note - veterans not being housed is not the fault of the refugees!  The same voters who moan that veterans are not housed, are the very same voters who vote for parties that seemingly do nothing for veterans. It’s not fault of the refugees 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 Lol - Tom telling people who are victims of trumps racism and white supremacy to shed tears?!  No tears will be shed at my end of things.

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @piersmorgan I wouldn’t put it past him to be honest.... considering the election is imminent, all parties will be looking for tricks and traps ... so who knows!   As you said: noone wishes death on anybody, but aside from that, he can pray for himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @piersmorgan Absolutely, he’ll blame Biden and the so called “left liberal media and wokeness”   Absolutely maddening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @piersmorgan When people were dying he called it a hoax and went playing his golf as headline after headline tallied the dead.  Then this week he wished death upon people of colour by telling his hyenas to stand back and stand by - now racists are getting armed and emboldened. Trump is ❌👉🏾🗑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodjgrimmer #BeBest 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan With respect @piersmorgan - Trump is NOT caring and loving - someone who tells his racist white supremacy #ProudBoy to stand back and stand by to kill people of colour is Evil - not loving, caring, compassionate etc.   That’s the tweet. end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow How many prayers did Trump send out to the more than 100,000 USA citizens who have succumbed to Covid19? Whilst he danced around calling it a hoax? Whilst he played golf when the corpses piled up?  Girl please  https://t.co/0k5L3UsLVb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ckanimba @ckanimba absolutely! #Belgium should be ashamed, how long has it been now since your dad was mysteriously and unlawfully kidnapped?

<|startoftext|>@RexChapman @RexChapman to be fair - #Trump did tell his #ProudBoys to “stand by” - they knew exactly what he meant!   He blew the dog whistle! The hounds are now salivating! 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott Absolutely everyone bar @DawnButlerBrent have missed this important point!  MPs were dragged back by tories! MPs feel compelled to travel to Westminster to give their constituents a platform!   This is all partly Tory making<|endoftext|>

Please speak on your OWN behalf!  Bye 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomowolade @JoinPersuasion 3/ take Brian that we all know very well, the media and journalism, how many black peoples do we have representing a black perspective? ZERO! What does that mean?  It means having NickFerrari/PiersMorgan/IainDale/ etc. Speaking on our behalf! Do they represent us? No they don’t❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomowolade @JoinPersuasion 3/ do we want to quit medicine/law and run for journalism in our droves? Probably NO, however what happens when we have no representation in media and journalism? You end up with unbalanced media biases against us: DailyMail etc. We need ALL barriers in all professions removed🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomowolade @JoinPersuasion 2/ racists will bully/discriminate/attack/kill a nonWhite person out of hate and white supremacy. Their hate for you and I is not dictated by borders, it is dictated by the fact that our skin (african American/British black) is black. Sadly I think that’s missed from your article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomowolade @JoinPersuasion @tomowolade whilst its an excellent article, well written, and raises excellent points. I would add that: although indeed it’s occasionally erroneous to extrapolate🇺🇸experiences to🇬🇧; on issue of racism: a RACIST doesnt care about a black mans heritage! We are bound by our skin🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bronzedxx @Christmasembers @Sachkebab @thetryagainstan For real - why are people gaslighting British people about how the name Aaliyah is pronounced!?  When my african-heritage self meets John Smith - I don’t go around deliberately pronouncing the name wrongly because I’m not white native British!  How dumb are people in 2020?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christmasembers @Sachkebab @thetryagainstan Wrong wrong wrong wrong   First of all, the name Aaliyah (by nature of its spelling is not a British name) therefore the British person needs to ask and learn how to pronounce the name!  Secondly, everyone, absolutely everyone knows that Aaliyah is NOT pronounced the way she did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DionneGrant Well ... there’s one small error here; the UK and it’s elites including the monarchy have INDEED EDITED history- to make themselves appear holier-than-thou! “Oh we sailed the seas liberating slaves”- yeah after centuries of using black slaves, UK returned to colonise in 1900s🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @johnmcdonnellMP Indeed, thing is when we put political dramas &amp; self-interests to the side, we suddenly realise: we have far more “healthy” things in common: we all like a good laugh, good vibes, we all have passions that we care about. We indeed have subtle differences, but hey, what the heck🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan @pritipatel Gee thank you @pritipatel - your plan to send asylum seekers to remote islands where they’ll have no access to education, welfare, housing etc makes such a difference to the lives of the asylum seekers - genuinely thank you!

<|startoftext|>@lucyallan Lol ... isn’t it the Tory party that supports law and rule breakers - #Domcummings?

Yes, y’all have your WhiteLivesMatter 365.25days/yr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 Yes -white privilege indeed!  So despite them not making it to university, white men somehow inversely become the CEOs of everything, managers of everything!

<|startoftext|>@brianschatz The American republicans have blocked something that says “discriminating/ killing/torturing/harassing etc black peoples is wrong and should not be acceptable”🤷🏾‍♂️  Now extrapolate this to: if Germany had a chance today to vote against Nazism and they blocked it #Blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Also can we note the way retailers misled the public depending on the they word their cost/mL   The water is technically more expensive, so they’ve used the cost/mL to make the breakdown appear cheap.

<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy In reference to the #KeirStarmer quote that more black history needs to be taught - correction:  Britain needs to STOP 🛑 photoshopping its history to make itself appear “Holier than thou”  Britain enslaved black peoples for centuries, colonised Africa and supported APARTHEID🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Thank you @DawnButlerBrent ! Keeping it real!   The whole Westminster journalisms echochamber has jumped on a bandwagon “OMG how could Margaret do that, she’s so irresponsible” - meanwhile all MPs gather like sardines in a tin to when they vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateEMcCann @KateEMcCann - we got the gist from your first tweet - you don’t need a novel worth of tweets to tell/remind us that MargaretFerrier fucked up!  Give it a rest!

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @rcolvile I agree 1) categorically those advocating for prison ships/ghettos on far away islands, dehumanisation of people are vile- @pritipatel and alike 2) those who rightly oppose the above need to suggest improvements to the current system.  hasten to add: ferries/islands NOT suitable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephengray54 I’m afraid this should have been done AT THE ONSET!  Instead the British government prioritised their business mates, creating a major element of mistrust from the general public!

<|startoftext|>@mariyahldn That’s harassment  She actually tried to block you boarding the bus because you are no white?  *SOME* White people in the UK (along with some Asians like #PritiPatel) really want to reintroduce apartheid in 2020!  *Whites only can board the bus*, ethnics must walk?

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @johnmcdonnellMP I think Britain due to its 2 party system results in everyone trying to identify everyone politically.

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @johnmcdonnellMP I think from experience people who add political leanings are trying to deliver multi faceted messages: I.e. an attack on the offence (AS/ antiblack racism) plus ideology: ie. white supremacy)  If I tweet “f**k you, you white supremacist racist” - you get the gist. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @edwardpoole1975 @johnmcdonnellMP Surely the answer would be “antisemetic” and the left/right isn’t needed?  For example, if someone is racist towards me - I don’t care whether they’re left or right leaning - they’re just nasty racist idiots🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @ramaisibo kabisa!! Arabs/ Indians (to extent Nigerians/west Africans) have learnt to stand strong and represent themselves irrespective of how the westerner reacts. But there are many ex-colonial nations who are still affected by the poison that tells us to “emulate muzungu”❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale I cannot understand, irrespective of how the debate went overall, why @IainDale would score someone who directly encourages racists/white supremacy as “better”  Just goes to show, when these people are not themselves target of racism &amp; discrimination, they’ll throw us to hyenas❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale I’ll find the clip where #trump the #750dollars per year tax man, is asked “do you take this opportunity to condemn white supremacy” -and trump pretty much says “😏stand back and stand by” referring to white supremacist population of USA.  That’s the candidate Ian gave top marks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @BBCNews Exactly!  Back in year 10, I remember there was to be fair a detailed course on American civil rights movements and JFK acts etc.  But absolutely ZERO on apartheid in SA, nothing on how 🇬🇧 supported apartheid and called for Mandela to be drawn and quartered🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VictorMuhire_Sr @le_rwanda Let’s not be in denial though- unlike their “long serving presidents” such as Merkel in Germany - african Long term serving presidents are 💯% dictators!!

<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Why didn’t we think of this before? If only we’d painted postboxes black the week before #StephenLaurence was stabbed by white racists.

<|startoftext|>@RennyKeks @BBCNews This is the vibe Im getting from these random gestures!  “Hey I know, let the council paint postboxes black, those blacks will think we’re solving racism and then they’ll shut up, and we can get back to “normal”  And even more pathetic is that many people will see this as progres<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @pritipatel The worst thing about #PritiPatel the wicked witch of the west, is that despite the fact she herself is the product of the privilege offered to her parents when they came to UK, she wants to remove that privilege from people who are in her parents’ shoes! She’s deleted❌! Rotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Hmm... Im not entirely sure how a “black postbox” is going to resolve the issue that a black person is less likely to be hired for a senior job...or how it’s going to stop racists from being racists... or how it’s going to suddenly correct the systemic injustice! Someone explain?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Raff_1312 I really wouldn’t put that past her. At this rate, this woman is simply wicked through and through - with absolutely zero redeeming factors!

<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital If journalists had held the liars to account from the beginning, we may have avoided certain mistakes!  Instead they allowed the government to play though.

<|startoftext|>@SheCometh @Lewisno1fan emphasis on “just TAKING TAKING”  No thought for natives where items belong, no consideration for historical belonging of artefacts.

<|startoftext|>@shaunking They 'deliberately' planned to do the raid at the same time as the SWAT teams (who by sounds of the article are superior officers in raids) were busy doing other raids?

<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP @NadiaWhittomeMP -its hard to put into words how disappointing the situation is! In life society teaches us to do “Right” thing &amp; to have moral compass. The bill proposed empowering troops to commit crimes for which they’d be excused like HarryDunns killer. Thanks 4 ur coursge❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@butwhatifitsall @NadiaWhittomeMP What a ridiculous thing to say! @NadiaWhittomeMP along with 17 other MPs did the right and PRINCIPLED thing last night.  Abstaining on a bill that empowers British troops to commit war crimes “abroad” against foreigners is NOT appropriate (even if its political game playing)!❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isitjustmeman @ModernLeftie @MirrorPolitics @TheResistFest1 @MerryMichaelW Sandra - at this rate I’m open to anything.   Thanks for the suggestions, I’ll check them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @KayBurley - Kay how are you still beating the dead horse called “British royals do not get involved in politics?” We’ve has royals doing the Nazi salute, we’ve had Charles campaigning for his causes, we had queen telling Scots how to vote! What on Earth are you on about!? Iies❌  https://t.co/JVCM339Lqa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khayerc @Jennieformby1 Lol yeah right😂  Thinking that the Labour Party abstaining on a bill that empowers British troops to torture and abuse foreigners- is non-stop-pro JC?  Wanting a country where people don’t pay extortion for uni/rail/living is non-stop-pro-JC?   It’s called principles! Learn some<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khayerc @Jennieformby1 The transparency in the gaslighting and ignorance is plain to see.  You might believe you’re onto something, that you’ve got a forensic messiah, it’s all temporary. Tides turn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khayerc @Jennieformby1 Haha carry on the bullshit 👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khayerc Hahaha  a few BAME MPs in the Labour Party were racially discriminated and spoken of by labour staffers - #KeirStarmer #NewLeadership tried to bury the issue under a carpet, and went further and offered to pay part of their movement. Where were your arms for those black people?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal @NadiaWhittomeMP @PriyamvadaGopal how &amp; why do you always capture the thought in my mind?! I’ve been struggling to articulate the way this “impunity” clause is a continuation of the impunity that allowed Britain and her European mates to plunder, kill, enslave. Then they erect statues to gaslight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JermainJackman @NadiaWhittomeMP Right!!  Political game playing has a limit/ red line. If Labour MPs cannot stop at human rights as a red line ... then Bwoy 🤔 this #NewLeadership malarkey ain’t blessed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBIndie1 @rachshabi @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer It obviously is, you seem to be gloating that Britain contains racists intent on making immigrants’ lives a living hell.   👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBIndie1 @rachshabi @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer Because they want a better life, and Britain sells itself to be the beacon of “democracy, fairness, equality, justice”   Immigrants learn about your xenophobia sadly after they’ve arrived and settled here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBIndie1 @rachshabi @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer right? “Immigrants to fit into the country” whilst they face daily discrimination &amp; racism? Apply for a job “f**king immigrants stealing our jobs”, send kids to school “bloody immigrants breeding children”...speak their language “fu*kin immigrants” lovely to see a racist Keir fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent And she looks healthy and happy. It appears the antidote she needed was getting out of Ingerland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  Racists and haters of #MeghanAndHarry eat your hearts out.  Go clap👏🏾 for demure size zero Kate and Will as they do their photo stunts at bakeries 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirk1978 @TheMendozaWoman @Keir_Starmer The most important thing is RECOGNISING the current problem and making a morally appropriate decision and taking action.  The issue with the #NewLeadership cheerleaders is that they recognise shortcomings, but continue to give excuses/justification in the name of “wooing racists”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBIndie1 @rachshabi @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer Right - cheaper utilise/ free university access for all British students/ cheaper transportation for ALL British people/ less expensive wars to save British money was “abuse towards vast majority of the electorate”  Understand!

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @holski_beat They’re a nasty bunch!🙅🏾‍♂️  I really need FPTP to end so that I can NOT be forced to hold my nose to vote for these people/parties!  We are forced to vote lesser of two evils at every election!   This time round: both evils are as evil as each other (seemingly)❌🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherAndrew79 The bill was a question of conscious and principle:  Does the British Parliament believe that BRITISH troops can go abroad and torture/ rape/ kill/ abuse all with impunity and no justice for the “foreign victims”.   I guess with Blair as a role model, why we surprised by Keir?🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachshabi They apparently want to convince Tory voters that they care about patriotism and “Britain first”  If you have to go against human rights to appease xenophobes, does @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer not realise that there’s a PROBLEM in the mentality of the British population? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Public_Pers @EmmaKennedy One thing I want this country &amp; population to understand is that the word/abbreviation “NHS” is now (and one could argue previously also) being used as.

<|startoftext|>@EmmaHardyMP Haha 😂   Which young people you talking about!?  Offspring of Keir and his cheerleaders? 🤨🤷🏾‍♂️  Haven’t seen any young people in circles: work/ hobbies/ family/ friends boasting about their “new found” undying love for #KeirStarmer and #NewLeadership !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @OmarBaggili @liamyoung I really appreciate this message. It’s tiring being in a relationship that appears one directional, for now im exasperated.   I’ll sit on the fence for a while and watch. Maybe the wind will change 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piecesofmeangel @Lewisno1fan Dare I say - #MeghanMarkle actually looks “healthy” and glowing .... the antidote must have been quitting a racist country that treats black peoples with contempt!  Good on #PrinceHarry for keeping it real and supporting his wife and son! There’s more to life than:🤴🏽&amp; xenophobia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @OmarBaggili @liamyoung Martin I wish I could find the strength to say “I will strongly consider voting for Keirs #NewLeadership” - nothing I hold dearly in terms of principles, do I see him and his cheerleaders stand firmly on.

Also you don’t know the circumstances of how the police was shot yet, focus on facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat Interesting! Good to know, thanks for the heads up!  It makes sense now.

<|startoftext|>@_itsdaniellen @SarahJo35135067 @JnrPhotog @Tom_Winter If the so called 10 good cops do NOTHING to reign in their 2 bad cops, you have 12 bad cops and a system that EMPLOYS “bad” cops, so you have a shit system and 12 bad cops, and a system that fails to correct and punish the bad cops and their employers 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahJo35135067 @JnrPhotog @Tom_Winter The tweet literally stated “RACIST police” NOT “every cop”  Please take the bullshit some place else! A black woman #breonnaTaylor killed whilst asleep by whit police men, just received the type of injustice even a dog would not get! And here you are brandishing bullshit❌❌🤢❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristinafortx Curious question, I’ve seen a lot of “we will do XYZ in her honour”  Are y’all saying this verdict is THE ONE? So her white neighbor get justice for being startled, but still alive. And #BreonnaTaylor gets NO justice and is 6ft under ground?   You will HONOUR her name!? W T F?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miroirdufou @StevePeers This is my thinking exactly.

<|startoftext|>@broseph_stalin What the hell was going on today?  What game plan was 'abstaining'?   I am really confused?  I get it Tories have a majority and were going to win the vote anyway.... but what happened to principles?   Do the abstainers believe that non-British people deserve NO justice? WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @DawnButlerBrent - Not going to lie - absence of Dawn @labourlewis et al - was a GENUINE let down!  What has happened to 'normal decent' labour MPs who are normally 'forthright' and not afraid to speak truth to power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie @MirrorPolitics Good point re: unions - defo going to sort that out as part of my life-admin days.  Yeah, I am also thinking Greens, bcoz Tories/Lab/LibDems are the same shade of lies, and they al 'now' stand for things I do not believe in. So looks like Greens for now. Need to read them up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie @MirrorPolitics For Real!  I could go on and on about how annoyed I am, but alas, I’m done with labour.   I’m going to start reading up the Green Party. At this rate, options are getting very scarce indeed!  One thing I know though is that I have integrity to MY black self, Keir aint got my back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie @MirrorPolitics The way i feel vindicated for never trusting this #NewLeadership Forensic man, you'll never know.  All the BS about "Get behind Sir #KeirStarmer"   He showed face when he tried to tell DianeAbbott to do one re: #LabourLeaks -that was the sign. Then called BLM a 'temporary moment'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Is she black ... and he... white ? by any chance?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@egm974 @StuartDillon1 You do know Labour @emmadentcoad lost Kensington constituency? Because labour voters actively campaigned for LibDems - as a consequence the seat was narrowly taken by conservatives?

<|startoftext|>@StuartDillon1 @egm974 The irony of her tweet is that Virtually most of #KeirStarmer cheerleadears today campaigned actively and publicly against Labour because they “slightly differed” in opinion.

<|startoftext|>@egm974 @StuartDillon1 Ahh indeed, play the game.

<|startoftext|>@egm974 @StuartDillon1 Narrative was made him to appear that way.  If people could not see the benefit to THEM of better funded services (For them), cheaper transportation (for them), cheaper education (for them and their children), less wars etc as a benefit for them, then I argue voters are a bit dim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 @StuartDillon1 Right.... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Anyway we move on, he’s no longer party leader.

<|startoftext|>@AJScattergood @HackneyAbbott 2/ Keir and his “form” of new leadership cannot continue to pretend they care when at every juncture, they opt to remain silent/lukewarm on anti-BAME discrimination, but very vocal on other forms of discrimination - exhibit A: #RLB “zero tolerance”, anything else ignored!

<|startoftext|>@AJScattergood Answer to this part of the thread is simple: look at his track record. 1) #LabourLeaks revealed make antiblack racism, #KeirStarmer wanted to throw the scandal in a bottomless pit, it forced @HackneyAbbott to threaten speaking out!

<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis The difference is it’s been delivered by “Forensic” #KeirStarmer , so it must be loved as the dawn of a new beginning, new leadership.   (Ps the new leadership started 4th April, not sure why they’re still calling it a new leadership) 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sabrina_Huck I’m beginning to get #MAGA vibes from #KeirStarmer and his “new leadership”- and it feels very very odd!  “Rediscover patriotism”?

<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams I find it hilarious that despite #KeirStarmer now having been leader for some months, they’re still shouting out “A New Leadership” -dear @UKLabour and Keirites, the New Leadership started on 4th April 2020. We are now 22nd September. It sounds like they’re still dreaming of JC🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani @Keir_Starmer remember when you activated and deliberately went against the labour party’s leadership- pushing through second referendum/ peoples vote- and totally did not believe in British “patriotism” which Brexit voters wanted?  And now you tell US to rediscover? 👋🏽😂😂  https://t.co/WcUZtU7qf3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Also the so called “red wall” gone (blue sheep voting for slaughter)- were decimated by Maggie Thatcher.

<|startoftext|>@michael_chessum I am keen to learn and be enlightened on what #KeirStarmer and Labour mean by “rediscover patriotism”  Brexit, conservatives, Nigel Farage et al, have been preaching patriotism already.

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @Keir_Starmer you said “you want the public to rediscover their patriotism”  Can you please expand and explain what this is supposed to mean?  we’ve already got #NigelFarage teaching us all about patriotism.

In Dec 19, I left the fence because labour sounded like they were offering something totally different and importantly as a black person, I felt like the party WANTED to truly represent EVERYONE equally. Then along came Mr Forensic who threw DianeAbbt under bus: Keir❌❌🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bencsmoke Haha 😂 a of truth in this tweet!  The “why is such and such not wearing a poppy on the 6pm BBC news” are the same brigade who will be calling ofcom to complain that alesha wore a necklace  Being racist must be so confusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlewishAnd @balfourbeatty if the argument is that @MPSLewisham is the one insisting on removing the murals and @balfourbeatty is suggesting that its “against their desires”- why doesn’t BalfourBeatty tell Lewisham police to remove the murals themselves? So we can see the wastemen police against the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miqdaad @Conservatives Meanwhile the tories will drag out @pritipatel @sajidjavid asians to speak on behalf of disadvantaged and discriminated BLACK peoples??  The point of the matter is: the term “BAME” throws all non-white into one basket as if we are ALL same and in solidarity- We are NOT❌❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMcKTFC @IainDale Hahaha 😂 touché 💪🏽💪🏽  Also when Iain paints #GuidoFawkes as the founder of “peace/kindness/warmth/love/Lets Be Kind and caring to each other etc etc.”   You can only conclude that Iain lives in some weird right wing cave with the likes of DarrenGrines (a racist) et al! Utter BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJBanksy96 @djn2911 @SholaMos1 what ignorant crap! Creating equality means braking down the INEQUALITY created previously by previous generations who were motivated by racism and discrimination! The system we have today was emboldened by people who supported apartheid in Africa, colonialism around world etc❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa lol😂Cyakora iyi initiation vow yabo ni interesting.

<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @thetimes Who write these articles “overburdened” and “underpaid” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  If any journalist working for the British government directly or by proxy wants to see what “overburdened” and “underpaid” means- I welcome them to my NHS trust! I’ll give them a tour of our wards. So out of touch❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Haha 😂  what do you get when you blend magnolia with a bit of colour? BEIGE! Still extremely DULL!  The equivalence of being fed unseasoned vegetable broth 🙄🙄👎🏾👎🏾  https://t.co/tZ5rsD3oqR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @DominicRaab @OSE_Yemen Literally!  Sometimes these tories tweet out of the rear end!   So @DominicRaab and his government are gleefully arming the world with weapons and bombs 💣- weapons that inevitably result in death and famine of countries such as Yemen, Syria, then they tweet “Oh it’s so sad”❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@le_rwanda We hear for you bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickjh @ThatTimWalker @pritipatel I don’t know why people take any apology from this gov seriously?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_oxford @nadhimzahawi @nadhimzahawi is one of the biggest liars this government has!   If Boris Gov needs to lie and gaslight - and they know Hancock and Raab can’t hack it, it’s always operation role out Nadhim - it used to be @JamesCleverly - the king of all gaslighting. Nadim has outperformed😎🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker So one minute @pritipatel says she “apologises unreservedly (deliberate) errors in the process” then it also transpires that she’s been (deliberately) using anecdotes and prejudice to deport people unlawfully?  Why should we be surprised though? Boris’ gov is about xenophobia ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sezibera1 @philclark79 @Lattif @nytimes I think the following are important revelations 1) contrary to Kigali assertions that #Rusesabagina voluntarily returned to Rwanda- its now clear that’s NOT true 2) being tied up, blindfolded for 3days - that is NOT normal proceedings for a “regular” arrest.  Strange by Kigali❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipHalton @RJLostInTime @ThatTimWalker @UKLabour ooops.... what's that?   Haha yeah, #KeirStarmer talking about No IFS and No BUTS...  Alas, some idiots want to stan, and pretend things were not said!  https://t.co/ddyrpfCdwC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen Its very clear who their target audience was- ironically- on one hand they are “sad” that Barbados is ditching queen (about damn time!) - yet they write these articles to their white mates, rather than appeal to Barbados/black peoples! Which Bajan identifies with armbandgate?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen For real! Their magic potion of smokescreen &amp; gaslight only works on their white people; who are motivated by seeing black people have amnesia about their history so that we stop asking for justice/correction of history books &amp; reparations! They want to keep photoshopped history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen (Very popular) I was meant to say!  They are doing their classic: shun and degrade #HarryandMeghan to make William &amp; wife look better!   They better know that as far as black peoples are concerned: Harry is spicy scotch bonnet (I.e. our kind of person) and Will &amp; wife= soup🤔🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen For starters the armband thing was major issue in EUROPE, not the Barbados - if they did a survey on "how many of you remember Harry with an armband" in the caribbean - most people will be like "🤔hm not sure what this is referring to", also Harry VERY among black commonwealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen I thought, "HOLD ON A MINUTE"... they've found a way of attributing this delicious demise on "HARRY"?   So they (British white people) fail to recognise that BRITAIN in its #RuleBritannia heyday was chaining/drowning/killing black people, and now its all somehow Harry's fault🤬  https://t.co/qEboFsNAHv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenpoppy100 @FurqanReisen The part in this article that suggests #Barbados is ditching the monarchy because of "Harry wearing Nazi band" could not be MORE out of touch!  Barbados is ditching the queen because of the HISTORY of the Empire in relation to its treatment of black people of Barbados! Not Harry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewhoatv “I don’t mean to be rude/funny .... BUT.......” (proceeds to say something rude and NOT funny”   “Should we have a chinese/Indian/kebab etc tonight?” (Also these bastards coming to our country destroying our culture, bring on BREXIT)  “It’s alright my love” (translation🤬🖕🏾🇬🇧)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnnypapa64 I remember this also! I was new to England -2002. Half way through studies they would give us milk! As a newly arrived child of asylum seekers- this was a god send for my family. Sadly very quickly tories snatched it away, all in the name of “we hate socialism” UK is rotten today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipHalton @RJLostInTime @ThatTimWalker @UKLabour Twisting truth? That is your endeavour not mine- clearly out of touch with reality!  The gov had set itself 4 targets before which they’d unlock and start school, of those tests - robust testing was one of them. Gov moved to open schools before testing was robust, Keir loved it🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/iTIqhOMyxN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @MailOnline 😂😂 @toryboypierce the answer is very simple:  She’s been checking her bank statements, pocketing money. Playing polo with her polo pals. Sipping gin+tonic, champagne 🍾 etc.   Where else did you think she was?   Handling a pandemic? How gullible are you?  https://t.co/XfmabEop7T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anna_itsonlyme I love the way the newspaper correctly confesses that the royal family uses their “diplomatic”’missions to keep ex colonies “sweet” this is a confession that says “we use popular royals to manipulate, smokescreen and gaslight ex colonies to continue kneeling before OUR Queen”❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJLostInTime @ThatTimWalker @UKLabour Did you hear me say “Labour is responsible for the failure of testing” NO you didn’t!  The gov had set the 4 obligatory tests that must be met before schools reopened, The gov with blessings from Keir opened schools! The teaching unions were overruled by Labour! There’s the truth  https://t.co/heNNCyVa2M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker It was just Boris in fairness! It was #KeirStarmer as well. It was a cross-party decision!   The school fiasco cannot be blamed on Boris alone! @UKLabour was a promoter of the idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Liam_Walker_ Hahaha😂  The rolled out a dough that a machine had pre-kneaded!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - Arent we so lucky to have these two indeed ... rolling out pre-prepared dough in front of cameras - such hard work😓!

<|startoftext|>@kehinde_andrews Can u believe despite “independence” (emphasis on the quote marks)🤨🙄- Black people in most Caribbean have been expected to kneel &amp; be paralysed with wonder at the site of this family👇🏾? A continuation of rulers who chained/shipped/ sold/ killed and laughed at black people?🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/laqjNmxYyT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenSh98863282 @DionneGrant For as long as Black people ready to kneel before this 👇🏾👇🏾 despite their history that we NOW know about where we came from and how most Caribbean’s came to be in the Caribbean in the first place. We will always be prisoners mentally and physically.  👇🏾this enslaved our ancestors  https://t.co/Pln7mruQlI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenSh98863282 @DionneGrant The empire was “clever” it psychologically manipulated blacks: we fell for it! They smokescreened our leaders with “commonwealth”: governor generals get to wear “a gold necklace” &amp; shake hands with the queen! Black people be like “ohh wow, that’s amazing we get to shake hands🥳🤵🏾  https://t.co/7tAPXh3ncs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenSh98863282 @DionneGrant And those african countries should be questioning why! Its preposterous that African countries are paying France for centuries of Robbery &amp; theft!  Also, this all boils down to leaders being dishonest with the people, what benefit does the “small black person”‘get from all this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_AMATA_YOKEJE Depends with who? 🤷🏾‍♂️😏😏😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@me_myself_ey3 @ac3k1 @willjennings80 @DionneGrant To be fair to him, I think I understand what he’s saying... most african nations that went straight for the cord (admirable), but they then went through decades of failed republics/ military rules/ corruption/ many lives lost etc.  Barbados has “built” frameworks to survive🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ac3k1 @me_myself_ey3 @willjennings80 @DionneGrant But hey... at least finally #Barbados is finally saying “we done with loitering and kneeling before your crowns and diamonds - begotten from robbing and killing black people. So bravo 👏🏾!  Better late than never! I still Stan for Barbados 🇧🇧! Good vibes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa So true... in the end tuvugishe ukuri!? 99% of messaging is now done via WhatsApp (not the phones built in messaging program). The other facilities that’s used often is camera and music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @JuliaHB1 Lol #DarrenGrimes - this doesn’t change the fact that you’re 1) a racist 2) champion of white supremacist who do nothing but hold black peoples and their history with contempt!  You can politely just descend back into the cesspit from whence you came!  https://t.co/ewBU2cmpYX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob So they want us to believe that files pertaining to the biggest PREVENTABLE human tragedy in the UK in the last 10 years, which could see private companies held criminally accountable were ONLY saved on “one” computer, “no hard copies” NO “original” paper documents? Horseshit❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ac3k1 @willjennings80 @DionneGrant Guess that makes sense - but as #DameMason said “loitering” at the steps of your slave masters is really NOT a good shout! That’s doing a disservice to the black: men, women children who were abused by the slave masters and treated like shit for being BLACK! Period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OgbeniDemola Black people &amp; their nations need to be TRANSPARENT about the dark schemes that happen behind the scene! The issue is our leaders are happily engaging with corruption from nonBlack sources (rich western countries) and China! The leaders are greedy and selfish, they sell us away🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardodurrant The answer should be: splendidly  Long over due, never understood why black peoples in the Caribbean thought it was a good idea to keep a portrait of the representative of the empire that enslaved them as an idol to kneel before, and a country to remain subordinate to! Very odd🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thePVCedrone @usanotokay @CNN With all due respect, Mr Ignorant, #BreonnaTalyor mother, friends, family etc and the black community at large asked for 1 thing is a priority: 1) ARREST and CHARGE the murderers - The USA failed to do that. 2) Indeed her family need to be compensated, a breadwinner was killed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KensingtonRoyal Haha😂  This picture is actually rather ironic.  #princeHarry successfully running away from William &amp; his wife and Britain.  The only thing missing from this image is the hidden bullshit behind the smiles on William &amp; Kate- the xenophobia/racism/ignorance/photoshopped history❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CElysee_ Is it a 🇷🇼cult🇷🇼 ? Is it a 🇷🇼monarchy🇷🇼👑? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Njye rwose Ndabona ibintu ari bizarre!  With that said: it’s a lovely picture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DionneGrant I’ve always struggled to understand why many ex slavery/colonialism colonies thought it was a great idea to keep the portrait representing their ancestors’ enslavers and white masters on their currency. And to quite literally continue to kneel/curtsy to your previous enslaver🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilliamsme @ProfMMurray #RoyalFamily thru kneejerk reaction lacked foresight re: #HarryandMeghan. They failed to think past Queen. The queen is popular not just becoz of long history of the Brit monarchy but coz of personal character. Charles/William lack charisma they’ll only pull PURE traditionalists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy Indeed as u say -people like familiarity &amp; 'common ideology'.  I doubt I will see Australia/Canada&amp; NewZealand ditch their white British siblings in my lifetime.  If it does happen, I will applaud, and remember this conversation. If twitter is still a thing, I will reach out to u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy And what was the outcome of that vote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy Considering Australia, New Zealand, Canada (white nations) always side with UK (when it comes to wars etc), this tweet of yours is VERY VERY ambitious.  However, Jamaica - that might happen in the near future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bb889p @thetwerkinggirl lol, so a racist is a 'tolerant' person! Right okay then, that's a new explanation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MouthfulofOt7 When it first started, non-white people had no clue what it was. Then every time big organisations were asked about how many black people they employed, they alwys replied "We are proud of our BAME employees" (referring to 1-2 ASIAN people), that when we realised its a smokscreen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Haha, the contrast in the attire both these men are wearing is hilarious: 1) Black man: Justice for #BreonnaTalyor and others killed unfairly by police  2) White man: 🤐🥳Justice for Petroleum?

<|startoftext|>@thomasbowell And I 'literally' use public transport every day -In the United Kingdom- but oh well, what do I know about the tickets I pay for.  As I said, go lie to someone else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasbowell Yes, you're chatting absolute horse manure about railway tickets in the UK. We all live in the UK, and use transport, we know the cost of railway. Therefore, truly go lie to someone else.  And if you're unprepared for facts, do bother patronising others with your nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasbowell And some people just chat shyte- like @thomasbowell  Railway tickets in the United Kingdom are exceedingly expensive whether you book on the day standard class or in ADVANCE. Advanced STANDARD class West Mids to LondonEuston= £192 return for a 120mile trip! Go lie to some1 else🚫  https://t.co/jymn8w3Sbi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ @NadiaWhittomeMP She should sue- the head of the organisation deliberately lied and misled the public (in doing so fed ammunition to Tory vultures). In the process #LarkHill retirement village lied about its PPE to stave off criticism and scrutiny. @extracare_jobs LIED!  Now theyre backtracking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_leesha1 @grantshapps when I make plans to visit people miles away, the first priority is: 1) Cost 2) convenience.  Graffiti has quite literally never popped into my head.

<|startoftext|>@rutembessa @nadinebh_ @JohnBoyega @LewisHamilton @naomiosaka @planetjedward I think its to do with the way Facebook is open to political mis-information. I.e. facebook is more open to political advertisements that spread fake-new/ propaganda etc - especially in the USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ @JohnBoyega @LewisHamilton @naomiosaka  and even @planetjedward got there first. But we do Stan, for those waking up. Albeit late, but late is better than never<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl The energy and LUST for xenophobia and racism is so strong in a significant part of the British people, they'll genuinely vote to hasten their own health and death, simply because they heard a non-local English accent in the bus/poundland! You go through do I laugh? Do I pity?🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl As a hospital doctor, I see these people every day, it is pathetic. They are the classic 'INGERLAND needs to be independent that's why I voted tories" - yet they're stuck in hospital because there's NO social welfare (free) bed available for them in the community coz of tory cuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe This @DehennaDavison chick really needs to get lost.  She's actually making a 'scene' about the word 'hillbilly'. Meanwhile there are 'actual' issues and problems in this country. One main one being anti-black racism. Have we seen this Dehenna commenting about StevenLaurence? No!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AttorneyCrump @AttorneyCrump the big question is: ARE THEY ARRESTING AND BRINGING TO JUSTICE THE MURDERERS?  #BreonnaTalyor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@manqobizizwes @Lungah__ Where did this happen!? Maputo??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmergMedDr But I thought the tories and their cheerleaders had told us that we have a world beating system that can test &gt;300,000 tests per day?   Surely it wasn’t lies upon lies upon lies? They said they’d strained every sinew to make it world beating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage Honestly mate, tell me about it. We (black people) stand here and we try to say “this is not okay” in response news channels invite gaslighters and racists to talk about our history. Recall #DarrenGrimes and his “hero” racist historian? Darren still gloats around unashamed 🤷🏾‍♂️❌⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage Im glad we understand each other finally. The ongoing #LabourLeaks malarkey is further testament to apathy - complaints and evidenced racism towards black people is treated with ignorance. There seems to be a deliberate disregard for antiblack hate! FYI A knee killed a black man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage I’m not disputing that Patrick. The issue I’m trying to highlight is the way antiblack tropes/racism are minimised kicked in the long grass.  My lips as a black man aren’t the size of half my head thank you very much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage The point is these caricatures have taken stereotypes and features of people and exaggerated them. Mark’s nose was disproportionately exaggerated completely distorting the image. The black characters also had their features exaggerated - none of the caricatures are good, the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage I’ve understood your position perfectly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning I thought it was Jeremy that was the cause of Labours demise? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage Right so in conclusion Patrick says - different energy 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - antiblack tropes “yeah but they weigh less compared to other tropes such as antisemitic ones”’🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ okay I get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusLogicall @GMB @calvinrobinson Where do they actually find these gaslighters?  So that wasteman telling me my african name has the same opportunity on a CV as “Boris Johnson” ?  Absolute bollocks @calvinrobinson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @nadinebh_ @SpittingImage Well I guess y’all need to be giving the same energy your giving Mark Zuckerberg - none of these caricatures are accurate, and the outrage is that Marks nose has been misrepresented, all the black characters have had their features massively misrepresented also. ⁉️Same energy⁉️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lewisno1fan 💯Honestly speaking, Ive started watching out for it!

<|startoftext|>@Lewisno1fan I wonder this -the normal algorithm is that “something that is massively trending appears as soon as you typing #XYZ” however whenever its controversial you start seeing hashtags with erroneous spellings, or the hashtag stops appearing altogether. Happened during DomCumming drama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour With all due respect - it’s a resounding NO from me!  Try the next client, if you want a purchase I’d advice someone who’s ideology is that #BlackLivesMatter is a “moment” and that Diane Abbott/ DawnButler et al need to shut up about #LabourLeaks.  Good luck 👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽! All the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie #BorisJohnson &amp; #Domcummings appear not only to have outsmarted the general public with a fake prospectus, it appears Dom has also outmanoeuvred the Tories!

<|startoftext|>@LadyPortwrinkle @yartsie123 @DavidOlusoga I find it incredible that people come out here celebrating and kneeling for a racist like Colston!  Fair enough he built schools and stuff - but hey guess who else built stuff: Stalin built metros that still carry millions of Russians today-Does UK celebrate Stalin?  NO they dont<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yartsie123 @DavidOlusoga money was made from CHAINING, shipping, drowning (the weak), selling to white peoples in Americas/ Caribbean for slavery and perpetual abuse.

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @philrees2010 @LBC @Ofcom It was complained about because they (white racists &amp; those who couldn’t care less about solving racism in the UK) don’t want to see their “Rule Britannia” reminded that there’s racism in this country. They want us to pretend #StephenLawrence never happened, we imagine the myth🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @philrees2010 @LBC @Ofcom He champions causes/people that sow hate &amp; division through the media.

<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy @EmmaKennedy dont hold ur breath.  The one thing I’ve noticed about tories that sets them quite apart from their labour counterparts is that: when push comes to shove, Tories are more able to hold their nose and stick together and vote together.

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Keir_Starmer I’ve read arguments from Pro-Keirs that the “long game” is to woo Tory voters- one could argue that the long game is working!  However what I challenge is: surely this so called long-game undermines @Keir_Starmer principles? Overnight he’s abandoned second ref/peoples vote🤷🏾‍♂️🐍🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UkSleepwalker Its actually straight forward; I would argue DomCummings has played a blinder! The overriding principle is that the British people (on the whole) are apparently more concerned about “foreigners” brexit handed Tories a life-line. Cummings is manipulating the xenophobia brilliantly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Keir_Starmer What is absolutely astonishing is that his followers are always ready to fall into line &amp; repeat with sheep-like energy what he says!  This twist of events reminds of #Animalfarm by #Georgeorwell where the pigs convince the sheep that pigs are better, and the🐑were like”ahh okay”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer 🤷🏾‍♂️ Lol @Keir_Starmer  So second referendums/peoples vote/splinter groups to threaten &amp; undermine the labour leadership (who previously argued that we must get on with respecting the referendum) are no longer required eh?

<|startoftext|>@DrSimonHodes @ruthcoman @bickypeg @geol_uk @pete3291 This is indeed true!

Notice that @pritipatel has said sod all about this clear cut case of racism! Not only are they abusing @SadiqKhan they’re calling black people C*NTS❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Solidarity!! Mindfulness helps me when I’m very very stressed!!   Do you have any quiet parks/ woods nearby?  Go for a walk.... calming instrumental music - sounds of ocean does it for me.... find a quiet spot, lay down, and just breathe!   Whatever the information, solidarity🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andraswf Love the way an assault on “them” and their “liberties” is being asked to wear a mask!  Meanwhile simultaneously they also bark “Rule Britannia” at any “woke” person who dares #blackLivesMatter🤷🏾‍♂️  Wearing a mask, is a bigger assault on their liberty than perpetual discrimination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad Mate why do you bother ? Block block block ❌❌  That Flynn twat is dragging you along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineFlint @CarolineFlint you brought it ALL on yourself!  When people speak truth and don’t twist and exaggerate facts - they rarely get piled on!  You sat in front of a picture of @jeremycorbyn photoshopped with a #MAGA🧢and verbally threw out bullshit!  Ever heard of “reap what you sow?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OgbeniDemola 2/ we cannot keep waiting for Europeans to write our history for us! Which means part of our problem, our absolute Achilles Heel is the fact that we (not all but some) are intellectually lazy! We dont want to do the research or work. We just wait for someone else to do the work🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OgbeniDemola One thing just occurred to me - the only way Africans can learn is that: we need to start setting up our own museums and libraries about african history and where things went wrong! Future generations need to understand why their nations are perpetually failing: Black Judases🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realdalegreenin @Link1709 @thetwerkinggirl Who said “EVERY British person is racist?”  Not every German was a Nazi - but Germany still committed the holocaust!   Rather than knee jerk to every comment about racism in UK that makes you feel uncomfortable, start calling out racism so that you can be part of the resolution🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @lucyallan The conservatives *VOTED* for the bill that was proposed and crafted by *CONservatives*   At the election they told the British population that the deal was *Oven Ready*. Once in power, suddenly the dish isn’t even at the ingredients stage yet! Utter charlatans! ❌❌🤢🤢  LIARS🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KRUZAA_ 2/ when we are privy to these situations and conversations- we need to CALL out the bigotry &amp; wrongness❌!  This girl sitting there nodding/ giggling/ laughing *ALONG* does nothing to help! Then she posts on Instagram for views and likes -what does it solve? Has she educated him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Lol🤷🏾‍♂️what are they suggesting should happen to non-white children? Not be alive? Not be aiming for grammar school? Not enrol in education? Remain sub-standard? Remain poor?  Seriously what bigotry is @thetimes trying to conjure with this type of literature? BAME success an issue?<|endoftext|>

That’s the conservatives and right wing mantra alive in 🇬🇧!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zulf_the_wolf @mrjamesob @LBC Glad to hear I’m not alone. Recently I’ve been on late work shifts so I have time to chill in the mornings... I hadn’t realised James had gone on holiday, so I casually thought “hmm let’s see what’s going on on LBC, opened app...heard Nawaz and very quickly closed the app🤢❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob And that the media will do his bidding.   And they can always be trusted to do exactly that!   The British media over last few years has done everything to scrutinise the opposition, and simultaneously shoe-shine the Tory brogues👞!   Part of the problem is the media complacency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErickWGN16 @egm974 @mrjamesob Do you mean Mr “I block anyone who disagrees with me/ or sounds more intelligent than me/ or calls out my hypocrisy and love for Tommy the racist - Nawaz?   Yes we’re all sick of that echo chamber of BS too🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 @mrjamesob And for MajjidNawaz the “I block anyone who disagrees with me or is seemingly more intelligent than me” to get back to his weekend slot and leave our Monday to fridays the hell alone!   @mrjamesob make haste and return ASAP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Dear @mrjamesob when are you coming back?  Every time I attempt to open the @LBC app and I hear MajjidNawaz speaking during your slot, its an automatic shut down of the app!❌  In the future please find a more palatable, less snowflakey (blocks anyone who disagrees) person🤷🏾‍♂️🙏🏽😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad In that circumstance I’d argue that’s great news - it means you were previously being followed by a twat! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Good riddance to racists and xenophobes I say! 👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lungah__ @ARISTOKRATLAGOS @OgbeniDemola Its actually nauseating🤢&amp; depressing😔-for as long as Africans have these (educated) Judas to shake hands and share company with, Africa &amp; Africans will continue to be: enslaved (psychologically &amp; financially)! If god is real, Help us🙏🏽! We need emancipation from black Judases🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OgbeniDemola Amen 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lungah__ @ARISTOKRATLAGOS @OgbeniDemola I dont understand some Africans...busy distorting their own history! To gain WHAT?  People come into Africa, exploit the poverty, exploit the tribal differences, trick us with money and alcohol, use us to achieve their RACIST and GREEDY desires! And this black man celebrates?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

Why does the @BBCNews get away with this kind of propaganda!?  @CarolineFlint you have utterly no shame! Spreading lies and pure naked propaganda! What exactly you aiming to achieve? He’s no longer leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARISTOKRATLAGOS @Lungah__ @OgbeniDemola What the hell is this? the death of #Lumumba was carefully planned and ordered and paid for by western powers: both USA and Belgium planned his murder!

<|startoftext|>@JohnEdwards33 @BorisJohnson 🤔 *rolls eyes*  its operation “roll out @RoyalFamily” to gaslight public against: - government breaking international laws - second spike of Covid19 - imminent end of furlough scheme   And of course the RoyalFamily seem to have no issue with emergency service getting pay freezes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Britain is really becoming annoying to live in for those of us who aren’t white. Any time you raise your grievances you get racists piling on calling you “woke/ chip on shoulder/ all lives matter/ shut up and go back home and all the rest” it’s infuriating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon It is therefore ironically the British general public who are clearly skewed towards racism who are the problem! If Britain took antiblack racism grievances seriously and addressed the institutional issue, the mistrust between police and BAME people wouldn’t be so acute🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Im Black, I have respect &amp; sympathy for the police in general. As do most black people I know. The issue about the police and black people is that when black people speak and say “there’s unfairness and inequality in the way police treat black folk” white people try to gaslight🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Haha 😂   Love this tweet! 🍃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon What’s this got to do with #BlackLivesMatter please? What’s the link 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Dragging black peoples into every situation of police being assaulted is a bit weird, seeing that every case of racism in the uk doesn’t necessarily invoke dragging the police into either. 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisK3454 @Sigbertganser @_Brian_Hunter @geol_uk @pete3291 Many trusts do not own their scanning facilities. These services are private and the NHS trust has to “pay” private company to provide the “service” it includes bringing in a scanner on a truck and parking it in a car park etc. Because NHS “pays for you” its still labelled as NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pete3291 @NoseSteel @daviesneil275 It’s a tragedy isn’t it.  It’s so so tragic that the desire to keep “foreigners out” was soooo strong that 1000s of British people decided to give charlatans/ liars/ cocaine snorters etc. The steering wheel! All of these risks just because the hate for “other” was so strong!😢🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlluraSea @Emme52294 @RyanJohn___ Allura as I’ve said - bye 👋🏽   Your chat is really poor, not meriting of any onward discussion.   Go be racist, but trust and believe nobody but trash of society have time for your bulls**t  https://t.co/SMnVZrQGug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker It was NEVER a fair &amp; honest prospectus. However the British Media made💯sure that it read like God’s commandments. They did partly by focusing all lights on everyone and everything but the conservatives. That’s how the prospectus was sold: by destroying alternative prospectuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Brian_Hunter @geol_uk @pete3291 Oh don’t even get me started! As a doctor it frustrates me the way they use the “NHS” logo and branding to brainwash and gaslight the British population! People come to hospital and assume “It’s NHS” - little do they know: a CT scan is not owned by the nhs, nor is the MRI etc😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bickypeg @geol_uk @pete3291 All those “Nightingale” hospitals- they couldnt attach an NHS testing centres? Nope, people have to travel 100s of miles to Newcastle from London to get a test? Others have to cross by ferry to Isle of Wight to get test- then they turn up: its closed! Hospitals meanwhile are 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Brian_Hunter @geol_uk @pete3291 Indeed! As it all beginnings to unravel one can’t help but see the MAJOR flaws in the government handling!  Track and trace apps - handed to private companies. Testing centres - contracts handed to private companies. You’d think we had no pre-existing hospitals and labs🤷🏾‍♂️! Weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlluraSea @Emme52294 @RyanJohn___ Girl bye 👋🏽   Ever heard of the saying “bad things happen when good people do nothing” - well guess what: she’s a good person doing SOMETHING! Meanwhile here’s Allura chatting sh*t  https://t.co/5r6aG2ZTlf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanJohn___ I wasn’t ready - does this lady have twitter? She deserves dividends for her show of strength!👏🏾🥳  Also love the way the male black guy was giving the “damn girl👏🏾👏🏾wish I had your courage” and some of the white guys be giving the “😶😔🤐this is awkward” looks! #BreonnaTaylor 🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/OfWx8X9fbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pete3291 I’ve been wondering this actually over the last few days!  Why the hell have contracts been handed to random private companies when NHS could have relatively easily set up NHS testing centres adjacent to hospitals where tests could be run quickly? They didn’t want to give NHS 💷?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl @thetwerkinggirl can we all remind Dominique that it was a CELEBRITY in the name of @MarcusRashford who managed to ensure children from poor backgrounds were FED!

<|startoftext|>@AnchorWindrush @kenanmalik @nybooks The plaque placed on the statue was a photoshopped plaque - it said “Colston was a kind and VIRTUOUS” man - it did NOT say “FYI the money Colston donated was begotten from chaining, shipping, enslaving and killing black people who are deemed to be subhuman”- so we must correct it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnchorWindrush @kenanmalik @nybooks “They are about memory” indeed they are, however the question is: who is in control of “creating and cementing” a “desired narrative or memory”  As @kenanmalik identified Colston statues was erected in response to civil inequality and discontent. They use statue to prevent unrest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks Also @kenanmalik I’m keen to see the evidence, literature and references used to draw your conclusions about how black peoples feel about their history. Are you black? Are you african? Was your nation renamed Rhodesia? Was your ancestor shipped in chains etc. Please don’t insult  https://t.co/vXQh5uPBnC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks Lastly, I agree that the issue of statues is complex, Im also pleased to see the recognition that statues are very much used as a political/manipulation tool by elites with power. There is certainly a healthy debate to be had about how BETTER to portray history going forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks Whilst the article is on the whole good, Im afraid it  appears to draw conclusions about how “black people feel about their history” from YOUR interpretations of how black people “might” feel. Would you dare write about your interpretation of how Jews feel about Holocaust? NO❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks You claim that “marginalised (black peoples) are not trapped by their history and nor is it a cause of trauma - hmm excuse me but which black peoples did you survey to conclude this view? Have you been to Congo and spoken to Congolese about #Leopold? Hav u spoken to S.Africans?  https://t.co/scjkCSf3ws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks The whole reason #BlackLivesMatter has sprung up in 2020, is because RACISM is very much still real, and many of those especially in USA who are ardent racists are people who glorify and idolise racists and slave masters - so you’re claim is disingenuous 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenanmalik @nybooks Good article, read it all, ive a few questions for @kenanmalik: 1) u state black people do not want to be deemed psychologically fragile- where did you get the survey data of black people in this regard from? 2) u claim we no longer live in society where racists are celebrated 1/<|endoftext|>

Bet it TalkRADIO and LBC nick Ferrari were on BBC he’d be tuned in 24/7 calling in to say “Nick I couldn’t agree more mate, these BLM protests can F off”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Do these racists ever stop to think what other “native people” thought when “Rule Britannia”’was going around enslaving people/killing people/renaming nations Rhodesia/stealing diamonds for the queens👑, plantations in Caribbean?  Yet they want statues of slave masters! Pricks❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bwaarner29 @TonyCowin @baileyglyde @thetwerkinggirl lol with the same token: I also pay for the license fee, and I don’t mind of theyre political, everything in this country is dictated by politics: education, social welfare, healthcare, elderly social care, what I can and can’t buy, etc - so I damn right want to hear all about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyCowin @bwaarner29 @baileyglyde @thetwerkinggirl British people are really weird - they moan about politics ALL the damn time! Their favourite newspapers put politics on BLAST all the bloody time! Everyone is political one way or another, BUT BUT BUT let’s mute BBC in case it displays politics “I” disagree with!😭 - GROW UP🤷🏾‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian lol - is it that deep?  The Belgian royal family is literally ONLY a thing in Belgium 🇧🇪!   And many Belgians couldn’t care less about their royal family... it’s NOT that deep young lady (whoever you are) 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gaemechanger @mike_adama The irritating part is that news channels keep inviting her! They are deliberately now bating and gaslighting black people!  What did they think someone like Dominique would contribute to the argument around antiblack racism? Was this their version of “balancing”? Damn them❌😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaamodUK Speechless 😶   Have they imagined if the word “Palestinians” was replaced by another nationality? What that would be labelled as? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Meanwhile in England on Facebook, people are arguing “as long as PritiPatel is on THEIR side” who cares what she harm she inflicts on others🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/l6KBic6cid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabrielquotes So basically: as long as she’s “their” friend - who cares what abominable acts she commits against “other” people?  Considering historical events in history - what a tragic&amp;sad view to hold by those individuals; is all I can say to this array of screenshots. Disappointing   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams Oh dear, poor #pritipatel - so despite doing the bidding for all the far right racist white peoples of UK -THEY still wouldn’t give her that crown jewel!? That’s utterly awkward ... so she’s just a BAME vessel- used to achieve their goals! Haha😂   @pritipatel solidarity dear🤷🏾‍♂️😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lewisno1fan The irony is: @dominiquetaegon doesn’t seem to realise that her “fame” amongst the rightWing white population is based on her perpetually “confirming and reaffirming” their racism and ignorance! If she dared to speak truth and reality they’d throw her to hyenas in a heartbeat😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon @GMB @kategarraway Exactly   Not mention they don’t want to be a platform where any type of antisemetic trope or otherwise is discussed and Celebrated.   But alas, its antiblack racism: who cares who they invite and what the people spew out. Antiblack racism is apparently a 🏓game to them! Shame❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HRH_BorisIWS Nothing was well said by @dominiquetaegon - the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon @GMB I’ve rewatched the @GMB segment over and over to try prise what @kategarraway &amp; her #GMB were hoping to contribute to the issue of racism in this country and I’m frankly lost. Can anyone imagine a situation where they’d try pitch lets say 2 Jewish people against each other?🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon We are getting to a point where news channels like @GMB “purposely” muddy the waters/ cause inflammatory bigotry and ultimately contribute to the PROBLEM rather than being part of the solution to racism! Racism and discrimination in🇬🇧has a political element to it: PERIOD 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @BGT @dominiquetaegon @GMB have u run out of black people to invite to discuss the issues pertaining to BLM and inequality &amp; discrimination faced by black people? One would think you purposely book acidic people to irritate and gaslight black people! @dominiquetaegon speaks for NO black persons❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon is an absolute pain! She’s always in the rollercoaster of being offensive/ stupid/ disingenuous- when it all blows up she offers silly dishwater type of apology, disappears off Twitter for a bit, then comes back being dumb again! Why news book her is bizarre🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenPartyMolly Hmmm 🤔 perhaps because he sold the country’s Gold for ... not very much at all!  Not very bright ❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddystone506 When I saw racist Boris and his clique of rogue men &amp; women, and I heard and read about his previous literature publications: RACISM in the naked form, I knew that there was no amount of holding my nose that would force me to vote for him! I’m glad I’ve been vindicated in my view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddystone506 The issue with The British voting system in 2020 is that it’s no longer fit for a modern peaceful &amp; relatively stable inter-European society. FPTP May have been suitable Victorian days due to external forces in Europe, but it’s not anymore. Also Brexit entrenched people further<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddystone506 Didnt u see it come?  When u know an individual has written racist material with pleasure and refuses to apologise and his party refuse to distance themselves from it, do u really think you’re about to vote for the best man and party ever!? I traditionally vote Tory, But not 2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @GMB @MichaelBoateng_ @dominiquetaegon It doesn’t matter whether BLM is political or not, the FACT of the MATTER is: Britain in 2020 still exhibits discrimination against people who aren’t white - this means RACISM. The people/organisations that can do something about it are politicians! Those moaning are disingenuous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Lol ..they weren’t furious for the covid deaths, they weren’t furious when a Tory broke the covid19 isolation rules, they weren’t furious when #AnneSacoolas escaped the nation without scrutiny leaving Dunns to suffer unending pain, not when Gov broke international law🤷🏾‍♂️ but now🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @NewTimesRwanda @RIB_Rw 100% correct my friend   Yet our police and RIB regularly parade people in the full view of the parliamentary members - with zero consequence   I think our nation needs to revisit AMATEGEKO Twiyemeje nkigihugu- are we a lawful nation.. or do we play with the laws as we like🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @NewTimesRwanda @RIB_Rw I’m glad to hear they’re being dealt with - i wasn’t aware.  Also here lies a problem - why do other criminals get paraded in front cameras and the police who killed people are dealt with “mugikari”! We have the right to know who the criminal police men and women are! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickBoles @adamboultonSKY Clever and well “read” and simultaneously having intellect smaller than a stamp .... is that possible?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  And why do your conservative colleagues permit the circumstances which has well and truly hijacked and kidnapped the country and its parliamentary institutions?🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @NewTimesRwanda @RIB_Rw 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  And the police who shoot people dead ⚰️?   🧐😐😐 - let me guess “no comment🤐”   Haha Rwanda rwa Gasabo, urasekeje 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Mate💯% solidarity! Funny thing talking about it now, it makes you realise: yes people appreciate our roles, and when they hear you leave, they’re genuinely gutted. But they’ve no insight into the impact the job has on personal life! My social and relationship life is also😪🤔😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Being a doctor who occasionally has to do night shifts- I can absolutely relate to this! 4 consecutive 9pm-9am shifts leave u completely wiped out! I cannot imagine what its like to have ALL your weekends gone like this for years!🤔  I find social life the biggest loser of it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 Also I suspect people saying that have not yet been in the same circumstances and shows of those with mental health problems.  There are some people who have terribly sad circumstances.   I do have wish for people better coping mechanism, and more things to value etc. Solidarity<|endoftext|>

It is very clear Mr Fox wants to live in an echo chamber- where on twitter people he doesn’t know in person: cheer and applaud his racism/Ignorance/bigotry. He relishes fake applause more than truth🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Never thought I’d see the day: criminals call the shots - all because our government @DominicRaab didn’t bother doing their due diligence and making sure a killer didn’t board a flight!   This case is infuriating 😢🤬🤯😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buttetscotch30 @tweeting_keith @RebeccaFront It’s mad isnt it it?

He is NOT a friend At all! ❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweeting_keith @buttetscotch30 @RebeccaFront Notice how in his replies he tries to twist the “racism” onto @RebeccaFront . I’m truly speechless.   Here’s Rebecca saying “I’m blocking you because I find your attitude and followership towards black people and their denied rights disturbing” then he’s like “🥳🧐your racist”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Im all pro freedom of speech etc, and do not normally advocate for silencing people . And I certainly do not have the solution, but I think there needs to be a debate about how to make internet and social media more responsible and a safer place!  It’s horrible what we have today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen We seem to be asking for suspensions and banning when it’s too late. The damage is done. Banning #davidvance now what does it change for the 100s/1000s of people he’s dogpiled on? The people he has hurt? And the hyenas he’s fed all these years who are armed &amp;emboldened with hate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen I would argue that they do more damage during their “tolerated”‘descent. Take KatieHopkins et al -she always danced around the edge of acceptability (she would avoid going far enough to be banned) but in the meantime: the followers multiple, her views scattered! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen The issue with the environment we find ourselves in (social media/internet) is that there are many divisive individuals with platforms. These people who have successively been suspended had a slow descent into bigotry/racism/hate. During their descent they rose in followership 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl I actually dont get it, what are these 7,500 complaints actually asking/saying?  The fact of the matter is: black people are killed by people in authority. The justice system also contributes to the problem. Why is seeing black people voicing their concern a problem for Brits?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YzallineU @rutembessa Can we ask the police this question? Please  https://t.co/dYhwlWXQi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendofBaba @Chris_Topper Whaaaat!? Cheese!?  For me it has to be ❌potato mash❌ 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - when my mum would cook it, I would actively search the fridge for alternatives, to the point of considering rice and baked beans 😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dchivall @AndrewP08138877 @DTraynier @OwenJones84 All JC haters love to pretend JC had all the cards in his hands!  JC should have done XYZ🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️, whilst they were all doing a Judas along with LiberalDemocrats!  Labour lost Kensington to tories as a consequence of Lab+LibDem stitch up job to get @SamGyimah elected!   Great job🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erictheacrobat @ItCorbyn @AsACyclist @OwenJones84 So Starmer throw stones at JC about brexit, forcing JC to start “something he can’t finish with a good chance of winning” by forming all sorts of proEU splinter groups. And now in leadership, Starmer is justified and allowed to abstain from the brexit argument? Okay then! Haha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rwandapolice Can we expect the same steadfast action with regards to the police officers who have SHOT and KILLED rwandan citizens “under the guise of fighting the spread of covid19” - what investigations are being done in this regard and  - where are the officers in question to this issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @danieltomsdad @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Good.  As I said, irrespective of ones sentiments towards JC - the LabourLeaks revealed a behaviour that is truly unbecoming for any party staffer. Abusive/ racism/ hate for contradicting view points and financial manipulation guided by personal interest! Indefensible to be frank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Denise__Headley @LBC Clever 👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Denise__Headley @LBC All you had to do was “confirm” she’s being paid.   As for your addendum - 🧐 what you trying to get at?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @danieltomsdad @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Hmm 🤔 they’re not THAT random - lol ..  they’re not Joe Bloggs from random estates ...   They were Labour staffers: with responsibility and duty of care and diligence to the party membership and the party finances - hardly random 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Denise__Headley @LBC Is Denise finally being paid? Because she IS CONTRIBUTING to the program!   @LBC has not made it clear in what capacity @Denise__Headley is being used on your platform! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad You missed #DavidVance the racist being suspended from twitter. He has steadfastly gone onto Parler to seek support from eels and vipers 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james__glen @hywel1979 @Otto_English @MikeStuchbery_ Haha 😂   All this while, whilst he bullied and racially harassed people, why didn’t he VOLUNTARILY free himself from (sewer) of twitter?   He’s an eel lying to his fellow eels about how he mysteriously found himself in a dirty pond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @danieltomsdad @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Lol ... also the extracts said “burn and shoot” lefty cranks - is that part of the optimism for: if we can graciously get rid of JC, we will do better next time?  Frankly regardless of how much one thinks JC wasn’t a great leader, I cannot understand any defence of 2017 staffers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @danieltomsdad @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic In LabourLeaks extracts are revealed where labour staffers are “gutted and heartbroken” that JC won seats, they’re “gutted” that labour did well here and there. How else do you interpret those reactions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Agreed. What went spectacularly wrong for labour in 2019 is that those who fundamentally hated JC went along with the Tory and media spins of labelling the entire ticket as communism reincarnated! The #LabourLeaks partly proves that to be the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic This was me exactly - I’m (was) traditionally a conservative voter. But when a man who has written racist literature became the leader and PM of the country, it was time for me to move on! ANYTHING SEEMED theoretically better than a racist in 10DowningSt, I voted labour therefore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic It is worrying indeed, some people in this country are truly brainwashed.  It seems that as long as foreigners are kept out, some people are prepared to he sacrificed for the tory policies 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neilush63 @PaulBrandITV She’s an MP, representing people, you’re just Neil - she’s 1000 times more than you’ll ever be!   Lol 😂  https://t.co/YuCbjkuXvS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume @PaulBrandITV What does this have to do with Diane? 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV What I dont understand is: the queen of the right wing #pritiPatel made an equally gigantic error with numbers (during Covid briefing), subsequently the hyenas that hounded Diane for a “number” misspeak DID NOT racially hound Priti- Journalist should be asking WHY that’s the case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @danieltomsdad @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic The alternative being: literally  - why should you pay 92£ from Euston to Bham? - why should students pay 9000£ for university? - why should there be inequality In the United Kingdom?   😂😂😂 More equitable country was the danger people could not tolerate! “God forbid fairer Uk”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Lol well it’s hilarious that the threat of cheaper transportation, utilities was apparently more dangerous than a no deal brexit, worse handling of a pandemic, and tories getting richer!  People who voted for tories must be dancing with glee at where we are at the moment🥳🥳🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Has anyone in labour actually bothered to find out why people who traditionally voted labour decided to vote conservatives, aside from all of us making assumptions?  Areas in the north east - is studied in Newcastle between 2011-2014 - it was the most Labour area I’d been to🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic So why did the opposition lose the red wall constituencies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I guess the polls lied then.   People in the red wall seats need to be interviewed and surveyed for why they lost hope in the opposition parties 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic Certain sections of the opposition were stuck in their personal desires to re-run everything, it frustrates the public, and the 2019 GE was a de facto ref in which the public Re-asserted their view. The 80seat majority has its roots in the People’s vote/revocation rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic What I’m saying is: In Dec19 there was no public appetite for a revocation of ref result nor rerun of ref, the threat of doing so by labour and opposition is what led to: JoSwinson losing her seat and Tories gaining 80seat majority with their “let’s get brexit done” mantra.🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STU_ACTOR @StephenMcGann Hahaha 😂 “Do not use as chopping board” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English @MikeStuchbery_ 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  One less vile racist on twitter. That’s got to be good news!   Glory to the people who reported the racist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeStuchbery_ @Otto_English Has the vile racist #DavidVance “genuinely” been suspended?   And it better be permanently! He can go languish on Parler with other vile eels like KatieHopkins et al.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic 🤔The rhetoric ive been hearing sounds like the principle not just the arithmetic has changed.  Suddenly the thinking is “the referendum happened, the vote was to leave, we have to move on” which frankly is what I remember hearing pre-Dec2019  Alas, the earth keeps spinning🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @ThatTimWalker @RCgothic I do have one peculiar question on 2020 labour Brexit position. It appears to be (unless I’m wrong) that “the vote has happened, we are where we are, we can’t change it, let’s move on” - how does this differ to pre Dec 2019 view and what was with the “peoples vote/2nd ref” stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @grantshapps “as long as I (we tories) stand to gain from a particular situation, regardless of how insane the situation is, the tories are prepared to go along with it! #tonyabbot could relish to suffocate their grandmothers, they’d still go along, if it means millions land in their accounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville I want to know who the hell received this hippo 🦛 of a man, and thought “yaay let’s give this 🦛 a license to go into our national park to kill animals”  We need to start focusing on those signing off the license, they’re the source of the problem! Countries need to be shamed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @LBC @DavidLammy Agreed!  Everyone on the left moans whenever tories are revealed to be holding multiple non-MP jobs - this cannot be an exception for non Tory MPs!  MPs need to focus all their energy on being Mps and representing citizens! Not on chat shows talking about Saturday “Lols”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Literally!!   So many white peoples in UK and USA seem more offended that: black peoples are finding voices and platforms to express their suffering.  Black peoples speaking out is causing more mental trauma than KKK and the police abusing black peoples!  Very baffling  https://t.co/zC17zsqKgk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joseph_gellman One thing I never understood about the “Eat out to Help Out” was why the deal was dependant on clients “physically sitting inside the establishment” to eat. They failed to allow for takeaways! So in the end to use the deal, people had to sit in confined spaces and share the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo This is sad to see! Whoever approved the construction 🏗 needs to be fired and prosecuted and the owner needs to relocate - the whole point about the national parks is to “PRESERVE the animals, NOT private businesses”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen They’re scapegoating at this stage.  Over the last few months where we’ve had relatively low incidence and mortality rates, what tests were carried out/ day? (To prove that truly people were abusing the system?). Likely reality is: when it calmed down, gov took eye off the ball🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @SkyNews @MattHancock I won’t deny/pretend that politics (especially opposition) is easy. The game play that is needed to attract AND RETAIN simultaneously isnt easy!   Keir plays chess on a daily. If I kneel with BLM/condemn Trump- I’ll upset Pearl clutching white people. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - Good luck to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @SkyNews @MattHancock Its mad isn’t it? I think I also heard the same debate! They have no shame!  Britain has become too entrenched with politics, I honestly wonder what it takes for their voters to ask “WTF is going on here” They vote against fire safety re:Grenfell and ask for applause🤷🏾‍♂️ WTF  https://t.co/FdOmCkfoSu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @SkyNews @MattHancock What has become evident from the sudden collapse of the testing system is that - during the time we’ve enjoyed relatively low incidences and low death rates, the lazy incompetent government took its eye of the ball, rather than build more capacity in the pause, they went to pubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @Keir_Starmer I appreciate that<|endoftext|>

Regards,  Fred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @Keir_Starmer I whole heartedly agree about the furlough statement.  In equal measure however, I think what happened yesterday in the House of Parliament is a travesty which I am not seeing much comment from opposition(s) at all.  The government admitted to breaking the law as if its banter🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willochelt @Keir_Starmer Lol  How’s the Labour MP watch going?   (Ps how’s St Michaels mount?)  https://t.co/GhMk0qNAWO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  The conservatives must do the right thing by NOT breaking LAWS which their party put through Parliament to become law.  And it would be delightful if you could hold them to account in that regard.  Kind regards,  The general public who are tired of this nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoePolitics @RealDeniseWelch Yes I have, done ✅.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @piersmorgan NEVER MIND “trust them AGAIN” - why the hell did you ever trust them in the first please?

<|startoftext|>@ChantayyJayy Brits elect racists like Boris who have written material suggesting that African nations need the second coming of white peoples to survive!

<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @DavidLammy @MarcusRashford Divorces/children out of wedlock/one night stands/ Poor parenting etc is NOT a black people problem!  It’s a NATIONAL problem affecting ALL races and creeds!  So racists really need to F off with all this targeting of @DavidLammy and @MarcusRashford and black peoples in general❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Why are some white people coming up here chatting shit specifically aiming🎯 @DavidLammy &amp; @MarcusRashford as black men; with reference to absentee fathers? FYI in my line of work in healthcare and all my previous jobs in education/welfare- I met many FATHERLESS white kids🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTrashiesUK @hugh_canning Have we all noticed how antiblack racism in the UK is regarded as "meh.... what-eves" by media and society"  This man used antiblack 'tropes', but there's no recognition by the British society.

<|startoftext|>@mattzarb Well said!   What is transpiring as the months go by is that- everything that the British media/ tories and incredibly Labour Party who disliked JC moaned and barked out was simply used as a ploy to: make the public dislike JC. Racism? Brexit? Economy? Etc As long as it hurts JC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 Let’s hope now the xenophobes can focus on something else ...

<|startoftext|>@Luispillo @Phil_Lewis_ Oh yes, and that too! A “woman of the black race”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scobie @acceber910 Good for #HarryandMeghan - shut the xenophobic loud mouths up!  And may I say - it’s actually an embarrassment that the RF even accepted the money!

<|startoftext|>@MweneGahaya @gintycyn @BusingyeJohns @Rwandapolice Killing someone as far as I remember in the rwandan constitution is a CRIME punishable by jail time.

<|startoftext|>@tjcbale @pritipatel The woman, @pritipatel, has MORE sorrow and sympathy for “a piece of paper with ink printed on it”  Than for an innocent asylum seeker mother who died under her jurisdiction!

<|startoftext|>@gintycyn @BusingyeJohns @Rwandapolice We weren’t “STARTING” we were ALREADY scared.  Secondly: what justice are the dead and their families getting?

<|startoftext|>@BusingyeJohns @Rwandapolice In conclusion: The people who have been innocently killed will get no justice?   The police will just get a “Sha mwabasore mwe, calmer vous avec les pistols”   Running away is not a crime in the constitution.

<|startoftext|>@RonwellQDobbs @GynecologistIm @andraswf @zatzi I’ve cooked chicken breast in the oven many times in my life time... the end result has never looked this stale/boring/disappointing. And if it did ever come out looking like this; I’d be consulting the recipe to see where It all tragically wrong 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hbirddog @MisterRatt @andraswf @zatzi Hahaha 😂 yeah - if it was a platter for bougie dogs, these images would actually be okay .... sadly it’s a meal for a family 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterRatt @andraswf @zatzi It simply looks awful.   It looks like the kind of meal I make for the dogs when there’s meat noone wants to eat and rather than chuck in bin, we microwave it from the pack for 5 mins (no seasoning, no nothing) and straight into the dog bowl after cooling!  This meal looks sad😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ 🤔🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tomaszjohn @mickhsmith @DavidOlusoga Apparently the dog in the foodless cage, that doesn’t get care will inevitably fail because it chose to “limit itself” when it was forced into a small cage and refused food by its owner. Apparently it wasn’t the owners fault, it was the fault of the dog according to a twat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @LBC In conclusion the right wing will strain every “sinew” (in the words of Hancock) to find issue with anything the “left” does but will act both: deaf and blind when there are MAJOR issues in their backyard!  It’s disingenuous, game playing, calculated. Not falling for it ❌🤷🏾‍♂️🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @LBC Then the next minute, he’s inviting Denise as his token black contributor because allegedly he’s steadfast against all forms of racism🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️- I’ve been round so many bends, I’ve just given up.   As far as he seems concerned as long as tories are in power, to hell with their victims<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @LBC Indeed, also I’ve observed his tendencies (I used to be a huge fan of his and lbc as far back as 2015). As country embraced tories more and more, he’s become more inclined to tolerate rightwing hiccups whilst trying to remain iron rod against so called “left” matters. Example 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @LBC Could not have summarised Iain Dale better than this tweet. On one hand he paints this picture of 'Why cant society just get along' despite differences in views/opinions etc. Yet simultaneously he is part of the faction of people whose motivation is offend/gaslight(#DarrenGrimes)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber @southwaterbars @UKLabour We saw what happened when people like @ChukaUmunna etc hijacked the system for their own gain. They deliberately refused to hold by-elections and transplanted their constituents from Labour to “TheIndependentGroup” - they subsequently lost their seats - constituents said: NO!❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber @southwaterbars @UKLabour Yes I get that, and all due sympathies go to Luciana, however this is not about a SINGLE isolated MP- its about a principle.  Politician aspirants climb the ladder by tying themselves to a party, in UK by &amp; large we vote for a party not an individual. You can’t hijack the system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southwaterbars @CllrJamesBarber @UKLabour What does pregnancy have to do with anything?  As MP u represent the people of your constituency or you don’t. You either run as independent or as part of party!   If you’re popular as you claim to be - let the constituents confirm that popularity!   What’s the ifs and buts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benphillips76 This video has left me speechless😶   I know the tories have taken it upon themselves to HATE whatever is not Caucasian, with regards to migrants who come to this country, however regardless of the level of xenophobia, @theresecoffey is UNABLE to show sympathy with a motherless👶🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liamyoung Every day with labour, one minute its 'attack Jeremy Corbyn and his fans'... then the next day is 'Attack Blairites/Keirites'  The 'Left' which has colloquially come to mean 'Labour party' is stuck in perpetual self-damage. The different factions cannot seem to sit down together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamyoung I am sure u recognise that the 'stop being an opponent' complaints come from both sides?  Im not a natural labour voter, never have been, i veered towards Labour in Dec2019 because the thought of Boris freaked me out (i've been vindicated). So i observe 'The Left' as an outsider<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamyoung Issue with alternative to Tory ideology (lets stop pigeonholing it as 'THE LEFT' is that- in the midst of its divisions - people who do not wish for Tory rule to endure, never want to sit down and turning 'conveyer belt of ideas' into policies. The constant self-attacks dont help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocrossborder @BBCPolitics Lol the brexit at all cost brigade have emerged from the eel infested murky waters I see.

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 Hear Hear!

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 As @DavidLammy pointed out Adele grew up in the “ends” and probably has a massive insight into Afro-Caribbean culture.   Adele wearing what she wore is cool.

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @JuliaHB1 I personally have no issue with what Adele wore. I’ve got white relatives whom I gift african themed gifts/ souvenirs whenever I travel to Africa and bring things back.

<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker "Stupid" is not a slur/vulgar/misogyny   Its an adjective used to describe something/someone that acts with a 'lack of common sense/ intelligence'  Prior to and at election, JoSwinson did act stupidly, the fact she lost her seat is a testament to the fact!

<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales What a ridiculous thread of disdain for #BlackLivesMatter  1) if black people saying “hey stop treating us unfairly” makes you suddenly see colour in a “bad way” then you’re racist 2) If seeing more BAME people on TV makes you feel like it’s “reverse apartheid” you’re dumb  https://t.co/Do9RNdEPFj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunking Let me get this straight- even those black people who tick the boxes (they put their lives at risk to join the establishment military stuff to make the establishment happy etc)....they also get killed?

<|startoftext|>@serialTweeper That one day will never come -bcoz they've mastered the art of divide and conquer.

'we (white) have to stop being politically correct' (translation: we have to stop respecting human rights for people we disagree with/dont like).

<|startoftext|>@SallyTheManc Not just that: White CHILD was armed, the police doing their curfew patrols SAW a WHITECHILD armed PAST CURFEW - the ARMED CHILD was not seen as a problem past curfew WITH a GUN.

<|startoftext|>@EmergMedDr It’s not just disingenuous, it is deeply offensive towards all peoples who were ever occupied by ANY European “empire”! Britain looted, killed, chained, sold (people), renamed nations (Rhodesia), subjugated people in their OWN land, when it had stolen/killed enough: it stopped!🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ayooshty84 This tweet is💯% correct   We do not care about them lyrics! British people can recite them as loudly and proudly as they wish!  What we care about is that British people: 1) respect every race as much as they respect their whiteness, 2) they recognise where empire got its wealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Do you not have a family? Friends?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misszing We dont need their compassion, we require “FACTS”! Britain didn’t come out of nowhere with an armada of ships to end slavery .... they had been gleefully involved in the chaining, shipping, abuse, killing and looting of black people! They stopped it coz they’d met objectives💰💸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Funny thing he fails to even acknowledge is that prior to stopping it: Britain had extracted as much as it needed from the blood of black people! They’d established their plantations, they’d build London, Liverpool, Bristol, they’d amassed minerals! Like a full cat refusing  food<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benwinston It’s a shame she didn’t copy and paste this time round ...  The stuff about coming from Slovenia to work in fashion industry? Work Harding for 10yrs to get a passport?

<|startoftext|>@walegates Even more to truth is: if I start a fire, use the fire to achieve my personal goals, then suddenly I see other other people creating similar fires to achieve similar luxuries, out of greedy and frustration, I start a movement to end ALL fires bcoz I want to be only beneficiary🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenKentish The science in the UK has been “constantly changing” because it was deliberately from the onset stapled to the POLITICS! It was never independent, it was never able to contradict the politics.  People like Jenny Harries essentially became conditioned into aligning with No10🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Lol - so Britain🇬🇧sailed the waves: shipped chained black slaves from Africa to the Americas and Caribbean, then UK would sail to London with the riches begotten from slavery, plunder, massacres — but we should rejoice that 🇬🇧helped to stop something which enriched them?

<|startoftext|>@JohnnyMercerUK They’ll still remain disparaging!

<|startoftext|>@afneil FYI   If you start a fire, feed it logs for centuries and then when you’ve achieved what you wanted to achieve from the fire, you decide to turn it off (because others are also now using the fire to build whatever they wish to build)  You’re NOT a hero!

<|startoftext|>@FirenzeMike Lol - is Melania holding a “Gun” ?   What a silly picture! I bet she was coached into position by a womaniser who wanted to imagine a woman baring her skin, admiring jewellery (betrothed by the said man) whilst holding a gun!   *shakes head* - pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 The bit where he says "Stop mooching OFF US"  Does he know what Britain was doing during the centuries of the Empire?  That's right: Not just mooching, they were killing, chaining, massacring, renaming countries, enslaving, building railways to transported looted goods etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 The bit where Farage raises his hands and gets monsterly excited is the part which refers to slavery.  They love this song especially for that particular extract!  Britons roll in glee over the fact they enslaved the rest of the world, looted them, chained and sold people! Lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Oh it’s racist re-incarnation this week is it?  A black man gets killed, and racists emerge from the dark murky waters like possessed eels to offer their commentary?

<|startoftext|>@harriepw When British white people are MORE concerned about Emperial lyrics that suggest "Britons should never be slaves, but Britons shall enslave other races; chain them, ship and sell them for financial gain, loot and dominate others'   than recognising #jacoblake #BlackLivesMatter 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche They must have shot through his spine, and damaged his spinal cord.  In medical language- spinal cord damage tends to be permanent.  America you are A MESS!

<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 Translation:   Release The KARENS!   Is what she's shouting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ When ever did the government say #BlackLivesMatter? I do not recall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusFysh @BorisJohnson In one tweet, this man illustrates exactly why UK has dealt with #covid19 so badly:  Rather than allowing science and medicine to lead in a medical pandemic, conservatives want to manage the pandemic 'politically'.  Apparently using science is 'pandering to illiteracy'  Madness🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Their voting records and subsequent buyers remorse with Boris suggests they are indeed less than smart.  I do hope they're enjoying the 80seat majority foolishly donated to the Tories, most because 1) Apparently they cant stand foreigners and 2) Appaz Tories better with security<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl 3/ PM Boris has put a Russian into the house of Lord- so much for fighting against Russian money/influence.  It is entirely laughable the way everyone seems to fall for the banana skins. Oh well, at least Tories are laughing to the bank, whilst decimating public services. 🤷‍♂️🥳🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl 2/ We had shouting, aggressive rhetoric from many other MPs &amp; the PM indeed, what has been achieved by the shouting &amp; aggression thus far?🤷‍♂️  Russia is still there, Putin is still there. If anything tories played a blinder: they fooled public, yet Tories take most russian rubles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Well your main grievance seems to be “it came up on doorstep many times” I.e. the people you were canvassing wanted something more than “let’s wait and analyse the evidence”  Waiting for evidence doesn’t =not trusting UK evidence Sending samples doesn’t =not trusting evidence  ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl MPs act for themselves, he cant control who goes where  Sending a sample,the UK already had a sample- makes no difference in management. He didnt suggest 'surrender all evidence to Russia and be left with nothing).  So the doorstep just wanted a reactionary person? threaten war?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl He condemned the attack and said let’s wait for further evidence to be able to ascertain exactly who/ how/ when/ etc.  What exactly was wrong with that and what did those shouted the loudest achieve more than those who didn’t?  Twitter brownie points? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariannaspring @BBCNews Whilst one is sympathetic about the loss of his wife - which educated adult walks around thinking scientists and doctors are lying about a virus!? But politicians like trump and Facebook are almighty and right?  Stupidity 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaudiaWebbe Exactly this point!  The issue isnt that its happening in America, FYI America is UK “best friend” (remember?)  In any case: the issue is that people of BLACK skin are being killed with impunity and without consequence by WHITE people! This goes beyond borders!  #blackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft Indeed!  They only want to hang out the white linen to convince the world “look at us, we’re lovely, we’ve got the commonwealth (our ex colonies love us), meanwhile they DELIBERATELY leave out the massacres/looting/chains etc!  If theyre going to hang it out, hang it ALL OUT! 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @viewsfromleft the irony of the white British protest over this debate is that they on one hand want to exclaim “we should be proud of British history”, yet when given the chance they only publish “glorifying” material  Where are statues of slaves? Where are statues of the loots?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncstone @viewsfromleft The fact we only have statues of rich white masters (with plaques not mentioning slavery) and NO statues of the slaves in chains says it all!  Britain went on a deliberate photoshopping exercise to achieve 2 things: 1) Convince their white populations  2) gaslight black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 @pettittemily Indeed.  It’s all a bit carnage - with that said,   went out to an Italian last week, and it was lovely!  The Otherwise (overpriced) pasta dishes were half price and the atmosphere was really good.   I’m not sure why Gov is making taxpayers pay for this?!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pettittemily @egm974 I am fully aware of that, the issue I’m highlighting is, they’ll process your half payment for sit in, and when you proceed to sit, there’s NO adequate sitting area that allows social distancing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidOlusoga It’s bcoz ur vocal, u say things that trouble their conscience! They’re not prepared to be challenged intellectually, therefore they wish to dogpile you, silence you, distress you, hound you!  Trust and believe if were on the other hand badmouthing black people, they’d love you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egm974 Some places really try to rob you and say “it’s only valid if you are SITTING in” (all the fast food shops), but then they haven’t got the space to “socially distance” sitting in clients, yet they refuse to allow you to pay half and leave.   Very very odd!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @mrjamesob - mate don’t confuse the American audience with the European audience.  In America, it appears to be the case that the Orwellian quotes work time and time again!   They’re on a different planet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Are british white people still having melt down and seizures about “we shall never never never be slaves”’(whilst we go around the world enslaving other people, looting their nations, chaining them, shipping them and selling them?

<|startoftext|>@n3fnbillgittens @OmarJimenez Stop venting, stop being upset, stop being angry that you’re being killed as though you’re a rabied dog..... “even though police shooting an over reaction”  An over reaction (not murder?)

<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Who was it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oflynnsocial Oi Patrick here’s a reality check - black peoples (and other BAME minorities) and there ancestors LIVED slavery, Colonialism and apartheid! They were abused, robbed, chained, killed INSIDE their native LAND! You and your ancestors benefited from the atrocities!   Damn your views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Will_Radley Yep be absolutely bloody proud of:  - plundering resources from others - enslaving people (whilst chanting in Rule Britannia that you don’t want to be enslaved) - robbing people of their culture/ languages - apartheid   If you’re so proud where are statues of slave ships?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy For starters - they were happy in their huts, speaking their languages, living their cultures etc.  Then Europeans came, enslaved them, made the work for products to be shipped to Europe. Shipped them to Caribbean to sell them as slaves. Returned in colonialism to repeat the deed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omaromalleykhan Gained a new follower👏🏾  We saw this exact behaviour with the “Boycott twitter for 48hrs” movement.

<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 You’ve to be the right kind of person for certain British people to want to help you: 1) are you a rich Arab with tons of money to invest in race horses? Property?

<|startoftext|>@bethwritesstuff They (British white people (most of)) want to continue living in the photoshopped modern reality, that: 1) Britain was never bad to anyone  2) Britain somehow acquired diamonds, gold etc from mines in Kent 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ 3) Victorian era wealth was begotten from ?Yorkshire?  They’re dumb❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverDowden @BBC 🤷🏾‍♂️😂 they “ADD to it” by erecting statues that: 1) photoshop British empire history to pretend “slave masters were “kind and virtuous” 2) history books that never expose the “plundering and looting” of colonies?   They add to it by bloody gaslighting descendants of the colonies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal 2/ the lyrics actually PROVE is that Britain and its empire builders were ALWAYS aware that slavery was BAD (they didn’t want the reverse to happen to themselves) but they were DELIGHTED to enslaves others!  In summary the past can be judged by today’s morality! RACIST EMPIRE❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal 1/ I’d never actually spent time on the silly “Rule Britannia” anthem, however now that I have (due to racists having seizures over it) one thing just became CLEAR!

<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ YES BUT:  They should be grateful, Britons (who shall never never never never be slaves🇬🇧🇬🇧) brought them: - railways (used to transport looted goods to ports) - buildings (used by Britons as courts to commend the ruled over) - schools(🤷🏾‍♂️) - subordination etc Says white Britons❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 Since English comprehension seems to be a problem for you, let me break it down again:  Julia HB, P Morgan and D Wootton are All British white people who have been trying to dogpile on #MeghanAndHarry for speaking out against racism and against a white supremacist!  Simple!😂😂  https://t.co/Gh0cyzNNX0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 Haha  If Meghan was made to choose between you and I - with regards to whom she wants as her teammate against racism - it most certainly would NOT be you Andy Stewart!  I can guarantee you that!  https://t.co/zhL0MRnPK9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 So you can have as many fits about this as you want. It doesn’t change the facts  British white people are today having melt downs about #MeghanAndHarry speaking out about racism. Claiming Harry and Meghan bring shame to Monarchy!   The shame to the monarchy is homegrown: Andrew  https://t.co/0j1H786hHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 Facts: P Morgan, Julia HB, Dan Wootton are 3 white English people who have been out having melt downs about Meghan being outspoken about racism and a white supremacist in USA.  It’s not my business that they’re all White British!  You’ve come here “extrapolating” for ur agenda❌  https://t.co/KUBmYz90wk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 Receipts speak for themselves!🥱🥱  💯 % Nonsense in response to a post about pedophilia - lets just leave it there!  https://t.co/9gWmf1To0m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 Cheers buddy 🍻 ! Ah mate enjoy the 10days! Well deserved. This year has been tough and shite so far! Any break is definitely welcomed!  2 more nights and I’ll be back to normal days! Can’t wait.   I’m off for a bit now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashtredame I’m a little bit baffled - there are many shows that stereotype out of satire for entertainment. Little Britain - they cover every cultural group in the world (I think). Ive also seen African stereotypes portrayed on TV: African aunties/ accents etc). Is it always WRONG? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 I’ve got a night shift coming up! Dreading it 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 Hmm - you lost me there!  It’s been fun exchanging with you (oddly enough).  But you’ve lost me now. So I think this is where I say - cheerio 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@planetjedward #MeghanAndHarry used their vocal cords to speak (out against racism and ineptitude in politics)  Some sections of Britain are as a consequence having seizures!   Otherwise, it’s all good! Happy Saturday 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1  https://t.co/6ZCgxYBw2p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 She’s called Meghan Markle.  Has achieved and will inevitably achieve far more than you ever will!   And she’s outspoken about racism and doesn’t want racists in the white houses! We applaud her for using her voice! She’s not Ariel the voiceless princess👸  https://t.co/8xv0ZeqqNY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DnellStephen @JuliaHB1  https://t.co/dd1OPLxOOj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English A good tweet!  Somehow you appeared in my timeline, I agree with your tweet, therefore I’m following! 🤷🏾‍♂️  Brits need to stop trying to gaslight society that being a suspected pedophile on taxpayers receipts is much more preferable to being outspoken against racism and racists🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 Lol  Yes she’s was “loved by the working class”  The same class of people calling a cunt and other nastiness!  Well done for loving her for however long you tried!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoncNorth @JuliaHB1 Apparently according to a politician wannabe   Pedophilia, child sex trafficking etc. Is 💯% nonsense! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾  No wonder right wing politicians who are arrested for rape are protected!  Yikes! What depth the UK has plummeted to in 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent 🇬🇧ur disdain for #MeghanMarkle and #PrinceHarry choices and decisions is bordering on: obsessive, desperate and unhealthy!  We get it, you hate Meghan, her eating 🥑,closing a car door, holding a baby bump, curtseying imperfectly, having a voice and using it was too much to bear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 Meghan closes a car door - brits lose their shit  Meghan curtseys - brits lose their shit because Kate curtseys further down  Meghan  Meghan rata avo - brits link it to slave labour, Kate eats avo - brits highlight health benefits  Britain - JUST leave MEGHAN alone! She’s gone👋🏽  https://t.co/hjM3dx7Fkb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1AndyPurchase @ognittis37 @JuliaHB1 Likewise mate! 👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@livinglifeldn @JuliaHB1 you’ve answered your own question:   “I don’t follow #MeghanMarkle or necessarily hear what she says”  So indeed you don’t know!  https://t.co/TxiCSeniti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1AndyPurchase @ognittis37 @JuliaHB1 Okay Andy ... make haste and get lost 🤷🏾‍♂️👋🏽👋🏽  https://t.co/pgOI2FYC3o<|endoftext|>

Intelligent  https://t.co/VLoDIeBlWf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilo_hunt @JuliaHB1 Lol Meghan holds a baby bump- Brit people lose their shit  Meghan uses black nail varnish - Brit media cry that she’s outshining Kate Meghan has a baby -Brit media call the baby a chimpanzee  Meghan eats avocado -brits lose their shit Meghan goes Canada -brits lose their shit😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1AndyPurchase @ognittis37 @JuliaHB1 😂😂😂😂  Okay   Being a Royal Prince Paedophile is apparently a “good”   Lovely to discover what Andy Purchase stands for!  https://t.co/OlosNqtlyV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexisLovesMe @faust_412 This is screaming “Dead Or Alive - PlayStation” - I used to see these high jump kick moves on DOA  https://t.co/vVgZxr4pSj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 Melanie if you’re racist - you’re racist, if you’re not racist - you’re not racist!   What the hell are you barking on about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 “In the hopes they get scared” hahaha 😂   You’re hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 Once again - clearly English seems to be far too intricate for you to grasp simple concepts:  If you are RACIST, you will be called out!   It’s very simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 Simple English isn’t simple enough - let me translate:  If you’re a RACIST, you will get called out by ME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 I call people who are racists, who engage with racism, who are dismissive of racism, who are ignorant to racism because seen it doesn’t affect them personally - racists because that’s what they are.  If you’re none of them above, you’ve got nothing to worry about. If you are🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 The proven murderers who killed British people were helped to evade by the conservative government - #DominicRaab 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - direct that at Dominic.  Lastly: calling out racism and not wanting a white supremacist to be re-elected is actually commendable! The end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanessaazahar @JackieC5225 @JuliaHB1 Hahaha 😂   “Your honour I have daughters therefore I can never be guilty of infidelity, rape, abuse towards women”   British logic!  https://t.co/0vVwbVtQFd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 And they’ll continue to do that and live their best lives...   Whilst y’all have periodic melt downs because they’ve breathed and spoken their truth!   Big up #MeghanAndHarry 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  And damn racists in Britain!   That is all!  https://t.co/G6Y2KrvKxK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erikk_the_Dane2 @RealNatalieRowe And racists going to continue being ugly, nasty, most stuck in shit jobs, hiding behind a screen typing vitriol whilst living in some council house!  And for the racists in mansions rolling in the money: they still ugly and pathetic too!  That’s all! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ #MeghanAndHarry 👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 Nobody got time for the racism!  (Obviously fellow racists may have time for y’all)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie40257513 @JuliaHB1 And by choice- #MeghanAndHarry wrote to the Queen informing her that they wish to be relinquished off their duties so that they could shape their own lives as and how they wanted!  They subsequently left this country that called their baby a chimpanzee, yet Brits still hound them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@switch3010 @JuliaHB1 Seems to me you need to jog on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rkhargreaves @JuliaHB1 It has been white peoples I’ve seen tweeting vitriol towards #MeghanAndHarry  Last time is checked: Piers, Julia, Dan Wootoon were all white people!   So yes it is WHITE English people who are pissed off that Meghan and Harry do not wish for USA to elect a white supremacist! Next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ihwalker @JuliaHB1 It’s Prince Harry who’s married to Meghan and who’s the father to Meghans baby.  Your emotions and feelings about their relationship is pretty much unnecessary and very much a waste of your time.  They’re out living their lives, fighting injustices!  Sorry that makes you feel meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@switch3010 @JuliaHB1 And most Americans of black heritage (a community Meghan belongs to) have had enough of racism in america! And they’d like to see the end of Trump and his divisive politics!   Secondly, Meghan is American and can do as she wishes in America, sorry that upsets White British people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smudge90210 @JuliaHB1 Regardless of who #MeghanMarkle is married to: she is calling out A RACIST WHITE SUPREMACIST who is intent on fuelling racism in USA and beyond!  #Trump is a racist- PERIOD!  Are white Brits telling us that in hindsight if RF had called out Hitler they’d be pissed off? Answer:❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThaiBill2 @JuliaHB1 Then feel free to jog on off my timeline!  Did I ask you to stop by?  It’s not my fault your role model Julia asked you to come here, you should have said no!  Bye 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SChristyJones @JuliaHB1 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Go report me, sounds like you’ve got a case  👮🏽‍♂️ @metpoliceuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @JuliaHB1 lovely -thanks for confirming what I already knew! You carry on flying the flag for PrinceAndrew.  Meanwhile your nasty hate towards #MeghanMarkle - give it a rest!  Meghan is doing far more than you are to contribute to a better world! A more equal world without racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Yep👍🏼  The great reminder that white peoples in England find #MeghanMarkle wanting to see the end of racism in USA and beyond more disgusting and emboldening.....  Than fact the British royal family has a pedophile within its castles! A pedophile befriender on taxpayers receipt😂  https://t.co/f1wB2Ka1hn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @JuliaHB1 @danwootton Meanwhile Britain has a royal #PrinceAndrew who is highly suspect for being a paedophile still being spoon fed by the taxpayer!  But apparently #MeghanMarkle &amp; #PrinceHarry bring the royal family into disrepute for being passionate about ending racism in USA (and UK)!   ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/PaaLzM2wJI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Waking up from a medical night shift to see white peoples like @piersmorgan @JuliaHB1 @danwootton losing their shit over an American black woman married to a British man commenting on the possibility that a RACIST WHITE SUPREMATIST might be re-elected?!  REALLY?🤷🏾‍♂️Y’all 💓RACISM🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/WA0CNhPvIb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaC40673026 @moribund137 @danieltomsdad @Nigel_Farage @AngelaC40673026  Great question - lets what she comes up with!?  Has any immigrant asked to: 1) stop eating Sunday roast? 2) stop getting pissed at the pub? 3) stop having children? 4) stop kneeling for the queen and Prince Andrew? 5) ordering in an Indian takeaway etc?   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kev_gillespie @piersmorgan Im nodding along too🤷🏾‍♂️🤔  You’re spot on the internet is a massive factor.  I would also argue personally that in hindsight RADIO MEDIA played a HUGE part! Theres a reason why #LBC &amp; JHBrewer’s TalkRADIO popularity rose dramatically recently. Radio platformed Farage, KHopkins❌🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sleafordmods Whenever I come across a tweet that makes a lot of sense - I like +/- follow   On this one - I’ll do both the both!   Happy Friday! And well done for summarising England so succinctly 🤷🏾‍♂️💪🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kev_gillespie @piersmorgan Indeed buddy!  I find it particularly ironic that we are all in hindsight exclaming “OMG how did we end up here? How are people so dumb? Why do we have racists on the tube singing to BAME “you’re my pet animal &amp; you will be sent back home” We elected these people in full knowldge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan They’re dumb because we’ve enabled and elected leaders who “normalise” stupidity! the most “admired”nations in the world- USA &amp; UK have simultaneously elected men who: 1) normalise racism  2) normalise peoples inner bigotry  3) repeatedly fail and coverup  We’ve settled for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Its bewildering to see  that lady casually throwing around that Nazi remark! I remember visiting a concentration camp near Berlin called Sachsenhausen when I was still in school. I learnt the horrors and learnt the “meaning” behind the term! I’d never use it, why can’t she see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Black peoples have their experiences of racism and discrimination GASLIGHTED every day in this country!  No one boycotts anything in solidarity or protest.  We regularly get historians platformed to tell black people they’re “DAMNED”’for still being alive -so plz don’t downplay❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Appreciate the outrage, and sympathise with the seriousness as well.  But let me point out very straightforwardly you’re assertion that “no other minority” experiences this is misplaced   Have you tried being BLACK for a week? Or engaging with antiBlack blindspots all over UK?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @TheMendozaWoman The way its being intentionally ignored gives the narrative that she's: 1) Not Jewish and that 2) She's the next Hitler   Observation from afar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews I thought it was 'Good riddance' to #HarryandMeghan?  Why is British media still stalking these people?  Meghan wasnt able to curtsey/ hold her baby bump/ eat avos/ be skinny/ be demure/ refrain from closing car door etc as well as Kate could. Harry wasnt a pedophile enough?🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepsafeandkind @toryboypierce @jeremycorbyn Oh because he has used his voice as an MP to comment on issues affecting people of this country, he's undermining?  Blissfully, JeremyCorbyn haters want to forget that he's an MP, he has a duty to represent 'people' of this country. He is ENTITLED to speak out like every other MP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @jeremycorbyn Lol People could also ask  Why is the media and right-wingers 'bellyaching' about a pensioner, who is no longer a party leader, who is no longer applying to become PM.  Also PS: #JeremyCorbyn massively increased Labour party voter number in 2017!  Next!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@afuahirsch Big UP @afuahirsch in the African themed #Kitenge dress!  Can we normalise Black people in the Western world representing the motherland? Will go a long way in breaking down stereotypes!  That's all i wanted to say! Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili After dropping bombs, WEST once again CHERRYPICKS another leader.. feeds them sugar also for 10-20yrs, then West cries "Omg look, its a dictator, we must stand with the oppressed"....West arms 'the oppressed' -another WAR happens, WEST 'BOMBS' again.  REPEAT!🥳🥳👏 IanDunt claps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili It is not just ME, Africa is another rugby field for the West.  The strategy is simple: pro-up WESTERN cherrypicked 'leaders' - those leaders are fed sugar that develops them into 'dictators', West comes promising locals 'CHANGE'= REGIME change =internal WAR, West drops 'bombs'🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarBaggili Indeed!  We had #Trump the racist let the mask slip on his recent speech where he said “we’ve got the oil” (which is literally the reason why the western world continues to fuck up the world: for resources that they DO NOT Inherently have themselves) - Ian then trying to gaslight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @DanReast That’s the biggest tragedy of it all.   They all want a fairer world, a more equal society, opportunities for all, end to wars etc etc etc.   Yet they also want to cancel each other with full might and enthusiasm.   Not really sure what’s going non to be honest. It’s a turn off🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @DanReast When we say things: whether out passion on steroids, anger, frustration etc. We should reserve space for understanding and dialogue.   In any case the to and fro between her/ her fans and the offended is showing how everything in this country very quickly becomes profound &amp; nasty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @DanReast Been observing this snowball growing over last 2 days.  One thing is evident -society has lost the ability to be civil and dialogue seems to be a thing of the past🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I do think the tweet was wrong and insensitive, she ought to consider grievance from Jewish ppl and apologise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaigeMASTERS5 @mojidaniels God can we trade #HarryandMeghan for the royals that remained in England?  The waving, curtsying, being slim and holding bumps the right way, pedophiles in pizza express going for casual shooting weekends etc. are no longer cutting it anymore !   We want REAL humans with emotions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Lol Ian Dunt with a very deluded &amp; gaslighting comment about why people are migrating!

<|startoftext|>@Jo_McGinn @lewis_goodall Oh right. Crikey I am with you now!  Changes story completely.  It sounds like his circumstances can only be resolved with resolution from @GavinWilliamson and the university in question. Appalling circumstance to be in!  Also I wonder if the @TheBMA can give any advice/support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_McGinn @lewis_goodall Okay, tricky situation.  The way things are looking, he needs to get his grades confirmed by exm board.  Since the gov u-turn it appears that 'most' unis are honouring offers that they made (either this yr or offering deferral to nxt year).  Has he contacted MP to chase up case?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Doctor here -   What exactly is the situation?  He passed interview, had offer but has been shafted by the system?   Was his grades downgraded by the algorithm?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @lewis_goodall Lol, Once again (as if further proof was required)  RightWingers getting triggered that their ideological leaders and parties are failing, and the failures being laid bare for the public to see.

<|startoftext|>@iamntyrell Meanwhile.... the world falls silent at antiblack abuse.  I wasn't even aware that Lebanon shipped in 'maid' (aka house chore slave) from Africa.

<|startoftext|>@moribund137 @danieltomsdad @Nigel_Farage Translation: Integration fails because some natives don’t want integration.

<|startoftext|>@AHizanidis exactly what I thought about this article.  It is the classic “My way or the high way” followed by a multitude of attacks on those who he perceives to be against his ideology &amp; narrative.   These self centred men in suits with columns in newspapers love to gaslight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob They are using the pandemic to enrich themselves, so that when its all over - they’ll have renovated their tired mansions/ manor houses.

<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy And the media LOVES giving him a pass every time he goes on his disappearance acts!  Britain has been largely failed by the media! But then why should I be surprised?

<|startoftext|>@stayontheleft How did the entire Boris government get to be in power?  Answer: for a long time (years) Britain blindly enabled through MSM @LBC normalisation of bigotry, xenophobia and racism: by hiring NigelFarage and KatieHopkins - this was a prelude to the Brexit malarkey! And TA DAH🤷🏾‍♂️🥳🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @SholaMos1 @afneil I agree with vetting! Western countries need to follow the international law on refugees/ migrants -receive the application, assess whether the application is genuine, run it through home office, then reject or accept! None of this drown at sea stuff!  I dont know why its so hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @SholaMos1 @afneil If you come from an English speaking ex colony - your aim is to go to a destination where the ability to restart your life is simplified (path of least resistance) this is why if you look below the surface every european nation has a pattern of immigrants (ex colonies)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @SholaMos1 @afneil The contribution of context I can add to this is: Migrants/asylum seekers as @SholaMos1 ‘can and do’ have destinations! Take a migrant from a British ex-colony- They will by default set off with plan to go UK (Not France, Italy, Austria, Holland). There’s a lot of context<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_am_sam82 @skiologist This is very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_am_sam82 @skiologist 100% agreed!  The issue is that the British PEOPLE, elected well known charlatans! We knew Boris was racist - but he was elected anyway. We knew VoteLeave through DomCummings was corrupted - but British people vote for Boris (and Cummings).  Therefore, Brits failed themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbutton2 @GaryCul98485992 @JohnMCG18081691 @pritipatel The BAME vs BAME infighting is similar to women vs women in the workplace many years ago. Admittedly women have moved forward and now on the whole women PULL up other women.  For BAME people, they're still stuck in the 'I've got to enjoy the luxuries before others get here👑🥳🥇"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbutton2 @GaryCul98485992 @JohnMCG18081691 @pritipatel Priti Patel displays common symptoms in many BAME people who are givenplatform by 'distinguished' (rich) natives!

<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @BBCNewsPR @minnierahman handled that stupid question by BBC very very well indeed!

<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy there’s the answer to ur shock! The past few years has seen the UK population conditioned into a mentality of “as long as im okay, fuck everyone else” that mentality extends to fellow less privileged Brits, and its worse for non “natives”! Farage and Hopkins were also normalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalumKirkcaldy Are you GENUINELY😶gobsmacked?  Have u been absent in this country for the past few years?  Our PM has written literature saying: “black people have lower IQ than white people”... “Africa needs the white man to return and run them”, “Muslims are bank robbers” UK PM is RACIST🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@caldyr99 @edwardpoole1975 It’s unnecessarily complicated and genuinely causes risk to patient!   The NHS is supposed to be a public organisation. It needs better streamlining! All the fragmentation is a major risk to patients and governments (evidently not the tories) need to safeguard it! Not fragment it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryCul98485992 @ElaineDavies943 @pritipatel Hmm I think Elaine was being sympathetic - or am I wrong?   I think she was suggesting: the migrants are families that want to “give” not just “take”?  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ Perhaps I’m naive and I read it wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElaineDavies943 @GaryCul98485992 @pritipatel The point about immigration/asylumseekers is that by international law/convention, a nation is obliged to 'PROCESS' the application, and then decide to reject if they wish to.  Priti Patel, championed by racist farage ET AL does NOT even want to PROCESS the applications!  TRAGIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryCul98485992 @pritipatel She is a disgrace to ALL so called “non-natives” who for whatever reason travel here looking for better life/ safety!  These very people that Priti Patel has sent the ROYAL AIR FORCE against could very much represent HERSELF and her family when they were seeking safety!  DISGRACE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kel_audio @edwardpoole1975 This is the issue with the “invisible privatisation” that Patients and the public never see!  Each NHS trusts ends up tied to contrasting private company to supply their IT program etc. It’s a bit like in a family household everyone having their own: TV/WIFI/utilities provider🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kel_audio @edwardpoole1975 It was just a general addition to the stupidity in the NHS!  This August thousands of doctors in training rotated to different hospitals. Despite being qualified medically, the new systems render a DR useless for the first week or 2 -in that time MANY errors are made! It’s dumb🥵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon I keep seeing people posting it about it and I wonder if it’s a conspiracy?   Meanwhile I’ve seen daily barrage about Belarus. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kel_audio @edwardpoole1975 We DRs do NOT need hospitals within same region to have: different investigation request software, different EPMA prescribing softwares, different names for same drugs on EPMA!  This leads to ERRORS and impacts patient SAFETY! How can Dr locum at trusts with such divergence?❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @edwardpoole1975 talk about the division between NHS trusts! This August started at a hosp 8miles from my previous 1: guess what?  - NEWS charts are different - clinical portal software is diff  - investigations request software diff  - prescription software diff Patient safety🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Even more reason why we need more people like @DawnButlerBrent @HackneyAbbott @zarahsultana @labourlewis in politics.

<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @viewsfromleft @DontDivideUsNow Claire you can hark all you like - you’ve made your position on racism very clear to me: according to you calling out racism in the workplace is “re-education campus”!

<|startoftext|>@eLHAMiiD @Baker_Reports People wanting to get rid of a corrupt political system is not “what is wrong with Africa”  The turning of blind eye towards corruption, nepotism, dictatorship etc is the real “What’s wrong wi ty Africa” that should have been asked MANY years before leaders become dictators🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @DontDivideUsNow Being biased and being RACIST is NOT the same thing!  One would hope that someone destined for the House of Lords would understand something this fundamental point!  RACISM and DISCRIMINATION based on race is not mere “bias”!  Your attempt to blur Racism with bias doesn’t wash❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @DontDivideUsNow Claire- in workplaces I’ve witnessed and called out racism!   Calling out racism is not “re-educating” people! And frankly if someone intrinsically thinks that their “whiteness” makes them superior to a nonWhite person - then they do need re-education!  We are NOT in Nazi Europe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @DontDivideUsNow With respect - asking racist people to stop being racist and to stop discriminating others is NOT “re-education campus”   But alas there we have it - someone promoted by Boris into House of Lords would happily want to see racism prevail in the United Kingdom 👏🏾!

<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @DontDivideUsNow Lol - are you and your people upset that people are being asked to be “anti racist” .... absolute ignorance / sympathy towards discrimination and racism! 🤔🤔  Very very odd issue to be frustrated by!

<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM @AndyBurnhamGM any chance you could be leader of the Labour Party?  At this point in time, I’m finding myself represented by your commitment to the students of this country!   Keep it up! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMoonie @truemagic68 @piersmorgan Lol 😂   Alright Dave   Apparently only your son and his friends worked hard! The rest of the UK 🇬🇧 just sat at home, doing nothing.   👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hilarybennmp This latter issue could have been Completely avoided had the gov &amp; minister CONSULTED with universities &amp; UCAS!   UCAS and universities should have delayed revealing offers! Results should have been announced, appeals processed and then Unis pledge offers!   Absolute FAILURE🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenitinsawhney They’d send out a Royal Air Force plane to hover above the waters, causing waves 🌊 - waves that will ultimately fatigue and tire those attempting to stay afloat.   They’ll then present their glorious work to Nigel Farage the apparent arbiter of UK sea patrol for merit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMoonie @truemagic68 @piersmorgan What nonsense! My son this, my sons friends that!  The world doesn’t revolve around your perfect family &amp; close circles!   The algorithm was unfair and based its calculations on ghost students from previous years. This largely benefits historically well performing school alone❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I second this question by @piersmorgan - at SOME POINT surely even the diehards of Tory voters recognise that this fiasco is💯% UNTENABLE!?  Unlike covid19 where the argument was “noone saw it coming, unfair to hold gov to account”, this results drama was foreseeable! They f’d it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qsteph Meanwhile the very same racists who hate “immigrants” so much will be the first to tell us how much they’re looking forward to going Australia/Canada to find a better “life” where their cash goes further. Apparently only white British people should be able to seek better life🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPugh Haha wow 🤭🤭🤭  Receipts 🧾 the absolute best thing in the world!   So according to Keirites - it’s okay to spend every waking day of Jeremys leadership harrassing and hounding him. But should anyone criticise Keir - they lose their shit?  Lesson: what goes around comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Literally this!! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  I went through a period of being frustreated, confused, angry, depressed (ON BEHALF of the less fortunate) - but then I realised - hold on a minute - British people voted for this shitshow! All because they want to stick 2 fingers up to foreigners 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️enjoy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Ava how do u find the energy for these ignorant white men? And literally why is it always white men who on the whole antagonise?  Here we have a very clear situation: a  white supremacy racist male attacks a group of black boys racially, but white men now pulling “MH” card🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P_JVGestel @pktheterrible @kiddosyaknow Haha trust a Belgian to come weighing in with “whataboutery”  Can we all just accept that: if that racist had minded the gap, and minded his business, those boys would have also minded their business and minded the punch?  Why do people feel need to come out defending idiocy?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoContextPMQ @nadinebh_ @pktheterrible Mind the gap got me!  For the life of me, I’ll never understand - WHY WHY WHY do people aspire to be racist xenophobes?  Whats the benefit? Eating toad in a hole for breakfast, lunch and dinner with side serving of granule gravy? Seriously?🤔  Dear racists, please mind the gap🤷🏾‍♂️!  https://t.co/JD24AXrRov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber For a start you’re more vocal than most on the fundamentals.   I was pleased to see your dismay with the antiblack racism and your words of sympathy. More than can be said for many Labour MPs/ councillors at this point in time!  Sadly, results of progress can be small! Keep it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Serious question- at a time like this, having seen how passionate @AndyBurnhamGM is about this #ResultsDay travesty -why cant Andy be the LOTO?  I want a leader who shows passion, who convinces me he/she understands how I and victims of injustice feel. RIGHT NOW Andy is RIGHT!🙏🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcash How can people amplify things that don’t make sense or things that do not fundamentally resonate with us?  What exactly do u want us to amplify?

<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat If she couldn’t swim (in fact regardless of her ability to swim) isn’t this .... attempted murder or act to cause significant harm?   What is the police doing about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal I love the clause “no matter how much they commemorate war victories” because this is absolute truth!🤷🏾‍♂️  The same war memorial statue defenders are the very same “EDL/BND/UKIP” racists and fascists who love scapegoating others for their failures and circumstance!   Grim racists❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevolution76 @concept_of_evil @DaveEva73349638 They just need to give them their predictions or universities should just recognise this year has been a bit of a shit one - this everyone they had granted an offer to should have their offer honoured.   The gov is refusing to be innovative in their problem solving here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@concept_of_evil @DaveEva73349638 Wholeheartedly agree! They should have used the principle that a student should either get their predictions or nothing nothing lower than their mocks.   Using a WHOLE school PREVIOUS performance to rank 2020 students means: Grammar &amp; private schools are deliberately advantaged😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveEva73349638 @concept_of_evil it is unfair and only right that we speak out &amp; seek fairness! As more digging is done on the algorithm, it appears that it unfairly assumes that comp schools do not generate A*/A and that private schools ALWAYS do- it thus honoured priv school grades, &amp; rejected comp schl grades<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveEva73349638 @concept_of_evil I think the term “generation” was supposed to imply “this year cohort”. This particular “generation” of students of 2020 who will be shafted from secondary school through to colleges/6th form.  If I’d been this years cohort, I would have missed my medical offer. Im a Dr today🤔😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesleach_ Point is - in private schools, because of access to FINANCIAL resources, anything can be made possible! Children from comps often cannot afford to have EVERY paper remarked, they just have to “suck it up” and accept fail. In private mama &amp; papa can essentially pull strings🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesleach_ And this tweet is pure truth!  I remember when I finally get into university, met people from all walks of life. Then first exams came - the extra time room intended for “dyslexic students” was largely full of private schooled students -most openly joked they weren’t dyslexic🤐🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@concept_of_evil @DaveEva73349638 incredible how narrow some commentators are on this issue isnt it?  The attitude spewing out from some is pretty much “uni isn’t everything, so what? There’s always next years cohort... bla bla”  Every year, students have DREAMS, they work HARD to get them, they deserve better🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy Happy birthday!  Best wishes!   Continue living your best life! 💪🏽💪🏽👌🏾👌🏾🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem I went to a comp secondary in inner LDN, prior to my year -the grades had been stagnant. My cohort showed a good growth as we progressed through 7 Yr7 to 11. By 11 my cohort achieved some of the best results, personally got 3A*, 10A &amp; 1C- this algorithm would have robbed my A*s🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem The craziest thing about this thread &amp; algorithm is that it “assumes” that in a non-Private school, there can “never” be that ONE (or indeed few) students who really work hard and ultimately get (deserve) top grades (A*). It assumes perpetual failure.  The algorithm is shit❌❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokeEnough @PriyamvadaGopal @benandjerrys Point still stands - tory cheerleaders 📣 in the name of Emily H, Tom H, DarrenRacist Grimes etc. Are always first to the scene - but today. Not on an issue which is disproportionately affecting the poor.   They’re NOWHERE to be seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sezibera1 Is this the official one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal No he hasn’t- as a matter of fact nor have the usual tory/right wing 📣 cheerleaders!🤐  After voicing their dislike for @benandjerrys because the company spoke out in support of innocent refugees/immigrants they’ve taken a break! Battling genuine injustice isn’t their brief❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Haha🤷🏾‍♂️  Lets glorify a human being day, for being born into a family that can pretty much sit, eat, sleep, travel private jet, repeat at expense of poorer countrymen &amp; women who pay taxes and live in much more challenging circumstances. Appaz the taxpayer is not the unsung hero🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Sadly like most times in UK recent history- the left and right will be outraged simultaneously for a “moment” and then within 48-72hrs it will be over, we will go back to Tories being tories. And the left being left.   Weren’t we all united in clapping NHS? What happened after?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM How bizarre of the @Telegraph -so the accusation is “teachers handed out unrealistic high predictions” YET only private school high predictions were honoured, the comprehensives were penalised instead!🤷🏾‍♂️😤 @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner this is your “MOMENT” to hold Boris to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKentish @Cambridge_Uni Fortunately I went on to receive an offer from Bham, I’m now a qualified Doctor!   The most ridiculous thing about my Cam rejection was their insistence that I didn’t have enough exposure to medicine, despite a nurse mother, and 3years of work exp in hospital incl St Thomas🤷🏾‍♂️❌😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKentish I applied to @Cambridge_Uni - went to disadvantaged sch in NewCross, worked my hardest, got into grammar 6th form, studied at RedBrick Newcastle for Biomed, got 1st class, applied for Med, after interview rejection said “I didn’t have same exposure to work exp as other candidates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @Cambridge_Uni -this story is tragic and shameful! You HAD OFFERED him a place. You &amp; ALL education institutions know very well that the algorithm isn’t fit for purpose! The fact he still stained A*AAA despite a discriminative algorithm shows he’s capable! He’s what @gmcuk needs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM What’s the LOTO #KeirStarmer offering in terms of voice/ help?   Surely the whole opposition needs to oppose this? Has LOTO reached out to other opposition parties for joint action?  Have teaching unions been brought on board etc?   #resultsday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @PeoplesMomentum The “charity” status stuff I agree needs to be removed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @PeoplesMomentum I suspect it’s high.  But I personally see nothing wrong with private education. At end of the day the more Choice parents have, the better.   If people can afford it, and want to send their kids to private school - what’s the issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Theres failing to revise, taking the mick with classes &amp; getting D in your chemistry and missing out on a place at Med school.  There's also working hard, taking it seriously, then your predictions dropped from A to C and missing out offer from Med school! NOT THE SAME  INJUSTICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @PeoplesMomentum REALLY??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Some students have had their C predictions decreased down further to 'U' grade.  A U grade will not get you into a uni.   How can she claim there has been NO Disadvantage to 'any' student.  Resign worth ignorance to be frank! #ResultsDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams My thoughts exactly.   It’s not hard to decipher who’s responsible and accountable.   It’s not the parents, it’s not the students, it’s not a ghost, it’s not a foreigner - it’s The government and the appointed minister!  It’s NOT hard! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Did she ACTUALLY block u? Pathetic  Your comment in response to her tweet wasn't even inflammatory.  Irony is, Likes of Emma will not recognise WHAT is HOLDING BAME people back in Western countries: RACISM.  Bame people seem to have to wait for a white person to 'open the door'🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy 1) Britain DOES have GOOD qualified women of BAME background (If BAME is the criteria). Secondly, the reason ALL BAME individuals (male and female) are held back is because of racism. When they speak up (ie #DawnButler #DianeAbbott) -racists have a field day. Call out the RACISM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tash_Hussain @Nclarke30 Haha😂 -the irony is the chest tattoo “English DEFENCE league”   Can someone please tell what DEFENCE this 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔...&lt;round object&gt; would provide to any nation? He can hardly run for a bus, let alone fight a war. He’ll probs soon be on an NHS bariatric hosp bed cost Englan💰🙄stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Is it that hard though!?   @MatthewStadlen it is really NOT that hard, here’s some suggestions: 1) we’re led by a PM who normalises discriminatory language against foreign people (bank robbers/letterboxes”, black people have lower IQ  2) brexit was fuelled by xenophobia 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPrepper4 @afneil Lol😂🤣  And prior to B&amp;Js making their statement, all the years they’ve been in business... where were right wing racists to call it for for being a “conglomerate”😂  The same people &amp; politicians who vote for Tories a party who’s largest donors mostly avoid tax!👋🏽bye snowflakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Lol fancy that  Right wing England out in force hounding IceCream - because IceCream company has expressed solidarity with refugees!  UK on brexit steroids is an absolute cesspool!   Xenophobia, racism, hate, vitriol, supremacy galore! 🤷🏾‍♂️  Big up #Benandjerrys, bun racism💪🏽❌❌😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ainajkhan Literally!   At this rate, I’m actually more mentally prepared to vote for @benandjerrys if they were to suddenly announce they’re running for Parliament than I am prepared to vote for #LabourParty, LibDems etc. Obvs tories are a no go zone! 🤷🏾‍♂️  #Benandjerrys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney @benandjerrys Haha😂   I’ve seen it all now. Right wings attack IceCream🐄🤷🏾‍♂️  What is Qwhite clear now is that ANYTHING and (literally ANYTHING) that threatens the interests of racists and right wing Brexit xenophobes is fair game for pile-ons, attacks! B&amp;J stood up for migrants, racists got😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allenkab3 The fact that normal people have to explain themselves on this issue is very very weird !!  Banyarwanda for real?

<|startoftext|>@benandjerrysUK @pritipatel I have curious question:   Whoever owns/runs @benandjerrys ice-cream company a couple of things: 1) YES to Ben&amp;Jerrys 2) Thanks for keeping it real and telling these soulless politicians how we all feel 3) Stay this way! 4) I will be buying B&amp;Js ice-cream going forward! 💪😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Can we allow this narrative that 'Biden enabled first black [fill in the gap] please.

Brava #KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Spot on mate - and this is why I always feel like despite our often fiery debates, the overriding principle is that: politics is ONLY one thing, it shouldn't create hate/animosity.   I do genuinely feel depressed by politics in UK, FPTP really needs to go! its creating a crisis🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent I think the issue is: 1) Twitter count makes us all write very direct messages with no caveats. 2) Twitter puts everyone on edge from my observation. 3) Apparently politics in UK in 2020 appear to be polarised- everyone ready to react- we are all guilty of it.  It can be draining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Indeed. And contrasting opinions should not be basis for animosity, ridicule, gaslighting etc. You have your views based on XYZ experiences. Person X also his his/her views based on XYZ experience. We can all be black and have diff views on racism. As Shaun Bailey has shown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 Meanwhile - Madeleine McCann budget increases every year as if its a national public organisation that requires its own yearly government budget.  Say no more!  RIP #StephenLawrence and value and respect for #BlackLivesMatter is NOT a 'moment' despite what some people think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber To be fair to #KeirStarmer - I think on this occasion he was focusing all his attention🤐 on showing solidarity with #StephenLawrence mother?  He has posted for once: with haste and to the point. I guess on some occasions he is able to act 'on time' and appropriately🤷‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent With respect, u being black means yes, u have a view on anti-black racism, however it does not mean your view on how Keir responds to it is biblical.  It is not a false equivalence, because the fact timelines are there for everyone to see.  You do u, rep Keir- noone is stopping u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Of course ur entitled to opinion -similarly, so are other people who have contrasting views. It doesn't make them 'anti-Keir' and therefore target for ridicule or gaslighting. Ur opinion does not invalid theirs.  If Keir gave the right vibes - we wouldnt be having this chat🤷‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent point is- everyone is entitled to express their views on a party leader &amp; how they dealing with issues personal to them. You nor I have the right suggest to people “stop moaning”- when Jewish people rightly complained that JC et al were “slow”- I didn’t see you calling it petty🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Well for a start I’m disappointed to see you reduce grievance from many people (largely the black &amp;BAME community) as “petty issues”- racism and the impact thereof on the individual is not “a petty issue”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Would you care to quote me where I say Starmer is racist?  I’ve historically said I’m disappointed by his lack of enthusiasm when dealing with antiblack racism. And factually the evidence says he is slow.  It’s not zero tolerance. Facts speak for themselves I’m afraid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Well the short answer I guess is - you’re not privy to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @robjeffecology @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent How do you always find yourself privy to these conversations that Keir has with other MPs? Do you take the minutes?   How can you categorically date stamp when and how the conversation took place? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@106th Is this the same school where a pupil was excluded for 'telling the public what was going on in the school?'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Colaco For as long as we have people like @ShaunBaileyUK doing the racists' bidding- we will have to continue to endure the struggle and frustration.  It was previously assumed that if we get people LIKE us in parliament/power they'll help the fight - 2020 teaching us we were wrong❌🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker Why continue to be part of such a party?  For how long must you be contradicted in sentiments and ideology by the party that you’re a member?  What is necessary for the party to do for you to call it a day?  Genuinely curious!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmcternan @mattzarb @AyoCaesar summarises it well. @Keir_Starmer &amp; his colleagues (white members) have most likely calculated (as has Tory’s @ShaunBaileyUK) that the black vote is dispensable AND that they can be done without if necessary.  Sorry, but I’m open to voting someone else and I will🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sensiblehuman96 @DurstApologist @TheKafkaDude Keirs labour approach to supporting its own party members and MPs is all I can see in this image to be honest 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  (Also big up Janine - she was gold) 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusjdl @J2S_Official If the debate and context had not been racism towards black people (as matter of fact there should not be any individual who has to experience racism) - I would legit LOL at this because #GC normally cracks me up.  But this is legit how #KeirStarmer and @AngelaRayner respond❌🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stehughes1878 @Keir_Starmer Thought I was the only one who noticed this - he says it must be condemned, but then doesn’t condemn it.  And to think #DawnButler is in the same party is Keir is just simply breathtaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber Emphasis on the “crumb” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  God what a LOTO, and what a person for @DawnButlerBrent to call “leader of my party” 🤒🤒🤒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okwonga Don’t let @ShaunBaileyUK hear you - apparently any black persons expressing concern about their lived experiences is exaggerating, FakeNews etc etc.  FYI Shaun is A BLACK candidate for mayor of London. He’s also the Tory selected cuckoo 🐣 planted in the nest of London 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddygraham39 @bernardsmernard @DawnButlerBrent Major respect to all the decent white people in Britain- who recognise the inequality &amp; calling it out by offering their own personal stories!  Sadly, the likes of @JuliaHB1 @montie too busy trying to spin! Madness! Julia and Tom you’re not black, you’ll never understand! Stop🛑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl I have to say- theres a LOT I disagree with the tories on -nearly 99.9% of everything they suggest/do - however ONE thing is certain!  It has become apparent by looking at @Keir_Starmer &amp; @AngelaRayner that the tories will ALWAYS trump labour on: interparty solidarity! 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ He’s a the conservatives candidate- he clearly gets his lead from Boris and Cummings - I mean who and what else do you expect?  Shaun is not the first or last BAME person in the tories to gaslight BAME people! @KemiBadenoch is a prime example 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Why the bombaclaat any black person even thinking of voting for him!?  Have black peoples never heard of the story of the cuckoo bird and how she lays her eggs?🤷🏾‍♂️  @ShaunBaileyUK has never been on the side of the everyday person (least the black person) he’s on side of TORIES🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber @DawnButlerBrent @HackneyAbbott Anything said by @DawnButlerBrent party’s leader mr @Keir_Starmer 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Or was he enjoying his Sunday roast and a gin and Tonic to be bothered to show solidarity?  And so Keir continues to show us his ambivalence 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - and we keep being told to give him chances!   Haha 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pag1970 @vicderbyshire And then American black people are in a totally different category too.   So you’ve got to engage and be informed about the subtle differences.

<|startoftext|>@pag1970 @vicderbyshire Good day to us both mate.   I think all I want to convey is - not all black people are homogeneous (which is erroneously assumes).

<|startoftext|>@pag1970 @vicderbyshire Im blackAfrican brit, have many black African colleagues/family/friends- the N word is simply and factually not a word we play around with! Yes it’s in AMERICAN rap music, anyone singing to a song may recite it in that context. But European blacks do not walk around saying Nword<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pag1970 @vicderbyshire Most European black footballers are african heritage- the Nword is not a word that was routinely used by colonialist white racists against African people- so not sure where those footballers got their lingo/courage from.  As I say, its a USA colloquial. Infrequently used in Eurpe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 I’m just confused - who shortlists these candidates?  Was there an application process and Andrew and Nicky were the top 2 best performing candidates?  I mean, what’s the process?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Also why is it that it’s always ex politicians who get these cushy deals/jobs?🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEconomist If you want to talk about history - perhaps talk about the WHOLE history!  Let’s use European history as exmple- the lands that Prussia/Germany had “stolen” from countries such as Poland (Danzig port city)- did Germany have to give it back? Yes!🤷🏾‍♂️ How did Europeans acquire farms?  https://t.co/J1XHaHBPhW<|endoftext|>

London as with rest of UK continues to have reduced opportunities for BAME backgrounds, you plan to do F all for them! Go be mayor of Oxford🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pag1970 @vicderbyshire Clearly null-informed.  The colloquial use of the N-word in black communities is an American thing, not British/European.   Moreover, just because they may do so does not mean it’s a bandwagon for people disconnected from the N-word history to start recklessly using it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein @MaajidNawaz You’re late to the insight - #MaajidNawaz  (aka MrBlockEveryoneWhoDisagreesWithMe) is pathetic and extremely egotistical!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions Kabisa 💯!   That’s my main concern bro!   It’s the attitudes that are dangerous!  (Followed you, you sound like my kind of person: DECENT!) Pleased to meet you! 💪🏽🤝🤝🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika I think as “decent” rwandans we need to start a new habit of calling out inappropriate comments and language when we witness it.  Nkabanyarwanda who understand the language: “bajye bahahira mugikari” who know exactly what this means! It’s rude, its disrespectful! Inappropriate🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions With all that said: Njye I respect Moses and his hassle! He has WORKED damn HARD to have this product! And kudos to him! We should be inspired by his dedication and drive!  Ariko for me, abantu bazana ubwirasi - I don’t want anything to do with them! Ngo bajye “mugikari”? Ahree😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions When Africans start to belittle each other in this way, it leads to “dehumanisation” and with that comes ignorance.  My salary permits me to buy moshions (if I want to), but should I pretend I don’t coexist amongst other rwandans who can’t even afford clean water?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ oya rwose❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions I think we need to challenge attitudes like these man! Because so far 99.9% of those defending the prices are those saying “mujyane ubukene bwanyu mugikari” - this is attempts by rich Kigalians to exclude OUR FELLOW brothers and sisters from the table! Sorry but I can’t endorse❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions The issue is attitudes coming from some people on here. Attitudes like “who told u to shop in Kiyovu, go shop muGIKARI”  Theres nothing I hate more than this rwandan attitude of “kwirata/gusuzugura”  Our country is blessed in many ways, but let’s not forget MAJORITY are dirt poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seruka_Afrika @BHeryvan @RemyBaho @Pa6FK @Moshions Ntago issue ari ko tudashyigikira @Moshions ! I’ve visited their store.

<|startoftext|>@sundersays This is what “skin privilege” meant up until 1994 in South Africa - a nation in Africa whose original inhabitants are NON-EUROPEANS   So please spare black people all this gaslighting and schooling on what “white privilege” means!   ✋ stop 🛑  #BlackLivesMatter  https://t.co/EAwzpwN3vg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundersays If you were WHITE you could access all the good things in life, travel in best vehicle, sit on best seats, drink from best fountains, sit on park benches. If you were BLACK - those PRIVILEGES were REMOVED from you!   This is the history of “white privilege”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundersays ... American civil rights of 1960s - you frankly will never understand what we mean by white privilege. There is NO “one definition” of it because it is based on context, perspective and history.   Up until 1994 in  https://t.co/sDM9ZrOhgt - YOUR skin COLOUR dictated PRIVILEGE 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundersays All I am going to say about this “privilege” discussion is this; it’s very easy for people to attempt to school black people how to analyse and comment on discrimination.

<|startoftext|>@ashtredame I cannot say this enough!

<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @andraswf @GoodClearTweets You’re right.   Although I think in the UK - certain people in society wouldn’t have a CLUE what “poussin”’was if they saw it on a menu.  At same time, certain people from “distinguished” backgrounds would know what it is on a menu.  So in UK often these things relate to class🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PMuzogeye Agreed 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl So what’s your thread intended to do? “Desperately learn and teach” or desperately bring about a “whataboutery” argument?

<|startoftext|>@D_Raval This part of the thread is 🔥TRUTH🔥.  I’m new to labour, ex Tory -when boris was running, I wanted to run as far away from tories as I could. I don’t kno much (or care about labour few years ago). But being BLACK and seeing how he’s handled the #BLM and #LabourLeaks - I’m OUT!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott Not only do we not know him, the guy the tories keep thrusting down our throats and in front of our eyes IS DEFINITELY NOT getting our vote!   Regards, A black/ BAME London voter who intends on canvassing against @ShaunBaileyUK 👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmenTesfay Can someone explain to me how and when racism can be “out of context”  And for those prepared to argue that the bigotry and racism was out of context - do they want to make the same argument for how... let’s say antisemetic bigotry can be deemed “out of context”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ no they cant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanFinn95 Indeed- the silence of the media (as they were indeed silent when the #LabourLeaks were released) says ALL there is to say! The British media is largely sympathetic (or ignorant/unbothered about  antiblack (BAME) discrimination.   As a black person I’ve decided UK doesn’t care😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanFinn95 @DanFinn95 -this has been the thought that has been going through my mind all day.  Can we all for a second imagine if the WhatsApp messages were antisemetic towards Jewish members, and corbyn suggested that the WhatsApp messages cannot he released because they’re “private”🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott @UKLabour Been thinking about #DianeAbbott today.😫  Most depressing aspect of all this is to come to realisation that @HackneyAbbott only crime was 1) Being ally to JC and 2) black. She became Tory/right wing target (unsurprising theyre racist🤷🏾‍♂️). Shockingly @UKLabour joined the racists🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrschlosberg The fact they’re out here to defend insults targeted at an innocent person says it all!  So called “centrists blairites” whose raison d’etre seems: bigotry, antiblack discrimination, hate against those with different political views! Plain nasty!  Monsters dressed in chinos+shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirleymcbrinn @HackneyAbbott @PriyamvadaGopal @UKLabour Idiot and everyone liking this stupid comment is equally idiotic!

<|startoftext|>@br_nning A very very cold one! Count me in! 💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer As long as the situation is dealt with adequately- I have no issue whatsoever. No labour voter wants to see labour breaking laws etc. Howevr we expect ALL cases of racism, bigotry &amp; abuse to be steadfastly dealt with. None of this zero tolerance for some, and deaf ears for others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeCityAuthor @LKTranslator There cannot be a situation, where @Keir_Starmer says no stone must be left unturned when dealing with AS (rightly so) and then simultaneously attempt to hide behind bureaucracy and legal intricacies when it comes to dealing with antiblack racism!   SIMPLE AS! #blackLivesMatter❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon Well that’s Labour’s business &amp; fault - racism and abuse is not something to hide - we wouldn’t be saying this if it were about antisemitism. And the culprits cannot hide from scrutiny. Labour and @Keir_Starmer will have to find mechanisms to adequately deal with this crisis.🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon So in conclusion keep whatever vitriol and racism spewed out by labour staffers in “work” whatsapp  groups secret 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Very constructive and great way of addressing abuse and bigotry in the Labour Party 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber I appreciate this tweet and the sentiments therein.  I can only hope (in vain?) - that #keirstarmer and his advisors heed.   I’ve never been so turned off voting labour as I am today.  Fingers crossed things will change, I must notify Keir: the black vote is not blind🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber Well you’re right on this topic: You may not be BAME, but I think it’s obvious even you’ve clocked the disparity. Im a member of the BAME community and Im relaying to you how I and many others see and summarise what’s going on in labour: the leadership has hierarchies, NOT okay❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber As a black labour voter, so far having observed the LOTO reactions &amp; attitudes towards racism in Labour Party and beyond, it is very clear that Keir has a magnet for some forms of racism, and is blind and deaf to other forms! It’s like having a parent who treats kids differently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber Irrespective of fan or no fan, the question still stands: how do u think people who aren’t Jewish, who suffer from daily/regular racism and bigotry feel when we observe his differential responses and actions against “racism”. He gives a perception of “hierarchy” In racism. 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJamesBarber I’ve got a question for you: It’s all well and good u (a fan of his) saying “fingers crossed he turns it around” (I.e he STARTS giving bigotry and racism towards minorities who aren’t Jewish due attention). How do u think we BAME feel watching him turn blind eye all this while?🧐<|endoftext|>

Oh yea that’s right, I remember: not wanting to appear to be the opposition party whose duty was to hold the government to account. Yep let the ball slip by major attempts to woe Tory voters!

<|startoftext|>@KBGreyhoundlady @DarwenJim @AndrewKnight226 If you apply for a job, and on day ONE of starting it you realise that the role and duty mandated by your new job Does NOT align with your principles and morals - what should you do? 1) resign  2) stay and put all your might into the job that does not represent who you are? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Goddess1345 @MartinOKeeffee @BenKentish @eddiemair The issue from what I gather is that there is no “universal” approach in UK. Everyone is being left to use their “initiative” - I’m afraid you can’t beat a pandemic with haphazard initiatives.   All airports should request for all incoming passengers to compete forms! Simple 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ @LewisHamilton You’re spot on!  The world is already shit as it is - why do people want to make it anymore depressing and painful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ @LewisHamilton Exactly. I was hurt, when i saw the hate he received for literally saying "hold on a min, my dad is/was black - I am proud of who/what he was" (not sure if his dad is still alive). Literally over night, the hate started. They started to hate him because he's proud to be black!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ EXACTLY!  (Ps, i think you're great!) - and I am glad i came across you today, I have followed you.  The world needs more people like you! We can all get on: it is possible. But some people really need to drop the 'superiority' complex. We have darker skin, but we still human<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Perfect example is @LewisHamilton - previously before he started to say "hey, I am black, and i think I am proud about it" Britain loved him, he would go out and win for 'England'. However ever since #BLM, and his vocal support for his black dad - British people are like 'Nope'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Racism has for sure improved over the years in this country. However, being BAME in UK, is like being a guest at friend's house - you are tolerated AS LONG as you do as your told. The day you ask for too much (equal opportunities)- You must leave. When u speak up, Britain hates u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Instead, she gets constantly compared to Kate, and the comparison is purely: Meg = not as stunning, holds her baby bump wrong, shuts own door (breaks protocol), but Kate: perfect, she curtseys, she is 'thin', she holds her baby bump 'right' etc. I mean, SERIOUSLY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Meghan had a job prior to marrying Harry - so all the Gold-digging insults are arguably baseless. As matter of fact she was not far off being a millionaire in her own right - hassling in the film industry - however Britain has refused to celebrate her personal achievements 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ What has happened to Meghan has unfortunately laid bare the mostly well plastered truth of racial supremacy, xenophobia and ultimately racism. Both Meghan &amp; Kate are beautiful women with their individual merits. However they get a dramatically different treatment. WHY? 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Hi Sammy, thanks for the interaction &amp; thread. It is unfortunate that in the cross-fire of the tragic state we as a society are in- VERY decent and truly understanding people like you (and I am certain many millions of others) have to occasionally hear it from the black angle /1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serialTweeper Something definitely does not add up about this explosion.  I do not believe it happened spontaneously or accidentally.   There, I've said it.   Where is Russia to out the schemers lol🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MummybeanSammy @nadinebh_ Its so plain to see what they (Brit media) and the so called *Palace aides* are trying to do &amp; achieve.  There were 2 women, both non-royal that married into the royal family. One is white &amp; one is black. One was ALWAYS portrayed as PERFECT, the other as 'challenging'. #BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer 🤷‍♂️ Why were they permitted excuses and bluster in the first place?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinWelby @RosieDuffield1 @AyoCaesar Ash &amp; Rosie had a disagreement on how to tackle drugs in the UK. As a result of Rosie's frustration, Rosie declared to Ash that she (Rosie) would never henceforth defend Ash (woman of colour/BAME) against racism &amp; abuse. Ash receives racist abuse DAILY.  Your holiness re-evaluate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinWelby @JustinWelby   1/ Dear Archbishop of Canterbury,  Before you weigh into this argument on one particular side, we (who have had to witness @RosieDuffield1's comments on twitter) suggest you first of all speak and engage with people she has offended. @AyoCaesar should be spoken to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKentish @eddiemair Can vouch for the Irish track &amp; trace!   In Ireland you CANNOT get past immigration without a completed track and trace form!

<|startoftext|>@jdpoc Understand! Thanks for the reply.  #GeorgeFloyd case is sad and for black peoples it is simply a reminder that in 2020 despite all the facade and sugarcoating- racism and discrimination and abuse based on antiblack racism is very much real. worryingly politics filed with it too❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnellis187 @KialeeKaylee666 @DaveWardGS I eat out regularly - thanks for the reminder.  That salad is more expensive than a nandos meal!   Bye 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett In my state of disgust, I completely failed/overlooked that truth.  Indeed trump had more time and more empathy and understanding for a child sexual exploitation pimp who was a fugitive for a while as she evaded the police and FBI.   Wow   It’s alright though we got Johns back💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdpoc Have you seen/heard the leak? #GeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KialeeKaylee666 @DaveWardGS This is exactly my thought - I have never seen a salad for £16.00 before. Not even in Waitrose 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️.  A whole chicken in supermarket is around 4-6£, lettuce🥬 is about 80p, salad dressing maybe £1.50, sourdough bread £2.00 - so I just don’t get it!  SIXTEEN POUNDS🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤐🤐❌❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ashtredame Do you remember the “we are boycotting social media for 48hrs because racism is bad and this is enough”  We literally had a show called “Nigger-Brown” selling on @amazon - and the same people who said they’d enough of racism have not said a word or boycotted  #BlackLivesMatter🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChantayyJayy I love the way he tried to say “maybe it’s because of the travelling transatlantic travels” haha😂- he had to find something to disguise his racism!  @LewisHamilton is hated because he no longer wins for “England” he now is a winner and proudly black! Now racists can’t stand him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SebastianEPayne It is indeed extraordinary that an individual who has potentially sexually harassed a woman is receiving 💯 support and ENCOURAGEMENT from the @Conservatives..

<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 Well probably because Trump May have been a REGULAR at #GhislaineMaxwell and #Epstein parties that involved obscene acts on young women.

<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy @TheRickWilson Is this the same interview where he was asked about the civil rights gentleman who recently died #JohnLewisRIP - and Trumps reason for not honouring him or going to his funeral was because “He didn’t come to my inauguration!

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express Antisemitism is wrong-💯, however so is antiBlack racism in equal measure. Both antisemitism &amp; antiBlack racism result in the same impact on both Jewish people and Black people.   So why is it that the British Caucasian population has a contrasting approach to dealing with racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express I want to know why it is normalised that when a black person asks for platform to talk about their experiences, white people are empowered to “gaslight”/ question and educate the black person to “lose chip on shoulder/move on”. Yet another group of racism victim are listened to🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express We all have no issue with their solidarity against the words of Wiley - I hasten to add we ALL are AGAINST everything Wiley said  The point is: there’s a chronic habit in the British population (politicians &amp;media included) to belittle/ignore black experiences of racism🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express @LBC Absolutely spot on here mate!   The Conservatives have truly upped their game in driving culture wars over the last few years! They’ve spent a lot of money and time in creating a Tory Youth Group that acts to cheerleader their ideology, creating pile-ons etc. It’s astonishing😳🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express Indeed   Diane Abbott -a black woman- along now with her Dawn Butler (and others) receive barrage after barrage of antiBlack racism and media and radio stations like LBC actually feed the frenzy rather than deescalate.   When have they ever done 48hrs boycott for black peoples?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express Fundamentally the question Iain should be asking is “WHY” are the British peoples so extreme when it comes to politics? If you pan around the world also, it is countries with 2 party systems like USA and inadvertently UK due to FPTP that have very polarised politics🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express On your last point re: tribalism - that is the point I’m highlighting about FPTP - for as long as it exists tribalism persists also, and in the current climate of brexit, conservatives on steroids it will only make the tribalism worse.  Social media being scapegoated by IainD🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express Theyre right, the nature of the political process in the UK sets itself up for extreme emotional interaction&amp;distress with all that is to do with political ideology  Vote LibDem- get Tory/Lab, vote green get Tory/Lab, vote independent get Tory/Lab.   So end up with Right vs Left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Daily_Express As the IainDale has shown Britain previously when he attacked an old man protesting against nuclear weapons🤨- most of the hate and animosity comes from people with entrenched political ideology. The FPTP system has created in UK an environment of extreme polarisation in ideology<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 @nadhimzahawi How’s the world beating app in Isle of Wight going?   It was allegedly supposed to be a “game changer” and “world beating”  Facts: 1) it did not change the game and 2) it didn’t beat the world.  🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster Hb= haemoglobin. Carries O2 in blood. When u bleed from major cut- u lose blood &amp; Hb so Hb drops in value.

<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 According to @Nigel_Farage - black people walking through streets of Brixton in large numbers is unacceptable/ terrorism.  Are black peoples NOT ALLOWED to assemble?

<|startoftext|>@Daniel_Grigg Why do the unions even fund labour? Serious question.  No money should be “automatic” because u end up INDEED in situations where the money is abused by receiver.

<|startoftext|>@BarrySheerman @BarrySheerman in 2018 made it clear that antisemitism under JeremyCorbyn should be zero tolerance with expulsion ASAP.   Today now that he’s the perpetrator of antisemitism, he thinks an I’m soz tweet is enough.   Tweeting requires thought, you thought it and still posted it🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/EKogRegNlX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @BarrySheerman Come on -are we really buying the “at least he apologised” stuff?  The deed is done, offence has been caused. Also can I point out, before we “type a tweet” we think about what we are typing. Tweeting is not sneezing or hiccuping- it’s thought through!  Why does he get a pass?🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AKWatsonGenas @alexsobel @Twitter @bnp Who said its a competition?   The people choosing who they show solidarity to are the ones turning it into a hierarchical competition. How many of them have made plans to show solidarity with the black man run over and called nigger in #Bristol? Guess it wasn’t racism in their👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad Well we definitely know they don’t because, less than 72hrs ago a black man who works as key worker for #NHS was run over in #Bristol and the driver shouted “nigger” at the black victim.  I’ve seen NO plans by blue tick “I’m striking for 48hrs against racism” to show solidarity🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For real what’s the plan?🤷🏾‍♂️  A black guy during ur 48hr strike was run over in #Bristol and had the words “nigger” shouted at him! He was an #nhs key worker   How many of the blue tick I’m striking against “racism” have made any onward plans to act in solidarity for the black man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsobel @Twitter @bnp “Somehow”🤷🏾‍♂️  They’ve been here for decades! And so has nigel farage, and other antiblack racists.   Quite a lot of the “I’m vacating for 48hrs” never vacated in the past against antiblack racism. Most of the latter couldn’t even bring themselves to kneel for SECONDS in solidarity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamnasser1 @DawnButlerBrent @KemiBadenoch ** I get you (not I get I)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamnasser1 @DawnButlerBrent @KemiBadenoch I have family members who completely disregard the black struggle bcoz theyre 2 generations into marrying into white background (my uncle) its not an unusual phenomenon for people who are in mixed culture relationships.   So with respect, I get i, but I know also what im on about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamnasser1 @DawnButlerBrent @KemiBadenoch I also come from a mixed family- white &amp; black, and I know what its like to be in the middle of the road. I know what its like when you’re faced with the dilemma of what to say/do when these #BlackLivesMatter moments arise. I know what its like when its easier to ignore the issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamnasser1 @DawnButlerBrent @KemiBadenoch I don’t really care who and what she’s married to.  The point is we live in a country where racism towards black people is ignored/ belittled and gaslighted. @KemiBadenoch has FREQUENTLY gaslighted and made light of black people experiences. Shes OUT of TOUCH with black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @LBC @mrjamesob @AvaSantina The hate and vitriol that @viewsfromleft is receiving after his honest reflection of what black people feel was voiced on @LBC @mrjamesob says it all to be quite frank!  The fact people/trolls are actually going out of their way to vent and gaslight confirms the statement made🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent @KemiBadenoch It’s as though @KemiBadenoch is a mere puppet with Dom Cummings having taken over her soul &amp; voice box.  What in the end is a black MP responsible for equality doing when she attempts to gaslight black and BAME people like this? Kemi we get it you’re married to a white man🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 Blinded &amp; smokescreened by their xenophobia &amp; dislike for “foreigners”   Now they’re being held hostage by the Tory party - a government being led by an “unelected”#DomCummings who breaks rules/ laws/guidelines as he chooses. But will arrest working class people doing same crime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha I  always thought that when minorities of BAME background get into politics its A GREAT thing -they’ll use their privilege &amp;position to push for POSITIVE change, push for betterment. @KemiBadenoch has made me think -a white politician can do MORE for me than her  She dumb! Period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 @mayorbcyoung @davenewworld_2 why is this only being investigated in 2020 when it happened in 2016?  Why is justice for black peoples always in delay - or simply brushed under the carpet ?? #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 @FreddieBailey96 I would go as far as saying   “Alexa show me a racist hypocrite with white privilege”   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ I mean how many BAME people can casually leave London and say “off I go to Spain for a better life” and expect to be welcomed in Mallorca with open arms”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewhoatv @pritipatel Let us know if she &amp; other blue tick✔️ people respond to this question:  They engage in anti BAME racism or stay silent.

<|startoftext|>@MandaJJennings @DaveMcK47215118 Whilst I give no damn about Tommy, I want to highlight something.

<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @NickFerrariLBC It was incredible when they all said they “don’t do GESTURES” and that showing solidarity with black people for few seconds to mins felt like “subjugation” and that they only “subjugate” to a white woman who wears a 👸 and a “God”  Yet they happy to GESTURE (now) for 48HOURS🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes It’s about @KemiBadenoch using her race to gaslight black people into supporting the conservatives   Therefore in conclusion the whole exercise is: 1) PR stunt by conservatives  2) electioneering - by conservatives   It is not: 1) aimed at improving conditions for black people❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @Nadine_Writes @KemiBadenoch Perhaps Ms @KemiBadenoch &amp; her white husband, &amp; their Tory party need to read this article to actually understand the lasting impact these things have on black people who aren’t MPs, Rich, doctors, lawyers, London mayor wannabes etc!   She part of the top 0.1% of privileged BAME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo If I hate you, trust and believe I won’t be supporting your business. And therefore I won’t care if you’re begging.  The whole point of the European Union after WW2 was to create unity, love, understanding, comprehension, integration to prevent hate that leads to wars🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Did she have 12 armed officers burst into her house shouting and quite literally making you feel like you about to get shot ?   @KemiBadenoch stop the gaslighting please! You’re embarrassing and using your privileged lifestyle to paint a picture that all black people are like you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes With respect @KemiBadenoch for as long as u hail ur party leader who is a known racist &amp; bigot -who throws out offensive language to other races, who belittles &amp; banters about colonialism &amp; that Africa needs to be recolonised -we will ALWAYS BELIEVE (rightly) that tories are shit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jos_Spriggs @AlexInAir @mrjamesob @grantshapps Well regardless - if they’re going to allow flying (which they are) they need to be providing GOOD guidance and putting in place measures that MUST be followed.   In UK airports, you’d wouldn’t even think there’s a pandemic. No airport wide sanitisers, no tannoy announcements🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexInAir @mrjamesob This AM travelled thru Luton Airport to Marseille via Dublin.

<|startoftext|>@ChuckModi1 @nadinebh_ Amazing how much difference presence/ absence of the media can make it the narrative of an event.

<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl I am here for this energy! @stevelapsl well done!  This Guy #DarrenGrimes quite literally hosted a white supremacist racist, the racist threw a barrage of antiblack racism, Darren hailed the clip amazing &amp; that #davidstarkey was as a result of the Clip his “hero” Darren IS RACIST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar I wonder what the right wingers and Tory cheerleaders 📣 are going to say now about @AyoCaesar taking a picture on a Sunday afternoon ...   “omg look ash posted a picture and the weather turned cloudy- she’s to blame” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Ash live your best life!

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @HackneyAbbott Oohh🤭🤭🤭😜.   This is a welcome truth bomb 💣   👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  @pritipatel where were you on black peoples were being racially abused over the last couple of years?   Let’s think and remember 🤨🧐🧐.... you were nowhere!   #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsternweiner So in conclusion this was all about Jeremy Corbyn?   If JC is guilty of what he is accused of, the claimants should carry on through with their claim, otherwise what this shows is that it’s all about “cleansing the party” of those Keirites disagree with, and NOT about JC’s AS🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Solidarity @nadinebh_ - not Jewish- but a black brother. Irrespective of religion people shouldn’t be doing this!  In life there are disagreements/differences perspectives - it should not be a societal crime to have an alternative political view!   So much for people being “holy”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_female_lead She SMASHED it  More than can be said for her male counterparts running some of the biggest economies in western world - white supremacist in USA with a cognitive function of a jelly fish  - racist, covid19 COBR meeting ignoring PM in UK #BorisHasFailedTheUK  @jacindaardern 👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dabeard Correction: fired - #BreadForTheWorld found his rude/ misogynistic and crass behaviour unbecoming of a “Christian” man.  Being a misogynist is not the “passion” “Christ” came to teach.  He didn’t offer his resignation, until the organisation decided his position was untenable🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@broken6 @KateWilliamsme @Zehra_Zaidi Why then when they went to colonies, &amp; white people remained a minority, yet They end up on colonial currencies?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Answer: because they saw themselves above other races- SUPREME! There’s your answer❌🤢  With that said: I’m glad there’s a shift according to @KateWilliamsme🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cwmbear1 @UkSleepwalker Are you saying that without a RF, you’d lack the social etiquette to “respect other people”   What an utterly bizarre and stupid mentality to have. “I need to monarchy to illustrate to me how to be kind”.  For a start, tell the Queen to tell her son Andrew to be “respectful” laws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmeliaHouchins @Valerie3Ward Ahhh and they’re not being gassed - meanwhile in the “free world” USA .... #PortlandMoms 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Haha yet they teach us its only in Russia where protesting is a crime 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyAnnO @nadinebh_ So @ayeshahazarika with glee announced her duet with Tracy - and here we have Tracy qWHITE literally suggesting that white/black Jews are not part of the saw community.   What in the name of equality/ racism is this nonsense ! And can Ayesha explain her admiration for this bigot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kickybarr @kazzaB33 @Doings0 Very valid question 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ has anyone bothered replying yet?  They’re all using the classic “I didn’t mind him, but now it’s time to place blind trust in Keir” yet there’s evidence keirs alliances actively plotted against JC behind the scenes. So much for “we didn’t mind him” 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ It’s my to go to when I feel like crap (emotionally) and actually want a “decent” dish with flavours!

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Of all people to talk about racism - u #DarremGrimes are NOT the one  Antisemitism is indeed a major problem, and it is shockingly disappointing what Wiley has done in the last 48hrs  But u @darrengrimes_ welcomed and platformed a antiBlack racism. You called him a hero. SHUT UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonRubs Accepted!  Thanks for acknowledging and henceforth let’s keep the energy against ALL forms of racism! It’s not about “Jewish” vs “black” people. It’s also not a white vs black issue for that matter!  We are here for “wrong” vs “right” at end of the day: RACISM is WRONG, no ifs❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamntyrell @JolyonRubs #Wiley does NOT speak for anybody but himself!  The onus is on nobody but Wiley and @Twitter to deplatform and stop this hate and bigotry coming from Wiley!  Also vast majority of people of ALL races have called Wiley out!  So please @JolyonRubs - leave black people out of this❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamntyrell This stuff from decent people like @JolyonRubs feeds right wing racists who are soon going to throw out propaganda like “see what we’ve been saying all along -black people &amp; the #BlackLivesMatter is actually far left black racism driven by thriving antisemitism” which is bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acceber910 @Shannon79053723 @KateWilliamsme For real!  They want to propagate the old anti black trope that “black people aren’t anything without white people” - it’s their classic to go to excuse and explanation for things like colonialism!  Notwithstanding of course most of their wealth was begotten from looting Africa🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonRubs Can I just point out - 1) black people aren’t responsible for #Wiley behaviour the same way ALL white people aren’t held responsible for people racist like Farage/#DavidStarkey etc. 2) your conflation only worsens tensions in communities that already have mistrust for each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Say what? 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KateWilliamsme @KateWilliamsme just wanted to say thanks for this thread. It’s so painful seeing the DAILY barrage of hate and vitriol directed at #PrinceHarryAndMeghan - Julia HB is this very morning throwing daggers 🗡 and whipping up her audience of hyenas - it’s just vile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Hi @JuliaHB1 - u can HATE #MeghanMarkle as much as u want, but here are some hard truths for u &amp; ur bigoted audience: 1) Meghan WAS Meghan before she came to UK 2) Meghan HAD a JOB &amp; made her OWN money  3) She was a MILLIONAIRE in her own right  4) UK👑 did NOT make her 5) STOP❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Barber10 #Solidarity  Campaigning to make Britain equal for all!   This is what energy I’m here for. Went to “follow” realised I already follow. Good to know I follow the right kind of people!  #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WileyCEO @WileyCEO - please stop this man.  Turn phone/computer off!  Do some mindfulness.  Reflect!  I don’t know what’s triggered you, but Jewish people aren’t your enemy. RACIST and xenophobes are the problem. You’re being antisemetic in your rage against injustice.  Reflect🙏🏽 #Wiley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad It’s like living in a household where your parents treat the children differently. One child always gets what they want, and the other has been forced to just fend for themselves 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ How is that normal!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad It sucks. And worse of all is when we have bare witness how differently the system (politics/ media/ journalism/ judiciary and SOCIETY etc) treat and respond to our struggles😢  Take Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler, we’ve all witnessed their journey of racism, society bats eyelids🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad I totally understood you mate.  And to ge honest, if may say so, the reactions we have seen recently in addressing antisemitism, it’s how it SHOULD be for ALL forms of racism. And indeed this is what #BlackLivesMatter are trying to convey, RAISE ALL minority lives to equal others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad Im all up for debate, 100% its what I try my best to engage with on twitter &amp;beyond. As u and I do. What I think TN was saying is: “why is there a DISPARITY/incongruity” in how we deal with &amp; address different forms of racism? If your black, it feels as tho ur pain is “DEBATABLE”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lwhb__ @David__Osland If you forgot - JC wanted to end foodbanks, he wanted to make transparent cheaper so people could get to jobs reasonably. He wanted to make internet cheaper so everyone had access to information/ education. He wanted to protect the NHS/ libraries etc.  So your argument is defunct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⭐️⭐️👇🏾⭐️This ⭐️👇🏾⭐️⭐️  Anti-Black racism apparently needs “nuance”, inquiry (with no consequence), reasoned the debates with racists as we saw with #DarrenGrimes (Tory youth) and his “hero” a white supremacist British historian #davidstarkey and gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney @sajidjavid @pritipatel - Hmm here are a few candidates for whom you forgot to withdraw British citizenship.  They’ve done some abhorrent stuff (killed) and have shown no remorse.  We await your decisive action in this regard! Unless of course there are mitigating circumstances🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @RosieDuffield1 @curiocat13 @CarolinePenn2 I’ve DMd you the tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @RosieDuffield1 @curiocat13 @CarolinePenn2 I’ve paraphrased, but it was essentially to that effect. Let me see if I can find the exact tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @RosieDuffield1 @curiocat13 @CarolinePenn2 I agree. And she needs to be very recognisant of how appalling her statement about staying quiet on racism came across!  She’s definitely being side-eyed from my stand point going forward. People cannot be making statements such as “unless you agree with me, I’ll allow racism”❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @RosieDuffield1 @curiocat13 @CarolinePenn2 All I can say is that Rosie’s Canterbury was won by the efforts of campaigning by young people like Ash/Aaron etc. So Rosie now in power, is trying to go rogue.  Few days ago she declared that she wouldn’t defend ash against racism &amp; misogyny simply coz they disagree on “drugs”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @emilyhewertson @thedsggroup They might as well quit the pretence bcoz its pretty obvious for us all to see. If they’re selectively outraged about ONE forms of racism, then they’re NOT antiracism at all. On the contrary they are the absolute architects of this “culture war” they keep throwing at the “left”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @emilyhewertson Perhaps she can explain to us when there was CLEAR racism towards black people from #DarrenGrimes &amp; Darrens hero Mr White Supremacy Racist #davidstarkey on a right wing platform run by her mates, why she and colleagues were either 🤐🤫 or actively defending the ANTIBLACK racism!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Enabled and promoted by no other than @bbclaurak 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  She’s now giving their narrative of “the scientists have wrong advice” roots and life!  Bravo Laura. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 If they can tweet about their love &amp;compassion for #Paulette who died likely because of their #Windrush policies, (and whom they never showed love &amp; compassion to when alive) -trust and believe they’ll tweet about foodbanks!  They have one-directional sense of TLC for themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft I’d like to kno why these people (Tory youth cheerleaders) are now out en masse posting tweet after tweet trying to suggest that people are siding with Wiley ( they’re not) - acting like they’re SO passionate about being antiracism, but when there’s antiblack hate, they: 💤🛏🤐  https://t.co/Y6TGSpbaBx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson @sajidjavid  - shouldn’t these lads lose their nationality? .... I mean I thought this is what we do nowadays? #PCAndrewHarper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Pardon my ignorance, I’ll ask anyway: I don’t particularly listen to Wiley, I know him by name only ...  Is he traditionally antisemetic? What on Earth triggered this tirade of madness?  I am so confused and speechless 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Someone with insight please shed light #Wiley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Well well well 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessLSainsbury Exactly this point ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  The whole conversation around BAME has become such that White is option A (Default) and then option B is the “etc/ et al) amalgamation of the weird and wonderful into “BAME”. Sorry but nonWhite people: we’re not “etc”, we’re not “and the rest”❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbevan96 He didn’t beg.  Fact: someone started the goFundme page independently to show solidarity with JC!  Stop making stuff up!   #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid @adamboultonSKY Here’s the receipts  https://t.co/tp5CUvDtox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid @adamboultonSKY @sajidjavid @adamboultonSKY Sajid and those media retweeting you (as well as anyone else)  Couple of things: 1) she was called PAULETTE not Pauline  2) Your government contributed to hastening her demise and death 3) you weren’t able to show compassion to her when alive, why now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leftist_agenda @0Calamity That’s the absolute irony of the #FBPE and anti-JC bridage. They’ve shouted out about foodbanks/ charities etc. JC campaigned and run on a manifesto wanting to tackling these injustices! He still campaigns for these things. Yet they want people to leave JC hanging! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Barber10 Everyone is frustrated, annoyed &amp;feeling helpless. Current labour LOTO (like its predecessor one could argue) seems to please some and annoy others- try not to internalise the clusterbombs that seem to be going off in Labour Party.   It’s a right mess, not sure why it was sparked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ Congratulations in advance for tomorrow!! 🙌🏾 🙌🏾! Hard work pays off!   (Shame covid has ruined graduation ceremonies) !!   In any case: 🥂 to your success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @pritipatel @SholaMos1 you’ll not be surprised to hear/ see that tories @pritipatel are now sending their best wishes to #Paulette - after their policies contributed to likely an untimely death!  They’ve got zero ounce of decorum and respect for the dead!  https://t.co/Cudrzcnb3Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning For reference- see attached  https://t.co/94VPh9Ai5K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning Firstly I’ve asked for clarification on your “No” statement, because I still haven’t understood what you meant to refer to.  I asked you to befriend/ engage with black peoples to get an insight, your response was “NO” - what did your “No” mean?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Barber10 These court cases that are orchestrated &amp; organised are extremely expensive. If you listened to Mr Ware on LBC Iain Dale yesterday, they’ve secured a mechanism where labour party won’t fund counter claims, so JC needs funds!  Why haven’t u asked where claimants are getting money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning So what was “no” from you referring to?  And you may have to broaden your friendship circles, because I’m labour voting, black and think there are issues - so this “never heard a bad word” is sketchy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @pritipatel your government and its policies contributed to her death!  Please please out of respect for the dead, have several seats and turn around, head back in the direction you came from. I don’t think #paulette wants your sympathies now that she’s 6ft under!   Have decorum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning “No”   Is that “no” to you don’t want to  befriend black peoples? 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hxmzaliy To be quite frank - if the people suing are suing because their names were leaked - what about Diane, Clive Lewis and Dawn to mention but a few? Who’s name were NOT only mentioned in the report, they were also being discriminated in addition. They should pursue damages🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning If i engage with them- you’ll find out.  It’s really obvious if you look hard enough, first step is: befriend black people or just have dialogue with them, they’ll tell you why there’s a problem.  There really is a problem. We dislike tories-yes, but our vote needs to be earned❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ I am baffled by the amount of haters who are surprised that Jeremy has people who are willing to support him- if everyone has forgotten JC was the one politician who wanted to make life better for the majority. Lower uni fees/ transport/ living costs/ internet/ water etc! Duh❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall “Campaigning  for a better world continues”   Where is the controversy?🤷🏾‍♂️  Is the point journalist want to make that “Jeremy is not allowed to speak ever again?”  The man is still alive, has a voice, why should he live like a mute swan?  Journalists: you’re obsession is desperate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Aya mafoto ya celine are real? Cyangwa ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qsteph Hahaha 😂 werent they telling us about “what house” #HarryandMeghan are renting - apparently no one cares about Meghan?...and when she went food parcel dropping -weren’t they telling us about how much gas her car pumps out?

<|startoftext|>@trapcry 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trapcry Sometimes her plots didn’t make sense - as a matter of fact, hardly any of the plots make sense when she reveals who the killer is! I’m always left thinking “hmmm... but how🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️?”  Haha but he’s Ive got a lot of time for Jessica Fletcher 🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nataliem55 Even more powerful I think that male colleagues should be shown this clip!  #AOC made a very important point: the biggest issue isn’t that #yoho is a vile, crass misogynist. The big problem is that Yoho has an audience (male) who said/did nothing!  Decent men, we need rebuke Yoho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel_Grigg @CapX @CPSThinkTank @tonypatt2000 What does FBPE even stand for/ mean? Never actually understood this movement 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Solidarity with @AOC #YohoGottaGo #AOC   @RepTedYoho calling women younger than your youngest daughter a “bitch” and subsequently using your daughter and wife as a shield to excuse your misogynistic behaviour is crass and unbecoming of an adult man! 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning Thanks for responding in understanding manner. It’s fair to say, we’re all on the same side albeit, we have diverse areas of significant concern, and ultimately everyone focuses in on what affects them most. Keir IMO seems apathetic to concerns about racism towards black peoples<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Rwandapolice Don’t worry, I’ve got you! Things will change!  Rwandans are quite extrovert - so you’ll be changed. 😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning Indeed, as I suggest, everyone assesses and judges current labour through the prism of their needs and wants.   There’s a swathe of people who are not as convinced as you. As a black British minority, I’m not entirely pleased with his handling of racism towards black peoples🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @Rwandapolice Kinyarwanda is the mother tongue, spoken by virtually 100% of the population. Kinyarwanda is similar to Burundi mother tongue -a bit like Scottish vs. English -accent is the strongest variant between the 2. English and French are both widely spoken as second official languages😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@br_nning I find your statement amusing. More could be asked of Keir starmer, as indeed nothing or anyone is perfect and they can improve and do better.   He is not in infallible being.  What is clear is that everyone judges throuhh the prism of their own needs/wants. He’s satisfied YOU👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rwandapolice Fishing is now considered “poaching” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  This is new. Nonese abaturage bagomba kurya ibijumba hari ikiyaga kirimo amafi? In horizon?   Nonese no muri Kivu abaturage ntibemerewe kuroba?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews What did Camilla do to merit any such role?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  So there aren’t any qualified people to hold the role? Camilla was the best candidate for the role?

<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Are these real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjaminbutter Only the quotation marks are misplaced - JC did NOT say “I’m not sorry” - so this is yet again journalists getting it fundamentally wrong 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @evolvepolitics She subsequently went on a twitter blocking tirade at anyone questioning how stupid, wrong&amp; infantile her respond to @AyoCaesar was!  It also just goes to show how BAME experiences and lives are at the mercy of certain people! She qWhite literally said: I’ll allow/enable racism🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama Hold on,  can I get this straight - is @RosieDuffield1 the MP who desperately needed the youth vote in #Canterbury ? And the youth - @AyoCaesar included were campaigning on her behalf? And she repays then by suggesting “in future when you’re victim of racism, I’ll not bother”❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieDuffield1 @AyoCaesar @RosieDuffield1 with all due respect u need to grow up!   Just because u may DISAGREE with someone does not mean In future you THROW @AyoCaesar to the wolves!  You’re an ADULT and you’re an MP, it is your JOB and DUTY to defend AND be “Bothered” about ALL our safety! Grow Up!🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward Here’s my take: amongst many things, good or bad, this action by labour under stewardship of #keirstarmer has essentially strained every senew to compensate people (political decision, rather than legal requirement).Meanwhile LOTO has done zilch for victims of the leaked report🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @JeffBezos @piersmorgan it’s not “anger” - it’s society asking:   What does he do with his immense wealth to help address the world’s biggest challenges?   Everyone admires hard work and success. That’s not in question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC @KevanJonesMP I know @NickFerrariLBC is right wing/ Tory voting etc- but I didn’t think he was supporter of foreign interference in the UKs democratic process!

<|startoftext|>@DominicRaab @SecPompeo “Uphold security and prosperity of your people”.... right? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤨  @DominicRaab will achieve that by enabling #annescoolas to escape investigation and criminal charges by failing to stop her leaving the UK.

<|startoftext|>@hassan_akkad Untrue! NHS Doctor here - the government should properly pay ALL public sector workers!   There should NOT be a differential treatment.

<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @lewis_goodall - the fact that the successive Tory governments have FAILED/ REFUSED to investigate Russia interference in British politics is IN ITSELF- a smoking gun!

<|startoftext|>@IwriteOK God -those are legit murder holes?Unbelievable  Hopefully once this is over, Americans and the rest of the westerner world can learn to appreciate what “our” military do overseas - I suspect they’re acting with restraint here because cameras are on, journalists etc. Imagine Iraq?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @BethRigby @ScarthLloyd Madness madness madness!  Also, persistence of a “Royal monarchy” only serves to perpetuate this bizarre mentality. The class system is alive and thriving in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @mrjamesob how many Tory MPs actually left/kicked out last year? As far as I reckon less than 20.  If all it takes is around 20MPs to leave for the Tory party to become a fully fledged Frankenstein, then I suggest to you that the Tory party was already rogue!  It was ALWAYS nasty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FanofStanMiller @smcbride360 Lisa - frankly I don’t have time for you and your nonsense.  Kindly take yourself, your trump game, idiocy and whatever else you rep somewhere else!   I am NOT interested at this hour of the night (GMT+0)   Ta<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @FanofStanMiller Haha 😂 you people actually need help. 1) trump is a 🔔end who is racist and doesn’t deserve to be in the seat he’s in - however that’s besides the point  2) covid does not give 2 damns about trump  3) we’re in the UK🇬🇧 - how dumb is Lisa ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idster @ptlovebird @davenewworld_2 Hahaha what an idiot -  So the next person who walks past me - is invading my space and I have the right to commit battery and assault on them... because whatever they were holding on their hand was “adversarial”!   Can you get anymore moronic? Western education absolutely wasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FanofStanMiller @smcbride360 Haha 😂 keep spinning in your conspiracies!  Absolutely laughable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 “the medical correspondent for bbc disagrees” guess what there are 1000s of medical practitioners with differing opinions; it doesn’t change the fact that illnesses kill!  Ever heard of reading for yourself? Reading peer-reviewed material? Nope - you’d rather “a man on TV said”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 The advice changed when the mortality started to get out of control. It has sod all to do political lobbying.  By all means go ahead and put your life at risk - that’s up to you. But those so in the knowledge that you’re following idiots - not the science or medicine 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 How is this actually possible?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 It’s because in your lifetime there hadn’t been anything like this.   Also you’ve been privileged enough not to live in areas where pandemics break out -if you lived in places where Ebola etc broke out, your experience would be very different!   It’s HEALTH not politics! Jesus🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @Okwonga Exactly! Police seem to be allowed presumption of innocence, an investigation into “mitigating and extenuating” circumstances.   But the victims of their brutality (and crimes) are never given the same extenuating circumstances allowances!   Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 Incorrect- during the Spanish flu 1918 - masks😷 were recommended.  Your statement is therefore 💯% wrong: they were RECOMMENDED in 1918 to combat an illness   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  On a serious note: why would you rather follow conspiracy theorists? Utterly bizarre🧐🧐  https://t.co/GNKj1XuNFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okwonga @mike_adama Meanwhile, they have arrested people protesting the death of #BreonnaTaylor in their 100s!  USA can move its resources to arrest those seeking justice for black people, however it will NOT do the same to bring criminals who kill black people to justice! Mad  #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil I really dont understand the desire of many people to provide the government the benefit of the doubt in things that they SHOULD have got right.  When a foreign national commits a crime on our soil: their passport/visas SHOULD and CAN be frozen by the government! Harry was failed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil Read about the case - it is NOT true that the government was powerless to prevent the departure of #Annescoolas!  Also I’m curious why you’re so intent on covering up the government in this: THEY FAILED a British citizen! Pure and simple. #HarryDunn 🙏🏽🤷🏾‍♂️   https://t.co/jTYRa5fh6o  https://t.co/gGPmkV7nI6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil Isn't it the gov's duty to keep its citizens safe from crime and abuse? How can UK gov simultaneously argue it stands to promote British interests, whilst enabling wrong-doers and granting them Heathrow as a swift get out of jail passageway?  (Mind you ALL parties guilty on this)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil Glad we agree But, I believe when this story further developed: it transpired that she actually didnt have immunity? Also, she gave statement to police on the day of the crash, she flew out few days later.  UK has FOREVER known USA abuses policy, they've done sod all to stop it🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil 1) Whilst we wait, we currently are the highest 4) #AnneScoolas SHOULD HAVE NEVER got through passport control at Heathrow -Raab's REMIT (She'd just killed a Brit Citizen, she left prior to investigation being complete 5) Tory Gov REFUSING to publish FULL report What else u need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman The media must be so gutted that is not Cuba/ Russia etc. They love showing us when 'enemy' countries are failing.  But foodbanks in UK, racism in USA - NOTHING TO SEE HERE, keep calm and carry on drinking tea... Brexit means Brexit, Get Brexit done,  cocaine-Gove, repeat🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤐🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil Yeah bla bla Accomplishments: 1) Worst Covid19 death rate in Europe 2) Corruption galore: #robertjenrick &amp;Desmond money for building projects 3) DomCummings breaks rules willy-nilly -no consequence 4) Raab lets #Annescoolas escape after killing Brit citizen 5) Priti bullies staff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @KRUZAA_ Oh mate - in that case count on it!   Obviously covid has to die out first etc. But I’ll definitely bear it in mind 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @KRUZAA_ Well - next time I organise a Rwanda/african gathering for BBQ, you may receive an invitation 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!!   Come along!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @KRUZAA_ It’s a special relish/sauce they make to baste and coat the brochettes in as they cook  I know it has tomato paste +lemon juice, Dijon mustard, lemon, herbs (of some sort) salt and pepper (+/- scotch bonnet pepper) !! It is glorious!  This chat making me want to travel to Rwanda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @KRUZAA_ Ahh? You a fan of the goat!?  Weird trivia: most african nations (bar some Islamic ones) - goat is eaten FAR MORE frequently than lamb!   In Rwanda, lamb/mutton is considered meat for the poor. Goat on the other hand 🖐🏾 - oh lord 🙏🏽 🙌🏾 🙌🏾 #brochette #rwanda  https://t.co/7npwo6BRfY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KRUZAA_ Not just at bbq - anywhere to be honest!   That curry powder definitely ain’t going nowhere! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobaFatt @duvvid @DavidOlusoga You do realise that an individual can be an idiot as well as have health problems?!  For record idiot is a noun meaning: acting stupidly/ with lack of intelligence or common sense!  #KanyeWest acted stupidly belittling #HarrietTubman!   Idiots need to be held to account &amp;checked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobaFatt @DavidOlusoga @BobaFatt loses the argument and starts to accuse @DavidOlusoga of setting “attack dogs” on him! - idiot  1) It wasn’t David who called #KanyeWest an idiot  2) what kanye said was stupid, incorrect therefore makes Kanye idiotic 3) it’s good to call out idiocy! Thanks @PeteOlusoga  https://t.co/iQPGAR6PZS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idster @bln231 @davenewworld_2 LOL- remind me to bodyslam the next person who waves a feather duster at me - I’ll be so afraid that my life is at risk that I’ll have no choice but to body slam him/her - potentially break their arm, all because a feather on as stick is life threatening!  Get the F outta here!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @voxdotcom There’s a difference between USAs Democrats vs republicans and UKs tories vs labour! Since Bernie withdrawal Democrats have amalgamated into going beyond the “character” leading the democrats and more about POLICIES &amp; IDEOLOGY!   In UK, Starmers labour alienates when convenient❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham I’m confused - why did it take this long for the nurse to tell us what happened?   Why wait for an entire month and longer to reveal this essential information?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scotty_H73 @afneil Haha   And meanwhile what have your beloved Tory experts managed to do better?   🥱🥱🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philiparrogers @mrjamesob Well if kicking out 5-10 MPs means the party is left with rogue members - I’m afraid the party was majority rogue to start with!  So I still hold that the whole party is enabling this!   The conservatives are in it together. They’re ideology against the EU has smokescreened them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point -they’re using the term ALL to suggest they care about everyone in the world.   ALL is a synonym for white as far as they’re concerned! They’re using the term ALL to appear normal and measured!  Recall Farage/Trump etc garnered votes by pretending to be measured!❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philiparrogers @mrjamesob And what has the “Tory” party done in response?  They’ve gone along with it. How many tories have publicly called him and DonCummings out.  When you’re driving along in a family car, and the driver starts doing dangerous manoeuvres - someone calls them out to restore safety🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobinDark3 Fair enough lol - I guess where there’s credits, it’s only fair to acknowledge it.  Meanwhile twitter characters aren’t long enough to list the plethora of wrongs, injustices etc that the gov has poured upon the British population!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Its what happens when you lend your voice to a corrupt government led by rule breakers such as #Domcummings - on a serious note: what on earth did people expect?  The current tory gov is composed of chancers, men and women who believe in shouting loudest, with no follow up action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Its the regular “fresh hell” that this incompetent Tory government &amp; its cheerleaders (right wing media/commentators) spew out on a regular basis.  Since coming to power, apart from shouting “Brexit, get brexit done, end free movement” what have they actually positively achieved?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well this is a load of nonsense @DominicRaab suggests that he &amp; gov have “consistently” been on the side of the family: that’s incorrect. Raab enabled  #annesacoolas to go through passport control🛂, in the full knowledge that Americans never comply with extradition!   Lies ❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idster @davenewworld_2 I don’t care if you’re a liberal or Jesus, he dangled a donut! He didn’t threaten nobody!  Next time someone waves a feather within 50cm of my body, I shall body slam them because im being threatened by a feather!   Get the hell outta here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigazighmmm Surely u agree: presumably you’ve got friends/ relationships with people you deeply care about. You’re in touch with them on a daily basis, you know what is normal/abnormal in them:  The day they say/act💯% wrong, you telling me that you’ll just walk past/ignore?   I defo wouldnt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toekneerlynos We are here for the way you 💯checked the situation!  “Yo we leaving right now”   This is a lesson people need in life, when you witness something that’s all the way fucked up, you need to have a MORAL COMPASS that tells you to dissociate yourself with the madness!   👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigazighmmm His wife #KimKardashianWest ?   Why would you let your husband go on a platform proclaiming that he almost killed your daughter?   Most couples who go into politics have daily dinner table chats about the plans and progress...  Why has Kim &amp; sisters NOT checked him? 🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌🤷🏾‍♂️🆘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 Is possession of a donut a crime? As far as I can see the donut never even touched the officer -therefore not sure how dangling an object is “assault”  The actual assault happened when the officer touched him (battery) then twisted his arm (assault)! USA you’re a mess! Period🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Hmm ... @kourtneykardash and the rest of the Kardashian family - you all need to save the niece because this man is not okay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeritLaw The irony of ALL ironies is:  #kanyewest voluntarily took his black self to WhiteHouse to receive a red MAGA hat from a known white supremacist racist narcissist.

<|startoftext|>@evanbeentrill @50cent hmm, who took his black self to wear MAGA cap &amp; serve a white racist man?

<|startoftext|>@bev_gardner1 Nice attempt at backtracking:  @bev_gardner1 who exactly is 'WE' that is being 'fazed' out. Clearly the 'we' is not black people, so do elaborate on who the 'we' is referring to.  https://t.co/J9umAwDsJ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InquietamSomnia @amber693 @bodhibrian @NeilClark66 Haha I just love how thick people are. The THEATRE is NOT sterile.

<|startoftext|>@InquietamSomnia @chrisferro @bodhibrian @NeilClark66 The premise of this thread was that: Masks are unsafe &amp; that they make wearer 'faint'.

<|startoftext|>@InquietamSomnia @bodhibrian @NeilClark66 Two things: 1) we do NOT wear cloth masks in operating theatres, 2) surgical masks are worn every day by theatre staff, operations can vary from an 1hr to several hours, the surgical masks are designed to maintain normal oxygen saturations.  If u dont know, ASK, its easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InquietamSomnia @bodhibrian @NeilClark66 More evidence that some adults on twitter have LITERALLY never been in operating theatres to operate on patients.  Who told you that in an operating theatre we wear 'cloth' masks?  You all clearly need work experience exposure. You quite literally have NO clue! Wasted education<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa I’m concerned for him - ko numva avuga nkaho something is around the corner?   Genda Rwanda uri nziza 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodhibrian @NeilClark66 Haha God, it’s incredible how simple some British🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧 Adults are! Wasted free education.   Do you even know what operating theatre etiquette is? Meaning of “aseptic”?   Hahaha - who told you a mask takes away the ability of the nose to move air in and out of the body?  🥱🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodhibrian @NeilClark66 Haha yes, love to see that: virtue signaling about a job.   Yaay 🤪🥳🤪🥳 my work involves aseptic technique to prevent patients becoming infected during an operation, therefore reducing post surgery complications, infections, sepsis and death!   Woop woop 🙌🏾 #VirtueSignaling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodhibrian @NeilClark66 You’ve clearly never been in an operating theatre, performing the operation... so with all due respect:  JOG ON - I’ve just got out of one, an hour ago - on a Saturday - I think I know what I am talking about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilClark66 how many surgeons collapse when they have to wear masks &amp; visors for anything from 2hrs to 10hrs in an operation? We also have comorbidities such as asthma, respiratory/heart conditions. However for the safety of our patients WE WEAR MASKS! Come for work experience, you’ll see🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bernardsmernard @Keir_Starmer @jeremycorbyn @jeremycorbyn has receipts, tories also have receipts of fact they wanted #MandelaDay hung &amp; killed⚰️- so let’s not even buy any bullshit they come out with today. #KeirStarmer was 22 years old in 1984 when Jeremy was arrested fighting against racism!

<|startoftext|>@DucaaleWeyne I remember the noise it made ... incredible. I think they purposely flew it quite low for all to see! It was incredible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DucaaleWeyne It flew over my secondary school - quite low ... in new cross - lewisham borough   Was it definitely 2003? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️... I’m sure we saw it in 2004<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raider_Watch @matt_quinlisk @Ratking_Charles @lmechegaray @RexChapman Some people do it to give alibis to bullshit behaviour.

<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Preach preach preach! Not often I find myself full heartedly agreeing with @officialbarnesy  - but there’s a first for everything!  The instability in most of the so called “3rd world” can be directly attributed to colonialism and how colonials drew maps/ divided people etc!🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinRemains More importantly: why does our democratic process have procedures and customs like this?   If the public was given votes on half the knighthoods that are proposed and given by the PM - majority would fail to meet minimum threshold! The systems need abolishing/reset ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chimenead @Jo_Marney @LibmannSachs1 @meghmarkle WOW just read these messages from @Jo_Marney -what a bigot and racist! And she’s now arguing that it’s okay to be “offensive” (in other words: racist) as long as it’s in private?  On one had she argues that she apologised for her racism, then argues being racist privately is ok❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy It's astonishing when white people say "well the irish were enslaved they're not banging on about it"?  As @officialbarnesy highlights -the subsequent impact of the enslavement is 100% different. Whether people like it not, the confounding factor is: WHITENESS. #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ What are these called? They look great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon I want to ask something: what is the point of the new speaker of the house?  Misleading statements are made in parliament, and he seems to be oblivious.   Does he have no insight into details? Does he not care?   What is the point of him? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Difference being #Domcummings actually broke guidelines &amp; rules that he helped establish, then arrogantly got PM to support him in his rule breaking🤷🏾‍♂️  JC - speculation and no proof.

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Spot on!  💯 agree with ur last sentence in particular! People see whiteness as default -one could be Australian, South African, American, Canadian, German, French etc -as long as you’re white, its cool. If youre “coloured” -questions are asked, and you’re reminded you’re foreign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 It is indeed disturbing and frankly insulting that in some British people’s eyes: BAME multi generation individuals citizenship is dispensable? How many make the same arguments for say a white British with Italian/Spanish heritage? None! They see us as GUESTS, not compatriots🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa How is this possible? Are laws for playing ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Didn’t expect this tweet from David 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbarnesy Issue sadly is, unlike the corona which seems to devastate everyone, and everyone (all races) are eager to see vaccine/cure produced, when it comes to racism, there are some that benefit, and those that are victims. There are different interests in racism, not every1 wants cure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bonn1eGreer Note please that this “stripping” of nationality seems to only apply to non white people  I’m waiting to hear about the day Sajid &amp; Priti argued that: white British female drug mules in Peru should have had their British Nationality revoked, and similar etc. #BAME under the bus🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodwinMJ Welcoming &amp;tolerant country where the gov drives around “Go back home vans” and if you’re black British of #windrush heritage, gov adopts a “deport now, investigate later” policy.  A country where ur accent/ name determines a job offer etc! Fool someone else🤣❌#BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenJukes2 @MartinDaubney What car documents? You need to be specific  The police can run your plate number and get ALL the information they need about the car, including MOT!   So you need to actually specify the legal document they were asking for!  “What is car documents” hahaha 😂 you’re hilarious👌🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenJukes2 @MartinDaubney Well it shouldn’t have happened, what papers were they asking for?   The only thing they’re legally entitled to ask you to confirm is your car insurance.   Lastly, the police in this case had no justifiable explanation. So 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ - it’s profiled them. End of story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 🔥 A MOVEMENT not a moment!🔥  💯 is all I can say! 👌🏾🔥    #BlackLivesMatter - a movement that will carry on until there is parity for all races 👌🏾🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChantayyJayy -Yes Chanté -keeping it real on ITV programme #HasBritainChanged -Dont let them gaslight you into some weird submission. That Police woman is being disingenuous. You make a good point: The judiciary system is skewed against BAME people. Same crime diff sentences❌🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Hmm...they were parking AT THEIR ADDRESS.  They (police) had NO evidence/ intelligence to justify/ reinforce their interruption of the couple's activity.  So the police should be investigated for abuse of powers.  #BlackLivesMatter - soz if black lives mattering offends u so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anarkysheep @benjaminbutter @RulesSelmer @LauraAlvarezJC @HuskerDude247 I was literally thinking this....Can @benjaminbutter present with evidence of the times they've doorstepped MattHancock for presiding over Europe's worst covid19 health management?

<|startoftext|>@arighthandful @EmergMedDr @BBCNews The speed with which #BristolCity has removed the replacement statues🆚their reluctance and digging heels in with re: to editing plaque or removing #colstonstatue says all there is to say about #BlackLivesMatter as far as Britain is concerned: we’d rather pray to a slave master🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claire_Phipps I love how the local @BristolCouncil is able to steadfastly remove the replacement statue -which harmed nobody, had no dodgy murderous history, but, they dug their heels when locals asked to edit colston plaque or remove #colstonstatue! Their actions today speaks volumes ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrschlosberg @UKLabour Is this actually happening? And is this relating to #LabourLeaks ?   Another method of LOTO showing why I shouldn’t render my vote to the Labour Party! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ hmm, i am not so sure, tories may scratch and punch each other on the surface, but when it comes to common ground - they unite.  Something Labour etc. are unable to learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Apparently not, according to right wingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Well they're led by #dominicummings - someone you were 110% supportive of.   So, seeing Tories gave him their blessings and best wishes, why are you lot now suddenly recognising the ridiculousness of your governing party?   Writing has been on the wall for MONTHS #JulianLewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes They already used her as token, she took the token offer, this was the day they rolled her out to talk about how 'there's no racism in UK' that the UK is absolutely 'bliss' for BAME (black people). Unsurprisingly, her statements were without evidence/proof, BAME criticised her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queenchristina_ @pritipatel @YvetteCooperMP I just want to hear from all the tory cheerleaders who hounded #dianeabbott for the slightest error, where are you when your home girl #Pritipatel struggles in doing basic due diligence: being updated on NUMBERS &amp; FIGURES?  The silence is deafening! Hello Emily, Darren, Tom?🤷‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil I think you will find there are thousands of black BRITISH Citizens who have suffered appalling discrimination and racism in this country because of the colour of their skin.  They are British whether you like their conduct or not, and they are strongly supportive of BLM. Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford @OfficialUoM Good things come to those, who stand up when for the rest it is easier to stay sat down, pretending they can’t see/hear the injustice around them!   @MarcusRashford well deserved mate! You deserve the recognition! Consider setting up your own charity to sponsor/scholarships🤷🏾‍♂️🙌🏾😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBegnaud Does he understand the concept of “proportions” ? Has he done the damn maths?  Raw numbers may suggest so, but not when you take into consideration the percentage proportions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Whatever happened to Parler? Noone will criticise you on Parler, if you feel worried, I thought Parler was the place to be?

<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ Ahh I see! I guess some sort of weird coalition?  In any case the man needs to go, he is a hindrance to peace and normalisation of the region - from what I’ve seen over the years! Very intransigent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ How does he keep being re-elected is the bigger question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisshipitv They’re right- she does indeed pose a high risk of fleeing! She apparently simultaneously holds a French Nationalty - France does NOt extradite to America. Moreover she had the money and connections to organise private jets - therefore she is very much at risk of fleeing❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil Lol - yes colour is not not important when it’s not you being racially discriminated, disenfranchised, relegated to bottom etc. Your supremacy tendencies are very blatant, despite your abysmal efforts to disguise it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarajaneoreilly She’s bloody stunning! #PrinceHarry done well! #HarryandMeghan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCBMEP Ahhh ..... so there aren’t any white families on the welfare state, who refuse to work, who continue to have children...  ..... England’s problems are all because of foreign people!  How dare these non-white people have 👶 children! How dare they have a phone/TV. How dare they!😤  https://t.co/7RhEjRTOyq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I hope that when you’re busy being friendly with them: you actually call them out!  Also not sure sharing wine &amp;pints with racist white supremacists is a great thing to boast about.  Farage is a known &amp; proven xenophobe, he’s also racist, why would you feel need to grin with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilClark66 I hasten to add: the developments also show the government’s incompetence. Many months ago, many countries considered and promoted masks, instead UK ridiculed the idea, months later here we are. Same attitude was seen with the lockdown. Britain is making it as they go! Appalling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaneBaptweets This!!👆🏽🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👆🏽  They can tell apart plants, dogs, cats, birds, pasta, reptiles, eggs - BUT ask them to tell apart BAME people?!  Too hard! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  Ask them to read/ investigate? “Nah it’s alright, we’ll deport and investigate later”  They get it wrong on purpose due to laziness🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJS_007 @_SalmanAnwar He comes across as though he was born in the same household as JacobReesMogg.   He comes across very entitled, arrogant &amp; snobby. I mean don’t get me wrong; I am sure he may be a decent man. But the arrogance he spews out is off putting🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJS_007 @_SalmanAnwar Lol - same here! Although there’s an episode he did in india where he sits in a beautiful palace sorroubded by lush exotic plants, sipping a gin/tonic and as he necks the drink he says something along the lines of “Brit Empire had a point and right to conquer India”🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌WTF😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJS_007 @_SalmanAnwar Spot on! Also it highlights #michaelportillo ignorance of nonWhite migrant experiences. I’ve seen a lot of “you do realise Michael is child of Spanish refugee” - well thanks for the details, but Michael seems to fail to understand the complex/unpredictable life of immigrants❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanjstedman @CalumKirkcaldy It will be “world beating” and it will ensure the Tory government will “wrap its arms around the shores of the United Kingdom” providing a protective “shield”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  And Priti Patel will ensure “unskilled” social care workers never cross into the UK, bcoz we are most tolerant🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoekennedy @KimmyMayLeo @thetwerkinggirl Haha cut and paste is my Path of least resistance for everything!

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Use a good phone or scanner: Scan a white page with your signature on it - on the computer- screenshot the scanned signature.

<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 If people are prepared to smear by whipping up propaganda, whipping up fakenews, whipping up exaggerations that’s aren’t entirely correct - they need to be able to justify their statements/ writing.  He engaged in nonsense and ended up jobless, his own making entirely🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 No, on the contrary, I want to live in a world where we dont indulge in insulting people. Making up things about people we disagree with, whipping up propaganda about people we disagree with. BLM is a MOVEMENT not an isolated organisation/entity. He needs to be accurate! Its easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 Secondly, a company reserves right to hire &amp; employ those it chooses based on what they stand for/image they wish to portray! In the world of employment he’s not the first nor last person to be fired. People get hired/fired everyday. He needs to read the contracts he signs❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 Lets get one FACT straight right off the bat: saying #BlackLivesMatter is not “neo-marxism” the latter has been a trope conjured by right wingers/those seeking to extinguish the plight for equality for all. BLM is not an organisation its movement. So his comments were INCORRECT❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 I’ve just read this article - and his comments were ignorant and stupid, right that they evaluated him.  A private entity can pick and choose whom it wants to represent/ work for it. When I worked in retail- I’ve seen colleagues fired for lesser issues! Is this all you got?🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willbox26 @OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 When has anyone gone up to “average working class” people expressing their views at pub/ home/ barber💈, restaurant/ garden/ park/ car/ train/ plane/ boat etc. and gagged them, taping their mouth shut preventing them from expressing themselves?   Evidence will be appreciated🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @JuliaHB1 On one hand right wing want to claim they’ve been cancelled, they’ve been chased out of public etc. Yet they are simultaneously the ones with loudest platforms: RADIO and newspapers. They’re on TV daily, they even have an additional cave called Parler.   Right wing: STOP lying🤥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Right!!!   That mark he’s made can be analaysed in  so many different ways depending on who you are! Not sure why @LucyMPowell trying to speak non behalf of everyone!   Nope! Lucy you don’t speak for Diane/ Dawn/ etc. Nor BLM (black people in general) - just saying! NOPE 👎🏾<|endoftext|>

WTF🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad It’s all unraveling and the reality is dawning on them, now they’re all panicking!

<|startoftext|>@KateWilliamsme Nope UK couldnt -the level of attack #MeghanMarkle gets even when shes left the shores of UK just goes to show how not so tolerant the UK claims to be!

<|startoftext|>@Goddess1345 @paulwaugh @mattzarb @HackneyAbbott Absolutely! I love how we are able to relate about this topic! I felt compelled to speak up on behalf of Diane!

<|startoftext|>@NabeelaAkh @paulwaugh @mattzarb @HackneyAbbott Absolutely I feel like so many minority groups can relate! Our parents would quite literally sleep on the floor if it meant we got into a good school, achieved our potential! This is why so often despite being first generation immigrants, migrant kids do well🙏🏽! Be proud+thankful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker Wow is that the faces behind GuidoFawkes - grim grim and more grimness 🤔🤔🤢🤢🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__R_Adair__ I think you’re right. It’s such a shame the questioning went so far off the railway track and in the end it all fell apart like a titanic crash.  And I’m also glad we could politely agree- twitter can often be a place where people just shout (figuratively) at a keypad lol! 🤝🤷🏾‍♂️🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__R_Adair__ Moreover, in light of #windrushday on 22June -where Diane publically posted about her mum, a windrush generation nurse -her family were also IMMIGRANTS to UK, coming to rebuild a post war UK - meanwhile in 2020 all Diane gets is racism, bigotry and vitriol! Her mum was NOT rich❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__R_Adair__ Thanks for insight, I am not denying his history -but the point is- everyone has a journey (as he according to you does)- I am sure he would not appreciate it if some viscount snarkly started patronising him about his privileged childhood, totally dismissing his family history🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imarklamb @_SalmanAnwar Lol #michaelportillo IS a WHITE man, who is also entitled and privileged.   Sorry that pointing the obvious is apparently racist - in Mark Lamb eyes!   Bye 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddieeagle5 @_SalmanAnwar Bla bla bla bla   On windrush day not very long ago, Diane told her mum’s trip as a windrush generation nurse.   Those who want to know Dianes struggle and journey can do so. Those who want to ridicule her can also do so.   Some of us in society are not moronic 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Hahahaa “left live in echo-chambers” says the woman whose fans and teamplayers run to Parler - the echo chamber of racism/ bigotry and hate!   The real echo chamber is Parler and those who run to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent @MetroUK Solidarity with #Dawnbutler - its tragic to think we live in a country where such hatred towards others: be race/ religion/ orientation/ political beliefs - persists often unabated and frequently fueled by a dishonest media. All those who call themselves decent: Be Anti-Racist!🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Triciagreig2 @paulwaugh @mattzarb @HackneyAbbott Absolutely! it is not okay for ignorant people to make sweeping statements like “your parents lived in such and such postcode AND you dressed well” therefore you were rich! Many parents make immense sacrifices to give their kids best start in life. Children witness the sacrifices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBarutta @paulwaugh @mattzarb @HackneyAbbott Exactly!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyinLondon @_SalmanAnwar Doesnt excuse the style of questioning! As I said “just bcoz ur parents live in a particular post code” does not mean they were there sipping champagne, living the high life! And being able dress properly? My parents used to buy clothes from charities to dress us, we looked clean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwaugh @mattzarb @HackneyAbbott I would hate for an entitled white person to interview me in 30years time and suggest “well your parents lived in Kent and you were able to dress properly, therefore they can’t have been poor” - you don’t know my parents, you don’t know their fight, you never walked their shoes❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent People are asking for steadfastness &amp; actions! Not “momentary” knee gestures followed by inaction &amp; political game playing.🤷🏾‍♂️  We already know what Keir &amp; his team are capable of swift responses and actions when it comes to some forms of racism, they need same energy at ALL times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent Yes yes @DawnButlerBrent ! Good to see and hear from you!   We big you up!   And wish you strength and courage!   #BlackLivesMatter 👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent If I pondered beyond what is available in terms of tangible material: Dawns letter, keirs public response- I would be assuming. Whilst Im sure there may be actions behind the scene: unless Im made prvy I cant substantiate.  And I DONT know what Keir did before, u seem to, tell me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Im not assuming; Im judging the situation based on what information is currently available to the public: Dawns letter refers to Police being helpful, it doesnt mention anyone else Keir or otherwise.  Keir tweet doesnt suggest any prior intervention. What’s there to assume🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent No when i asked “are you assuming”, I was referring to “are you assuming what course of action took place?”  This isn’t a circular debate - you suggested there’s more to this, which there could be, but unless you’ve spoken to Dawn or Keir, not sure how you can substantiate🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent U said “there’s more to offering support than tweeting” which is true, what I am asking is what information have you been made privy to; that suggests Keir and his Inner circle did additional actions beyond tweeting. And I remind you, Dawn tweeted on Wednesday. Are u assuming?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl From that angle - that darker skin doll looks rather annoyed 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @PatrickWDixon @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent U seem to suggest that he did something more useful in between time Dawn sent out her plea for help which was a whole 24hrs before Keir made any public acknowledgement.  What are we not privy to? Did he visit Dawn physically before tweeting? Did he send his team before tweeting?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil UK: most tolerant country in the world? Yes Britain the country where a white supremacist is given a TV platform to spew out racist bigotry!

<|startoftext|>@resistandgrow @davenewworld_2 I was thinking the exact same!   NONE of the non-black officers approached her to perhaps whisper “we can stand here, if you want to go to the car and get away from this racism towards black abuse” or even “are you okay to remain in this situation?”  They just standing like🤷🏾‍♂️😴🤥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Truth of matter is, the #LabourLeaks revealed Diane, Dawn &amp; Clive to be MPs who were targets of INTERNAL racism! So from get go: #KeirStarmer was aware that Dawns welfare is at risk!  His apparent failure today with @DawnButlerBrent is a symptom of ignorance to abuse to black🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miqdaad @Keir_Starmer Didnt this story break yesterday? I certainly saw #Dawnbutler twitter post last night before going bed. Why its taken an entire 24hr for Dawn’s Party leadership to comment and respond: I WILL NEVER KNOW!  Didn’t #KeirStarmer say there’s NO room for racism when he dealt with RLB?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyKel43403463 @Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent @UKLabour And once the chief whip is in receipt of the information that a party member and senior MP is receiving death threats, racism abuse, her staff are being targeted as well - what does he do with the information?  at what point is the LOTO and his inner circle informed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @DawnButlerBrent Lol 🤷🏾‍♂️😂  Better late than never I guess....  PS curious question: does the @UKLabour have any internal mechanisms for keeping up to date with how it’s MPs are getting on?   How the hell was the labour leadership not aware of the developing issue? If only you’d listen to Diane🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @neeyulll @DawnButlerBrent @AngelaRayner Thanks @PatrickWDixon - it actually means a lot to hear someone say “I get your perspective”   Too often on this platform - everyone is far more motivated in cancelling out the views and experiences of the other... for what gain? I’ll never know!  Once again: thanks 👍🏽👍🏽✅✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray This is dreadfully sad!   The fact that he was revealing such painful experience without breaking down shows that hes had to get used to it. it no longer breaks him. Social isolation in school is dreadful. Knowing that once bell goes, u have no friends to run to, sit with etc.😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @neeyulll @DawnButlerBrent @AngelaRayner Its not even very hard - which is why I’m so confused by the approach taken by labour  RACISM in ALL forms is WRONG and unacceptable at ALL TIMES  We should dispense the same energy to fight against ALL forms of racism. One type of racism should not attract 10/10, the other 1/10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 I agree with @JuliaHB1 ‼️‼️  Meanwhile why are other politicians not speaking out in support and solidarity... as would normally be the case - if for example this was an issue of antisemitism.❌  Why does the British community have a differential approach to racism&amp;discrimination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @neeyulll @DawnButlerBrent @AngelaRayner It is this repeating pattern of contrasting reactions to evidences of racism &amp; discrimination that makes BAME (especially black) feel uneasy- not just with Labour but with our nation and all sides of politics.  There IS a contrasting reaction. It’s NOT fair. We want to know why🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @neeyulll @DawnButlerBrent @AngelaRayner Indeed!  this is where some1 like me (black) wonders: why is there a repeating pattern: #LabourLeaks reveal DISGUSTING systemic racism towards black people, lab leadership is informed- Leader does nothing (until things are leaked). But AS he’s first to act: is there a hierarchy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @neeyulll @DawnButlerBrent I’m very pleased @AngelaRayner has said something.  However, not long ago when Keir fired RLB he made a point of reminding the country that labour stands against racism -he was steadfast in addressing the issue around RBL- his apparent ignorance/silence contradicts his words🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulj131313 @crushed422 @afneil I guess “Jog on” wasn’t clear enough!  I’ll give you a helping hand: - go read a book - go back to your echo chamber of bigotry and ignorance   - You’re blocked 🤷🏾‍♂️👋🏽👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeyulll Has anyone in the party leadership spoken up in defence and solidarity with @DawnButlerBrent ...   I’ll hazard a guess.... #KeirStarmer is too busy wooing Tory voters by pretending he hasn’t heard the news about #Dawnbutler - just in case it startles tories that he’s proBlack🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ammejo1 @Rozie221 @afneil U really think black peoples sit&amp; think “wow Im pleased &amp; glad there’s black people killing black people?” -FYI: We dont!  Just because we’re fighting to end racism (which disproportionately has a bigger impact on the black community AT LARGE) does not mean we excuse other issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@butwhatifitsall Great views!! Where is this? @butwhatifitsall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PufcNathan @SkyCricket I am honestly curious - what drives people like this to make comment like this.  People watch cricket to “engage their ears and eyes” to the cricket ball and bat? Nathan felt that this black man speaking up about racism took away from his ability to “listen and watch” bloody hell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl 💯 Also reality check- these interracial relationships as great as they are towards building a more tolerant society- Sonia met and married her black husband years after husband had endured whatever hardships he did, she’s no idea what walking in his shoes was like prior!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌‼️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RDBrwanda @CityofKigali @kigalitoday @NdahiroPapy @BeliseKariza  - Is there any website that has the new tourism tariffs? I have colleagues in Europe who wish to #visitrwanda in September 2020.  (I have been on RDB site, it doesnt show)  Murakoze!  #kigali #rwanda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Wow @thetwerkinggirl -first time seeing u live and I am 💯 glad I follow u!

<|startoftext|>@_vbvvctnd @afneil This is about “ADMITTING” historical events rather than excusing them or completely denying them. Every time there is a question about atrocities against black people: white people thrust out “its history, forget it, nothing to see here” vitriol! It DID happen! Don’t gaslight❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_vbvvctnd @afneil Right🧐🧐🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️- okay -so in a 100 years in future - we should put up statues to Hitler, Himmler etc because at one point in time - antisemitism &amp; racism was “the rule of the game” and also everything around us (autobahn/ motorways) wouldnt be around us without Nazis  Great logic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_vbvvctnd @afneil Is this supposed to be some sort of justification for .... invasion of sovereign lands, subjugation of their population, looting of their resources, enslavement of their people, killing of their people... such that UK could build some railway stations and palaces? 😂❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffWr13700482 @afneil Geoff I am not the one who came in with a swiping statement that has no basis or evidence!  At no point did I suggest anyone gets silenced! We all need to have healthy adult debates, false allegations don’t contribute to healthy debates!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffWr13700482 @afneil Geoff Wright asks: want to KEEP white voices SILENCED   Geoff please evidence where: i silence and subsequently “keep” silenced WHITE voices!  I look forward to it  https://t.co/SgXrs9cjfR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffWr13700482 @afneil You suggested I’ve silenced white people - where did I do that? Allegations without evidence  Ironically it is white supremacists who want to silence black peoples! Whenever black peoples give their perspective: a white man jumps up with “damned black people” 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfkwasadoughnut @Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga I’ll have to take a look! I really want to be more informed with stats and facts to be fair! There’s one thing arguing from point of principle, but there’s another being intellectually informed about the numbers, years, names etc! I’ll definitely give it a look! Thanks! Followed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil Also while you’re here telling minorities to conform to the rules and culture of the lands they find themselves in -care to go tell White Australians to conform to the native rules &amp; culture? Or perhaps go tell South African white peoples to conform to the culture they found❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil For record here’s your tweet calling on minorities to stop moaning and just conform to the rules and culture of your nation - Britain!   We’re talking about stopping racism and discrimination and your argument is: accept the racism and rules! Lovely! At least you own your racism  https://t.co/TQARY4ADnl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfkwasadoughnut @Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga Oh I wonder what identity crisis that could be....coming to an end of the empire? Was it all crumbling and white Brits needed reminders of how absolutely brilliant the past had been? How admirable slavery had been? How contributory to wealth building enslaving black ppl had been?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil Thanks for reminding black people  and minorities that when we move to or are born in UK we need to act white, forget the history that happened to our grandparents (apartheid ended in 1994) oh and we just have to accept the white racism because it’s: your culture &amp; rules! RACIST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffWr13700482 @afneil Geoff when did I throttle you and stop you from speaking? Look forward to seeing the evidence of me throttling you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottamylola Moreover, go troll someone else with your racism and bullshit   Facts are: Commonwealth is a continuum of the empire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottamylola Right - proving the universally known fact that trolls cannot research or read!  Cheerio idiot  https://t.co/0bHYcFhNOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottamylola Go read a book!  Find us the place in history where commonwealth springs out of thin air -with no prior empire having existed before.. Commonwealth being some random invention by Britain to work with countries it had no prior links to... looking forward to seeing the context🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Reminder to white people trying to act smart in debate about the commonwealth&amp; the empire: 1) there would be NO commonwealth had there been NO empire - the two are interlocked and cannot be considered as 2 separate entities! 2) Empire looted and killed! Riches begotten from crime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGladdy @mojidaniels @afneil The conversation sparked by #HarryandMeghan is about the commonwealths genesis- the empire. The empire was NOT voluntary, nor were the riches of the empire looted voluntarily! Its people did suicide as sacrifice -they were murdered, and their nations looted! #BlackHistoryMatter❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baker_Reports lol... interesting statement here Samuel 🤨🧐🧐  And on the whole how well does journalism where you are report “what someone else does not want printed” 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AttorneyCrump Black British here, showing solidarity to USA brothers and sisters!  Over the weeks and months I’ve noticed that there are a lot of historic police brutality that have gone uninvestigated- surely Part if the #BlackLivesMatter demands has to be a reinvestigation of numerous cases?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga I’m sure you recall the anger and rigour that #DavidStarkey used some days ago to attack BLACK people for questioning the “western” narrative of what impact colonialism, slavery and imperialism had on Africa and black people! Supremacists do not want blacks to tell THEIR trauma❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga A very clear divide has developed over last few weeks since #BlackLivesMatter gained traction: right wing white supremacy who DO NOT want the factual historical truth to be told, why? Because it whisks away the facade that the WEST has ALWAYS been righteous &amp; kind! The guilt😤😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga Whether we like or not, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has made us have these debates about British (Western) history; there has been UNDENIABLE deliberate airbrushing of facts. Why is it we have statues of the slave masters but not the slaves in chains? We must confront the lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga Glad we agree, u should invest ur energy in supporting people like @DavidOlusoga and other progressive historians who are asking the questions: BRITAIN WHY ARE U TEACHING AIRBRUSHED HISTORY? As for statues: they can be placed in museums or replaced with statues of victims🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga It shouldnt require tearing down of statues for “hidden historical context” to be made available! For years Bristol asked for context to be added or statue removed, council played dead&amp;dumb!  UK needs to revisit its airbrushed photoAlbums &amp; textbook: TEACH FULL TRUTH (good&amp;bad)❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shappy_C @DavidOlusoga @Shappy_C please stop acting ignorant, the reason few people knew about Colston is because historians have deliberately airbrushed him and the truth of slavery from history curriculum. The statue stood for 100s of years with a deliberately misleading plaque! UK needs to be HONEST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lee_alley Wrong! U argued that a mob is ALWAYS wrong! Ur caveats are absolutely meaningless!  Point is: why the hell are you endorsing statues of white supremacists who shackled HUMANS, shipped them to unknown islands for SLAVE labour, brutality and murder!   Are you a racist sympathiser?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 Can we all remind @DominicRaab that Saudi Arabia BUTCHERED a human being (innocent journalist) inside an EMBASSY in Istanbul in OUR lifetime !  Now UK arguing that it’s GOOD to work CLOSELY with human BUTCHERS!   Lord Jesus, please remove these tories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lee_alley @JillOHalloran1 @DavidOlusoga From his argument @lee_alley suggests that let’s say i.e.  “A mob” had risen up &amp; resisted Hitler and his murdering officers- the uprising mob that could have changed history and prevented a holocaust would have been wrong!

<|startoftext|>@Vigman It is a Verb Meaning: manipulate (someone) by psychological means into doubting their own sanity  Example: #DavidStarkey questions and insults Black people for questioning slavery and colonialism.

<|startoftext|>@Rozie221 @afneil Indeed lets hope future generations (all races and creeds) can have a better environment.

<|startoftext|>@butwhatifitsall The tories &amp; those who enabled them are 'whats wrong with us'  There was an alternative, Tories via media successfully managed to frame it as 'woke' 'marxist' 'bla bla' and the public fell for it.

<|startoftext|>@mojidaniels @afneil Commonwealth is quite literally the equivalence of a wife beater treating the abused wife to a new dress, meal out and promise “never to do it again” after years &amp; years of abuse - abuse perpetrated in all forms of methods: emotional, physical, financial, humiliation etc! ❌‼️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Haha- do these white defenders of looting&amp; plundering think that plastering over the atrocities, white supremacy, brutality and hurt done by Britain through slavery, colonialism and imperialism can be whitewashed by the word “commonwealth”? They think it will erase facts?🤷🏾‍♂️❌😂❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray Hahaha - why didn’t Britain stand on its OWN TWO FEET by not colonising overseas nations, stealing their wealth and PEOPLE; shipping them to Caribbean to work plantations to produce food and wealth for London?

<|startoftext|>@ShelaghFogarty @mrjamesob I would simply love to hear from those NHS staff who were in presence of #BorisHasFailedTheNation a few days ago cackling along with his empty gestures... only to wake 48hrs later to see this How often &amp;for how long are hens going to welcome and clap for a fox🦊dressed in a suit?  https://t.co/LlPCiiNcze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent @DominicRaab we will be expecting you to strain every sinew going after Saudi Arabia - remember they’re committing atrocities in Yemen with British Weapons! They murder a journalist in Istanbul, they behead people internally.   We look forward to seeing te sanctions🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️‼️‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllanTMoore Moreover, NOONE deprived #Davidstarkey or #darrengrimes of their FoSpeech! Rather people are calling out the RACISM &amp; bigotry that the pair indulged in. Black people are not DAMNED. And black people did NOT beseech White British to dock their ships and taking them as slaves❌‼️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 Meanwhile on #LBC NickFerrari - a privileged right wing whit man, is using the station to malign #PrinceHarry, constantly trying to dogwhistle and pile upon him!  Unlike many selfish/racist/ ignorant brits: Harry RECOGNISES his privilege, he goes beyond and ADVOCATES for others‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Another day that #LBC and it’s host try to whitewash black history. Conversation about colonialism and slavery trade viewed through prism of a privileged right wing white man. Commonwealth is the equivalence of buying sweets for a child you’ve spent time hurting to trick them🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @SuzanneEvans1 Like we’ve forgotten what unity you bring to the table!  Hello Mr I find racists to being “hero’s” and videos of racism to be “so good” that you rewatch them on repeat! You have the audacity to tweet about unity and divisions- you’re the latter: a racist divisionist ‼️‼️❌  https://t.co/vLVq1056qp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa It’s ironic when white British people say racism is not a thing in the UK; the white supremacist/ Arian race mentality is so profound and so deep, they really believe that their racism is “normal” and anyone questioning them is “virtue signalling, being woke/ snowflake” vile❌🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Someone who I thought was respectful saying to me “why do black men find black women attractive? They’re big, fat and ugly... I just don’t get it”  Then I reminded them “you call me your friend, I was born from a black woman, I have a black sister!”  We’ve not spoken subsequently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1957AJB @liebshen15 @BorisJohnson Yes but if it was “world beating” why did we end up with “world losing” only ahead of USA and Brazil who have been the “worlds losers and calamity”!  @BorisJohnson please explain how world beating simultaneously also means world losing!

As a black person, so far #KeirStarmer and his leadership has shown me that my concerns/suffering/experience of racism etc. is merely a 'moment'. &amp; #Labourleaks proved it further‼️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monaeltahawy Under guise that 'UK now loves its former colonies &amp;that we're all ONE FAMILY sharing the 'POT' -yet Britsh governmnt busy deporting #windrush commonwealth citizens without due process or legal representation to caribbean.

<|startoftext|>@beltmad @The_Real_Keyser @OmarSwanson15 @phykell @Eskoala @BBCNews Nothing to do with 'blacksplaining' the fact keyser sees it fit to ridicule with 'blacksplain' says it all! May I remind Keyser that last week #DavidStarkey was WHITESPLAINING to black people that: Slavery was GREAT, colonialism was GREAT and 'DAMN black' ppl need to shutup?❌🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beltmad @The_Real_Keyser @OmarSwanson15 @phykell @Eskoala @BBCNews Hadnt even seen Keyser's response, if he's trying to be clever -good luck to him. I made it very clear, this is NOT a question about the rightful fight against antisemetism, it is a question on WHY ABUSE TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE (RACISM) seems to be 'TOLERABLE' why the hierarchy?🚫🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughWoozencroft @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 @afuahirsch They genuinely go out of their way t find black ppl who are critical of BLM &amp; who are prepared to deny that racism towards black ppl is a problem in this country- a country that murdered StephenLawrence, a country where this week black athletes were unlawfully handcuffed, Absurd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughWoozencroft @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 @HughWoozencroft -Ive lost hope with LBC- not too long ago, their main host: NickF (who told @afuahirsch a mixed race lady to leave UK, if she doesnt like it here) invited a black lady by name of Inaya (equivalent to USA Candace Owens) to discuss BLM. They're just taking the piss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickyford haha apart from the other women you voted against... weird tweet here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @queenscomtrust Can #princeHarry just be the king and make this country an actual better place!  Currently Harry seems like the only person who genuinely believes in ALL LIVES MATTER (including making black and others BAME lives equal to default: white lives)!   Soz William, Charles etc!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nubiannigisti @metpoliceuk Which seems to negate their version of events which is that - 1) they drove on wrong side of the road - sped at an illegal speed and that there was marijuana - the police refused to conducted an on the spot drug test - probably because they were chatting shyte etc etc! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nubiannigisti Wait hold on... so did the police lie? @metpoliceuk #cressidadick - Police need to release their version of the video, becaue so far we have conflicting allegations of what happened. #blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @phykell @Eskoala @beltmad @BBCNews Im not at all questioning the protection holocaust has, I’m questioning why black issues and history are held at a much lower regard! We have white people Whitesplaining to us that: slavery was beneficial/ colonialism was “essential” these terms are used to blur the atrocities❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @phykell @Eskoala @beltmad @BBCNews I’m legit curious for racists/ racist sympathisers to explain to black people &amp; the world at large: why it is so easy for people to question black suffering, black trauma, black history, yet other forms of sufferings like holocaust/ antisemitism are defending from questioning🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @Nadine_Writes @Keir_Starmer This is conclusion Ive drawn too! for as long as I (a black person) continues to see my suffering/ my experiences/ my trauma pushed to the sidelines, but someone else’s equal experiences honoured and respected - I will NEVER have trust! So far the hierarchy correlates with colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @phykell @Eskoala @beltmad @BBCNews How does some1 make mistake repeatedly in same interview with enthusiasm?  Second, why do people feel compelled to tell black people how to interpret racism? How often do u teach Jewish people how to interpret antisemitism?  Black people aren’t DAMNED nor did they ask for slavery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phykell @beltmad @BBCNews Haha - he was being interviewed by an idiot who has right wing views and an apologist for racism. He churned our racist bigotry not once or twice but multiple times! Black people are NOT DAMNED and SLAVERY was not something we asked for in order to promote British imperialism!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews They werent “clumsy”comments- they were RACIST bigotry. Also he didnt do it once or twice by error; he repeatedly churned out white supremacist racist bile. He and his apprentice #DarrenGrimes were having a swell time ridiculing and insulting black peoples! Apology NOT accepted❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudebwoyben1 @Nadine_Writes @Keir_Starmer 💯spot on! Im a young black voter&amp; I will judge and vote based on what actions I see. Unsurprisingly KS is under scrutiny as he will be judged for the way he deals with issues in Labour: AS is long known ill, however #LabourLeaks revealed antiblack racism. KS isnt dealing with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSeddon1962 Sure - let me know when<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSeddon1962 Already have! 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 - thanks for the reminder ‼️‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSeddon1962 we all know what brits are baying like hyenas to do: hound them every time they speak. If they’d been that direct -we’d have death threats from whipped up Brits who seem to be obsessed with hounding Harry &amp; Meghan for being alive, meanwhile pedophile befriended Andrew: no comment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSeddon1962 I think you’re deliberately failing to understand what they are suggesting - Commonwealth also includes Britain - the country that colonised the “commonwealth” nations! If you read the article they touched on “truths” about “colonialism”! Britain was THE COLONISER🤷🏾‍♂️! It’s easy‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dera_Africana I’ll list a few: 1) Africans and their leaders are more interested in European (bazungu) things than african things - I.e. Africans pray for a trip to Paris than a trip to let’s say Accra! We don’t support ourselves  2) corrupt and poor politics  3) Crap education 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes @Nadine_Writes  - sorry but isn’t @Keir_Starmer a HUMAN RIGHTS legal specialist?  How can he be so biased that he needs to go on a training course? Whilst simultaneously being leader of a party aiming to go into government and HUMAN RIGHTS legal representative? #blackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon Haha😂Lord Jesus have mercy -the hypocrisy in this can be seen &amp;checked by a brainless donkey   ANYBODY who gets pleasure out of watching #DarrenGrimes nod and laugh with a white supremacist #DavidStarkey  is 100% a psychopath🤷🏾‍♂️  Yep we see y’all! Karen is OMG, but racism is 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ I asked Emily H the attached- still havent got a reply.  It’s interesting how the right wing cheerleaders of both genders always take a social media holiday when their teammates fuck up and let the mask slip to reveal live and kicking racism&amp;bigotry. But antenna alert for “Karen”  https://t.co/KLyun6kdJh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Same way #DarrenGrimes allowed a white supremacist racist called #davidstarkey to spew racism on #reasoned UNCHALLENGED. Nodding &amp; laughing along. Then 24hrs later proclaiming a racist to be his “HERO🤴” and on Parler boasted to be rewatching racism clips because it’s “so good”💪🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestmonsterUK @Fox_Claire If you want people not to be divided by race: stop fueling and emboldening current systems that yield discrimination &amp; disparity in treatment based on race! At end of the day: we still have minorities disadvantaged based on race and culture, so the current system is inadequate❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestmonsterUK @Fox_Claire So ... what are u trying to say? People who are victims of daily racism/discrimination/inequality “shut up, 30/40 years ago we treated you worse than we do today... stop asking for more”  Knock knock: reminder ANY level of racism is NOT ACCEPTABLE! End 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️  #BlackLivesMatter‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabrielquotes Wow - shakes head - what commentary - could you ask the individual: “do you want peace with Palestinian people?

<|startoftext|>@marbridmacc @SuzanneEvans1 @darrengrimes_ Well I think you’ll find- #DarrenGrimes the racist and his hero the white supremacist #DavidStarkey frequently appear on bbc / Skynews etc!   We all PAY a licence fee for the TV and the BBC - so yes you’ve paid to see racists pour their bigotry and vitriol! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theousherwood Anyone at @LBC going to ask #KeirStarmer about the racism towards black peoples from the #LabourLeaks -key questions 1. Has he personally spoken to the black MPs singled out for abuse? Diane, Dawn and Clive 2. What action is being taken against culprits of the racism! @BenKentish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Surely also send a copy of the archive to your local MP - they need to see what minorities who speak out go through!!  You should not keep this to self! The bigotry, abuse needs to be put out! We cannot have racists like #DarrenGrimes and his white supremacist hero unchallenged❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nclarke30 @HackneyAbbott I don’t even mind those who don’t want to take the knee- we all know what it means -they’re half hearted in their effort, they’re too afraid of discussing it with their friends/family/sponsors - not sure how hard it is to say “I stand in solidarity with black people, don’t u”🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC whoever this lady is articulating how the police stopped them- is NOT doing it very well at all. She’s telling the story in a very incriminating and confusing way! Why focus on traffic lights you didn’t cross? Kept mentioning “rush” to change the baby ? #BlackLivesMatter🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 Really disheartening seeing these “friends” who clearly KNEW all along now coming out of the woodworks to provide alibis to their friends rather than fighting to provide justice to the Children Victims of sexual abuse!

<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 @darrengrimes_ 😂 haha hilarious- “appalling views going unchallenged” -how many views did racist #DarrenGrimes challenge?

<|startoftext|>@EdsTheory @EdsTheory - curious: did you report the trespassing that occurred on your property and the attitude of the gammon in burgundy who said “your the problem in this country... you must have been arrested before” - that was a whole mess- saw it for first time last night- unbelievable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mollygiles2015 WHAT🧐🧐🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkbjournalist It is astonishing that people are writing articles of empathy with #GislaineMaxwell... her friends are coming out with “she was also a victim” which suggests they actually may have known all along... regards: people are SUPPORTING an enabler of a rapist, rather than the VICTIMS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward What strikes me is - I’m sure the police may have been justified to pursue the car  for whatever reason!  However once the car had come to a stop, and the occupants were starting to cooperate, and the baby was noticed etc. Why was the police NOT ABLE to adjust their handling?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntacsB @Valerie3Ward Lol 😂  Knights save people and are honourable - please ask #dianeabbott what knight Keir was when #LabourLeaks happened ...   Let us know what she says. Thanks in advance   Ps #BlackLivesMatter is NOT a “moment”  ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @LBC @AndrewCastle63 I know what you mean! Also this is not about HER being the rapist and abuser, its about her providing information that can lead to justice for the children who were victims! She needs to recognise this distinct difference! It’s about contributing to JUSTICE! Doesn’t she care?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @LBC @AndrewCastle63 Exactly! These silly “she was also manipulated” excuses do not wash! So she was living it up in luxury- flying between UK and USA... visiting Prince Andrew, living the absolute life... all in the knowledge that children are being raped/ abused - we supposed to feel sorry for her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afuahirsch What do these racists/ idiots assume “Africa” to be? Some pan safari wilderness?

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @theJeremyVine I don’t even have an issue with the royals - I just have issue with these divisive commentators who really are just out to hunt, hound, attack and destroy #MeghanMarkle and #PrinceHarry ! Every chance they get: they attack! It’s never ending! It’s nasty! It’s infantile, its crass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine Do you want to go and attack the British Royal family who live in CASTLES and PALACES paid for by working taxpayers?? Castles are as “monstrous” in appearance! And many royal family members champion charities etc. So next time you hound attack #MeghanHarry, also attack Will et al<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LincolnTapper Thanks for tweeting and therefore expose me to this #itseverywhere clip! Really interesting to hear statements that apply!

<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo The statues need to be edited with true history or removed &amp; put in museums again with historical accuracy.

<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo I think as people argued in response - Both can be done and need to be done! Reparations without educating white peoples to stop being racists achieves nothing. Majority of statues related to imperialism/ colonialism/ slavery are historically inaccurate! they embolden racists🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @OmarSwanson15 Hmm to be fair I don’t watch or attend much to do with football! So I’ll take your every word. I retract my overt criticism and labelling them as “one season gimmicks” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👌🏾👌🏾😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo @ramaisibo I disagree on this. There are statues that are just ridiculous AND inaccurate about history! Take the statue of Leopold in Belgium- the man was racist&amp;executioner of black peoples! The statue has a plaque saying “Congolese are thankful to Leopold for saving them”🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @OmarSwanson15 Youre right. It would be much better though if all these gimmicks could be more than a season thing? We need deep reaching projects that produce tangible results. With that said, football has really tried! I think we now to ensure politicians don’t let us down (they the problem)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 Fact that the British population&amp; western populations at large have to read and be educated on issues of racism &amp; discrimination from white peoples (right wing white people) just shows u the problem we have with regards to changing the environment! This is part of the problem🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @AndrewCastle63 @laurasgoldman So now ... people want to give extenuating circumstances to try and shield #GishlaineMaxwell from accountability?

<|startoftext|>@MissHop10166977 @MannyAwo Thank you! And I agree it is endearing most (perhaps all) of the time that children feel comfortable to call a teacher by whatever way they and teacher is happy with. To be fair i was more affronted with fact initial tweet from Emmanuel said “colleagues” also revert to Mr A🤷🏾‍♂️😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannyAwo @paultinay @MannyAwo we’ve all done it. To be fair to those who shorten our names- its never done from a bad place. They’re polite and kind to us etc. But the long&amp;short of it is: they do NOT learn our names! I’m sorry but our fathers/parents names us our names for a REASON! Culture/history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MannyAwo I think you’re right - there are situations where it’s actually the teacher who says “call me Ayo ... rather than let’s say the longer version of what every the name is” ... but the sad thing is - it’s that the children or colleagues never bother with actually learning the FULL🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MannyAwo Fair fair! To be I also had a teacher by name of Taylor (legendary history teacher) - we used to call him Mr T - he was great!  But too often BAME names are shortened to Mr X and Ms Y because it’s “easier”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannyAwo for too long we’ve allowed these things to happen because we didn’t have the voice/ platform to demand the respect we deserve; but things have to change!   Everyone should show respect to each other. Let noone undermine your name! 🤷🏾‍♂️💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannyAwo Remind them it’s AWOYELU  How often do we say Mr S for Smith? Or Ms R for Richardson, or P for Potter or G for Grieves or T for Thompson etc?

<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @DiorFrannn @nellarose_ Haha- to be fair it’s a very acquired taste type of music... if I hadn’t grown up around it - not sure how I’d react to it... it’s a style you can’t quite just dance drunk ... you need to know what you’re doing and ideally have a dance partner who’s into you lol🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😎!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiorFrannn @nellarose_ I second this! Rwandan British here and ZOUK is literally literally literally UNKNOWN to British people (white, asian, black, and everyone in between) ... Once I played zouk at a party, and people were baffled and thought it was time for a tea break😢😢! Haha! Take me to 🇫🇷 🇧🇪 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry I think what we need to try do is have more dialogue - with no prejudice, no judgement and learn from each other... we are all on the same side, but sometimes blinded by one or two smokescreening features<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Brilliant! And I think I’ve learnt from this debate. Articulation from BLM is important- it risks pushing away rather than building bridges and allies 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Iyi rewriting of history niyo mpamvu abazungu babasha kutumanipulatinga in my opinion. Ubu se koko abanyarwanda barenze 1July badafashe time to reflect on what ababiligi bakoreye ancestors babo cyane cyane abaneighbours in Congo... Njye mbona rwose ari ikibazo! Is it just me?🤷🏾‍♂️🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Ahubwo interesting observation: when did Rwanda actually get independence from colonialism? Ko nabonye on that day: Rwanda government/ Bots/ RwoT was🤐 🤫. It seems that every republic that comes every 20-30years creates its own rules? We can’t keep destroying history like this🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry 5/ You don’t know my history: but there was a time where my family had NOTHING in this country! Foodbanks didn’t even exist in those days: I do not recall my parents and family losing their humanity because they’d only had tea with no milk or sugar for breakfast! 🤷🏾‍♂️that’s Selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry The “fray on edges” does not mean society loses sight of the principle cause!  And I’m sorry about: there are BAME who are also at foodbanks who also face the added daily racial abuses! We all need to keep eyes on the bigger pic. Turn blind eyes bcoz your stomach is hungry is sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry 3/ seeing people argue that “one slogan” turns them away from fighting to end racism and discussion based on race is frustrating and shows that those people DO NOT get it! Throughout history every movement has its fray et edges: suffragettes/ LGBT/ civil rights USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry 2/ 1st of all Saying Black Lives Matter (which they do) and BLM organisation is not the same thing. I’m not a member of the organisation nor a representative, however I am black, my family and ancestors have lived through racism and it’s impacts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry I was having similar discussion with someone recently, we ended in better place. At end of day: we are looking at same picture from different angles. Your perspective has its influences so does your opposite(mine). We need to be able to understand each other’s perspectives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlufftyP @edwardpoole1975 @MetroUK Absolutely, when Keir won, I didnt really kno (or care) about the internal factions of Labour. I expected any leader to continue standing up for what is RIGHT &amp; call out what is WRONG. His CONTRASTING responses to RLB and LabourLeaks says ALOT! Theres a hierarchy: black at bottom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Well, with that said: IM Pleased youre not a racist &amp; I do take your word for it. Throughout this exchange Ive not thought YOU to be racist, you’re trying to speak on behalf of society at large. The issue is, you’re trying to provide them an alibi unnecessarily(I think)🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Cider at 09:00?? Which pub is operating and serving ciders at this hour of the day? 😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Do u suggest that using a foodbank eviscerates ones ability to recognise wrong &amp; right? Because this is actually what you’re eluding to! Germans were okay to ignore antisemitism and actions of Nazis because “hey they were hungry post WW1, they had to think about their stomachs”🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Because I’ve highlighted to you how others may perceive your simile of “swinging from trees” you now want to shut down the Conversation?🤷🏾‍♂️ I’ve expressed my sympathies to your circumstances and wished you’d articulated your point better or DMd to preserve yourself personal info!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar @RoyalFamily @10DowningStreet @BBCNews   What on Earth is this?  #PrinceAndrew you bring shame to the United Kingdom and the British Monarchy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Swinging from a tree is not a simile I’m fimiliar with in context of suicide. And frankly in light of the fact we’re talking about BLM and monkeys is a derogatory term used against black people, I suggest u also appreciate how swinging from trees can be misconstrued🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry The point stands, up until u revealed personal information- we were talking in GENERAL terms. And I said: if people can SEE others’ suffering and WALK AWAY without helping, there’s a problem. If I saw u in vulnerable situ&amp; walked passed: what am I? Answer: UNBOTHERED! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry 1/ Daniel, I’m sorry to hear about that background, the way you articulated “swing from trees” did not elude to mental health. And I’m pleased you’re clearly in a better place. Wish you’d rather have maybe DMd if you wanted to keep your personal life private.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry quite speechless to be honest after seeing u suggest that u,d rather be swinging in a tree than fight racism &amp;contribute towards a more equal society  I will judge the priorities because if someone is DYING/SUFFERING due to impact of racism, &amp;people choosing to swing from trees😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Right ... “swinging from a tree” - a priority that sits above you see and recognising that black peoples (and others less privileged than you) suffer from RACISM, race based violence, inequality in jobs and life outcomes, daily abuse, psychological trauma etc. Swing from a tree🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @MetroUK Thanks for solidarity for black people! It’s been a tough past few months since Keir took over leadership. From the day #LabourLeaks happened, as a black person I’ve been observing at how Labour as a whole is handling racism&amp;discrimination towards black peoples-I’ve been appalled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry If u fall under that category (I’m not suggesting u do) u really need to ask yourself what principles you stand for. Ive had ill health too, I’ve been hospitalised in my lifetime etc, during that time of illness -did I miraculously turn a blind eye to antisemitism etc? NO❌‼️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry No @danieltomsdad, I am calling those who are racists/ appeasers of racism- racist! because they’re racist! If someone sees racism happening, discrimination happening, abuse happening and they casually sip their tea and carry on watching Netflix- what else call they be called? 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coops_tv Apparently protecting themselves against contracting a deadly virus is against their human rights if not wearing a mask 😷.... Americans are truly thick. To be fair they’re also led by man who’s dumber than dumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wohyeahwohyeah @scook2003 Thanks for sharing these receipts - you’ve owned yourself a follower! People who tel truth and aren’t racists deserve a follow!  Meanwhile @BBCNews here’s the receipts you need to forward #DarrenGrimes lawyers  #blackLivesMatter whether Darren or #DavidStarkey like it or not!🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flossopher @JuliaHB1 @bbcquestiontime who knows.. but we need more than “simply not inviting him” - when people commit antisemitism they’re publically shunned by EVERYONE and those who employ them, and they resign/get fired! Darren danced &amp;nodded to the tune of RACISM, genocide denial etc. He’s racist &amp;still gloating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts I’m so baffled by the way this #ElijahMcClain has been handled by the #AuroraPoliceDepartment, law enforcement, local leaders and the media! 1st all: they’ve simply resigned? No arrest? No charge? No investigation? 2nd: Elijah DIED UNLAWFULLY, killers must be HELD ACCOUNTABLE🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa You’re doing just fine mate, I wouldn’t worry about the people who have run away. The point is - if being polite, engaging, solidarity, empathetic, standing up for the right thing etc. Loses you “followers” - perhaps the followers were not very nice anyway?! Stay you! 🙌🏾🤷🏾‍♂️👌🏾✅✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott In conclusion:  #DarrenGrimes knew exactly what had happened in the interview! After listening to ALL the RACISM spewed by #DavidStarkey - Darren thought he’d met a HERO!  Darren is a racist sympathiser, he provides platforms for racist white supremacists! He finds racism heroic  https://t.co/k8epWGQyfx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshwoolcott @joshwoolcott the key is what #DarrenGrimes actually did after the interview. Having finished the interview, edited the interview &amp; published it; Darren claimed to 1) have met his hero in #DavidStarkey 2) on Parler 48hrs after interview he said he was rewatching as it was so good  https://t.co/9Jot5XOj1v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Hahaha same solution as trump - trump regarding covid ati: if we do less testing we will have less covid cases - scientists and hospital stop testing!! Haha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Well since you asked what we think of you, here it is: 1) you’re a racism appeaser 2) you provide platforms for racist white supremacists 3) you provide platform for history revisionists  4) you find racists to be “heroes” 5) you love racism so much you rewatch videos of racism🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyTheManc @danieltomsdad @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Absolutely this is the point I’m making!  If one hiccup means you jump up saying “this is why I will now sit on side of the racists/ and fence sitters” you really have commitment issues! You’re supposed to engage, probe, challenge and help the movement articulate better! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️‼️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges The answer is actually simple: a leader should NOT require articulation and speaking lessons before going for every interview.  Ability to answer intellectually and with gravitas should be a SKILL that a leader HAS inherently!  If as you say he has NO CLUE, it means he not GIFTED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JujuLaBelle @rutembessa Is SHE a sex worker ... or are adult men manipulating, abusing her and breaching every human rights law ? They’ve deprived her of a childhood, they’ve deprived her dignity - all of which is criminal! The @Rwandapolice needs to engage with her to identify as many as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racheluwase1 @Rwandapolice @RwandaHealth @RwandaParliamnt @CityofKigali Banyarwanda #RwOT -these issues are a recurring theme in our country, today ngo umwana was raped, ejo ngo umugore yatemwe by husband, ejo ngo dasso yasekuye umuzunguzayi, ejo ngo abasirikare raped abagore. How long can abanyarwanda keep reading same headline? We should be ashamed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racheluwase1 whilst there is debate to be had about identity revelation (which reporter comments on and his justification is mentioned) the main beef we need to be driving here is: @Rwandapolice #RIB @RwandaHealth @RwandaParliamnt @CityofKigali : what are authorities doing to protect her?😱‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry As I said: if seeing racism, inequality, discrimination doesn’t make u say “what can I do to engage and help change our country” ... then boy... crack on with your keep calm, ignore black injustice, drink some tea and repeat!  lol, a slogan... makes you close your eyes? Okay🤷🏾‍♂️🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonRubs Couldn’t have summarised it better myself ...  Everything is Tickeyboo   Who cares about those black peoples, their history, their trauma, their scars?   They’re not white, so keep calm, ignore, drink some tea, tweet pile ons against #Meghan, support Andrew (hes white)! Etc. 🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry What i are confirming is that people would rather just shrug their shoulders, when confronted with the realities of racism, white supremacy rather than engage, learn, probe, challenge and ask questions for clarification. What makes them all akin to #DarrenGrimes nodding at racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry And that is sad- if the “majority” in light of overt discrimination, racism, inequality can continue to just sit there and say “I don’t want to engage”- this just highlights the problem that BLM is trying to highlight. Why are majority silent/apathetic in full view of tragedy🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal What is needed is for EVERY organisation that #DavidStarkey works for to comment and distance themselves from this white supremacist.  I remember when I was younger when I used to watch documentaries on British history, this man was on TV screens everywhere- They need to denounce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @mrjamesob - is this for real!? Wtf #BlackLivesMattterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Everyone understands that the slogan has nothing to do with indefinitely abolishing the police force.  If you’d actually engage with the debate and dialogue you learn that it’s about directing some funds to community projects. That’s my understanding anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyandHattie @darrengrimes_ Its bullshit bcoz it doesnt correlate with his actions during &amp; after the interview! Darren, after hearing David’s views on black people and pro-racism/ white supremacy, tweeted: 1) David is my hero! And 48hrs after the interview on Parler he said he’s rewatching coz it’s so good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyandHattie @darrengrimes_ At end of interview; before or immediately after publishing the interview he said “I met my hero” -therefore in the FULL knowledge of the RACISM spewed out by #Davidstarkey - Darren praised David as a HERO! 24hrs after publishing video: on Parler he boasted about rewatching!🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/RHJBouLDUo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Same energy directed towards #DavidStarkey needs to be directed to #DarrenGrimes -why?  Bcoz: 1) after the interview Darren hailed David as his HERO in full knowledge of the racism. 2)2days after interview on Parler app, Darren said “it’s so good I’m rewatching” Darren is racist  https://t.co/XU2yS17JFu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unadine10 @rutembessa Njye ndi confused. With all the so called &gt;50% of women in parliament, nigute murwanda duhora twumva Amakuru nkaya about the suffering of female children? Mwabagore (&amp;men) mwe muri Parliament muri za V8 zanyu... mumariye iki abanyarwanda? Serious question? This is frustrating!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham Surely it goes without saying that #RobertJenrick abused his position of power? 1) used his Tory won, to influence council decisions in favour of renovations to his personal house despite council previously having rejected plans  2) used position as MINISTER to solicit for friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieltomsdad @SallyTheManc @DstructableCake @Femi_Sorry Yes but you’ve clearly just identified what the slogans means - so you weaken your own argument. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @Femi_Sorry @viewsfromleft they know that it’s irrelevant, however part of their profound desire to discredit the entire movement and bury it (as the movement requires this country to do fundamental change) means that they’ll exploit any avenue to destroy the movement! They dont care for BL  https://t.co/cGOgJTlg5g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @viewsfromleft @GMB Here are some receipts of the types of people who retweet Iain Dale when it comes to discussion around #BlackLivesMatter   These rightwing people use their platforms to malign misrepresent the BLM movement altogether. I cannot therefore see how Iain claims to be supportive of BLM  https://t.co/eh5Gpsj1qw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @GMB Absolutely, over the last few weeks, right wing media/commentators have done their best to blur together BLM movement with BLM organisation. Any misstep by the BLM organisation is very quickly whipped and blurred with BLM movement to create animosity towards BLM. We see thru it❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @viewsfromleft @GMB So why on earth do you fund an organisation that also claims “damned blacks” surviving means atrocities against black peoples didn’t happen? You literally empowering people who precisely have disdain for black people. Who belittle black historical experiences- that’s NOT support  https://t.co/OJsvTU3VB0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvaSantina I’m liking @AvaSantina tonight... she’s bringing the truth, nothing but the truth!  And she has solidarity for black peoples and their history.  Thank you Ava 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvaSantina Someone in #LBC funds them ... astonishing stuff  https://t.co/f9VrJuUIsT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvaSantina @AvaSantina I noted you’ve attached a screenshot of his apology today on 2/7/20. Can I bring to your attention on 1/7/20 on Parler he boasted that interview was SO GOOD he’s rewatching it! And on 30/06 he tweeted “met my hero” after the interview! So Darren is basically NOT sorry  https://t.co/RWSJi67UL9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DAaronovitch @adamboultonSKY Just note that this was yesterday! And on 30th June he also tweeted on twitter that he had met a “hero” in the form of #DavidStarkey ... then look at his fake apology where he claims “during interview he wasn’t robustly engaged” and hence missed chance to challenge David! Lies  https://t.co/ezQmJOSQqg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Count on my support! Signing with enthusiasm 👌🏾👌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @DAaronovitch @adamboultonSKY @PatrickWDixon up until YESTERDAY- #DarrenGrimes was boasting on Parler (the murky waters where eels play gleefully) that he enjoyed the interview so much he was “watching it again” -he enjoyed listening to SO MUCH RACISM, he had to rewatch to replenish his brain with more racism  https://t.co/6diBF1qybo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama I’m curious to know what kind of comments She’s prepared to ignore in their private platforms/ socials in order to .... hmmm appease her white friends?  Ive today checked the statements from many right wing people who retweet and follow Dom: They’re ALL ridiculing black history😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcowenjones Can they all just go to Parler and stay there! They can go swim like eels in murky waters on Parler where their racism, hate, xenophobia is ... apparently tolerated in the name of “free speech”!  https://t.co/amLax3hwXH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @toadmeister Wooow ... so racism is now “eccentricity”   Thanks for the clarification of what this is about: trivialisation of black people atrocities - essentially siding with racists   😱 #BlackLivesMattter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon For real! Remember them days after parents evening when you knew your parents were going to CHECK you inside out, with no foolishness stone left unturned🤪🥵!   It’s what you do to help those you love! You check them real good and make sure same mistake is NEVER ever made again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon Darren gave a platform to a BLATANT RACIST, a racist who quite literally today INSULTED ALL BLACK PEOPLE, in the most contemptful way possible. Dominique you are doing Darren no favour if you are NOT prepared to 100% correct him. AND you're pretty much pissing over black ppl🚫❌.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon The sad thing here is, sometimes we have (dear) friends, who often say the wrong things, do wrong things etc. as a FRIEND you do them NO service by HIDING their faults. You help by removing their blinkers and saying: 'Are you insane? what you did there was NOT okay! CHANGE!"🤷‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @toadmeister Well the racist some of you seem so desperate to defend suggest that just because black people are still alive, there was no genocidal atrocities - and he then adds DAMNED black people. AND in same interview suggests Black brits should be grateful to slavemasters/colonisers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon Absolutely, at one point @dominiquetaegon suggests 'we all sometimes fail to do due diligence' if that were true: #DarrenGrimes would have 1) NEVER published the video after reviewing+editing 2) Would never have called the RACIST a HERO! &amp; would not have boasted on PARLER. Jesus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon @mike_adama I am glad we agree on 1 thing: #DavidStarkey was 'blatantly racist'  Normal humans when they hear 'blatant racism or antisemetism' they tend CALL IT OUT! They distance themselves from it.  They do not 1) Next day go on twitter to boast, and 2) 2days later go on Parler to boast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @dominiquetaegon All I am going to leave here for Dominique is these receipts: 1) Darren relished the interview so much he boasted about it afterward on twitter and parler - literally mocking black people and racism by saying how much he loved #DavidStarkey  2) Holocaust memorial rebuke End🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/rWx8r5qymG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @toadmeister Well - you seem to critique me, find attached comment from the Holocaust memorial.   rest my case  https://t.co/8ybKaFfPaM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon @darrengrimes_ @mike_adama PS even the Holocaust Memorial twitter page has rebuked the interview..  But no... glorious Dominique wants to come here whitewashing the crisis with excuses and extenuating circumstances!  Jesus Lord, bestow upon us the wisdom to see and comprehend the most obvious observation🙏🏽  https://t.co/MmM5i7byBl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon @donaldinio @darrengrimes_ @dominiquetaegon -Darren had plenty of time to do due diligence after the interview, he did by concluding that: 1) 30/06 he met hero in form of #DavidStarkey and 2) on Parler yesterday he told his followers “its so good I’m watching it back again”  Seriously what is wrong with u?  https://t.co/nRdtV0LEkC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon @darrengrimes_ @mike_adama you spoke too soon... as if by magic - here’s Dominique excuses Darren for giving a racist a platform! Not only did Darren give a platform, Darren subsequently proclaimed to the world that he’d: 1) met his hero after the interview and 2) it was SO good he rewatched it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smcbride360 @toadmeister Racism is RACISM! There are no light/neutral sides to racism! “These damned black people wouldn’t be here if there had been a genocide” - well ... can #DavidStarkey go say to Jewish people “if there had been a holocaust there would be no damn Jew left, so it’s all bullshit”❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 And whilst you're here, please do NOT buy #darrengrimes fake apology. Up until yesterday, he was on Parler telling his followers who much he loved his interview with #davidstarkey. Also on 30th June he called David his 'HERO' following their interview filled with: pure racism  https://t.co/HUTBRGUizG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ And this is exactly why when when they say Asian BAMEs are there to represent BLACK people.... all black people look at each other and say "what the bombaclaat"   Katharine just described RACISM towards black people as 'rude or ungenerous' - sorry WHAT? #BlackLivesMattter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama And Tory MPs in general. Today, the ones who have bothered to stick their necks out to defend racism are: Julia HB and Tom young - those are the ones I’ve seen! Keeping an eye open for Emily H - she’s normally one of the cheerleaders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama In conclusion: he invited a racist for an interview. The racist was fully racist as well as a white supremacist, claiming that the slavery and colonialism didn’t finish the black race up! 😡... Darren loved every word said, he tweeted about love for his hero #DavidStarkey❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/W8m4mwHCNR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @mike_adama - he didn’t just nod along...  Yesterday he was on Parler (the new app for right wingers) saying that he loved it so much that he “watched it again”. So on one hand in his apology he claims he wasn’t engaged, but then claims he was so engaged he rewatched it?  https://t.co/xWBBrohv4F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@florabotanics @GerryGaughan @RussInCheshire More receipts! Thank you!  Managers in the name of Julia HB and other brexit party members will have to explain to us why they’re not accepting legitimate original receipts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shomaristone @NBCNews When someone murders somebody.... they just 'resign' and its all good?  Hello America, do y'all actually have laws? Because this stuff f'd up!  #ElijahMcClain murderers need to be arrested and charged with murder. Period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulbhampton @RussInCheshire More receipts: on 30th June - after the interview... Darren went online to proclaim his undying love and admiration for his hero: #davidstarkey the racist white supremacist.  Taken with his comment on Parler, Darren resonated full heartedly with David: they’re both RACISTS. End❌  https://t.co/fzk3AHOdNb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 @darrengrimes_ Let us be in absolute NO DOUBT about the facts: #DarrenGrimes conducted an interview in which a white man hurled racist statements. At no point did Darren probe/challenge. Then Darren went on twitter &amp;Parler to proclaim his love for the “Hero”! Darren is a RACIST! Period‼️❌🤛🏾❌  https://t.co/4hrUNgnToB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Here’s the receipt for 30th June following the interview. After indulging in racism, nodding at racist statements, giving platform to a white supremacist Racist  #DarrenGrimes posted that the white supremacist racist #DavidStarkey was his “HERO”. Now Julia trying to gaslight us❌  https://t.co/bSbirJNbMg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Julia, who and what do you think we are? 1) #DarrenGrimes posted a tweet on 30th June following the interview saying #DavidStarkey was his HERO! Yes you heard right -following after hearing the RACISM 2) Darren, on Parler tells his followers that he loved it so much, he REWATCHED  https://t.co/s9tVC0M0HR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire @RussInCheshire - It is not that #DarrenGrimes is too thick - lets be in NO DOUBT whatsoever, what is at play here: Darren agrees with the comments from #DavidStarkey. Also can we all note (attached), despite his statement of 'I wasnt fully engaged, notice his comments on Parler!  https://t.co/E58GytkIqr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney It's not 'dodgy' - it's RACIST.  Get terminology recorrect   #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @JuliaHB1 my good lord Just STOP!   Why do you feel compelled to come out defending this stuff? #DarrenGrimes tweeted after doing his interview with #DavidStarkey that David was his “HERO” - he proclaimed a racist white supremacist to be his hero!  So please just stop the BS!  https://t.co/7NqDZwt3kx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realJavedBashir He doesn’t even mean the apology... behold what he wrote on twitter immediately after doing the interview ... he saw #davidstarkey as a “Hero” - all his BS about “I wasn’t fully engaged” is a load of🚽! He was robustly engaged with the racism and white supremacy! He’s a racist‼️  https://t.co/JVJl2NdH6m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coops_tv I just want @BBCNews @SkyNews etc. to explain what wisdom &amp; virtue they saw in someone like #DarrenGrimes  What clearance did he pass? What due diligence was done to ensure racists &amp;white supremacists were not unknowingly given platforms (if they encourage racist we need to kno)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coops_tv The apology is untrue and riddled with lies - here is a tweet from him, praising his hero #davidstarkey immediately after the interview. In other words: #DarrenGrimes felt that everything stated by David was Heroic! Including the racist material. Therefore Darren is a racist. End  https://t.co/Hgdowrlvpf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seunspeakss Jesus of Nazareth ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  What on Earth is this stuff?   So this is the hero that #darrengrimes met and had an interview with!?  https://t.co/hcIdniai3R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WritesBright @peterjukes @WritesBright - nevermind the fake apology from #darrengrimes  Subsequent to the interview, Darren personally tweeted that he’d met his HERO🦸🏻‍♂️! So he was actually ROBUSTLY engaged with everything #Davidstarkey said, he was therefore engaged with the racism/white supremacy! ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌  https://t.co/JpOloDYxdq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmselk @Femi_Sorry @viewsfromleft @BBCNews @itvnews @Channel4News @channel5_tv @SkyNews Well we all know it’s the latter, and definitely NOT the former!   Darren subsequently tweeted that during the interview with #DavidStarkey he felt like he’d met his “HERO” - so he was ROBUSTLY engaged with David and the racism! He felt the racism was heroic 🦸🏻‍♂️  #blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjukes @peterjukes THANK YOU for calling this out!   EVERYONE in our society knows very very well that this would never (and should never be said) about any other minority historic experience: holocaust etc, yet for some reason: its “okay/permissible” if said against black people? WHY❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DAaronovitch @adamboultonSKY Not only is it pathetic - he also LIES in his statement...  Like hell does he regret not challenging... like hell does he regret not being fully engaged! Like hell would he have challenged his “HERO”!   Darren did the interview and Felt that he’d MET his HERO: a RACIST! Go figure  https://t.co/aULgOZEvWZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @viewsfromleft @BBCNews @itvnews @Channel4News @channel5_tv @SkyNews How very interesting.... so #Darrengrimes puts out a statement saying “he was not fully engaged” during interview and would have called #Davidstarkey ... yet he robustly tweeted that David was his hero?   His statement of apology is therefore: FAKENEWS!  Racists will be racists❌  https://t.co/wy2IINAZXs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @ReasonedUK @darrengrimes_ afraid this is absolute🐴manure! You did NOT robustly challenge #DavidStarkey because you were Robustly NODDING along to his racist tune! Moreover ur promotion video robustly suggests that statues of slavemasters are “force for Good”-David was resonating with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @IainDale @JCHannah77 I can categorically point out that #DarrenGrimes was in last 48hrs promoting #Reasoned through a video which I saw &amp;commented on! The video contained an insulting segment which set the scene for what was to come.Moreover why would anyone spend £100 on something they haven’t seen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAACable Ready to sign - let us know when ready<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @steselby21 @IainDale Right.... So goes out supporting people who finance racists - when called up on it...”sorry can’t help you any further”  Perhaps learn to not side with racists and their financiers ? It’s not complex algebra or astrophysics!  It’s called ethics and morality!  Racism is WRONG ❌‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @neverheardofher @IainDale Truth and facts doesn’t have time for your ridiculousness!  You literally came out supporting someone who financially endorses a known bigot and racist!   Why would you even want to do that, unless you sympathise with the entire situation: Racism 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steselby21 @armbreakingswan @IainDale And despite the fact that #DarrenGrimes racist tendencies were virtually KNOWN to all (especially ANY TORY member - whom Iain is) ... yet we now have Iain saying “I had no clue about the racism tendencies”   Pure gaslighting!  Why would anyone finance someone who has these views?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Denise__Headley what ur take on this is? Theres an interview circulating of #DarrenGrimes (Tory member) interviewing a white historian #DavidStarkey -historian suggest “damned black people are still alive so slavery wasnt genocidal (coz we’re NOT all dead) Iain sponsors Darren🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paulosdub @IainDale Not just that - yesterday I saw a video of #DarrenGrimes promoting #reasoned! In that video Darren says (whilst endearingly staring at statues): “the left want to tear down everything that makes UK a force for GOOD” - in light of ColstonBristol - murdering+enslaving is NOT good❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @neverheardofher @IainDale Nope it’s Thursday 2nd of July 2020, a day on which you came out thrusting your support for a racist financier...  Facts do have a tendency of speaking for themselves- on a full moon as well as any other day of the year!   #BlackLivesMatter ‼️‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @steselby21 @IainDale it’s very straightforward: Darren is a racist, his adoration today of #DavidStarkey is one among many evidences of his white supremacy tendencies. Iain Dale financially sponsors a racist. Making Iain a sympathiser +financier of racism. You endorse a financier of racism- Go figure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise_katz @IainDale Thank u for bringing receipts of how ppl holding jobs broadcasting to millions of Brits, also simultaneously fund organisations run by people with racist/white supremacy views!#DarrenGrimes in his promotional video of #Reasoned suggests statues of slave masters are force for Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @steselby21 @IainDale Classic belittling of the situation by supporters of Iain and Darren here.  Trivialising racism and discrimination towards black people!  If you endorse and support racists, you’re a racist yourself! We see through it  #blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armbreakingswan @neverheardofher @IainDale Do we allow antisemitism? NO  Why do you think it’s on the other hand okay to allow white supremacy, racism towards black people? And falsification of facts when it comes to dialogue around atrocities committed towards and on black people? #BlackLivesMatter  Hierarchy of racism❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Haha -what ridiculousness -Iain acting and talking like he DIDNT already know the views of #DarrenGrimes and why Darren set up his Reasoned channel!There was a video promoting reasoned where Darren clearly sets out that Statues of slave masters show UK as “force of Good”❌He knew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 to think #PrinceHarryAndMeghan was maligned by rightwing in the last 48hrs for stating the ABSOLUTE bloody obvious that there is institutional racism in this country as exemplified by a British Historian and a Tory member #DarrenGrimes!  Being ALIVE doesn’t wash away the crimes❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid @sajidjavid I think you need to extend your rightly placed rebuke to @darrengrimes_ who was there lapping up the racism &amp; bigotry “NODDING” away as if listening to papa telling a wonderful pastime story! The interview conducted by Darren and Mr Starkey was RACIST! Fullstop❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamesrmcd Did we all notice how they panned to Darren who was literally NODDING as this Victorian historian damned black people?

<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat It’s actually sad because ...I was ready to fall into line ... he won the leadership fairly... and anyone pro labour obviously wants tories our ASAP!   Keir has repulsed me so much, I’ve been driven back to the fence! I would at this stage consider ALL options if an election came<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat Well he said “BLM is a moment” already that’s WRONG!  Also his deliberate inaction against the proven racism towards black peoples in Labour Party as shown by the #LabourLeaks shows me, a black person, that he’s NOT bothered about my experiences, my suffering or wellbeing. So..🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat Bottom line is - farage is praising starmer on a issue relating to racism... baring in mind farage is a proud xenophobe and racist...   That’s a very odd agreement lounge to find oneself in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat I’m not going to sit here and rerun the debates on brexit - I too thought that sovereignty was an important principle, and that a country ought to control its taxes and laws - am I a farage cheerleader? NO!   Brexit and #blacklivesmatter frankly have ZERO in common!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat Well it’s a cascade of events -why would you even find yourself in a situation where your comments on racism, equality for all ... resonates with a KNOWN racist? Seriously!  The issue is: Keir was unable to articulate a reasonable response, which shows he’s NOT properly engaged🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickamon @holski_beat We can be fair indeed!   However I do not believe that a movement calling for end to racism, discrimination and inequality based on race is “a MOMENT of [temporary] reflection on George Floyd” - it’s a perpetual fight until black people (and other minorities) are treated fairly‼️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat ... gets trolled by Cleverly and gets praised by FARAGE.... bloody FARAGE - a man recently fired by LBC for being racist! A man who flies to shoe-shine Trumps brogues!!   This is apparently the leader of a party that we (minorities and progressives) should relish to vote for?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coops_tv Very heartwarming this! Belgium definitely has a breathtaking tragic colonial history! However at least this gesture shows some element of accountability and remorse!

A cultural revolution where we address “RACISM” and discrimination through EDUCATION, correction of historical truth twisting/ spinning is apparently synonymous/equal to “final solution” of the 1930s where the Nazis through RACISM killed millions? Beg your pardon?⁉️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_ThePatriot Yep @HackneyAbbott above you, ALL day, EVERY day, EVERY year!   Bye Mike the patriot racist!   #blacklivesmatter 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️‼️  https://t.co/SOJ0HGmvaQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mike_ThePatriot @MartinDaubney Lol the terrorists are the racists and xenophobes of which you’re clearly a member.

<|startoftext|>@Mike_ThePatriot @MartinDaubney The plastering is what created a situation where: statues of slave masters are erected and adorned with INCORRECT inscription “colston virtuous &amp;wise” 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ - virtuous to whom? Plastering over colonialism, plastering through terms like BAME, BLM has unmasked, y’all are upset☹️‼️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_ThePatriot @MartinDaubney WRONG: BLM has unmasked the pretence &amp;plastering that had solidified over last few decades. There remains discrimination based on race (unspoken of), there remains abject racism in society, there remains brutality based on race! There remains inaccuracy in historical events!‼️🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Martinc101112 @MartinDaubney Yes and their constituents are interested in an EQUAL society where your race doesn’t make you a target for abuse!

<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV @PaulBrandITV - why is #Edmilliband not commenting on the lack of consistency in how #KeirStarmer responds to other forms of racism in Labour Party... which “strong” action did Keir take against people in Labour accused of being racist towards black people? #LabourLeaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielCreminUK she’s herself a RULE BREAKER! Let’s not forget the way &amp;reason TheresaMay had to fire her!?

<|startoftext|>@kidcobbler @MartinDaubney There are many like him: will clutch pearls at site of bird stuck in a net, or startled horse...  but when you remind them of injustices against people who aren’t like them (in privilege, race, religion, nationalism etc)...🙄😤ohh God stop, my ears, my eyes, STOP🛑! Extraordinary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSDH_S @MartinDaubney Lol - ahh how tragic, the abuse of a plaque, stone/metal statues made u want to cry yourself to sleep. It made you not want to be the fairest person on the planet anymore🤷🏾‍♂️😂🙄🧐  If you’re that blind to what’s going on in the western world with RE: BAME, might as well stay😴😴!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kidcobbler @MartinDaubney Tell us what he responds with: its been very interesting observing the attitudes and reactions of some people in our country: they’ve got plenty of energy for stone&amp; metal statues/plaques. But you WONT catch them seeking justice for people like #StephenLawrence. Statue&gt;human🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Right .... a “plaque”  turns your mood against fighting the for equality and against discrimination based on racism!   If that’s what your threshold is for making the world a better place for all... keep hugging and kissing your plaques and stone objects. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ #blacklivesmatter🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Well... why dont u have same energy to end racism Mr Daubney⁉️  MPs in House of Parliament are supposed to work to make the country a better place for EVERYONE, create equal opportunities for EVERYONE!  FYI: #StephenLawrance racist murderers &amp;police coverup are still walking free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestminsterWAG ... says someone who speead fakenews in the deliberate knowledge that the victim of the fakenews would be piled upon by baying wolves... Incidentally the victim of the fakenews had her career/character “derided and her intentions were twisted” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️! What’s good for the goose?🤷🏾‍♂️🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes He was a councillor?...all I can say is this #BlackLivesMatter season &amp; 2020 as a whole is making many masks slip! Racists and xenophobes emerging from the drying waters! Farage was a fox dressed in suits, KatieH is just 💯fascist! Boris is racist, tories don’t care for poor kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPWellman @FPWellman the worst part of #ElijahMcClain case is that: he tried to explain to the officers what he was doing: “I’m going home” and once they had restrained him, he begged and explained that he would do better!? Better at what? Better at walking home🤢😤😭🥵? Tragedy! Justice⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker I just want to hear from voters who were convinced at the election campaign that Tories were the safest hands that Britain could vote for. On the other hand, apparently a 70yr old man who wanted to reduce cost of transport, internet, wars, uni fees etc. was the GREATEST danger🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @PriyamvadaGopal check this tweet as part of the libel/misquote from DailyTrash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Nadine_Writes Exactly! And you’re right about Eastern Europe too. I suspect it’s because having never colonised African nations, they are relatively newly exposed? Last year I wanted to go holiday in Russia, and everyone warned me “mate are you sure you want to go Eastern Europe?” It’s mad🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams This is the issue I have: @Keir_Starmer steadfastly fired #RebeccaLongBailey apparently for retweeting an article that have a racism trope. And the same party leader is now saying racism towards black peoples is “private exchange between people” #KeirStarmer you’re a disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Im not surprised at all that Indians are relatively unsupportive. What white people who use BAME as a fall safe term don’t realise is that within BAME there are diff groups that have diff societal struggles. Black are bottom, chinese/japn at top, Indiana below Chn/jap etc!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryBoustedNEU @Jennieformby1 ... is this supposed to be some sort of teturn to the Victorian times by @GavinWilliamson ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leanrum @JLK19569 @benjpasek @aewerner @realzoestrimpel I think as we’ve managed to do today: people need to try and actually have discussions and dialogue with others. Its easy to sit back &amp; make an all encompassing conclusion which isn’t fair. After EDL marches I didn’t conclude “all white are racists”🤷🏾‍♂️generalisations aren’t fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal Good! We got ur back! These people cannot be allowed to get away with their slander! Goves wife has a massive following via her newspaper job- imagine the amount of people her FakeNews reached? Then the fakenews was amplified by Pearson/Vance et al. Best wishes! Keep us updated💪🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyamvadaGopal @PriyamvadaGopal please tell us your pursuing these people legally? Regardless of retraction - their contribution to defamation of your name has been profound. Also their retraction and apologies need to be formal on a notarised letter! Not a silly meaningless tweet! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBegnaud Im confused- the video from body cams is public, We’ve ALL SEEN the video: #ElijahMcClain posed ZERO threat to the officers. He was 1) outnumbered, 2) was unarmed and he still DIED as a consequence of the arrest! Why are the cops not being charged with murder/battery? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌😵😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 No, on the contrary @SuzanneEvans1. The people out protesting for #BlackLivesMatter are motivated by the xenophobia, Ignorance and racism exuded by people like you and farage! And the more you continue to show your ignorance, the more they’ll continue! @Femi_Sorry 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman This needs to be the mood every day 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ !! Racists really need to be taken to task<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leanrum @JLK19569 @benjpasek @aewerner @realzoestrimpel I’m not a member of an organisation called #BlackLivesMatter or a member of any organisation for that matter, and that’s the reality for many people on the streets saying “black lives matter” they’re not there as party/ organisation/ institution members, but as individuals 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leanrum @JLK19569 @benjpasek @aewerner @realzoestrimpel And hmm this statement better not be ur assessment of what you THINK I’m about. As I said saying “black lives matter”’does not make one part of a party/ organisation. I’m black, I’ve been victim of racism, my family &amp; friends have been victims: I’m here to say: STOP the RACISM🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nfidelis12 @JmvMuneza @songajames123 @Rwandapolice @Baker_Reports Glad we now understand each other 💪🏾👌🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okwonga @Okwonga my argument in support of what @adilray is saying is that #BLM are not adopting to the environment. We now have a media out to spin reality, they want to suggest BLM=thuggery/violence! The spin is beginning to work. BLM needs to adopt! They need to craft clear demands🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray @IainDale @Denise__Headley A lot of the issues we have in the uk &amp; western world is that virtually ALL current affairs issues on media are discussed from the prism &amp;angle of non-BAME perspectives. Even now while the topic of racism towards black is being discussed, we have white people whitesplaining🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray I think the single most useful thing people with platforms can do is invite people, give them a voice, help them articulate, help them organise etc. Don’t kno if u listen to #LBC, @IainDale recently started inviting a black lady @Denise__Headley weekly to give alternative voice🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray Hi @adilray thanks for replying. Fundamentally BLM movement is at risk of failing becoz indeed they seem unable to capitalise on the moment and become “organised” with a clear set of demands! In many ways they need to learn from the #Yellowvests -they quickly made a list of wants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OGMurphy1 You’ve got yourself a new follower! Bring them to account seeing the opposition wont.  Also is there a case with #RobertJenrick corruption leaks? Surely due process was not followed and instead process was deviated by a minister to prevent council collecting due monies? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray @adilray what contribution are you making to the debate though?! It’s all well and good criticising, but what contributions are we as individuals making.  You have a platform- how many BLM activists have you invited to your show? What debates have you organised etc? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JmvMuneza @nfidelis12 @songajames123 @Rwandapolice @Baker_Reports Thank u sir @JmvMuneza! Njye simply icyo nashatse to highlight is the indisciplined language used!

<|startoftext|>@nfidelis12 @songajames123 @Rwandapolice @Baker_Reports Translation: “what is HE, in the first place, to go beyond the instructions, such that he thinks he should experience a different treatment”. Therefore meaning “nigiki” was reference to @Baker_Reports directly! End of stories! Stop trying to twist the reality as if we’re stupid🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/riP9C8BjBL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nfidelis12 @songajames123 @Rwandapolice @Baker_Reports Erega twese turi abanyarwanda, we understand our mothertongue and its intricacies! Mu kinyarwanda adding “iki” before a word turns into an inflammatory meaning. I.e. iki+imbwa = ikibwa (negative), iki+muntu= wa kintu = negative etc! Rero don’t try teach us what he meant! We KNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faizashaheen Nope, but in the meantime #KeirStarmer has fired RLB 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samuelcoates Perhaps they should try find out why the atmosphere has worsened then! At end of the end, if people feel safe and trust the system, the atmosphere improves. Maybe the issue isn’t the “BAME youth” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samuelcoates “BAME youth do not respond to hellos” since when was it a law to respond to your hellos? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSalem @MPeakeOfficial @RLong_Bailey FYI - RBL did say she spoke to the Party and explained what the situation. Just because there’s “no tweet” does not mean she’s not address the issue! Jesus - not everything needs a “tweet”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@songajames123 @Rwandapolice @Baker_Reports Have decorum - ntago bavuga “nigiki” in reference to human being. Bavuga “Ninde”. That’s all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner Maybe I’m just not cut out for politics lol... the games, strategies are all too much for my simple brain.  All I can say is it appears #keirstarmer would be a formidable chess player!   Incidentally I’m awful at chess ! 😂🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!   Argh 😤 politics sucks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😪😪 - yeah but surely all this shows is that it’s all about “media management” rather than principles? Which to me comes across as ... political games?  Surely #RobertJenrick has committed in what most other countries would be deemed: corruption/ missuse of public office?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA @youjstdntknow Haha ...she “blacked out”? How does a person in a coma (blacked out) manage to balance in vertical position on the back of a pickup truck, formulate racist sentences, think of her children/ grandchildren to whom she’ll teach to be racist, wave a flag in air while dancing? #karen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall So what are u suggesting? He acted abruptly to give an appearance of “toughness”? To gain credit?  Your tweets are giving the illusion that RBL May have been deprived due process because #KeirStarmer was eager to appear favourably? Which is fundamental therefore unfair dismissal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire I want someone to help clarify something: is using the word “Israel” in any given sentence - be it supportive or critical equal to = commentary on Judaism/ Jewishness ? Because I recall debates in recent past that conflating Israel (nation) with Judaism (faith) was antisemitism⁉️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 I am very pleased and glad that we agree! At end of the day ALL forms of racisms have an IMPACT on the victims upon which the racism is directed! The impact is profound and negative. He should not be seen to appear to act strongly in one corner, and unbothered the other corner.🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 In conclusion therefore, I find the “disparity” and incogruence in his handling with different “forms” of racisms in his party strange.   Do you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 Strange in the sense that he should deal with ALL forms of racism with equal rigour &amp; steadfastness. Today he seems to display “leadership” in dealing with a type of racism and discrimination: Antisemitism. However I’m also aware that he hasn’t done much else with black racism🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 Everyone will be very aware since the labour leaks that labour is plagued not only by issues with antisemitism but also racism towards minorities. #KeirStarmer has steadfastly dealt with antisemitism (by today’s actions) yet blind to other forms of racism in labour! Strange🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner @viewsfromleft I just think it’s all absurd! Thankfully Im not a member, I’ve been on fence about joining a party.. used to be a conservative voter, ditches tories when boris came about... sought refuge in labour, suddenly Keir doesn’t quite fill with immense confidence. I’ll stick to the fence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 Did she actually say those things or is society actually the one doing the extrapolating ?   Where did RLB say verbatim “ Israel is responsible for George Floyd's death” 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner @viewsfromleft buddy any views on this? Im struggling to process this situation. Just got out of surgery theatres for a break to this breaking news. The ONE BREAKING NEWS that should be happening right now is “Labour has held #RobertJenrick to account: he’s resigned”🤷🏾‍♂️❌🙄not RLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Abrams I have to say I am HONESTLY at a loss for words! Genuinely😪🤔🧐😐🤨! I cannot for the life of me understand why @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner have the energy to purge their own party for an article &amp;twitter post, but ZERO effort to expose &amp;prosecute Tory corruption &amp; embezzlement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holski_beat So rather than chase the tories for corruption and embezzlement - @Keir_Starmer chases his own party members for debatable issues. #RobertJenrick ACTUALLY committed a criminal activity... #RLB shared an article that can be debated ... absurd doesn’t do the situation any justice🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jjone125_j @AndrewF58695390 @BorisJohnson I think what we need to have are laws! Many countries have laws on corruption and embezzlement. The UK seems to be a country where the government of the day can wing it as they go, and all rests on the competence and scrutiny of the speaker of commons- madness! Deliberately murky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjone125_j @AndrewF58695390 @BorisJohnson Well sticking head in sand and saying “well all are corrupt” is not the answer! The country needs to create laws that mitigate corruption! Corruption = taxpayers money stolen as per the 45M! The attitude on display here is “oh well let’s ignore the issue” soz but that’s not okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Fantastic news that you tried to blur images on bbc last night, but the images are actually in the public domain. Whilst your here trying to boast about nhs to smokescreen the #RobertJenrick corruption scandal- can you explain why the tories appear to be rife with corruption?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/Sa40nrhVM9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaylaMoran @Independent @LaylaMoran #RobertJenrick needs to be investigated for criminal activity. Not just resign! You politicians are failing us!

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @piersmorgan @GMB @susannareid100 There’s a plethora of images showing the association and relationship between #BorisJohnson, the Tory party and inevitably the gov!

<|startoftext|>@liamyoung It seems to be the case .... meanwhile the images are now in the public ... behold what bbc wanted to hide from the public ....

<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @LBC @TomSwarbrick1 The issue with Tom is that his angle of analysis is always as though he’s still a conservatives Theresa May advisor.

<|startoftext|>@realJavedBashir @adilray @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour @LibDems @theSNP  -this is what needs to be called for unanimously!  What #RobertJenrick did was a CRIMINAL act!

<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Jamaica has a statue of Queen Victoria? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔 lol ... I’m glad that in Africa most countries got rid of statures and idols as soon as they got independence.

<|startoftext|>@carldinnen I’m puzzled by the silence of tories &amp; their voters. Tories advertise themselves as party of law, order, properness, decency etc. However here we have a clear cut case of corruption (stuff you’d see/hear about putin/ Russia). Dear Tory voters, what’s going on? @emilyhewertson🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner @AngelaRayner the #RobertJenrick stuff is a lot more serious; it’s corruption and therefore criminal! It cannot be case closed. It needs to be investigated for criminal activity. A minister using position to influence local council decisions AND to solicit for billionaire donors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martw17 @MrHarryCole @KirstyStricklan @Conservatives But how can the WHOLE party be so under skilled?

<|startoftext|>@MrHarryCole @KirstyStricklan Its astonishing that the @Conservatives advertise themselves to be the party of justice, properness, rule of law, yet time after time info leaks that proves otherwise: they’re led by a racist, their advisors build w/o permission, ministers arrange tax avoidance schemes etc🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeDemianyk I just want to know how joe Bloggs on the street votes for these Animal Farm #GeorgeOrwell type of pigs ... who behind the public eye plot methods to steal from the general public! @RobertJenrick you’re a disgrace! As if the party @Conservatives to which you’re a member 🤢🤢❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman @RexChapman please update us on the followup! I want to hear &amp; know that this man is suing the hell out of the specific police department! Battery, broken wrist, racial profiling, attempted murder, PTSD the damn lot! This shit ain’t right! Period! @TheRevAl @FINALLEVEL @shaunking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Haha - a beacon for freedom and liberty ... meanwhile in the USA, you act to prevent Americans from voting (just in case they vote out trump)...🤔  Also please tell us about the “human rights” of black people who are dying from police brutality and impunity? We await a reply🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c0de6349 @nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere Okay 👌🏾 - jog on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestminsterWAG Ahh they’ll get sucked into crime and drugs .... says @WestminsterWAG . When your grown adult husband was snorting cocaine - (a drug worse than weed) - what articles were you writing reprimanding his drug behaviour? Did you report to the police? #ToriesLiePeopleDie 🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌🧏‍♂️  https://t.co/Rbf5pSau1Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere It’s just tragic! So much good could be achieved if everyone one did their “civil and moral duty”. See something wrong - call it out, achieve justice!   Astonishingly the same fence sitting, Pearl clutching, gin+tonic drinkers would be first to call police if they saw dog abuse🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere Sadly there are so many fence sitters who aren’t appalled. They’d rather sit in their silence and sip a gin &amp; tonic while people like #elijahmclain are slain! I do now genuinely believe the crisis is not the minority racists in the world, it’s the silence of the majority🤷🏾‍♂️😪❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere Me too! I saw the article &amp; video on Monday! ONE borderline autistic black boy handled by a football team worth of trained muscular police men, and yet they could NOT peacefully handcuff him? He begged, he explained, they still held him down like an animal. Then they injected🤢❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere I concur! As I say when I get the chance later today (UK time) I’ll see if I can track down the Instagram video.   Its all a mess in USA is all I can say from UK. Every day we see a new video and we just😬🤔😵: 1) #ouzobay, 2) This N word+ flipping video, 3) #elijahmclain WTF🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere I’m with you on this ... we kind of only see the video where he makes the allegations... but not the one where she actually does it. With that said: I’m reluctant to believe he fabricated it... with that said: it’s INSANE how it all escalated!! Bewildering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicbic1114 @ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere I’ll try find it later after work... I’m not sure if his Instagram is open to all? But he does allege that he’s got it on a different video that he posted on Instagram?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLK19569 @benjpasek @aewerner @realzoestrimpel Hear hear Justine (you fit your name (justice) amazingly and it’s admirable)! I’m with you 💯, why are people struggling to comprehend the issue at hand “equality for all”. That’s all people are asking for! Stop killing people, stop abuse, stop discrimination, be kinder! Easy 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky These scientists have allowed their advice to be manipulated and yet they continue to stand at podiums next to these lying politicians. Do #SAGE scientists actually have a backbone? They see on a daily basis the manipulation, yet they feed the manipulator the daily bread🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes His grace is what touches me! Imagine being bullied by those who were supposed to protect you? .... bullied by an institution for telling the “truth”. Absolute mess! They should go beyond apologies and actually correct inequality - I.e. scholarship named after black guy for black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks You can have 🙌🏾 - 2 hands !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miss_Snuffy @Miss_Snuffy with greatest respect, if there WAS no racism, If there WAS equality and parity between all races- there would never have been a Stephen Lawrence in Eltham London, there would be equality in career prospects, racial profiling wouldn’t exist. Blame the racists not BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicderbyshire @BBCOne We witnessed quite spectacularly how BAME term can be used to manipulate numbers when #matthancock was asked by @SophyRidgeSky a while back about black people in cabinet, Matt responded with “we’re proud of our BAME members like Priti, Sunak etc” - all those names were NOT black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicderbyshire @BBCOne @vicderbyshire I am a black man, I DO NOT identify as BAME. As matter of fact over last few weeks as a result of #GeorgeFloyd murder, I have had numerous discussions with other black people in UK, (and some Asians) none of us identify with The term BAME! It is misleading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman @BobYoungTHI USA you a mess. You make all the "third world countries" that you bring "democracy" to appear to be more democratic than USA. Let me get this straight: USA tried to lock doors at 6PM to PREVENT people exercising their RIGHT to vote? Then USA will preach about elections to Iraq?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToniBonos @c0de6349 @gowithdennis @GundamIsHere Code missed a very important part of the video: Carlos apparently has a different video on Instagram of the actual confrontation. What we are seeing is the aftermath where Carlos catches up with her &amp; asks why she did what she did!? Then Karen starts having spontaneous seizures🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAS1304 @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper Exactement tu as raison! Tandis que lui il est aveuglé par l'ignorance et peut-être même le racisme! au cours des dernières années, la Grande-Bretagne est devenue plus hostile et polarisée politiquement! Dommage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAS1304 @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper I’m just going to follow you because of the French flag haha! Bonjour comment ca va? Le monsieur qui nous parle est raciste! Tout simplement🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kreactivity @OuzoBayBalt Thats what I am thinking too -the 2 managers need to sue the organisation @OuzoBayBalt - the managers were FOLLOWING your policy on dress code! Moreover it clearly appears that WHITE people dressed ANYHOW were able to just walk to their table, but non white faced dress inspection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimZon_666 @FINALLEVEL you clearly struggle with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimZon_666 @FINALLEVEL Haha lol, okay, how do you want me to screenshot the BS you said? Attached is another screenshot where you allege "Some (black people) exaggerate. Then you clapped back with "I didnt say you exaggerate" - are you really that less than smart? If you cant back your chat, dont chat  https://t.co/KdqCD3kOXf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimZon_666 @FINALLEVEL Well firstly, you DID say 'SOME (black people) EXAGGERATE - facts are just facts, so not quite sure why you're now saying "I didnt say you exaggerate". 2nd what does Malcolm X/J.Chan have to do with racial discrimination/ profiling/ limitation of aspiration or career etc?🤷‍♂️‼️  https://t.co/CNcH1WSrof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rooftopandy @MAS1304 @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper Being against RACISM and RACISTS has nothing to do with 'being scared and offended'.  We stand up to RACISM and RACISTs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FINALLEVEL This video illustrates 'beautifully' issue of 'Institutional' racism, racial profiling, discrimination based on race &amp;appearance, limiting the aspirations of black folk, overt racism etc. ALL in less than 5min! Meanwhile some white folk want to accuse black people of exaggeration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 hmmm.... inner racist and xenophobic tendencies- they feel that Farage has a platform to normalise their bigotry?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex250175 @rooftopandy @PompeyTim69 @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper @Alex250175 - honestly mate dont put yourself through the torment of listing all the horrible events your family and friends have had to endure; to try make this ignorant racist understand the most simple issue of racism in UK! It’s an insult to all of us! It’s not worth it❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kavintgcinq I thought the whole point of the new republic was to achieve this democracy? Where we can have multiple political parties? Be able to debate agree or disagree and not be killed for holding an alternative view point? What happened to this ideal/ dream? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjcbale @LensSniper @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 U &amp;me both mate! Hes racist/defender of racists which inevitably makes him racist!   I honestly cannot understand these people. I think as a society western world is in a weird place, we in a place where ethnicities have hierarchies- antisemitism is crime, but other racism pass🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLK19569 @benjpasek @aewerner @realzoestrimpel Indeed! I’m 💯up for discussing the issues posed by those who attend with criminal intent. But it’s vital to note: stating “black lives matter” does not equal “an organisation” - its a movement! Im black, I think black peoples should have parity with others, I’m not antisemitic🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LensSniper @tjcbale @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ lol alright Mr I can reel of a load of bigotry nonsense!  Racists that cannot even make a comprehensive point.   Pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LensSniper @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 Lol yeah - sorry that asking for racial equality is allegedly according to you “Marxist” and extreme!   Racists - you really are simply just vile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjcbale @LensSniper @rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 Knowledge? You’re being too generous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray The fact that the banner didn’t even say “ALL LIVES MATTER” shows what it’s all about.... ignorance! Stupidity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl The worst aspect of @realzoestrimpel article is that it doesn’t even seem to want to heal any areas of “genuine” identifiable conflict between BLM &amp;Judaism. Instead she deploys JCorbyn to create a directional narrative and maligns MOST people who fight against black racism! Trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialtyeesh This has made me depressed! Why does the police seem to see black skin as catalyst to terminating a black mans life? This is not to right! RIP #ElijahMcClain -also what have politicians done to seek justice? @AOC @shaunking @People4Bernie @SenSanders @SenKamalaHarris @FINALLEVEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Derrick79310260 @TheSharkPunch @earthsignsey @indiapitts21 Dude the fact that #georgefloyd happened in the first place shows that it is a lost cause for many of them! I think you need to find more constructive ways of debating this issue. As I said the intention was good, methodology can be debated but raising awareness is not a crime🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Derrick79310260 @TheSharkPunch @earthsignsey @indiapitts21 By all means check em coz there many situations where they get it WRONG. But my grandma always taught me that many routes lead to Rome. At end of the day: the focus has to be the destination! @TheSharkPunch came from direction of good, and in this current f’d USA, I’m here for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Derrick79310260 @TheSharkPunch @earthsignsey @indiapitts21 Well each to their own! Have it your way, we just gotta keep having more #BreannaTaylor -no evidence =charades with the police👮‍♀️. White peoples trying to help us out and they’re now being told “stop trying to educate your fellow white people” then when they silent, we complain🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeffersznn @Kaycedilla_ @TheSharkPunch A football team worth of trained muscular police men were unable to peacefully hold a skinny black boy down until handcuffs could be applied? Is that what she’s SERIOUSLY suggesting here?! Why do people feel the need to defend the indefensible? This is why USA is a mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Derrick79310260 @TheSharkPunch @earthsignsey @indiapitts21 Black person here: I think @TheSharkPunch makes a valid point! At end of the end: where there’s no evidence the police make up their version of events “he tried to resist arrest, he was a threat, so gun was fired” these images are not fetishising death. It’s evidence❌🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper I suppose the thing is-you’re clearly a DECENT person (everything that this person seems not to be)  Keep the positive vibe energy man! Its the best way to be! Sadly there will ALWAYS be enemies of progress in the form of racists/ fascist/ (and any other extreme)! We’re better!💪🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper Also when you check his profile and look at the things he likes, retweets, people he follows, you see that his “longterm life tendencies” is pretty much racism/ xenophobia and bigotry. He’s definitely not a “I’m not racist... i just don’t get etc” - he’s just simply RACIST🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  https://t.co/hzKRFFwnKh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper I understand you, and I get your approach in trying to help him... but I fear saying things “mate I totally understand your (bigoted) views” sends the wrong message, these people throw these baits out to lure in fans and sympathisers to reinforce their ignorance. It’s sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper But that’s the point I didn’t because I don’t walk around seeing the worse in people. I don’t walk around extrapolating colonialism and slave trade on EVERY white person — because I am RACIST or an idiot. Why is it hard for us to call him out on his ignorance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper So he’s never been to a hospital &amp; seen coloured doctors? Never seen non-white nurses? Non white teachers? Non-white MPs? Non-white scientists? Non-white air hostesses? Non-white bus/train drivers? He’s lived on Mars where all he sees is his own race? Rest are Satan’s creation?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper Point is ignorance is not something to praise or excuse. Ignorance should be called out and education provided. Not pandered to! His tweet is full of bigotry, ignorance, xenophobia and many could say racism. He has literally suggested ALL black and Asian people walk with weapons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper So should I who went to a university in north England where I was one of 5 black people in a course containing 450 students, of a university with a total of approx 24,000 students of which less than 5% was black have walked around assuming every white person is a “racist fascist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper Lol 😂 okay! Mr racist defender! To be fair it’s not surprising to see a racist defending another racist! Cut from the same cloth 🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper And guess what there are A LOT of RACIST WHITE PEOPLE in the western world that black people have to live alongside (just a fact), black people do not walk around labelling EVERY white person “Racist fascist” (just a fact). And he picks on Asian &amp; Black people: 2 COLOURED races🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rooftopandy @Snorkyno4 @LensSniper Care to explain why black do lot view all white peoples as racist fascist despite the extensive and chronic history of oppression of white against blacks? Point is: his comment and analyse thereof is bigoted, ignorant, xenophobic and frankly exemplifies racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noyoufuckoff @LensSniper What level of anxiety can make someone take 2 very large &amp;diverse races of human beings: Asians&amp; black people and decide that EVERY black &amp;Asian person is carrying a weapon? When I walk past any white person, why do I not get the urge to “assume” every white person is a fascist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevelapsl Very interesting and somewhat sheds light on a question ive been pondering: why has Britain become so entrenched over the last 10 years? Brexit has emboldened “imperialism/greatness/rule Britannia” sentiments in the English; tories are most reflective of these ideals🤷🏾‍♂️@paultinay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We pay tribute to the role played by your mum @HackneyAbbott ! I’d no idea you have direct connections with the #Windrush situation. Helped to rebuild the “empire” and despite all the sacrifices rendered by your family, certain ideologically driven monsters hound you. Sad 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl It’s shocking to see how vile these people are. In any case solidarity! 💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Just block him - it’s really not worth the effort and time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello @JimBelushi - this tweet has reached me in United Kingdom, Birmingham during my work break (medical)!   Full heartedly agree with the message in your tweet!   The world is far too toxic at moment. Nations that normally lead the world are paralysed by toxic macho men🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Only thing I can add here is: @dominiquetaegon seems to have fallen for the “tokenism” card. There’s a way certain sect of rightwingers make u feel; they “elevate”, they invite you to polo/ cheese&amp;wine soirées etc. And sadly for many the🥕is too good for too long. Sad times🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandmcs It is qWhite astonishing that in the period where #NigelFarage is forced off #LBC because he’s a racist &amp; peddles xenophobic views and #katiehopkins was banned from twitter for being a racist; SUDDENLY virtually ALL tories/rightwing move to #Parler. They’re all following Farage🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft @dominiquetaegon I watched the BLM through media/social media. The demands are literally “black lives matter”, “stop disproportionately killing/arresting us” “stop stunting our career prospects”, “stop smokescreening history with fakenews statues” -there’s NOTHING extreme in these demands🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon 3. I watched the BLM through media/social media. The demands are literally “black lives matter”, “stop disproportionately killing/arresting us” “stop stunting our career prospects”, “stop smokescreening history with fakenews statues” -there’s NOTHING extreme in these demands🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon I disagree with @dominiquetaegon on the “extreme BLM” comment. The bottom line is: we are in 2020 (21st century), racism &amp;discrimination towards black people has gone on for centuries. At every milestone, black people are smokescreens with “we’re all the same” yet racism persists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon Been busy with Father’s Day over weekend, so only just seen this thread by @dominiquetaegon -IT IS A GOOD thread! Interesting thing to note is that black people who pander to the right, receive adoration &amp;support, as soon as Dominique speaks up, The RIGHT is the one attacking🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ant_365 @BertieRGTG @AlisonW37619617 @AyoCaesar Well for a start Katie is not even allowed on twitter, so let’s not even go there! Secondly, millions of people on Saturday spent time with their friends&amp; families, ate ice creams, puddings. Some drank beers, G&amp;T, wine, cordial etc. Are we all “leftist racist”? #AshSarkar 🤷🏾‍♂️🍺🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ant_365 @BertieRGTG @AlisonW37619617 @AyoCaesar I was in my garden with my family drinking some beers! I posted on Instagram. Am I a “leftist racist” celebrating the death of people in reading?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidO29359492 @DPJHodges @AyoCaesar She like anyone else in this country on Saturday was with her friends &amp; family, she had an ice lolly and posted to her friends, followers- what’s that got to do with anything? So here you are rather than have a word with the hyenas, you blame her for being her? Nasty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @DPJHodges 👏🏾! I cannot for the life of me understand why some people in this country are so messed up! Yesterday I drank a beer in the garden, I posted on Instagram, does that mean I am “some leftist racist celebrating death of people in reading?” NO! #AshSarkar 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sammii0812 @AyoCaesar Eh? 🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar One thing Im observing this AM, is that there's been some sort of coordination into attacking @AyoCaesar by right wing madness. Right wing idiots are tweeting tweets that contain words such as 'leftist' - clearly all the attacks are originating from rightwing corners. vile pricks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveMyrieBBC This is why people are saying #BlackLivesMattter to be honest. For some reason right wing commentators and the Tory party are trying to gaslight everyone into believing that those black peoples who speak up are fabricating - well We’re defo not!

<|startoftext|>@Jodyl64 @ls_lyndsey Of course she doesn’t. Ironically she’s proven herself to be rather dim, just because JamesNotSocleverly appears dark skinned, she assumes he’s full on black.

<|startoftext|>@ls_lyndsey Now that we’ve moved away from your erroneous assertions of his race.

<|startoftext|>@ls_lyndsey You allege that #JamesCleverly is a “black man” - he isn’t, he’s multi heritage - half white (British) and half African (Sierra Leone) he’s therefore mixed raced! On the topic of racism tonight: he got it completely wrong. So @lisanandy was well within rights to challenge him  https://t.co/4djcL6GCBj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ls_lyndsey Being mixed raced does NOT make one BLACK as it does also not make one WHITE! James cleverly is mixed raced, NOT black! Get the facts right.#bbcqt.

<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes Tips for dealing with bots and idiots:  -if a strange/ very provocative response is sent to your tweet: 1) before even replying, follow the account and check for number of followers, when account created, who they follow. 2) If their account stats look dodgey - don’t bother reply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexJamesNicola It’s a good thing that they’ve had no PR spin training because their “authentic truth” is leaking out.   The truth seems to be: 1) they care more about✈️ repaint than they do hungry children, 2) they think black fight against racism is “game of thrones”. They simply don’t care🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speak louder for the idiots in the room who are still asking and confused about whether “institutional racism” is a thing.

<|startoftext|>@MrJCrouch Haha wow - standing against racism “alienates” ordinary people.

<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes @DavidOlusoga ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcowenjones Good point. Guess their assumptions were that everyone in British society is as dismissive of British imperial atrocities as they are.

I’ve never wanted to say Fuck You so badly to some1  https://t.co/L1gc3u9oZx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farga @DanielJHannan The facts are Africans were fine before Europeans came to enslave them. How’s that for facts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farga @DanielJHannan Africa didn’t need you, period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielJHannan Ask people of #Zimbabwe -theyll tell u otherwise! The self centredness of British white people is beyond belief! This is tantamount to #Colston being described as “virtuous &amp;wise” virtuous to who? The 1000s of black people he chained, shipped &amp; threw overboard? #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Denise__Headley I have NO idea how your holding it together against that ignorant Mark, who is being emboldened by @IainDale  with regards to is racism a hindrance to black people progressing in careers! Its always revealing when these white people reveal their alliance! Jesus❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward Haha it makes Rees mogg appear human... shapps looks like she’s had a rough life ... the rest of them: wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Britain, can we please adopt the attitude of requiring our politicians to be accurate, and when wrong for them to accept responsibility! We keep being told “arms were wrapped around all institutions” yet all institutions (bar DomCummings) have suffered. #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Haha lol - this thread makes Rees Mogg and Patel actually relatively normal looking! Shapps looks like she’s had a hard life. Hancock - no comment! Suella Braverman - wow 😮🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JujuLaBelle Doesn’t Rwanda have highest number of “women” in politics? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan @pritipatel @UKLabour @guardian So one minute #PritiPatel along with @KemiBadenoch is allowed to gaslight black people about racism, telling us that “Britain is the best place in the world to be black”...but bcoz she’s facing a backlash, suddenly racism is REAL “against Priti” but not black peoples! Jesus🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fhmdrn You left @SuellaBraverman out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan Lol here comes a Tory asking #MarcusRashford to be an advocate for the tories after Tory MPs were previously ridiculing his letters, and I bet Lucy didn’t even write a response to Marcus. But now they want to use him to manoeuvre through their ideology! #maketheUturn NOT for SALE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChappersSays @bbcnickrobinson @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey @Conservatives Of what consequence is that to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 How did @Keir_Starmer not ask about this? Considering we have have a string of rule breakers: #Dominiccummings et al, how did this nugget of an opportunity to skewer #BorisHasFailedUK bypass #KeirStarmer the 'forensic' ?? Asking for many wanting opposition to hold gov to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 How are u the only one seeing the... apparently invisible 'holiness' of this new merger? The PM literally used the argument that "Why should UK help X African country instead of X bulkan (european) country, yet you cannot read between the lines? Somalia vs. Romania - whos poorer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges So, yesterday Tory MPs knew about #MarcusRashford (including some ministers), the media knew about Marcus (and were talking about him), vast majority of Brits on social media knew about Marcus, Marcus wrote to ALL MPs in Parliament... BUT the PRIME MINISTER did NOT until today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @thetwerkinggirl Yep. One observation Ive made from this discourse is that overwhelmingly black people in the UK are happy to be called straightforwardly 'Black people' -and people from India/Pakistani etc. seem also to be happy with 'Asian' (I think). Whats clear is that BAME is a political term<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetwerkinggirl Its deliberate. By blurring Asians with black people, they can allow the likes of millionaires like Priti Patel to throw in their ores of “i too used to face racism, BUT look at me now🙋🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️- I’m a millionaire &amp; a minister” -totally intended to plasters over black concerns! 😤❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @UKLabour Couldn’t agree more! 👌🏾💯💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Shes not even black! Jesus Christ 😤😤and she most certainly does NOT represent any black person in the Uk!   Whilst on this topic, nor does: Priti Patel, Sajid, sunak, suela braverman etc represent black peoples. They can by all means represent Indians and Pakistani, that’s all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford @UKLabour - listen carefully - this was NOT about YOU! ... it was not 'we (labour) did it!   Learn a lesson or 2 from #MarcusRashford on decorum and grace. (And how to win the argument against the Tory government)  #maketheUturn #BorisHasFailedUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LPerrins @LPerrins please be aware that it is NOT only “middle class” parents who pay taxes! You’ll find that working class people also pay! Moreover, it is not the average earners who avoid paying tax in this country, it’s the mega rich that you’re out here cheerleading! Despicable! ❌😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidRodwell11 @DavidLammy @MarcusRashford On the topic of right &amp; wrong:   Government Feeding children who are vulnerable and have no/inadequate food is: RIGHT!  Not feeding them, arguing their parents made a mistake giving birth to them etc. is: vile and wrong ❌  So in conclusion it appears you’re callous #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidRodwell11 @DavidLammy @MarcusRashford Lol okay David, jog along please.   Before you do jog on, though, thank you for highlighting to the rest of us the way Tories view society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidRodwell11 @DavidLammy @MarcusRashford Thanks for your contribution &amp;illustrating your lack of insight into the realities millions of people have to live on a daily basis. "God" DOES KNOW what those parents do: they are able to channel the few savings to things such as: bills, clothing, extra-curricular etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 I had privilege of listening to @BorisJohnson opening remarks: the running theme was: "Why X African country instead of X European(Bulkan) country- The motivations &amp;purpose of Gov's decision today are VERY VERY clear! We're not thick. How ppl are endorsing this gov is beyond me🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 The only thing I would say is that there needed to be better accountability &amp;better scrutiny of how the money is used. Less money in foreign country politicians hands, more on the ground NGO initiatives scrutinised by the UK. Boris' ethos is ill-placed &amp;disingenuous #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 I am a resident of the UK, how Australasia &amp;Canada conduct their affairs is for their citizens to decide. FYI We all know how Australia treats refugees on remote islands, I do not think following Australia in HUMANITARIANISM is the way to go. Accountability YES, scrapping: NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 Im afraid, when it comes to foreignAid (aimed at helping shattered countries), one cannot go into the sphere with 'what can i get from this situation' mentality. When I donate to Oxfam, I am not thinking "what will oxfam loot from Congo to give to me". The new move is regressive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KRUZAA_ Yes - @MarcusRashford has single-handedly won the argument today, Poor children will not go hungry! That is Good news. As of 14:25 - that is the only good news of the day. #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 So u are suggesting that, the time we helped Ethiopia when they had a terrible drought &amp;famine that killed 1000s of people, if there had been no 'self-interest in terms of economy &amp;finances' UK should have refused to help the people of Ethiopia? Tory Compassion hard to understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha That was what I gathered from this speech too: he on several occasions made direct comparisons such as: Why X African country, instead of X European country/ Bulkan. He was basically saying: we're done with Africa and black people. We want to spend our money on European interests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour This tweet needs to be deleted ASAP! Do not take credit that is 100/100 owed to @MarcusRashford! Dear @Keir_Starmer this plagiarism is NOT okay!   Labour was led by #MarcusRashford to push for the #maketheUturn! To now take the credit is disingenuous! Appalling @UKLabour ❌❌😤❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Is @BorisJohnson actually now arguing that UK should only help european white nations .... rather than African black nations ... I’m dead! What a government... what people the tories are! Jesus take the steering wheel 👀👀🥵🥵🥵 #BorisHasFailedUK #maketheUturn #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @MarcusRashford Honestly, yday I saw the letter he wrote to government &amp; all MPs and I couldn’t believe my eyes: #MarcusRashford was BEGGING gov: “Please feed the poorest of children” - gov minister this morning practically laughed at him. The greed and callousness in UK tories is beyond belief  https://t.co/g0FnGKlRmk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar @AyoCaesar AND a statue please. Remember how #colstonstatue was inscribed "Virtuous &amp; wise"? I think we have in 2020 found someone who is indeed virtuous &amp;Wise -its @MarcusRashford. If there was a statue commission, I would be recommending one for Marcus! He did what Keir couldnt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo He dared to speak, where politicians remained silent to not rock the boat with the government. He spoke louder and more bravely than ALL British members of Parliament (including leader of opposition: #KeirStarmer). @MarcusRashford should be an example to everyone: SPEAK UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Dare I say: if we are going to have bronze and stone statues across the UK - @MarcusRashford has shown himself to be “virtuous and wise” (words used to describe #colstonstatue) - people like Marcus are the kinds that we want future generations to remember: standing for the poor🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson It was frankly a no brainer as well. WHY should there even be a debate about whether or not children who are known to rely on government support for school meals should have those meals stopped?   Then for an MP @theresecoffey to have ridiculed @MarcusRashford - appalling&amp;callous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChappersSays @bbcnickrobinson @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey @Conservatives Okay👌🏾Chappers, thanks for your contribution.  Clearly you do not realise that there’s a character limit to a tweet, often words have to be compressed to complete a coherent &amp;complete message.   Evidently, you got the gist!  Lol, when people lose the argument, they chase grammar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresecoffey @MarcusRashford Dear @theresecoffey u claim to be passionate about supporting vulnerable children, yet the only time u engaged with @MarcusRashford tweet was to RIDICULE him &amp;the cause he is fighting so vigorously for! The only passion you ooze seems to be MarieAntoinette #maketheUturn  https://t.co/Dq24221yEq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital It’s Marie Antoinette level of contempt ! Crass, out of touch, disconnected from reality and unapologetic about it whilst at it! 😤  How working class voted for these people is beyond me... brexit was the biggest smokescreen I think I’ll see in my lifetime (I hope) #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChappersSays @bbcnickrobinson @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey @Conservatives Okay👌🏾 -once again thanks for ur contribution, CHILDREN “EATING” food- is NOT freebies in the pockets of parents.   Nevertheless, once again thanks for showing us how detach u are from reality!  Keep being you, keep your privileges to yourself.  @MarcusRashford 👏🏾 #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Of course she hasn’t. I mean let the image speak for itself. #maketheUturn  https://t.co/hJHxHNG2l6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey Yes the Nigel F clause - that might be what’s at play! I read from the Nigel crisis that VAST majority overwhelmingly disagree with Nigel farage tone and perspective, and Nick F doesn’t ride too far from Nigels angle. Perhaps trying to distance himself from cliff edge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey wow ... haha did Nick F have some sort of visitation from an angel over the last few days? This is not the Nick F I heard speaking about #BlackLivesMatter last week. Either way, sounds like he’s been touched by a holy hand. Suddenly he wants to learn/ understand/ contribute 🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey Good on Nick F. I really cannot for the life of me understand why we are in this situation? Isnt government supposed to strain every senew to ensure all its citizens are well looked after? The Tories seem only able to strain senew to aid party members from accountability🤷🏾‍♂️❌❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Can someone please confirm - is this (attached) really #Theresecoffey? #maketheUturn  https://t.co/aaepTc2qsL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey 💯🔥!! Agreed! We all need to step outside the confines of our own privilege and recognise the reality down the road, across the borough etc. I kno people on gas metres where when the last penny runs, the power TURNS OFF -quite literally! And parents gather all coins to buy £5😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey What does it for me TBH, is that he’s speaking from personal experience. I remember in secondary school when children from “certain circumstances” had to queue for a PINK token - for free school meals. It was mortifying. And there were MANY! It’s sad, we are 5th largest economy🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @MarcusRashford @theresecoffey Indeed! She can clearly see what his point was: “Please help the poor, who are struggling to keep their children nourished &amp;clean” -she responds with MarieAntoinette type of rhetoric! Honestly speaking this Tory gov has proven beyond doubt that they’re OUT of TOUCH #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @KayBurley you’re assuming she hadnt thought -what if the reality is: she thought, she found the case ridiculous: In other words “who gives 2 fingers about kids going hungry, let them eat dust if they must”.. what if that was her genuine response to @MarcusRashford? #maketheUturn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnickrobinson @MarcusRashford @bbcnickrobinson - have you seen the response this morning from @theresecoffey  regarding the meals for vulnerable children? It all seems like a massive joke for the @Conservatives party! Unbelievable arrogance, lack of insight, and total contempt for the general population❌❌❌  https://t.co/EPsxrXoRao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford We got you @MarcusRashford ! I’ll comment and retweet till the cows come home! And @theresecoffey we see 👀 your arrogant self too! #maketheUturn #MarcusRashford #COVID19 ! Whilst I’m here also, daily reminder that #BlackLivesMatter, Boris hiring a racism denier proves it all!❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABA_SecDef @piersmorgan @theresecoffey @Conservative @DavidTCDavies @ShiptonMartin @brexitparty_uk @WalesOnline I must say, it appears that u are right! This current Tory government has allowed the mask to fall. Gone are the days where Cameron could fool us all with his words into believing we were “all in this together”. Since TheresaMay it’s become apparent that we’re not together at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryQuickk @MarcusRashford It’s not “beef” - it’s point out the reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford @theresecoffey @paulwaugh Just in case @theresecoffey decides to do some retrospective editing by deleting, attached are the receipts! That ThereseMP thinks children going hungry, poor people have utilities cut off for nonpayment is a hilarious JOKE! This @Conservatives gov is callous  I swear😤❌!  https://t.co/H5WmYpqBPf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @theresecoffey Frankly @piersmorgan it is time to disconnect this whole government! Every challenge thrown at them theyre unable to handle: Pandemic - nope❌ they failed to implement #cygnus recommendations, racism crisis-❌fail, school kids with no food ❌-fail. They’re one trick pony: BREXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @darrengrimes_ “surely it would be more courageous to be overtly racist in 2020” and “this country really isn’t all that racist at all” - 2 responses: being a racist overt or otherwise is NOT acceptable and NOT courageous! Britain is qWhite racist for those who face daily racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryQuickk The emphasis being on “MIGHT”- it is not the role of MPs to sit &amp;wait for someone in public to do something then jump on it. If an MP hasnt got the strength &amp; power to galvanise people, and win a debate, then they should make way for those who can! What if @MarcusRashford hadn’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 Not going to lie @SholaMos1 you’ve been an inspiration and encouragement to me: not to just sit on fences, but to be vocally proud. I’m learning to OWN it, even if it levels Karens and Karen’s husbands scratching their heads! #BlackLivesMatter 🙋🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryQuickk The issue is @HarryQuickk , #KeirStarmer is supposed to be LEADING in challenging government policies and actions, since becoming leader of opposition, more often than not, Keir appears to show up at the scene once dust has settled, and actions taken by others! He’s not leading🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley All this hands wrapping, shield 🛡 of steel wrapping etc. The only person who has had arms wrapped around him is #DominicCummings - as for the rest, they can stop treating us alike idiots! @grantshapps #maketheUturn @MarcusRashford @piersmorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen Hahaha yeah - so in your conclusion: Churchill was not racist? Well nice for you that happens to be white, a skin tone approved by Churchill! Try being Indian or black ... or any other non white race, and let’s hear your chat. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️! What’s the term again? “Privilege”: white👍🏽👌🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Lol meanwhile - Colston statue and similar, @pritipatel wants 10 years (full force of law) for them ... didn’t see any media commentator arguing that with respect to statue toppling - 10 years, let alone 14days is too long ... we see y’all 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔❌❌ #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Is it going to be 10 years @pritipatel @BorisJohnson .... “Full force of law and order” was the key phrase a few days ago wasn’t it? .... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @Valerie3Ward Haha to be fair, good point! Although not sure how far the cannonball of that immense weight would travel! Shoot .... 1M travel.... and drop 😂😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward There should actually be a statue of these bigots with their BMI&gt;50 abdomens so that future generations can see who the defenders of racism, inequality and discrimination were and looked like! Absolute madness! If there was a war, would these bigots be able to fight for nation?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rutembessa Is this a bad joke??? Is this true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sathnam All I want right now is @KemiBadenoch explain to us how in space of 2 weeks or so, the UK has gone from apparently having “NO” issues with racism, inequality, discrimination, to “Much more to do on racism” also @BorisJohnson you’re racist, what do u intend to do bout yourself?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @DavidLammy so why is the @UKLabour intent on supporting this new Tory law that imposes 10 years....meanwhile: #Grenfell victims haven’t even received rightful rehousing, compensation or criminal justice! Even assault/ rape carries less than 10 years! Ridiculous #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewTimesRwanda What now? She washed hands 🖐🏾 in a way that kigalians on Instagram and twitter disapprove of? She didn’t use sanitizer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford Two things I want to say on this: @MarcusRashford a million times WELL DONE! You’re an inspiration &amp;example to many on how to use platform to influence POSITIVITY! 2) Where on earth are other celebrities with money and platforms? Busy with feet up, Netflix and unbothered: shame❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bencsmoke great points on @LBC .... where has this new energy been? ... law and order to oppress but relegation of duty to promote fairness and solve inequality! #BlackLivesMatter 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patosmeme @adamboultonSKY @idriselba And meanwhile #patrickhutchinson was simply only a passerby...not a police...no training on recognising end of life symptoms, not trained on recognising when police restraint was too much. But he was able to “read” the situation, he planned ahead! Hes a passerby #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY @idriselba Meanwhile as #PatrickHutchinson highlighted in London, if ANY of the police officer had been compassionate and brave and intervened, #GeorgeFloydMurder George might still be alive! Totally avoidable! But hey, where there’s racism, discrimination, hate, KKK what do we expect?🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV Just an FYI people like #patrickhutchinson continue to be victims of discrimination, prejudice &amp; racism! Which is why Patrick was out speaking out for his rights! If you want more Patricks then work to make Britain a better place for Patrick and others like him #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @mike_adama Haha - I will repeat - if you make allegations, have proof! You have no proof, so it’s time you graciously just jogged on. We’ve seen your prejudice bigotry with streaks of racism. It’s crass. Try expand on those 6months, you’ve clearly got a lot to learn and see! 🙋🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @mike_adama Lesson for the future: don’t make allegations that you have no evidence or proof for. Second, don’t claim to be antiracist whilst simultaneously engaging in prejudice and bigotry towards black people. Your 6month anecdote is grotesque. Lastly, goalpost shifting looks twatish.❌🙋🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @mike_adama In conclusion: Mr/Ms Ive got evidence hasnt actually got evidence! Despite self proclaimed deadline now having lapsed, now admits hasnt got evidence! So this character jumped on thread of bigotry, prejudice, racism towards black people. Made serious allegations, yet has no proof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP 8 hours have lapsed since you proclaimed evidence would be made available showing BLACK people raiding and looting an Indian restaurant kitchen, and then graffiti “fuckin Indian scum” - where is the long awaited receipts?  #BlackLivesMatter 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @mike_adama Your clapbacks are meaningless until you deliver those evidences that you guaranteed would be made available pertaining to: BLACK people raided DIXSA restaurant, that’s all I’m here for. Your ignorance and goalpost shifting is lost on me, so you might as well quit while ahead🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @mike_adama I think moral of this thread is: don’t jump on threads without being entirely clued up on the topic at hand! This thread with filled with prejudice and frankly racism! You jumped into the waters with a lot of words and bigoted views on black people. Your made yourself accessory🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP Moreover, this morning you said “facts to come in 8hrs” - please kindly present your facts and evidence that DIXSAs restaurant was raided and looted by BLACK people and that they wrote “fuckin Indian scum” on the wall. We continue to await the evidence! Defamation is a crime!🤷🏾‍♂️👌🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP Youll find the one person in this thread who came up with prejudiced &amp;racist statements is u. U slandered black people based on 6month excursion in LDN. I know countless of cases of Asian (India/Pakistan) who are involved with robbery, shooting, drugs, should I slander all asian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @MojitosMP @Rastravadibhakt Absolutely!! I mean can you imagine if I (whose been at uni in Birmingham for 5 years) alleged that ALL Asians are criminals? There’s a high population of Asians in Bham, CRIME is RIFE. But I’m not a twat! Criminals are NOT representative of a race! And I’m not going to slander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @MojitosMP @Rastravadibhakt Agree with @MojitosMP &amp; @mike_adama. This thread shows how easly people fall into trap. She made allegations, loads of Asians jumped on bandwagon of hate&amp;prejudice. You all showed yourself up for being ignorant &amp;prejudice by slandering all black people. Every race has criminals🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP @Dix5a Init @mike_adama -this person is beginning to be irritating, if he/she along with DIXSA are going to make serious allegations about BLACK people they need to back their chat with receipts! So far all they’ve done is be prejudiced towards black people. Bring EVIDENCE. Its easy🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a I repeat -DIXSA whom u came here to support alleged that: BLACK people raided her restaurant and went in kitchen to raid the pots&amp; pans, then they allegedly scribbled “fucking Indian scum” -we asked for evidence, u and DIXSA havent presented any. Instead you malign black people🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YaaLiaBlog @Dix5a I haven’t a clue - DIXSA and co trying to suggest black people desperate for chicken korma, and naan bread ... as if we don’t have jerk chicken, jellof rice, curry goat, african stews etc. I’m really struggling to see the motive for black people to raid an Indian🤷🏾‍♂️❌🤷🏾‍♂️ nope! 🤔❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RwandaMuseums Beautiful! 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾! Vive #rwanda !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore @pritipatel - will be “10 years” ?? After all that’s what you’ve argued protestors who disrespect monuments deserve! We look forward to seeing the outcome of this #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP For real! I never paid it too much attention, until this year, when tories tried to drag out Priti Patel as a evidence that the conservatives are very representative of “black peoples”- Hancock was asked about black representation and he said “I’m very proud of our BAME members”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama @Rastravadibhakt @MojitosMP All I can say is that the way some Asians are showing their prejudice on this thread is the same way; I find Priti Patel, Sajid etc. crocodile tears for black people (in the words of Trump) FAKENEWS! This thread evidences very very clearly that there’s very little solidarity🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanatHamiltons @KayBurley @AndrewCastle63 @LBC So theres no evidence of the “majority peaceful “ protest from the ProtectBronzeStatues brigade? The media was in full force, the protestors had their phones, and despite all that there’s no evidence? actually I have seen *some* footage of last week protest showing relative peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a By the way - we await your evidence that black people went into the kitchen of DIXSA restaurant and turned pots upside a down and graffiti  “fucking Indian scum” - you said in the foreseeable 8 or so hours! Make sure to tag me when the evidence is made available. Regards Fred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a We look forward to evidence that DIXSA restaurant was destroyed by “Black people”. whilst you spend a lot of energy maligning black people, bare in mind there are pockets of UK where Asian crime is also a problem, bring receipts of Asians robbing cars, shooting, robbing. Thanks🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @MichaelRosenYes welcome back to us! It’s great to hear you’re better! When this is all over, I’d be delighted to share a beverage of your choosing! Best wishes and stay blessed! 🙋🏽‍♂️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a Our main objective is ACCURACY &amp;JUSTICE! DIXSA maligned ALL BLACK people with crime! She has NOT presented evidence! Yet Asians have come in the thread to whip up more hate &amp;prejudice against Blacks! Do I need to shout about Asian crime in Birmingham? No bcoz Im not prejudiced❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a It’s a FACT of life that ALL people on earth are capable of criminal behaviour, for every black person who robs a shop, I can find a white, Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Latino etc who is guilty of the same crime! Nevertheless back to your &amp; DIXSA allegations: WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a Where is the evidence of DIXSA restaurant being looted, where black people went into kitchen to find pots &amp;curry sauces that they could throw on the floor. DIXSA allegation is that HER restaurant was destroyed and BLACK people graffiti “F’in Indian Scum” I want this evidence🤷🏾‍♂️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSm45963194 @KayBurley Please send us the evidence of the so called “Hunt” where black people hunted down white people. Also curious: after the chase and hunt, what did the black people do to their white people prey? In any case, I look forward to the evidence so that I can condemn it #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggierobson Excellent news! Can there be a caveat look into the Durham cottage that has 1) No planning permission (tho time for council to act has elapsed, council needs to be clear that had it been within time they would have destroyed the cottage) 2) cottage has paid NO tax all this while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rastravadibhakt @mike_adama @MojitosMP @Dix5a On a serious note, @Rastravadibhakt &amp;DIXSA you’re making very serious allegations, as you’re aware in the court of law, evidence needs to be precured! U tweet to malign ALL black people about crime, have you been to Birmingham &amp;seen Asian crime? Anyway: WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE?❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSm45963194 @KayBurley **pissing** #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennSm45963194 @KayBurley Lol...what do you want her to say?   “Marvellous racism at the protests yesterday, very proud”??  Haha -kind reminder: Racism is nothing to be proud of, uneducatedness and arrogance is nothing to be proud of, hooliganism is nothing to be proud of! Passing on memorials is shameful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyHodgson15 @KayBurley Lol - where’s the “knife” - where’s the blood? Where’s the incident report? Where’s the hospital report? ... we await the receipts! #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @KayBurley I keep hearing from some media like @AndrewCastle63 on @LBC that apparently only the “minority”’of yesterday “WhiteLivesMatter” &amp; “protectOurBronzeStatues” - I’ve only seen the vile racism and criminal behaviour. Can someone direct me to the peaceful majority? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theRealKiyosaki .... hmm sorry, what? 🤔🤔🤔. Tone deaf, stupid, less than smart tweet! #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips @BeccaaaPrincess What exactly were u trying to express? The racism on display across🇬🇧 yday is the REALITY many minorities have to walk to &amp; through when they “pop outside to go to the shops”! You really need to stop assuming &amp; instead engage and learn! Your tweet was shallow #BlackLivesMatter❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JarJarFan69 @WoobieTuesday Killing innocent people by police is DEFINITELY root of all this and is what needs to be called out. Kind reminder: there would be no protests, anger, frustration if: in USA there was parity between white and black people. Also why police kill someone in #Atlanta last night?❌🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_GraceyMae @mike_adama I’m a black male, grew up in inner London, I’ve literally NEVER heard any black person use the phrase “fucking Indian scum” -the word scum isnt even a vocab black people use! I think DIXSA needs to bring the CCTV receipts or frankly have several seats, or BLM sue her! ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dix5a ...so BLACK people entered a closed restaurant....made their way to the KITCHEN to play around with pans and crockery? Then turned some tables and chairs upside down and graffiti something which I’ve never heard black peoples say about Indians. Then kindly left windows untouched?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama Apparently she’s been blocking anyone who questions her narrative ... which makes this story a bit strange. Moreover, she is alleging that somehow #blacklivesmatter managed to enter a closed shop/ resto without breaking windows ... and WENT into the KITCHEN play with pans? 🤷🏾‍♂️😂❌  https://t.co/ODEWVNPoyf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielJHannan Facts do not care for feeling a bit awkward. The countries currently leading the world in mortality numbers are: USA, Brazil &amp; UK -they are 3 countries that recently elected so called “macho” men. It’s all been a disaster. They’re defenders of wrongdoings: public paying price🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 @Anna_Soubry This image comes to mind ....  https://t.co/sQ8hiHZC1s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTugendhat This is the kind of gaslighting we try to highlight when tories come out trying to spin narrative! Here we have a Tory stating that protestors last week fighting against racism relatively peacefully are “the same” as majority of RACISTS today. No sir, the public disagrees! ❌🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetPoliceEvents @Claire_Phipps @MetPoliceEvents  -last week the #BlackLivesMatterUK were lamented by @pritipatel @BorisJohnson and the rest of tories that people protesting for end to racism breached the guidelines on social distancing. U seem to have failed to mention the issue of social distance today. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coops_tv @KemiBadenoch Oh yeah.. what a good point! @KemiBadenoch -so called representative in govrnmnt for minorities in particular the black community- can you please tell us how scenes from today of people baited and whipped up by right wing politics (which u stand for) =best country to be black in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trickyjabs Haven’t u got the memo yet? Apparently @Keir_Starmer and his shadow cabinet are using “operation WOE Tory voters” that’s why #KeirStarmer threw #DianeAbbott, @labourlewis @DawnButlerBrent and other minorities attacked in the #Labourleaks under the bus. Mad stuff #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker speak louder for the hard of hearing🧏‍♂️ -this is what we call gaslighting, political games!  What is now clear is that politicians are the ones actively dividing the British Population. Tories labelled ALL BLM protesters as THUGS, but today racists: it’s “minority”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattLucas @RealMattLucas- its a shame that things have become so sensitive &amp; tense! I am black, I very much appreciate #littlebritain and all the spin offs. It was ALL in jest and innocent humour. It’s a shame we are where we are! But I appreciate your tweet, sentiments &amp; ur solidarity🤝🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson @BorisJohnson didnt u allege that Britain has no issue with “RACISM” now youre telling us “racist thugs” are alive &amp; well in the UK. Boris how would u react if u found out the way the racist Thugs voted? they likely voted for u, encouraged by “letter boxes/watermelon smile etc”🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Loving the deflection tweets today. They were hoping today racists would conduct themselves...despite no agitators/triggers the so called “all lives matter/ white lives matter” brigade descended into self-triggered chaos -now appaz racists are equal to #BlackLivesMatter. No sir❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreeing with @IanDunt , What we have seen today has no material or moral equivalence to the #BlackLivesMatter protests. BLM has noble cause, albeit there are small outbreaks of violence. Meanwhile today, despite no clear provocation, #WhiteLivesMatter being racist/ violent🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @symmo1969 @ScotSkye Speak yourself @JuliaHB1 - a white woman. Stop trying to speak on behalf of people who are victims of real racism! By every metric: #Stevenlawrance didn’t commit suicide, he was racially targeted and killed, many continue to experience racism &amp;discrimination. #BlackLivesMatter 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Haha - absolutely laughable this! You and your party baited your base to come out. They came out in full force to counter and “control” the #BlackLivesMatter - they progressed to pissing over memorials and shouting racist abuses. Oh and Nazi salutes! We see y’all 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveWismayer Wooow- and @pritipatel &amp; @BorisJohnson had the utter cheek to call the relatively peaceful (albeit with the odd violence) THUGS!? I’m curious to know what the @Conservatives call that: protectors of the state? Protectors of British culture and history? Really? #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonRubs @BorisJohnson @Nigel_Farage @pritipatel @BorisJohnson we see the army you chose to thrust upon us. They’re a disgrace! You should be ashamed that this is the best you’ve got! Shambles, racists, fascists! Nevertheless thanks for showing us who the Tory party is and stands for: more racism! #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zakestone @rutembessa The point is- if your cousin who lives next door to you dies.... it would be bizarre for a distant friend of friend of a friend who lives 1000s of KM away to be the first to mourn and offer condolences before you the cousin next door starts showing sorrow. Bizarre stuff kabisa🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zakestone @rutembessa Curious question: ibindi bihugu from east Africa -when did they start the half mast gesture? Because it seems #rwanda is at least 24hrs behind. Considering how similar In culture, history, ethnicity Rwanda is to Burundi, we should have been leading the way in tributes, NOT last🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @MatthewStadlen you should really provide references to the “racist views” - this poll is misleading without quotes and context. He didn’t just hold racist views, his actions lead to deaths of 1000s of people. Please educate, not further the ignorant divide in the country. Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson wasnt @pritipatel a few days ago throwing in her “I was once called a Paki” card- when called up on minimisation of #blacklivesmatter  she responded by arrogantly posting the letter to twitter to whip up her base, and here we are an article of Tory BAME not identifying with BAME<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @Caravaggio1000 @RexChapman Did you not say you were all ears for ideas? We giving you ideas, and you’re tryna clap back? We ain’t the ones trying to give a racist a pass by eluding to mental health etc. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgoodman @Caravaggio1000 @RexChapman Heres a suggestion: from this video: RECOGNISE that some of your fellow white people are GENUINE threat to innocent people, they play GAMES that KILL people who are “different to them” (non white). After recognition, become an ALLY against racism! Call out racists, seek justice🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Are people actually surprised? Have y’all never heard of “STROKE” - 2 types: ischaemic and haemorrhagic! A fall like that affecting the head is bound to damage blood vessels in the skull/brain therefore resulting in haemorrhage (bleeding) inside the brain =brain injury=paralysis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnrashton47 As The fox that almost successfully conned the population by dressing in suits, and learned how to sugarcoat his racism, so as to come across as a normal average politician. In doing so hiding his racist &amp;xenophobic past! He reminds us of Mr Fox in Beatrix Jemima puddle Duck tale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSeddon1962 So that Zimbabwe remembers who arrived, renamed their nation against their will, made THEIR culture, tradition &amp;language 2nd class. And looted the nation!

<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @afuahirsch I would like to suggest an idea, last week @IainDale did a duet with a lady @Denise__Headley, the combo proved very popular &amp; informative. Couldn’t there be a duo schedule where once a week a guest is invited to join the presenter? And main presenter should be PoC! @afuahirsch🙋🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMonehen @HackneyAbbott @UKLabour Hold on.. I’ve just watched a bit of this and had to stop early because it’s so bloody dull....BUT did @Keir_Starmer make this video primarily about himself, rather than about than the first black people elected to our parliament? Words fail me 🤷🏾‍♂️ #DianeAbbott #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 I’ll just keep dropping the receipts! Haha according to FlatSix &amp; his sacred radio stations: Congolese people BUILT a statue in 2005 for Leopold II (FakeNews), &amp; that 99%of Congolese dont care about fighting against racism (FakeNews). All from a “🇧🇪National radio +Wiki” 😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 Lol - we love a good reverse gear! You’ve forgotten to remove the hand break! Why do people build glorification statues FlatSix? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ hahaha lol - oh Lord, this is too hilarious 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelCrabbe10 @Nigel_Farage @JuliaHB1 @talkRADIO - are u content that the far right, racists see u as a safe haven for those fired for holding racist/ fascist views? Here are people who seem to think that farage should go from being sacked for racist views to bring his views to ur station? Do you approve?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleksGamertag @DaleksGamertag have you informed the police of your concerns ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 I am happy to have reasonable debates with people, but if your premise is to attempt to ridicule me, by stating “facts”‘that you’ve copied and pasted from “radio shows” and Wikipedia, I’m afraid it’s not going to go well. Racism &amp;discrimination is REAL, don’t try to minimise it❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 Well -the attached here shows YOUR original tweet very CLEARLY attempts to paint🎨 the FALACY that: Leopold was “actually” adored by the Congolese as they “built him in 2005” a statue. So you did try to whitewash Leopolds horrors as indeed statues in Belgium try to do today!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️  https://t.co/EhlsaohDnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 FlatSix u came here boasting with ur FAKEnews. Look at ur language “did you know that ACTUALLY” ... “And ACTUALLY 99% of Congolese” and you now have the cheek to start dropping the “moral high ground” statements! You need to check your arrogance before coming for me. Humility🤷🏾‍♂️🤔  https://t.co/vRWYUxfJ8C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 And with respect, just because people are hungry, &amp; desperate does not mean they forget racism! It is because of racism from a disgusting racist like Leopold that Congolese lost millions of people to hands being chopped off, starvation &amp;torture. Save us the patronising platitudes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 Well u need to try listen less to radios and do your own research and reading. And on this matter, it seems that you may need to “travel to the sun, to understand  how the Congolese sun became to be” because you seem to have soaked up one sided debates that are not 100% accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 So let’s revisit the original fakenews from a clearly uneducated man behind a screen: the Congolese BUILT in 2005 (no they didn’t), ... and the best part “99% of Congolese don’t care” for a fight against racism &amp; revisionist idiots- you’ll find you speak for 0.0% Congolese! 🙋🏽‍♂️❌  https://t.co/tDIc5SwvWi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 But “On the radio, they said” - have you ever stepped foot in Kinshasa? Kisangani? Goma? Bukavu? Lubumbashi? Kigali? Bujumbura? ... “but but but the radio and google said... “ 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 Ur tweet was NOT correct: Congolese people DID NOT build statue to Leopold! Belgium did. As soon as Belgium left Congo after decades of looting the country, in 1960, the statue was REMOVED! ONE isolated minister (NOT THE Congolese people) tried to reinstate, the PEOPLE removed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline @Radio2 You are indeed! Learn history, google is not a source! The statue existed in Leopoldville throughput Belgian colonialism of Congo- therefore it was commissioned by Belgium. It was removed after independence. 1 Congolese man minister tried to reinstate it, it lasted less than 12hr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline Hahahaha I just love when people people without accurate information or evidently historical knowledge make an idiot of themselves. Keep up the ridiculousness 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😁😁😂! Congolese black peoples apparently ‘BUILT’ a monument to Leopold. Please show us this monument alstublieft!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FltSix @Lowkey0nline Lol ... the Congolese people, used their hands to build a statue saying “thanks Leopold!” - hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😁🤣! That’s a new one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__N_A_J__ @FINALLEVEL @TracyAnnO And her departure out of #eastenders was when her on screen husband, Den, murdered her. It was not a gracious or reputable exit from the show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toadmeister Hahhha oh man I love it: “when is the Conservative party going to start conserving slavery ideology and everything akin to glorification of slave masters” at least they’re honest! Over to you @BorisJohnson @pritipatel - get preserving! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😁🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lowkey0nline As well as stealing equivalent of $1.1billion, #LeopoldII also stole MILLIONS of Congolese (black African LIVES) through torture, starvation and more. Meanwhile Belgium went and built a statue that says “The Congolese are grateful for his love and liberation” #blacklivesmatter ❌  https://t.co/TLxemQWqpw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @UKLabour I note that 2020 is not the first time #blacklivesmatter have protested in London or USA, during the years where there was no evident damage to tour political party or ideology you remained mute🤐, ur contribution in 2020 im afraid seems disingenuous. We don’t need ur pity now.🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zakestone Batubarize rwose🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonRubs It’s Right wingers trying to belittle the fight against racism and simultaneously trying to influence their audience and followers. They want to make BLM appear to be an affront to mainstream right wing/ conservative ideal of liberty. They want to use imagery to divide society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidOlusoga They not bothered abt an equal society. They want to preserve the entitlement to supremacy. They want to retain the “Piss off back to Africa” xenophobic cards. They do not care about suffering &amp;trauma endured by minorities (esp black)-lastly theyre simply racist #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKentish highest mortality, worst PPE scandal, failure to ensure care homes protected is symptomatic of having political ideology that believes &amp;pushes for deregulation, dismantling in the end you lose coordination. These political+science meetings failed to bring on board health experts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soniasodha They argue that “its erasing history”- they fail to point out that what is proposed isnt “obliteration” of statue but rather relocation to museum where indeed more people can learn about #RhodesMustFall. Also the analysis of a white coloniser by white people to black ppl is wow🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Lol - okay..... hmm ... elephant in the room..... horses being startled at protests, fight for equality and against racism.... nope not registering??...... okay: Let's Stay Still I guess.😂🤣😂😅🤷‍♂️#blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gabrielquotes Thank u @gabrielquotes! There are some people trying to pitch black people vs Jewish people.

<|startoftext|>@DavidHarewood Isnt it ironic that when #Bristol pulled down the statue to glorified slaver master, British apathetic middle class pearl clutchers screamed “OMG criminal, oh God our amazing history” yet Bristol has inspired Belgium, other British cities to reconsider the insult of these statues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 @TheSDPUK Lol “hateful ideology” behind a congregation of multi racial people asking the country to 1) ensure there is genuine PARITY between all British citizens, 2) stop discrimination &amp; racism towards black peoples 3) stop glorifying beneficiaries of slavery!

<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Why do we have to argue about whether or not “racism is bad” and whether we need to make reforms and changes to make the UK GENUINELY inclusive? We have certain ideologies (right wing) getting PISSED off 😤, that BLM is saying “Hey stop treating us shit, plz reform” it’s madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Exactly, this is why we are where we are, protestors upping up the ante with more and more radical deeds- its the classic evolution of protests. Presumably you’ve read up on things like suffragettes etc? Start with hunger strike, next throw self at kings horse, smash property etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC As I said before, I think everyone is naively giving government and politicians a major pass by only focusing on the protestors! BLM and their supports are trying to engage with law makers/ policy makers etc (government/parliament) but the latter are deliberately playing deaf🔕🔇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Burning flags to me suggests whoever is doing it has RUN OUT of ways of ways making politicians listen! It’s the same as middle finger to a parent.

<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Agreed -though personally, over last few months Ive been doing a lot of mindfulness and Ive started to learn to detach from symbolisms.

<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC This sadly will end up like the Yellow Vest stuff in France, people start of asking for change, governments play deaf... then the only to be heard is to shout louder, become more radical. I am angry at the violence, but we need to recognise political inaction =raised anger levels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC I understand ur point here, its valid, I too am growing frustrated with the 'trench mentality'. But I think at time of heightened emotions for reasons we know: GeorgeFloyd, telling black ppl: dont remove statue of someone who purged your ancestors as start of rebuttal -not ideal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC 5/ The solutions can only be achieved if we are all prepared to have grown up convos: black ppl are overwhelmingly not seeking revenge but rather PARITY: in treatment, opportunities &amp;protection. Also black ppl tired of havin their history whitewashed/tippexed by ex-colonials<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC 4/ The protests are getting out of control precisely because politicians have been cowards. Theyre hiding from the crisis because they KNOW the cause of the symptoms. The protests are symptoms of underlying cancer: deep rooted racism, superiority, &amp; shameful colonial history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC 3/ I disagree that the demands are non-negotiable- who has offered to sit and negotiate? Trump rather than negotiate tried to order the military to bomb its own citizens- thats not negotiating. In UK, Tories think burying heads and pretend nothing is happening is a solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC 2/ I will admit, USA cause for BLM is genuine, its strong, and there is immense every day evidence of discrimination &amp; racism towards black people - for heavens sake KKK is still permissible &amp;functioning in USA. However, UK (western world at large) is not free of racism neither<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Thanks for engaging (rarity nowadays). Issue is the sheer deliberate/naive perception by many non-black people: that racism is minor/exaggerated. Thus everyday we're seeing whataboutery dismissive nonsense. When BLM say theres racism: white ppl: NONSENSE, but Priti P says it:😰😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlStewartOBE @bobdylan Defenders of keeping the statues keeping arguing “lets not erase history” they either deliberately or naively fail to see that the purpose of the statues WAS/IS INDEED to erase history. When the statues were erected they didn’t say “slave master and murderer of black peoples”🤷🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama I do not understand - did it take 27 years for all the facts to emerge? or was the police/ justice department just very incompetent? He needs to sue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC They're not cancelled either. Lol - Prince Philip and the Queen and their families can do whatever they wish for his 99th birthday. I wish him a glorious day of celebrations and joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarcyOBree @AvaSantina I wondered because, you have extremely polarised views - I cannot imagine James O'Brien and his team genuinely sharing banter, coffee breaks etc. with team xenophobia Nigel farage. And frankly, I don't know if he could stomach N Ferrari for significant length of time. 🤢🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_queazy_ @JamesMartinSJ @yashar How does this change fact he was: 1) Pushed 2) fractured his skull as a consequence of the fall 3) He's stable in serious condition with brain damage? Which makes the action of the police men who pushed him - Criminal? #Blacklivesmatter #MartinGugino #GeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeforJabba @LBC Who said they were cancelled? lol - you need to get a grip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital @RedRadicals @BarristerSecret I might be making a phone call with that reference given above. WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Probably guido fawkes or people akin to him and his associates ..... 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Hmm in case I’ve misunderstood - is this supposed to be some sort of “to be fair apparently slaves were actually qwhite content in their slavery - some slave masters were rather jolly and charming to their property?” @afneil ? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔 #BlackLivesMatter 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Haha😂-I do love the attempt to subdue and dilute the current media attention -Boris and his strategists in the PR room: how about invoking royal family? Hmm a picture of the queen and Prince Philip? We tried the queen on a horse last week, let’s add a layer🤷🏾‍♂️ #blackLivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwest Youre feeling “despair” for 1)a bronze object 2)An idol of racist slave master? There are bigger things to despair about- such as we invited railway, yet we now have one of Europe’s shi**est rail network, inequality plagues our nation, elites refuse to teach accurate history etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallGradyT Welcome to the “out of trenches” UK. Our politics are so polarised, the political elites play on our anxieties (both sides) to drive wedge between us all. I left conservatives in Dec19, I was then able to see so much wrong in our country, Id been blind to it previously. Kudos🙋🏽‍♂️💪🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvaSantina Can I ask a curious question? here goes: seeing at #LBC they have different commentators &amp; each has its own production team, O’Brien (legend), then u have borderline racists Farage, right wing Ferrari etc. How much interaction &amp; camaraderie exists between the different teams? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramaisibo He must have had underlying medical conditions though? Heart attacks do not happen just like that ... well they can do, but it’s extremely rare ... in any case, Interesting times in Burundi.. that vote they had to increase his post presidency wealth and build him a house? Wasted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @Nigel_Farage et al would been the 1st to tear them down &amp; chuck them down the Thames! Brexit, #Covid_19, #GeorgeFloyd &amp; #BlackLivesMatter have really unmasked the racism/ white supremacy/entitlement &amp;rewriting of history by white bigots! Hitler is bad, but Slave masters are fab?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonClarkeMP @IrvineWelsh @SimonClarkeMP -thanks for trying to whitewash black people lived experiences! For ur info where colonisers left evidence of slavery&amp; torture: Africa kept them as reminder of the suffering Europeans inflected on them. But you expect us to bow to statues of racists? Slave masters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_adama Agreed, the time to show solidarity to black peoples by @Keir_Starmer and @AngelaRayner was when the #LabourLeaks report came out showing coordinated chronic racism, discrimination towards black labour MPs, that was the litmus test. Keir&amp;Rayner - failed the test with A*+ -bye❌🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Dear right wing/tories et, A Democratically elected mayor of LDN @SadiqKhan is not equivalent to racist slave masters who chained millions of Africans, marched them to ports &amp; shipped them to Americas for a life of abuse, exploitation, massacre. Thanks 4 showing us you’re racists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWDixon @BBCNews Comedy and satire is definitely not equivalent to glorification of racists and slave masters ... I support #blacklivesmatter - but on this #littlebritain malarkey - I’m a bit baffled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apeincage @leonsquire81 @KayBurley @pritipatel @DawnButlerBrent They want to deflect but they their deflection shows the utter ignorance! About stupidity! If you think Windrush deportations is so bad, why vote for party that created it, enforced it and made people suffer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennypugh5C @JackJDees @AvaSantina @pritipatel All the above shows the country problems of discrimination, inequality, racism etc that the government needs to deal with. The longer they keep their heads in the sand hoping that it all goes away, the worse things are going to get! That’s all I can say to be frank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatives @pritipatel @pritipatel thnks for sharing ur story yday about racism.

<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital When you get through tell them you need transfer to West Yorkshire! I’ve done it before and they can transfer.. also if anyone answers make sure to mention “I’m calling to raise concern about someone’s welfare” those are golden words that trigger specific pathways🤝🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Oh ...well I’d call anyway so that there’s been a record that “someone raised concern” police have to act and follow up whenever there’s a raising concern communication. Also it means that from behind the door police can say “someone you may know Alex Tiffin ... it calms him down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital You should maybe just call 101 and ask to be redirected to wet Yorkshire and ask police to check the address ... that’s what I’d do, but since you know some background it would just be easier more direct and accurate if you called. The police can pop round to his and check on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Oh dear I’m not in the area, but he should really avoid posting his address on twitter... if you’re familiar with him, can you not DM him? Calm him down? Have you his number etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Is this serious ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Lol ... one minute Iain Dale be like “ahh. Hmm Denise you were great, perhaps it would be interesting if media was more representative😇🤣🤝 “..  Next minute when Iain reminded of lack of diversity in media and whether he’d compromise himself =😡🤬🤬😤😤 muppets of the day? 😂WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrespresso What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennypugh5C @AvaSantina @pritipatel Okay Jennifer C Pugh - move on please. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @Nigel_Farage the picture u have posted literally does ur buddy #trump no favours. It basically looks like: 1) Do u want to be compassionate, understanding, empathetic to the death of a black man who was unlawfully killed... or 2) Do you want to be moron, that needs police state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Ciao! Good chatting to you! See you soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets For sure mate!! I love Belgium. I consider it my second home. I've followed you, follow back. (are you flanders/ Wallonie? - as soon as covid19 is over, i am coming to see family and friends (you included) 💪💪👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets And mate, I think finally I feel like you get me, this has honestly made me😊. We are not asking for revenge, we are not asking for 'death to europe' or anything radical/crazy. We just want recognition of why things are the way they are. &amp; Stop the racism, we're human. Be an ally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets What Im saying is: lets do what u&amp; I have done today, lets be HONEST, stop smokescreening truth with "well it was a long time ago, focus on today" (today we STILL face racism/discrimination/lower career opportunities etc). Lets acknowledge truth, and learn t move on in solidarty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Im sorry mate, its sad that we have to argue and shout to make each other understand our pain. What you went through sounds terrible, but please understand the pain we feel when we see these propaganda statues. To a congolese those statue= middle finger. there's no perfect answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Technically it would be back to the Slave trade. But, black people have given up on the 'compensate us' argument. We just want an end to racism, treat us as equals, AND please when u say Fuck off back to ur country: recognise the privilege and the irony of the racism/xenophobia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire Indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets At least all u had to worry about was 'being the other nationality &amp;never part of a group. Africans were: being captured, chained, taken to a rainforest to harvest rubber, if they didnt beg the tree to bleed fast enough, they had their hands chopped off. Try being them for a day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Also, according to u, if Belgium was already built, and didnt need Africa, please return the wealth you stole. Africa will very much appreciate the return of its massacred men, women, children and raw materials. I mean, if it was already built, why did ur king bother killing us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Go gaslight someone else. You stated that Leopold was the great builder, but now u tell me the Romans were the great builders... Which one is it🤣? Also I also studied in Gent, Leopold was NOT on the curriculum in the details that need to be taught. We werent born last night🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson This AM u gaslighted minority groups, mainly black ppl, that Britain is NOT a racist nation. Now you're telling us we need to lawfully defeat RACISM &amp;discrimination. This doesnt make sense. Also Priti Patel/Sunak/Braverman/Sajid etc do NOT represent Black people #Blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets And if that’s too hard/ much for you accept - it therefore reveals you’re proud of your kings racism, and wealth begotten from racism. You might as well fly a flag and say “hey I’m a racist” because if a statue of a racist is that important to you, you’re a racism sympathiser🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Lol you’re really not getting are you? 1) Remove statues glorifying racist monster - Leopold is one of those, 2) teach the truth about Leopold in schools (that’s NOT done, I’ve lived in Belgium), 3) learn that Belgium built itself via racism 4) stop being racist bigots! Easy 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Where did I say Belgians should bomb every church, every railway station, every building? The discussion here is glorification of statues!  And you literally implied “despite the evil, Belgians want to keep his STATUES up because they view him as a builder king” - bizarre 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Haha okay...I’m done! Y’all enjoy glorifying and bending over for ur ex racist king👑!  What a time and world to be alive🤭.   Rejoice all, he was a racist monster, but hey he built a nice looking building with marble he stole, gold he stole, rubber he stole🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️👏🏾👏🏾!   Speechless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets My good god- Leopold was the builder king... where do u think he got the wealth &amp; resources to do it?..... ardennes forest? ... I mean can you even recognise the irony here!?   Nazis also  built! Stalin also built, Mao also built... how do western countries view These characters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystalball Haha I love (not) the way they’ve tried to gaslight and masquerade by adding the African print scarves 🧣... for anyone falling for this charades - you’re a fool and good luck with your gullibility! For everyone else seeing through this: 👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾💪🏾! What nonsense! #blacklivesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @th5713 @JJHTweets Im pleased u accept that conquers, despite evil doings, find ways to escape responsibility. We see it also. What we don’t want on top is the cherry on cake which is: not only did we conquer and absolutely f**k you over, to twist the knife further, we’re going to put up statues❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets I’ve come to realise over last few years- that where black people went wrong (&amp; continue to go wrong today) is that we allow others to write our history! Slavery is taught from European textbooks, colonialism is taught from European textbooks. We are just there sleeping 😴🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets The answer is damn simple: Hitler &amp;the Nazi regime were ABSOLUTE monsters! Satan on earth- they killed Jewish people with impunity and no regard for consequences and stole their wealth. Meanwhile, “soz black people Europeans F’d you, but we want statues regardless of your trauma”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets Exactly, mate don’t let anyone twist your instinct on this matter. There’s a double standard that they need to explain to us first: theyre trying to convince us: “its history, its there as a reminder, bla bla bla” .. well please explain why there are no statues of Hitler?🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorbynistaTeen 🙋🏽‍♂️ me !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Annaj9267 @Sathnam @pritipatel Anna Jordan - jog on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJDees @AvaSantina @pritipatel Who minimised the police officers accident? At lease she’s alive. Where’s #GeorgeFlyo? Where’s #AhmaudAubrey ? Where’s Steven Lawrence et al? Theyre DEAD! So pardon me for expecting Priti Patel to show her absolute solidarity to victims of abhorrent racism! Don’t minimise them!🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets 3/3 place Leopold in history books, place Hitler in history books, place slavery billionaires in history books - but not squares! For heavens sake Edward Colston statue has a plaque saying “virtuous and wise” he was being GLORIFIED- Not SHAMED! He’s not even in history books! 🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets 2/3 there seems to be a very peculiar pattern, deplorables and monsters that did harm to Europeans are confined to history books BUT NOT public squares or gardens, but “pioneers” who committed their abuses in far away empires enriching Europe as result  are given statues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th5713 @CedricBallestri @JJHTweets 1/ 2 I disagree. As far as I am concerned the same way there’s NO reason whatsoever for Hitler or any nazi having a statue placed in middle of a square in Germany or LDN, there should be none for these other deplorable people! Teach the history YES, glorification statues: NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultinay @harriepw @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner I understand his dilemma, but he needs to learn to call a spade a spade! Is it appropriate for UK to continue to glorfy slave masters who made millions from chaining 40,000 black people, marched them to a port, shipped them, threw 1000s overboard, sold many to murderers &amp;abusers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harriepw He shouldnt even have to read the room, he should be able to comprehend the issue &amp; respond appropriately. His response is disappointing and in light of the way @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner dealt with #Labourleaks -this is hugely disappointing and shows they do NOT appear to care!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @JJHTweets But you know that 1) they don’t have the same opportunities and 2) it’s a constant reminder of hate, abuse, discrimination - and when you compound it with fact racism still exists -its worse. How do u think a Jew would feel if Hitler had a statue with added antisemitism on top?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire Lol “im completely wrong?” U havent a clue. Please don’t speak for black people when you’re clearly not one and not getting the issue of injustice that persists despite what MLK and likes of Mandela fought for! Those left being are having to go back on streets to ask same Demands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @JJHTweets Your comments are all well and good! But i find all this “well its history we can’t change anything “ really dismissive. Sometimes you need to remove yourself from your position of privilege and think about those affected! How do u think Congolese feel seeing Leo everywhere? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @JJHTweets Moreover, there had been requests by Bristolians for the statue to be PEACEFULLY removed &amp;placed in museum, local council dragged its feet and essentially blocked the proposal! If they want to preserve history: TEACH history fully, not cherrypicked glorifying elements of history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @JJHTweets statue of #EdwardColston had engraving that said “virtuous &amp; wise” -he was not virtuous &amp;showed no philanthropy to the 40,000+ black people that he chained up, shipped, threw overboard, sold for slave labour, abuse &amp; murder! How many Nazi autobahn pioneer statues does GMY have?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvaSantina If ur @pritipatel &amp; seemingly a member of tory party u can. When things are peaceful &amp; not disturbing their afternoon tea, they couldnt care less about a knee to the neck of a black man... but dear God, a chestnut horse being startled, a slavery statue torn down? Hold my pearls🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emtravelodge @gabrielquotes Thanks for this. Please teach them something, because they’re trying to gaslight us with very sensitive historical comparisons, for understandable reasons we don’t want to cross the line. But to black persons seeing statues of people who chained, shipped, sold+killed us =❌🙅🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarajaneoreilly They reply with “well we have a proud BAME cohort that we’re extremely proud... such as .... hmm priti Patel, sunak (billionaire), Suella Braverman, Sajid.... cleverly... etc... you see we have a good diversity in thoughts and ideas... “   🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivienn34776861 @SuzanneEvans1 @metpoliceuk Mr/ Miss speak your mind, you’ve spoken your mind, ive spoken mine. Keep it moving! Bye 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerPoppy @adilray @LBC Lol .... hmm apparently he’s actually been a racist borderline fascist since quite young. Spare us the fakery and sugarcoating.  https://t.co/yraSxU59Mf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneEvans1 @metpoliceuk Clutch them pearls lady, clutch them real hard. Its incredibly astonishing how thoroughly smitten with slave masters, evil doers, statues, running startled horses etc. some people are in this nation. Whilst they cannot show same clutching pearl energy when a man is kneed to death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire For as long as racism remains a thing (which it is today) these intermittent outpourings will periodically happen. Equality and parity is not an impossible ask, the failure of governments to respond with appropriate solutions is the problem, in my opinion. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire Moreover, I blame a lot of this on governments who fail to respond in appropriate time; if they think “keep silent it will all go away like a miracle” they’ve got another thing coming. Trump’s response was unleash the military (stupid). UK: keep🤐, it’ll just disappear (naive)🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire You entirely fail to recognise why they’re protesting in first place. Point is: We shouldn’t even be in this situation where a particular race has to beg for equality. MLK/ Mandela did that. We’d said then that we were going to change, we haven’t. That’s the problem. Not nike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire You need to get a life. Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nekocfc43 @Fox_Claire Right .... unleash military on American citizens? People say no. Spartacus: Marxist drone, Lenin, Hitler, mao, Stalin 😤😤... how utterly bizarre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire If u really feel that my tweet is going to ignite tensions, cause civil unrest and cause fatality -then u'd not be wrong in banning it. Moreover, he resigned &amp; acknowledges his own shortcoming in choosing to publish it. It was not essential breaking news, there was no need for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricBallestri @JJHTweets Nonsense, first of all, if black people were treated equally and not constantly discriminated by racists and their plight minimised by voices like yours, we wouldn’t even be in this situ! As long as RACISM exists, then history of racism towards black (slavery) will be revisited🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox_Claire @Fox_Claire  Everyone has a right to an opinion; not every opinion should be amplified. Especially not in times like this. Amplifying materials that risk creating a powderkeg that could explode in major tensions and fatalities is IRRESPONSIBLE. Theres no deference for this really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent I understand the tories clutched their pearls yesterday and males like @darrengrimes_ called trafficlights “radical left” when a police officer was physically manhandled by a traffic light: because a chestnut horse was startled! But they’re clutching pearls for a slave masters?🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire I understand the tories clutched their pearls yesterday and males like @darrengrimes_ called trafficlights “radical left” when a police officer was physically manhandled by a traffic light: because a chestnut horse was startled!

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Wow - well done @piersmorgan ...📣 for all the xenophobes, racists, 🔔ends, monsters who followed Piers because he seemed to hate #MeghanAndHarry and other progressive ideas (who felt like he was echoing their xenophobic inner thoughts) he’s asked you all to piss off! BYE! 🤷🏾‍♂️😂👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock I’m relying a lot on speaking to friends &amp; family from back home in London! Obviously with lockdown I’ve been stuck here since February. Its HARD! Of course they’ll come to me and talk about random stuff like “omg have you seen such and such a meme doing the rounds” I’m like😳🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maria4CarmsEast Becoz back then, white people were proud of their legacy! They were proud that theyd build so much and gotten so much (spices, commodities etc). Perhaps the people who never left the island had no clue WHO had worked for the wealth, it was BLACK peoples! Used &amp;Abused: elites knew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock I definitely do! I’m a medic in West Midlands, for last 2 weeks despite all that’s been on media - NONE of my white colleagues have even bothered to be like “Fred, mate on the news it’s crazy what do you think?” - they all just skate around me as if nothing is going on! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linm_linm @Michael_Heaver I’ve already said previously I personally do not condone tearing down things, so you already know i prefer things to be done in a “disciplined” manner. Im trying to explain to you why sentiments are high 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linm_linm @Michael_Heaver In any case characters who WERE “pioneers”’in things that we now deem to be historically WRONG there’s debate whether its inappropriate to keep worshipping them. To black peoples hes a reminder of an abhorrent history. Same way a Nazi statue would be wrong to Jews. Slavery was ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blezza4 @CatObbard @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock Youre Albanian European- i don’t know what Albanians class themselves as in terms of race. It’s not the “Albania” part that makes you a minority. With that argument you want mainstream white people to argue “well I’m German what do I fall under”🤷🏾‍♂️.Not sure what you’re looking for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linm_linm @Michael_Heaver Im guessing its the “slave trader” element that’s got people going mental? To be honest Ive got no strong feelings either way! I dont believe in tearing down stuff. There are debates to be had in a disciplined way about whether certain relics are appropriate etc. But not this way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_Heaver Who was Edward Colston again? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤔🤔🤔? #BlackLivesMatter #Bristol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock Ur right! And this actually highlights the very point of the #BlackLivesMatter movement in UK, the racism in this country stinks to hell &amp; back, but it’s just not as violent as the American version! Argh😤-I’m so cross and sad at where we are! MLK, Mandela etc will all be turning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock it’s infuriating! I really dont understand how they (media) think theyre being balanced!? James O- I’ll listen to him tearing brexit &amp; farage apart, but when it comes to BLM, soz but nah, Im good! We must surely have black well spoken people in media? Why can’t they get platform?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thommo25302279 @Bobmill87294270 @ChevvyAmy @Sathnam @pritipatel No one is telling you how to think. You’ve got a brain, think for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock Sometimes all we want is for a contributor to speak from a position of experience...instead we get NFarage, NFerrari, IDale, Shelagh, APierce, JObrien, TomS etc on LBC telling us what they think black people must be “thinking”, then they cast their judgement, next day- same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blezza4 @CatObbard @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock They’ve never been included in BAME because they’re often given their rightful strength in meaning. Jews aren’t lumped in BAME, nor are gipsies, nor are Romas - most nonwhite minorities retain their independent labels. But everyone else is lumped into BAME chestbox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Mokey76 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock @RidgeOnSunday Irony about Patel and Suella Braverman et al, they’re Asians who were refugees from east Africa where their parents dominated BLACK peoples in their own homes! So pardon me if I find Hancock throwing Priti out as champion for black peoples heavily insulting!🤷🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️❌❌! Distasteful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfromleft Big up big up Views From The Left haha - not sure what the name is, but I like this picture. Also the look of “I’m tired, why am I having to do this in 2020” is particularly resonating! We are exacerbated! We shouldn’t have to rerun MLK days, or African independence movements🙅🏾‍♂️❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock This is another issue that black peoples (and minorities generally) face: we have NO representation in the media. I often listen to LBC, but during this BLM issue I’ve had to turn off: the debates are being had from “white male” perspectives! They DO NOT GET IT! Never will!🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock No I’m finding this fascinating and helpful actually. It’s interesting. And you’re totally right, when they invite a Caribbean black person as representative, I’m also like ... well no! Im 1st generation African, most Jamaicans are 2gen+ British. The struggles are different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespondaDan @Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock Gosh! That’s infuriating. It’s most like you were just forgotten... not white but also not even part of then minorities! Yeah it’s a dead term! Never using it again to be honest ❌❌🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson @CorbynistaTeen posted a tweet apologising for that tweet thanks! At least tag him so that he may respond rather than just throw him and his tweet as bait to your followers. He and many people who took the mick last night apologised or explained their words/ tweet! Don’t twist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock @Louise243 thank you for creating a table for this discussion. I think it’s been quite interesting to see what other black and Asians communities think. Going forward I’ll defo be side-eyeing whenever I hear the term BAME used lol. Defo not a fan after Hancock tried to manipulate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespondaDan @Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock Exactly, we know who we are: we are brown/black etc. We are proud of that heritage...we really do not need our genetics to be condensed into a tin called BAME. All I can say is that today has been revealing. Tories are not competent to govern. We’re just some tins to them🤨🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClinicallyLuxe @mike_adama Tick boxed into BAME- i shall hence never use the term BAME &amp;will actually consider it offensive &amp; inaccurate! Sunak, Priti, Sajid, Nadhim, all the Asians that Hancock felt SAFE to list in response to a question about black peoples in cabinet have nothing in common with black ppl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmarSwanson15 @Louise243 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock I agree with this 💯! Put it this way: no actual minority person uses the term BAME to describe themselves. It’s the media that we see doing it. We know we are black/ Indian/ Pakistani/ chinese/ Japanese etc. It’s not a taboo to just say “black people” we KNOW we are black🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise243 @OmarSwanson15 @Nadine_Writes @SophyRidgeSky @MattHancock The one word I think black peoples in UK find offensive is the term “coloured” or people of colour. We just need to sometimes just say “black people”’or at least “people of African/ Caribbean heritage” -BAME is too vague, “of colour” is odd and generally not accepted by black ppl<|endoftext|>
