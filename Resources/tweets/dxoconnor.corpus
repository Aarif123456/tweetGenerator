<|startoftext|>@LightsOutFX Everytime I find a good show it gets canceled.   Lights out was really good, could've been great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boston. Nothing better than watching a basketball player flop and get NO CALL. Looks like a chump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orlando needs to play more D and less O.  Too soft, not a contender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brandon Bass is the man. A tough player on a soft Orlando team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orlando has no killer instinct. When they are up they don't put teams away. They slow down and let teams hang around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orlando. Derek Flopper just took a flop away from the ball? The true heart of a champion on display!  Nothing says heart like falling down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Celtics/Lakers: Nate got hit on the hand after that 3 pointer but I guess his green is camo and the ref couldn't see him....<|endoftext|>
