<|startoftext|>“no place in a decent society” 😭 acting like they committed a crime omg it’s KPOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/wF6g7GjpU2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve had this before with some kind of E number or colouring or smth so I think it’s that again cause I had 2 things today that could contain that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bruh I think I’m having an allergic reaction rn 🤡 it’s nothing serious but I’m about to go to sleep and my body won’t stop itching ewwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyManHoseok exactly, and people focus on the parts of the bible that tell you what NOT to do instead of what TO do. redemption is something that it so important in the bible and this man redeemed himself and yet these people celebrate his death while claiming to be faithful to God<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyManHoseok the bible is against the idea of “eye for an eye” and yet they preach religion and faithfulness to God. it’s pure hypocrisy. they’ll wake up tomorrow and realise they feel no better. I wonder when was the last time they read and truly understood the bible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viktorioes also during his time in jail he has shown remorse for his actions, been a model prisoner and helped other prisoners to turn their lives around. he was only 18 when the crime happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viktorioes a man named Brandon Bernard was just executed for the m*rder of two people in 1999, but he didn’t commit the m*rder he was an accomplice and the trial was seriously flawed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>two deaths are not solved by another death and they seriously think God is on their side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of course they thanked trump too... honestly? fuck them also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pokevillain if you use your hyperfixations to cope then please go to a priv account or do so away from social media since people are trying to spread life saving information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25HINee_ it confuses me how “love thy neighbour” is suddenly ignored when thy neighbour is lgbt... the messages of love in the bible are the most important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSnatchedMe people speaking up on injustices that black people face is not ignoring the injustices that other poc face. the fact that you’re saying that people caring about black lives means that they don’t care about Asian lives shows there’s something wrong with you, not other people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSnatchedMe how racist and insensitive can you be? you make me sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you can tweet bullshit like this but you can’t save a good man’s life. fuck you and everything you stand for. I hope you suffer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>black moots please take some time to yourself and get off social media if you need to, take care of yourselves, I’m so sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so many people have died at the hands of trump and his administration. the fact that he managed to GAIN voters this year is absolutely fucking despicable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trump, all members of his administration and everyone who worked on his campaign all have a one way ticket to the deepest fiery depths of hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sick to my stomach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>end the death penalty. no one should die at the hands of the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fuck there’s no fucking way you have to be kidding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want candy rn but I’m too lazy to go to the store 💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vminnieh anyway I’m going to bed rn idk if I’ll keep replying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh take a look at the replies and maybe it’ll help you to figure out that op’s intention wasn’t just to talk about stats lmao especially since they put bts in a different category to kpop but that’s another conversation 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>is committing vandalism to promote ikon a good option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh who said I’m pressed lmao 😭 they’re trying to use the fact that BTS have western validation as a clapback when it literally doesn’t matter and you’re trying to constantly bring up achievements when I don’t care... yall care about what Americans think way too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh lmao you do realise that tweet was in response to some twitter argument between armys and other stans right? that this was literally intended as a clapback or smth? they could’ve said anything about bts’s music as a clapback but instead they’re talking about charts 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh if you read my tweet that way then that’s on you and your poor reading comprehension lmao. you don’t need to constantly prove my point by bringing up achievements in every reply btw I know it’s the only reply you can think of it’s ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh says the person who’s shooting for op when they would throw skz under the bus at a moments notice 💀 also talking about “my idols” when we both stan skz?? think before you tweet unless you wanna say ur own favs have no achievements??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh I quote rted no one asked you to read it or type out two whole replies 😭 thank you for taking time out of your day to focus on me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh you can keep your western validation I don’t want it lmao. talking about starting shit when you’re the one hopping into my mentions when I’m just minding my business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminnieh thank you for proving my point ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loveofdivine and don’t doubt yourself either! that’s usually where I slip up, sometimes I even start doubting before my intuition has had a chance to drop a hint, it’s important to remain calm and trust yourself as much as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loveofdivine I’ve done it a few times but pretty much only for multiple choice or non complicated questions, I just try to zone out and focus on my intuition and I pick the first thing that jumps out at me. doesn’t always work but it’s had a decent success rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cw // appetite  my appetite has been GONE for several weeks but this evening it just suddenly returned and now I’m really hungry every couple of hours my days lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loveofdivine why and how do you always hit the nail on the head omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>some of these people only stan for their numbers and it shows... western validation and charts are meaningless when the music is good. bts’s music is good. let’s focus on that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what are yall trying to prove? that ur xenophobic? huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SHINEE WITH THEIR OWN TWITTER TOPIC? YALL???  https://t.co/YflRgwR0qP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGUSTDCLT @SuzanneFathy @rawnak_asma @misaisgay BTS paved the way for kpop in the west* BTS had a huge impact on kpop’s popularity particularly in the west, kpop was already popular within asia before BTS and was already gaining popularity internationally but BTS changed the game and quick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zaroskaaa I’m not black so I can’t really speak on whether that makes him racist or not, but he also has a history of racist / very problematic tweets. make of that what you will  https://t.co/O8nyUwWFIQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petahgriffen @Sar0yr0y I like the way you proved op’s point here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zaroskaaa he said that his original tweet wasn’t about human rights and that makes sense since he’s talked about fans asking him to use social media before, but instead of apologising for the bad timing of that tweet he went on a rant... it made the problem worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zaroskaaa I think the main issue is not the original tweet but the tweets that came after it. the tweets afterwards were more directly referencing BLM and he tried to have a discussion on mh to distract from the whole issue. it’s the fact that he can use his platform for mh but not for blm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>just found out sylvanian families are called calico critters in the USA. wtf is that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you wouldn’t tell everyone “yeah I have cancer ❤️” without seeing a doctor, self diagnosis is bad lmao but recognising you have symptoms of something that may be a mental illness is not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way I’m not excited for christmas at all rn :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon if even doctors struggle to diagnose neurodiverse and neuroatypical people correctly then a few google searches by someone who hasn’t trained to be a psychologist or doctor may not be able to accurately diagnose either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon mental illness is tricky to self diagnose because many symptoms of one mental illness overlap with another. my sister has a sensory processing disorder but even now doctors &amp; my family are questioning whether it’s autism or she has both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon doctors won’t always get things right, especially if you’re a woman or POC. I don’t entirely trust doctors to give me the correct diagnosis, but if I have a hunch I have an illness, I say that for what it is: a hunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon there is very much a difference between telling people “I have this illness” compared to “I think I might have this illness.” I’m assuming that you didn’t go around telling everyone that you for sure have cancer before you had a doctor’s diagnosis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon you can think you have the flu and a doctor can confirm that for you, doesn’t mean you have the same expertise as someone who’s trained for years to work in that field. again it’s perfectly fine to have a hunch you have a mental illness but to outright say you have it? nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoyalPolyplex @Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon I mean that mental health issues can be as debilitating as physical health issues. I’m not talking about the technicalities.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@karinacunty @POVLIXIES the other artists who sang the song also received a lot of backlash for it. the difference is that omg has done a lot of ca and mocked different cultures several times which hurt a lot of people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Literally_Lynda @VoidPancake @Saraheboon but you have to treat mental health like physical health. it sucks that not everyone can access psychiatric help, but you would never self diagnose yourself with a physical illness without seeing a doctor first. it’s ok to say that you think you may have a mental illness though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haechanreligion oh shit that sucks, I guess some people are more hesitant to cut people off but it still kinda confuses me how they can keep being friends with someone so toxic??? especially when their actions hurt more than one person<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>do u think we can collectively bully the grammys into letting bts win? because there’s no way I’m letting them lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoongixJiung only one nomination... if they don’t win then I’ll scream omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kinda sucks that they only get this recognition when they make a song in english but whatever a Grammy is a Grammy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7foreverlucky my point is that I don’t think it’s very fair to look at other korean artists and say “they got nominated for an award? that’s because of bts’s work” when it’s not entirely. BTS can be credited for helping kpop get big in the west but not for every kpop artist’s western award won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7foreverlucky I agree that BTS have broken a lot of stereotypes and they definitely deserve a grammy. my point is that many kpop artists were already rising to fame worldwide even before BTS, so there’s a good possibility that they would’ve been contenders for awards even without BTS’s fame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YUHHHH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7foreverlucky I’m not denying that. but not all of kpop’s success is down to BTS. kpop artists were doing well for themselves before BTS came along and changed the game and made it super popular in the west. kpop acts would’ve likely had a chance at western awards even without BTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salii_jm grammys aren’t awarded based on popularity and theres many less mainstream artists that have won a Grammy. BTS deserve one 100% but using their fame as some kind of reasoning why other Korean acts shouldn’t win is xenophobic. try again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7foreverlucky pop fans didn’t respect the Beatles but that doesn’t mean that the Beatles aren’t pop artists?? ofc the kpop industry benefitted from BTS but you can’t accredit every aspect of other group’s success to BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>armys hate it when bts win something and kpop is mentioned as a result but when a kpop artist wins something they think it’s ok to credit their win to bts? make it make sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lmao what’s not clicking that this happens with other genres &amp; industries too. when a rock artist wins a big award the media &amp; rock fans will say “rock is super popular and mainstream right now!” that’s just how it is<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tesfooo_sara exactly 😭 I could’ve saved so much energy and heartache... access courses are obviously still challenging but veryyy different to a-levels and they still get you into uni omd when I found that out I had to take a minute to process it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sick literally like once a month at least I hate it here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesfooo_sara ikr? and the fact that they don’t tell us their are loads of alternatives to a levels like access courses that can still get you into uni and they’re the equivalent of a levels and btecs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesfooo_sara thank you &lt;3 I didn’t really wanna do a levels in the first place but it just ended up kinda... happening so I never really had much motivation and now I have none at all. I don’t think I have the energy to catch up enough to make staying in school worthwhile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesfooo_sara I hope your family are doing well! my doctor sent in a letter to my school so I don’t have to attend for the next couple of months to see how my mental health is doing but tbh at this rate I think it’s a good idea if I drop out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m on anti depressants now so hopefully that’ll help with the mh aspect of things but I’m so far behind everything now because of the additional school I’ve missed on top of lockdown &amp; our exams next year are still not cancelled...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>why is it always the tumblr millennials that have issues and think it’s ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not a grown adult thinking it’s ok to be in the mentions of a minor insulting them and then getting their oomfs in the mentions too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and that’s a wrap goodnight folks  https://t.co/8absFGMevR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol the way a grown adult is still in my mentions and now you have your grown adult oomfs in my mentions too. you do realise you’ve been getting irritated by a minor this entire time, I’m glad I got to strike a nerve with a someone as self centered as you. I’ll sleep peacefully now  https://t.co/anU4Gj00GI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol the fact that you’re trying to call me self conceited lol have you ever tried self reflection it’s really crucial that you give it a go before replying to me again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol it’s not a moral olympics when one of us has no morals to start with 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol please re read my tweets until the basic reading comprehension kicks in. I’ll spell it out for you even though you’re a grown adult. mh issues cause problems with normal activities. nobody uses their mh just so they don’t have to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol you can’t be around people who don’t smell like roses for any amount of time apparently so your compassion doesn’t make it past the start line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol because saying that people use mh as an EXCUSE for not being able to keep up with a hygiene routine is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. mental health is a valid reason to have difficulty with things, no mentally ill person uses it as an excuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol raised to know that my comfort doesn’t matter when people are struggling. apparently some people can’t relate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol so now you’re the one making conclusions about me 💀 I have depression and anxiety. I’ve shared a house with a homeless family member who was in the middle of a massive breakdown. I went to school with kids who weren’t fortunate enough to always have clean clothes. but I was+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol the tweet: hey we should stop shaming people for things out of their control  you: but what about ME and MY comfort? why is nobody thinking about ME?  mental health is not an excuse for anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol not you thinking that having a debilitating mental health problem which causes someone to have severe difficulty with hygiene is optional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa whenever I feel like I’m an asshole I’ll think of you and feel better ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa yeah because one act of kindness is as far as your compassion goes. I don’t care about yours either but others might when your body language is surely as condescending as your thoughts. I thought people like you only existed in movies but people really are that selfish huh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa I got that idea about you because you continue to defend yourself and the way you expect people to suddenly be well enough to take care of themselves better, just for you and the sake of your comfort. you’ve clearly never had much contact with people less fortunate than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa you keep saying you have mental illnesses but that doesn’t make you compassionate. you’re so sheltered that you can’t even imagine being decent to people less fortunate than you because you put your own comfort above other people’s wellbeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa the fact that you demand people to cater to you when their mental illness has gotten to the point where they struggle to take care of themselves says a lot about you as a person. caring about yourself rather than someone who is struggling shows you were raised wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>exactly  https://t.co/0kFaF00J1Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa just because you don’t say anything doesn’t mean your judgemental attitude can’t be picked up on by others. being kind to people in a tough situation is the most basic human decency and you can’t even manage that? were you raised to be this condescending?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s so funny how my ideal type of romantic partner is developing mostly based on fictional characters and not real people because I’ve never been in a relationship or had that many crushes... my standards are dangerously high<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TortoisesDaily jortoise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crystal_pystol @daddygremlin_ @uhalyssaa your experience ≠ other’s experience. some people get to a point where they no longer care what other people think. of course mentally ill people need help. but putting your own comfort before someone else’s mental wellbeing like that? show some human decency<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TigerGold59 @uglyjihad @darlingequity @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer yes it is 💀 plus the fact that shaving takes so much time and effort, nobody has the time to be completely hairless 24/7. that’s just how it is. get used to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerGold59 @uglyjihad @darlingequity @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer do you not know how shaving and waxing works? 😭 a lot of people who shave and wax don’t do it in winter. for waxing, you have to let the hair grow back enough before waxing again. some people have to wait for hair to grow longer even for shaving to avoid discomfort<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dayr3ll @heauxlin @ventiloquy skydiving is less scary than the anime???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uglyjihad @darlingequity @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer tbh women shaving kinda got popularised during WW2 when razor companies couldn’t make as much money from men so it is kinda eurocentric in the sense that it was first popularised in Europe before becoming a more universal beauty standard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uglyjihad @darlingequity @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer where did I say that? why are you assuming I’m judging you lmao. glad you agree that people having body hair should be re-normalised instead of people getting harassed online because of smth that’s natural 🤠<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @LovelyTransHyun @jordyiaaa @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer so once again... you’re saying you have no hobbies thank you for confirming that for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @jordyiaaa @LovelyTransHyun @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer it’s not jumping to conclusions when I look at your account and it’s nothing but football. jumping to a conclusion would be saying your only other way of passing the time is having a wank once a day but I’m probably not too far off with that one luv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @LovelyTransHyun @jordyiaaa @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer the fact that you can’t tell the difference between an interest and a hobby answers my question perfectly thank u ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @jordyiaaa @LovelyTransHyun @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer maybe you should have before jumping to a conclusion and looking like a dumbass hmmmm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @LovelyTransHyun @jordyiaaa @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer yeah a couple things about BTS  on my account compared to everything on your account being about football... get a life dude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenTHFC_ @jordyiaaa @LovelyTransHyun @thenameisjax @blahbloohbleh @YeKyaVyavharHai @inthesewer except my account isn’t entirely about bts or even fan culture lmao 💀 try thinking more carefully before hopping into my mentions next time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uglyjihad @darlingequity @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer so u at least admit that women shaving is founded on patriarchy aka something that should be dismantled lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uglyjihad @RashfxrdAntics @MlNZYS @acs12321 @Nora_B921 @warlocc @Amelie__Online @inthesewer the idea of women shaving to look beautiful only really started during world war 2 when razor companies started marketing to women since they couldn’t make as much money from men... which still makes shaving a caucasian (&amp; capitalist) beauty standard...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EuroKpop AleXa! I think edm hasn’t completely caught on in SK just yet so it would be great to see edm music gain more popularity! I’d also love to see AleXa perform at festivals globally because she’s amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>REVOLUTION BY ALEXA BASS BOOSTED *CHEFS KISS*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>probably one of my fav things about getting the Christmas decorations out is the vintage smell of the old decorations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t even stan but what is it with people slandering celebrities for their looks all the time is it even necessary it’s just mean for no reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep missing shinee’s lives and I only find out they were live hours later GRRRRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>goddamn i love tøp’s music but now I can’t listen to it the same because tyler had to go and be an insensitive asshole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk why people don’t like dynamite by bts it’s so groovy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bighit stfu challenge: failed miserably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if I catch you putting some anti bts shit on the tl you will be unfollowed and muted tyvm... I had to unfollow like 6 moots arghhhh I hate it here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that song is TIMELESS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s so funny how bs&amp;t was the first bts song I heard because I was in my emo phase at the time so the mv and song instantly appealed to me lmao it was perfect timing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // panic attack mention  I’m glad I already worked through my childhood trauma because goddamn i would’ve had an instant panic attack otherwise this song has BAGGAGE attached to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>damn you coldplay! ur music is permanently associated with years of trauma!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chaenvogue you’re the one who needs to relax lmao talking about “leave me alone” when this is twitter... get used to it 😭 do you also find it weird how bgs generally have a mostly female fanbase? because that’s no different, again you’re the one making it weird w your mental gymnastics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaenvogue you’re accusing people of being creepy in the qrts of a tweet so ofc people are going to hop into your mentions. if you don’t want to have people replying to your tweets then turn off replies or go priv. that’s how twitter works lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaenvogue you said that you found it weird that military men “gain strength” from watching gg mvs. the creepy dudes who go feral when underage gg members perform is a different conversation. ggs have a lot of popularity among men and bgs have popularity among women, that’s just how it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaenvogue my point still stands though??? just because they like gg music doesn’t mean it’s a weird thing at all, you’re the one thinking about it like that. mvs are one of the only things they show on tv in the military and bgs like seventeen are popular too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaenvogue yeah you’re the only one... are men not allowed to enjoy music by women now? why turn this into a sexual thing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>edgy teens just hate happiness and think it makes them special<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auraflrt think again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what’s so wrong about not wanting 2 music artists to have the same fandom name lmao. it’s to avoid confusion, I’m sure corpsetwt wouldn’t really wanna share a fan name and # with another fandom too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicsfun @nontieup  https://t.co/AgbRDAnMoQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the BOW WOW WOW in fire really hits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefairoa @musicsfun @nontieup also here’s the full performance if you wanna watch! it’s a cover of the famous opera song nessun dorma  https://t.co/fPa12GragQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefairoa @musicsfun @nontieup this is onew from shinee! he’s the eldest member &amp; leader of the group :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s a good idea but they need to think it through otherwise there’s gonna be a total of like 5 people at these events lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyManHoseok I definitely will 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yongiesfrog @boxianini yeah some people have been making a big deal about it but corpse hasn’t confirmed the name and people only started using it like less than an hour ago so it’s really nothing to worry about lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the whole thing about ticketmaster requiring you to be vaccinated or have a negative covid test makes sense but many governments are not currently planning to vaccinate young people &amp; there’s a lack of testing in way too many countries rn :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I twirl my hair as a comfort thing and I’ve been doing it too much and now my arm hurts from the repeated movement. ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yongiesfrog @boxianini I know, and again imo I don’t mind too much, but considering that little freaks has been a fandom name / nickname for 7 years already it would b nice for the fandoms to have different names to avoid the tag being filled with two different people &amp; causing confusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yongiesfrog @boxianini hmm not entirely since corpse makes music too so there’s an overlap, I’m not super bothered if both fandoms have the same name but since corpse hasn’t decided on that name himself I think it would be nice if corpsetwt could see if they like another name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>some people are jumping on this fandom name discourse being mean to corpsetwt and making shawols look bad meanwhile they don’t have anything else shinee related on their acc. hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way I love my older sister so much I wish we talked more often I think that’s gonna be my New Years resolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicsfun @nontieup you’re not quirky or special for disliking boy bands and you’re also a tr*mp supporter and pr* l*fe like pick a struggle  https://t.co/aU7ix2cvGW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>shawols please stop getting so heated over a nickname this is why I have 50% of shawol twitter blocked while being a shawol myself #littlefreaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bad_Eye_Boy I don’t even collect pcs but I have a mini folder that I keep them all organised in sskdkfkgk imagine having the mental strength to stick a pin straight through them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the path I’m going down rn I’ll inevitably drift apart from people but it’s people I’m not *that* close to I guess but if I lose close people at the same time I’m gonna go straight back to that dark place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>last time I was in this situation was when I was severely depressed and I completely shut down and I couldn’t do anything or even communicate normally and I’m trying to stay afloat but if I lose more people it’s gonna happen again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>please I don’t wanna go through the process of losing friends again I’m scared it’s happening again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>://<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t really blame them because they seem pretty busy and they have a lot going on in their life but they still go on social media and stuff they just haven’t been replying to me for ages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bad_Eye_Boy I feel nothing but immense pain this should be illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>feeling kinda ignored by my online friend rn :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neveynoo1000 yeah cancelling them for your year group was probably not the right decision and caused more stress for you guys. but for our year group we’ll inevitably fail if we sit the exams. and it’s unfair because welsh and scottish students have had their exams cancelled now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4EZONE and we all have to apply to the same unis... plus last year’s students deferred... yeah english and northern irish students will notttt be making it into uni at this rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haechanreligion @BorisJohnson SIGHHHH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so scottish and welsh students don’t have to sit their exams but we all have to apply to the same unis... so english and northern irish students are gonna flop their exams and not get into uni especially because last year’s students have deferred #alevels2021  https://t.co/nIij7SQxfC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4EZONE neither does scotland it’s just northern ireland and england that are the ones who have to suffer here  https://t.co/ZAw5z3pcSp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neveynoo1000 because it will be lmao the people who were meant to sit them in 2020 only missed 2 months of school but we’ve missed 6 months or more and teachers are off sick so we have substitutes all the time. if we sit the exams we’ll fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>nvm I was celebrating but a levels are only cancelled in Wales :/ @BorisJohnson get your sorry arse up and cancel them for England too  https://t.co/Aj5uCIDIAj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if this news is true tho I feel bad that they had to breakup and I feel worse that it got released to the public like this cause no one is entitled to know their business like that 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YES so many erasers have suffered because I was bored in class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kinda? I did for a while but then I started drawing the full sun with a triangle pattern for the sunrays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes and I never used them and I still hate them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah I was put in a small separate class with other kids who couldn’t read a clock and I had to spend hours with these 😭 at least I actually learned smth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes but I never used to know how to draw it as a kid so I felt left out lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes I loved it so much that one time I had a serious problem with my eye and I was in agonising pain but I insisted on going to school because it was world book day and a teacher had to convince me to go to the hospital with my mum 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had everything except the second one, the pens in the first one were absolute shite lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the big tent thing yeah the etch a sketch no but I saw kids bring them in from home every now and then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes but the teachers barely made me fill it out that often because I read so much that they didn’t need to check 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes but my parents never asked me about it lol who goes around chewing on people’s arms 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>probably magic stars or haribos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>coco pops and they’re still my fav<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yoooooomoma @businessinsider I don’t think any other president has had mass protests against him whenever he travelled abroad 💀 the queen has no power over the way the UK is run but you probably didn’t know that and you’re just chatting on shit you don’t know about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoooooomoma @businessinsider you lot love to bring that up as if you didn’t join the war last minute and until then you barely cared about people getting persecuted lmao. trump is a loser and everyone hates him, biden is the next president and if you don’t like it, feel free to leave the united states<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoooooomoma @businessinsider and you pay a massive amount of your tax dollar to the military while having no free healthcare and barely any of that tax dollar actually goes to troops  https://t.co/waRnwKX67J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerditter100 @businessinsider as far as I know the US seems to be doing a whole lot worse than the UK right now. maybe you should think twice about supporting the dumbass that is letting hundreds of thousands of people die in the United States<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>somehow all the votes for him are legal but the votes for biden aren’t. hmmmmmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now hopefully this cunt boris won’t sell our healthcare system to america for the sake of a stupid trade relationship 💀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KIMTAEJ00N @filterkku @keepstrugglin_ basically the king/queen still has some power like meeting with foreign powers and signing legislation into law but they can’t exactly say “no ❤️” because then it’d be off with their head luv 😭 and the rest of the royal family just sits there and looks rich and pretty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KIMTAEJ00N @filterkku @keepstrugglin_ ok I had to google this too but long story short monarchs have always had different advice councils and the royal council eventually became Parliament aka our government and Parliament gradually limited the monarchy’s power over several hundred years<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophia73018600 @THR this isn’t about not trusting the system. this is about trump blatantly wanting to disenfranchise the american public. he’s trying to take people’s right to vote away from them, this is an attack on democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nexus____6 @THR there were claims of foreign interference in the last election, but there were no attempts to disenfranchise the American public. which is exactly what trump is doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>// enlistment  do you think yoongi is gonna enlist soon too? I think he might enlist around the same time as jin because that’s not unusual for groups to do since it gets the enlistment period over and done with quicker so the group can come back as 7 sooner<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jezkemp there were definitely a lot of anti maskers and other idiots in the crowd this year but the main sentiment is the same. at least if not in london, then in the rest of the world   https://t.co/4hhRfflt7Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seaspirit27 @TSG_Toronto @PrisonPlanet this isn’t a right wing protest, it’s an anarchist protest. it happens every year to hold governments to account, protest against police brutality, fight for free press, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jezkemp the million mask march isn’t an anti mask protest! it’s an anarchist march that happens every year to try to hold governments to account and protest against police brutality and other abuses of power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFlatEartherr this isn’t a lockdown protest 💀 this protest happens every year and it’s about holding world governments to account for things like war crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>although there’s a lotttt of anti maskers in that crowd this year they can eat shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way people think the million mask march is about covid now oh man... lmao it’s an anarchist protest about holding world governments to account, it happens every year 💀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wecansoarhigher SAME LMAO he would keep screaming fraud and demand a recount but only in the states where biden won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wecansoarhigher ikr?? why is he trying to suppress his own supporters cause some of those votes that haven’t been counted yet are votes for him 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomlinsonCJ yes because what he’s saying is factually incorrect and people deserve to know that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if they stopped the count now then biden would win lmaooo this man really is stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes they will old man, as long as it’s postmarked for election day then absentee ballots will still be accepted and counted in many states even if it arrives a few days later<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>curious george, when will americans realise that these shows were available to kids worldwide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>olivia, sorry to break it to americans but you’re not the only ones who had this growing up lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the government sending us to school during a lockdown is not just dangerous cause of the virus, we have to go to school when sunrise is later and it gets dark earlier... when nobody is around on the streets... kids walking to school by themselves...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IM CRYIMG WHAT IS THISSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s so funny how trump supporters are saying stop the count even though they’d lose if they did but biden supporters are saying count all the votes even though they could lose as a result too... yeah you can see which group of people actually cares about democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corpse_Husband some neurodivergent people have trouble telling the difference between a joke and something serious, but yeah most people just make a big deal out of nothing when it was never that serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwirlsWorks @PcflWtrs @FinancialTimes ah theres the slur I was waiting for it lmao, the liberal insult too that’s a classic. I don’t expect you to do any work either cause you clearly can’t come up with anything original before jumping into my mentions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also obviously the whole situation from a couple months ago, I may have been able to unstan quickly but I’m still not over that... he hurt so many people because he was insensitive and impulsive ://<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would love to think that tyler joseph voted biden but considering that he has at least 1 close family member who is a trump supporter... I’m not keeping my hopes up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwirlsWorks @PcflWtrs @FinancialTimes you say that as if you’re not anonymous yourself lmao I probably have more about myself on my account than you do??? you clearly don’t have any contact with the opposite gender because you think women just go and have abortions for fun  https://t.co/ZqJaxN6bYP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tumtaemin idk what it is about that song but it makes me think too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for some reason the song spring day makes me dangerously sad so I have to be super careful when I listen to it cause otherwise I’ll get some pretty dark thoughts :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baekluvrs loads of people have pictures of their fav celebrities in their phone, it’s perfectly normal &amp; nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realleggy and the fact that 98% of people won’t be affected by tax cuts at all because it only affects people within the top 1-2% ... they’re sacrificing people’s rights for jeff bezos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislooped why did he try to get on the stool like that... mate just sit down 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Callherdom @wetneptune so is trump but trump does it in a way that attempts to (and successfully) removes people’s rights as a result. nobody has much of a choice here but biden is the lesser of two evils<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>people add “BREAKING” at the start of a tweet to make it look like actual fact when it’s actually something they pulled out of thin air<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>and another spot reserved in hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookieekawaii atm the figures are pretty much just a projection or estimate, different media sources will be getting different info from different places. it’s pretty much still all to play for, the details of the results could still change even weeks from now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s so funny when conservatives say “this terrible scenario is what would happen if liberals were in power!” but actually it’s what already happened while conservatives were in power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve seen a lot of people saying that better educated people vote blue and yes that’s true, but I vote blue because I have morals not because of the quality of my education... school can teach you good morals but it doesn’t make you smarter or better person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pls stop acting like better education = being smart, a lot of us have limitations like physical or mental health problems or financial instability but that doesn’t mean we can’t think for ourselves<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donegalgirly @LFC_Cillian @rtenews last lockdown, schools were still open for children of essential workers. your child would still be able to attend school even if they’re closed for other students. closing schools is the best option otherwise this lockdown won’t work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffersam100 I agree, the government never gives money or councils who fund school budgets and buying new school equipment. I think schools should be closed but compulsory online schooling isn’t an option right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donegalgirly @LFC_Cillian @rtenews from your position of privilege you may think that home schooling is an easy option, but homeschooling is expensive and time consuming. and during the pandemic, parents can’t hire a tutor so they’ll have to teach their kids themselves. homeschool isn’t an option for everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffersam100 online schooling can’t be compulsory because not all kids have access to the same resources, some have been without computers or an internet connection for the past several months<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@only131vibes the room temperature wasn’t warm enough and I needed to soften it, but they turned out good! I ended up using a mixer to speed up the process of making the butter smooth lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBrace7 that figure is total deaths from all causes you knumbskull, and that was a one off event unlike covid which is claiming lives over a longer time period. covid is more deadly than the flu and there’s solid evidence for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAIT IS IT AVAILABKE ON IOS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would be excited but I’m an ios user 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neomarscity at least his style improved a lot but why was he cosplaying a pigeon here 😭 a pigeon can pass smtm but changbin can’t it’s a bit outrageous lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiu_frosty that’s why people are complaining though, it’s pretty unfair that changbin was sent out so fast and they didn’t even give him a chance to prove himself. plus they kept using him to try and attract more viewers but then he didn’t even get the chance to compete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jintopiia I’m not 100% sure if I’m gonna go ahead with it yet but considering that the government are still sitting on their lazy asses I would rather just leave  https://t.co/lb7RabDnt2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jintopiia already have a meeting planned with the careers advisor for plans to drop out aha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>betttt they’re gonna do another lockdown but still keep schools open 🥴 as if we won’t accidentally take the virus back home to our families ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>another lockdown and ofqual &amp; the gov still have done nothing to help a level students. yeah I’ll be dropping out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>no kibum halloween costume. tis a sad, sad day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you act like both of them didn’t go through shit from the judges &amp; other contestants because they were idols, smtm has always been against idol rappers but mino and bobby wiped the floor with the other contestants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why are these khh stans taking bullets for those judges, can’t they just accept that the judges are biased against idol rappers and go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiu_frosty bobby still went through shit cause he was an idol rapper, smtm is biased against idol rappers full stop. changbin should’ve passed, those judges were laughing at him before he even started because they hate the idea that an idol rapper could beat them at their own game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ysllix @barbyeeun who listens to that and thinks “this shit slaps!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bandidoo7 I’m alive and well thanks for asking  https://t.co/OEjhQpR3HV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ysllix @barbyeeun where did I say that all of them are bad? this show has good contestants but their bias against idol rappers means that people like this get to pass and actually good rappers don’t  https://t.co/R8DcCHngjB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjieris the show has some good contestants but that fact that people like this can pass but changbin didnt is really...  https://t.co/sj9hMjHF7Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neomarscity some of the rappers on this show are good but some of them shouldn’t be allowed to audition 💀 and this dude PASSED  https://t.co/jYOUJ8n8zp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neomarscity fair enough lmao but the fact that this was only last year &amp; this dude got 4 passes but changbin got 4 fails? weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicalObser1 @gorst27 @NFFC_FPL__ @BornABlue1878 @Matthew_Hodson white is not a minority so depicting Jesus as a white man is preventing minority representation in media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neomarscity yeah unfortunately   https://t.co/1uCHpvBktT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjieris yeah because this guy managed to get an all pass  https://t.co/1uCHpvBktT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFFC_FPL__ @ClassicalObser1 @gorst27 @BornABlue1878 @Matthew_Hodson doesn’t matter if he existed or not, he still would’ve been middle eastern &amp; minority representation in the media is important. plus, the Anne Boleyn drama is exactly that, a dramatised version of events, it’s not meant to be super historically accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and hanbin too lmao the fact that one of the producers on that show rn is only staying relevant by using his name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact that some of these idol rappers are outperforming the other rappers on smtm really says a lot... bobby and changbin were too good for that show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barbyeeun but they did need changbin cause the contestants on the last few series have been shit 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicalObser1 @gorst27 @BornABlue1878 @Matthew_Hodson maybe that’s because the bible is the word of god and skin colour is not relevant to faith and an individual’s sins and good deeds, so of course it’s not mentioned. Jesus was born in the middle east to middle eastern parents, he was almost definitely not white<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kinda weird how changbin got eliminated, I haven’t been watching this series much but judging from past smtm series, changbin is really a diamond in the rough in that show 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicalObser1 @gorst27 @BornABlue1878 @Matthew_Hodson jesus was almost definitely a man of middle eastern descent... aka he wasn’t white<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>christmas is gonna be ruined cause these fuckers won’t allow a 2-3 week lockdown. so instead we’ll be under harsh restrictions for months. ffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>yes we have that but no it doesn’t fall down lol it just holds the toilet water and it’s connected to pipes in the wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pretty much yeah everyone I know has it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah the only real difference is that trump is blatantly racist, homophobic, sexist etc. but boris tries to pretend he’s not even though we have him on tape<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>northern ireland is separate from the republic of ireland because of religious differences (ni catholic, roi protestant) so long story short roi got their independence but ni is still with the uk because the rest of the uk is traditionally catholic too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ourselves, the rest of the uk does not like england and as an english person I can definitely see why<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>yes! they’re in a few cities across the uk, they’re very common<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AtsumiNatt @dahliahanbin @Jjesse_hey @chanucabello @ygent_official merch and new content related to ikon is not promotion 💀 promotion is advertising their new song/album, music show performances, social media posts etc. things that will make people who aren’t an ikonic listen to their music.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ancienttm @SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official even if they go on their own paths I’ll still support them 🤨 I hope they can regroup but I’ll support each of them no matter what. 2ne1 are happy and successful after leaving yge, same as other artists who left lately, so either way it’s good for ikon if they leave 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official if they renew their contract then I trust ikon to make the right decision for them. from my perspective as a fan I think it’s best for them to leave but I support them no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official we have no idea what went on between minzy and yge, we don’t know if she had to pay or not. she just said she left to pursue her own style of music. you can’t just decide to terminate a contract like that. please do your research before hopping in my replies again ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jjesse_hey @hellochildrewn @chanucabello @ygent_official you love ikon but you said their cb didn’t chart when it did... and you pretty much blamed them for their cb flopping instead of yge who’s literally in charge of mv production, album production, promotion etc. if you’re a fan of ikon then you need to step up ur game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtsumiNatt @Jjesse_hey @chanucabello @ygent_official “best promos by far for ikon” is still bad promo 💀 ikon’s promo is shit in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to sleep and I woke up to me ratioing someone lmao speak on ikon’s name and get merked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bro wait they already had card holders with these designs for sale at last year’s london pop up store 😳 I literally have a koya card case with that design<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlS28 @chanucabello @ygent_official that’s exactly what I’m doing 🤩 and I CAN do something, I can encourage them to do what’s best for their careers and educate people like you so you stop running your mouth on shit you don’t know about ❤️ keep ikon’s name out of your mouth from now on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jjesse_hey @chanucabello @ygent_official incorrect, their comeback got no promotion, the album only had 2 versions so it’s automatically at a disadvantage in comparison to other group’s albums, and once again it’s overpriced. dive still managed to chart but not as well as it could have because... no promotion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlS28 @chanucabello @ygent_official I’m waiting for their contract to expire so they can finally leave 💀 and their vlogs are 5 minutes long come on... plus all the effort for those is ikon’s and yge just edits and uploads them, yge doesn’t do anything for ikon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlS28 @chanucabello @ygent_official omfg please keep up with the conversation 😭 yge released a full list of every yg artists upcoming activities a few months ago, and I mean EVERY artist, but ikon wasn’t even mentioned. they have NOTHINGGGG planned for ikon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlS28 @chanucabello @ygent_official terminating a contract isn’t that easy, please do some research before running their mouth. they would have to pay a huge sum of money to YG or go through a legal battle which they’re unlikely to win. and what upcoming cb? yge have no plans for them whatsoever 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official as a fan I can support them to do what they want with their careers and what’s best for them, which is exactly what I’m doing. you don’t have anything about ikon on your account so why are you trying to tell me what to do as a fan 💀💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ancienttm @SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official there’s no guarantee that they’ll lose their name and even if they do, why should I care? so many groups have changed their name after leaving their company and been fine and wym lose each other as a group? they’re a brotherhood lmao they can regroup outside of yge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMeilem @chanucabello @ygent_official they have a contract... which they can’t cancel unless they pay YG a ton of money... 💀 it’s not like they’re staying there by choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlS28 @chanucabello @ygent_official they’ll be able to give themselves a cb because yge won’t be able to stop them releasing music anymore 💀 because of yg they almost didn’t release love scenario, they need to escape that company asap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kalyanamitta11 @chanucabello @ygent_official you don’t even have any ikon tweets on your account, keep your mouth closed about iKON’s business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jjesse_hey @chanucabello @ygent_official it didn’t even flop it charted well and everything 😭 this cb wasn’t as popular because yge gave them a low budget mv and overpriced their albums... yg’s strategy is shit, ikon almost didn’t release love scenario because of his strategy 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xLittleAndax @chanucabello except for the fact that we know how in the past yge has stopped ikon from having a cb even when they were ready. hanbin got extremely stressed and agitated because he kept presenting yg with songs he had prepared and they were all rejected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElridthHere @CHOKEME_HATEME @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT true, but trolls or not it’s important to call the racism out. I don’t think it’s fair that people are trying to accuse either of them of racism (although I think a lot of them are saying it sarcastically but it might come across as a bit hateful)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElridthHere @CHOKEME_HATEME @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT I never said it was corpse or Jack fans saying this. although I’ve 100% seen this stuff from mrbeast fans before. it’s the fact that people were indeed saying racist shit in the replies. I’m not trying to accuse anyone but just pointing out the racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHOKEME_HATEME @ElridthHere @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT yeah, kpop fans can’t breathe without people in their replies saying racist bs. a lot of kpop stans were saying stupid stuff in this scenario too, but we can’t voice an opinion on anything without seeing racism everywhere even if what we’re saying is harmless. it really sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aleeciafate16 @ElridthHere @CHOKEME_HATEME @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT I don’t condone that, I was a big fan of Jack a few years back. both sides are wrong in this scenario and I’m constantly having to go on block sprees w/ kpop fans even though I’m a fan myself because they pull that kind of behaviour. racist abuse is another level tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHOKEME_HATEME @ElridthHere @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT okay cool, I’m glad we could reach the same conclusion. I supported corpse’s tweet and I’m glad he won in the end and the bts fan account got 10k too, but as a bts fan we have to put up with comments like this all the time so please don’t assume we’re bluffing from now on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElridthHere @CHOKEME_HATEME @Jack_Septic_Eye @Corpse_Husband @MrBeastYT since neither of you can do a basic keyword search on twitter, I collected some receipts for you since you’re both incompetent! this is only part of the racist abuse btw we’re talking hundreds of comments  https://t.co/Y9SErZ0w27<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>hey if you got so heated over the ratio thing that you started being rude to either bts or corpse then softblock me ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D4DDYBL00 idk tbh they are a fan account that organises that kind of stuff I think (not sure because I had them blocked since before all this lmao) so I can kinda see why they wanted to use it for that but yeah it was only after corpse said he would donate that they said they would too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auraflrt it’s been like that for years......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D4DDYBL00 apparently armys are gonna donate 10k in total to charity tho cause they’ll raise another 5k to make up for what they wanna spend on the cb... so idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixieninja01 @suki_yona @Corpse_Husband me making fun of gatcha players isn’t toxicity 💀 this is just twitter you’re gonna have to get used to it at some point<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@qairux @MJ1323_ @Adrita_Saikia @carolmidoriya @BJungkook09197 @MrBeastYT BTS have previously used a lot of their earnings from albums to donate to charity. even if the account decides to only put 50% to charity directly, if the rest of the money goes to buying albums then it’s likely that that money will still be used in a donation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>locals popping a vein over the bts account even though at least 50% would be going to charity but they don’t care about tweets like this ok lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@in_jinertia @pjmsapp @_primadonnagrl @badfeelsgood_ @tanizakey saying shinee did a retro concept in 2016 is not directly insulting or dragging any other group, if people take offence then that’s on them......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namjoonsbowlegs @tanizakey “everything shinee has been through” you have no right to comment on that situation or treat shinee differently because of it. keep their name out of your mouth. op only said that shinee did a retro concept in 2016, if people decide to drag then that’s their problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@200127namjoon multi is a word that goes back years, if you like more than one thing no matter what it is then you’re a multi by definition 💀 it’s ok you can cry and where did I throw bts under the bus lmaooo just because I like other things doesn’t mean I won’t defend bts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@200127namjoon calling an army out on their bullshit doesn’t make me any less of an army, what crack are you smoking 😭 do you even know what multi means either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@200127namjoon I did and so did BTS 😳 I’m an adorable representative mc for youth and I’m really sorry to break it to you but you have no jurisdiction to try and suggest I’m not lmaooo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flowerbanqtan @jungkookhours_ @tanizakey okay, that’s your opinion and you’re entitled to that! the genre of the song includes new jack swing, contemporary r&amp;b and pop soul which are “retro” genres that were popularised by black artists who started the retro concept so imo the song has a retro vibe too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pjmsapp @badfeelsgood_ @tanizakey clearly you’re pulling shit out of your ass because there’s countless singer-songwriters under SM who have a huge influence on the creative process, as well as with their choreos and mvs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jungkookhours_ @tanizakey no ones denying that! but shinee were one of the first kpop groups to do this concept with a lot of success! dynamite went the extra mile in terms of popularity + of course the credit for this concept goes to black people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>bts have a talent for making songs that r unlike anything you’ve heard before and they did it again 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>good but the producers and writers need to do better because there were golden opportunities for more rap verses and we got “du du du du du du” 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s good but she’s a little controversial 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like the chorus is missing smth idk but everything else is good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bad_Eye_Boy yeah I get what you mean, I still consider myself an army because BTS appreciates all their fans and wouldn’t push people away like some of their fans try to... it sucks cause I think most armys are nice but it’s the nasty ones w/ a superiority complex that have big platforms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bad_Eye_Boy EXACTLY OMFG idk where they got the idea that “most” armys only stan BTS because I can guarantee that’s not the case at all... there are some multis who “stan” BTS and don’t defend them which sucks but it’s the fact they use the words “multi” and “anti” interchangeably now??<|endoftext|>

BTS love all of their fans and ur worth as a fan is not decided on by what music you listen to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when was the last time you felt the touch of another<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dynamitejin even IF people did that, distrusting every single person who likes more than one artist is childish and a waste of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like we know we live in ur minds rent free but pls don’t make me feel insecure about my accent lmao one bri ish joke is fine but when you make fun of every little thing it’s just annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sometimes jokes about British accents are funny and sometimes they’re not but Americans still act like it’s the funniest shit they’ve ever heard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dynamitejin @thanxx____ since when do people do that? there’s literally no evidence I’ve seen of people doing that lol that’s the point of op’s tweet, people are acting like it’s the hunger games or smth and distrusting people just because they like other artists,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rezimora how’s year 12? how’s knowing you have no actual exam experience whatsoever? how’s knowing your grades might have been better if the government didn’t bollocks it? have you been humbled by your first E/D grade yet? :D I will not spare you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rezimora you never sat ur GCSEs. you never felt that pain. now you’re going into alevels completely oblivious. we’ll see how you do then miss girl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rezimora the taste of your sister having the spaghetti pot near the sink for no valid reason? the taste of failure? the taste of tragedy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rezimora you say that until u get covid from the sink... my spaghetti may have been flavourless but at least it didn’t kill me 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rezimora ah yes the flavour of bacteria and dish soap residue 😋😋😋<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jun5tar @deer_winwin @zeusjungwoo98 @neovelvetsoshi you need money in order to collect photocards tho so a lot of people take what they earn from selling pcs and put it towards their collection, that’s generally how people collect stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicenecksix @GlobeFinancial @mballardwrites @nicetryofficer that’s not how inflation works lmao... the value of the currency is higher = they get paid less = the debt is worth much more. a $5 debt could be worth more like $100. this happened in Germany after WW1, kids played with stacks of money because it was worthless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlobeFinancial @nicenecksix @mballardwrites @nicetryofficer military spending in the US is massive. shifting a few million from the military towards stimulus checks for the general public would help the economy because people would actually have money to spend which would also help keep businesses afloat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFlat2 @branewurms @nicetryofficer many but not all. France isn’t the best example here since their test and trace system is garbage which is one of the big reasons why they had to go back to heavy restrictions. places like south korea and China have been doing fine and mostly back to normal life<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GirlThats_Reno @forbidcassidi @stephbabyy @itskrisbruh the issue is that clippings don’t really prevent infections though... again hematomas are rare and most ear infections in dogs are treatable and don’t require their ears to be clipped. it’s a pretty extreme method that doesn’t do a whole lot except cause the dog pain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GirlThats_Reno @forbidcassidi @stephbabyy @itskrisbruh no I mean if they’re actually at risk of infection 💀 some vets will still allow people to do that to their dogs even when it’s just for visual purposes and that’s still wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like how does someone go and ignore iKON’s whole brotherhood like that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@forbidcassidi @GirlThats_Reno @stephbabyy @itskrisbruh + it’s very rare that actual vets will crop a dog’s ears, it’s almost always done by someone else which is a risk because you don’t know if the tools and methods they’re using are safe. ear clipping is harmful to dogs unless a vet does it for a medical reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>naw cause why do some of my moots follow a bobby solo stan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GirlThats_Reno @stephbabyy @itskrisbruh hematomas are rare and clearly this article doesn’t recommend chopping off a dog’s ears to stop them from happening though??? in fact cutting off their ears could be more likely to cause an infection in the wound 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GirlThats_Reno @stephbabyy @itskrisbruh nowhere in that screenshot does it say that clipping their ears is a solution or a preventative, what’s your point<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ymstruggletwt I would rather that my grade is based on work that I’ve done in class and independently rather than based on an exam where I’m forced to answer questions on things I don’t know because school was closed for a solid 6 months and they won’t change the syllabus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymstruggletwt I genuinely want my exams next year to be cancelled, we all collectively lost 6 months of school + there’s some schools that are having to close or send kids home even now, as long as the gov / exam boards don’t screw up with grades again then exams shouldn’t happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>knetz alwaysss trying to defame people like please go outside and get some fresh air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also the company is connected to several smaller businesses and that’s literally how they choose to operate so idk why they’re talking about “fishy” ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also the donations originally were completely funded &amp; donated by hanbin but the company was touched by the gesture and decided to help by producing more masks to donate lmao this is basic info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when taps make that weird scary gurgling noise when there’s no water coming out so every time I check to see if the water is still working where I live rn I get nervous lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>kpop stans really sacrifice their morals to drag someone on twitter... sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielneill90 @axios but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t care, even if less people are dying compared to other issues it’s still deaths that could be prevented. plus there’s increasing evidence that patients have lasting problems after recovering from covid so death isn’t the only issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe Americans don’t have sweet / salty / sweet &amp; salty popcorn at cinemas... it’s just so wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DALGONEW idk but the first thing I thought of was freshly washed socks?? i need to go to bed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myeondilf that’s true, hopefully if it’s a cb for anyone YG will actually put money into it this time unlike they did with ikon’s last cb... their mv had such a small budget 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myeondilf I’m guessing it’s a gg or female soloist because the alien has little eyelashes lmao but it can’t be bp which is why I’m wondering if it’s that new gg they said they were gonna debut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way I’m stressed about everything rn.. I have a headache<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>don’t tell me they’re debuting another artist when they can’t even give comebacks and promotions to their current ones......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk why this information wasn’t passed on to him... this is why I hate getting new teachers I have to give them a whole speech everytime and they STILL don’t understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if my history teacher didn’t get my email I’m gonna have to give him the whole explanation on how my mental health affects my education oh lord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>how are you gonna say you stan a group of you secretly dislike some of the members? weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khmjsgj @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf you say “own fandom” when I’m not even an nctzen lmfao. you’ve spent so much time on stan twitter that you’re losing your grip on reality, please get some fresh air 💀 stop acting superior when we both know BTS appreciate all their fans 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hgupthan_ @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf do you think nctzens would spend their money just to spam the name of another group in the comments? I don’t think so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf okay? that’s fine nobody asked you to care lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agustd_meowmeow @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf where did I say “all armys are like this” ?? I know most armys mind their business, there’s a reason I have the little 7 in my dn. one person getting their ass kicked by bh doesn’t represent everyone. bh suing a hater has nothing to do w the haters fandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hgupthan_ @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf unfortunately it’s not just people pretending to be armys. you have to accept that some actual armys are trolls too. I don’t get the people crying about leaving the fandom over this though it’s not that deep lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf clearly it is kinda your problem since it has everything to do with the fandom you’re in... and I’m not the one popping a vein here I don’t even stan nct . I’m an army and I’m still gonna call out armys for being annoying the same way I’ll call out others too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hgupthan_ @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf also annoying 💀 commenting shit about another group is a waste of time no matter who’s doing it idk what you’re expecting me to say here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agustd_meowmeow @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf what fandom being sued by bh? since when 💀 bh can’t sue thousands of people based on the actions of a few trolls idk what crack ur smoking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hgupthan_ @daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf equally as annoying lmao it goes both ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf if nobody put up a fuss about that then doesn’t mean others shouldn’t? it’s annoying and unnecessary either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf well clearly there were some armys watching their live right there 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist @jaehyunslostgf their comments literally mention BTS and say “I purple you” which is obviously a phrase that armys use, can you not read,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snarkeigh so you looked up “guy taking a shit” on YouTube or something 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarkeigh but the real question is why were you watching that video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1of1jikook I heard it’s about £55<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nene03921145 @kylandyoung @business I know that one of the members has the Hyundai black card but I’m not sure about the others.  https://t.co/FQKS68X0sy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@muniimx @suyixss @chingugang @namgiluvbot how are you gonna compare an album to a luxury brand 😭 I’m gonna end the conversation right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>otsukareeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maira100491 apparently it’s a mistranslation though :( i saw someone say that taemin said something like “I lose things a lot”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkullyoongi @bonvoyajin @namjincollab  https://t.co/DlboRHTieg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I could get away with not doing my history assessment but I think I’ll have to do it at some point rip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muniimx @suyixss @chingugang @namgiluvbot where did I say that 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muniimx @suyixss @chingugang @namgiluvbot I’m not trying to make it a big deal, and again I’m allowed to complain cause I’m the person who’s supposed to be buying the product. they can price it however they want but I just think the price could be lower 🤷🏻‍♀️ that’s all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@131prime the only reason it’s taking so long is because of YG and HSH investigations 😭 hanbin’s investigation already ended but it took longer because the people who were dealing with his case got investigated for corruption so his case had to be given to a diff department 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanlian01250682 @nanagalaxa @girlsoftheweeek @SHNN_twt @maryjoh24325377 @BangpinkThe @business I don’t support communism either lmao I’m a socialist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamnotmarklee honestly good luck 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixie__park I know that but I’m literally just saying that’s why they priced it like that, because they’re a business... I’m just saying the reason behind it I’m really not trying to argue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamnotmarklee that’s such a weird prompt wow 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iris_Ilex as soon as a I saw how multi talented they are I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to become a fan 🥺 and their personalities are so sweet too, they genuinely appreciate their fans and work so hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muniimx @suyixss @chingugang @namgiluvbot I know but I just think the price is a bit unreasonable nevertheless 💀 that’s literally all I’m saying, I’m allowed to complain about the price of things because I’m a consumer and that’s how buying stuff works lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixie__park I know it’s a deluxe edition and I’m not giving people shit for buying it??? Im just saying the only reason it costs that much is because bh wants to make money, not because they need to pay their workers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@131prime if they had enough evidence against him his case would’ve wrapped up by now. the fact they’re still questioning people surrounding the case suggests to me they  are relying mostly on witness statements &amp; their witnesses aren’t even reliable lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixie__park @namgiluvbot BH already earns millions, they’re definitely not gonna be struggling to pay anyone right now so that’s not the reason why the album is so expensive. not trying to argue just saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suyixss @chingugang @namgiluvbot that’s true but it’s still a bit annoying how they’re charging so much, imo an album shouldn’t cost that much even if it’s deluxe cause that’s pretty much the price of a concert ticket. but ig we can agree to disagree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ISSAF4X @Luckystar24Wd @OneMoreTime82 @enHypeMeUP @business @BTS_BiTS ??? you’re barely making any sense lmao why bother replying if you’re not gonna offer anything interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nene03921145 @kylandyoung @business I mean the more exclusive invite only black cards. a lot of banks make black cards available to people with a certain amount of money but there’s some black cards which are harder to get than others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ISSAF4X @Luckystar24Wd @OneMoreTime82 @enHypeMeUP @business @BTS_BiTS also idk why you’re getting so heated over this lmao do you not have anything better to do with your time and energy? damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ISSAF4X @Luckystar24Wd @OneMoreTime82 @enHypeMeUP @business @BTS_BiTS assuming that every single girl group / boy group is “generic” is a xenophobic assumption to make 💀 the industry there is just as bad as the western music industry &amp; you clearly haven’t listened to much korean music to make assumptions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noslipin @business that’s because until recently they never got radioplay because of racism and xenophobia in the media. they had a sold out worldwide stadium tour last year and earned millions from their US concerts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilillmusic @business tell that to the hundreds of thousands of fans who went to their sold out worldwide stadium tour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylandyoung @business also because they all own shares in their record label and the label has been earning millions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylandyoung @business theyre already millionaires as far as we know since all of the members already have black cards which are very exclusive and only given to people with a large amount of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nanagalaxa @girlsoftheweeek @SHNN_twt @maryjoh24325377 @BangpinkThe @business I hope the system will change but again it’s only very recently that BTS have become millionaires, previously they lived in a tiny dorm room together and struggled to afford meals. they didn’t have the money just handed to them so at least they worked for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nanagalaxa @girlsoftheweeek @SHNN_twt @maryjoh24325377 @BangpinkThe @business I agree that the whole capitalist system is really fucking wrong and nobody should have piles of money while others have nothing. however, at least BTS regularly donate large amounts to charity so they’re doing some good things with their money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ISSAF4X @Luckystar24Wd @OneMoreTime82 @enHypeMeUP @business @BTS_BiTS sounds pretty xenophobic to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they went from living in a tiny dorm room and struggling to afford meals to becoming multimillionaires... now THAT’S what you call ✨self made✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hanbin was up against experienced executives for the executive director position and WON his mind is so powerful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hanbin really escaped the shitty management of YG ent and said fuck it I’m my manager now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NEFVRTITTI @kuntastics @ptgfromis @tbzjpeg it’s strong but it’s not super thick, kind of like medium thickness! it’s strong and has extra thickness on the top, bottom and corners but it doesn’t get in the way or anything and it’s not super chunky on your phone 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsujinkei @kuntastics @ptgfromis @tbzjpeg it’s tpu material which is a type of plastic, the case feels solid and strong but it’s also bendable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hope so, if shinee do a london concert and I see dan there I’ll feel very at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do you think dan howell still stans shinee<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kuntastics @ptgfromis @tbzjpeg I’ve had this one for almost a year and it’s not yellow at all, plus it has a couple of small holes on the side to loop a keychain through 😌  https://t.co/mel5hHiULq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbzjpeg I’ve had mine for months and it’s not yellow at all yet lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>would be nice if the government could actually tell us wtf is going on and if we’re actually gonna have a second lockdown or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like idk nothing feels real and I’m not even talking about covid and stuff, just everything in general feels like I’m dreaming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>is anyone else feeling like everything feels so weird and different rn or is it just my mental illness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the lack of reading comprehension on this app...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk why armchairs are having a giggle over what taehyung said when it was a mistranslation and even then it said “other kpop fans” aka it still implies armys are kpop fans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WHY IS THIS THE FUNNIEST SHIT IVE EVER SEEN  https://t.co/b8V97kv1SP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons disregarding people’s mental and physical health during a pandemic... maybe it’s you who needs to educate yourself before clicking the send button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons funny that you say that since you’re the one saying that fans not being able to stream all the time are at fault if a group disbands, which completely disregards people’s mental &amp; physical health. which you should probably know as a med student don’t you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>karma butterfly is such a good song snsd snapped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kibuphobe emo taemin emo taemin emo taemin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@odetowonderland thank u so much !! honestly I’m not that bothered about what this person has to say, I’ll continue supporting my favs when and where I can 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons you’re literally demanding people to stream right there 😭 acting like they have to keep up in order to consider themselves a fan.. maybe you should think about what you’re saying before you click send tweet and contradict yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons I’m not even telling you how to utilise your time, I’m telling you to not demand others to stream when not everyone has the time to do so. considering you’re a med student you have a surprising lack of reading comprehension skills. again, read the lyrics of pied piper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/cjjWzurbUx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons I love listening to their music too but demanding people to stream it all the time literally takes the fun away from it? if you can’t listen to what your favs said in pied piper then that makes you the worst fan ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/1hApsNOptO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALMOST 2 BILLION EEEEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons @JEN0MILE I’m sorry you don’t have a social life or other commitments so you can’t understand the thread 😢 some of us don’t have the time to stream 24/7 and keep up with everything our favs do and that doesn’t make us less of a fan, sorry our lives don’t revolve around stanning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @haofIeur @JEN0MILE here you dropped this 🔴  https://t.co/GaCrIMgVzW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borrahae7 @btsdigimons @JEN0MILE that’s kind of the point of the thread, people put too much pressure on others to stream all the time so the thread was made to remind people they don’t have to stream 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @haofIeur @JEN0MILE lmaooo BTS is gonna be my first choice too sweetheart I’m so sorry you had to realise you’re a multi too and now you look like a bit of a clown...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @haofIeur @JEN0MILE wow how could you say that 💔💔💔 I’m so hurt I can’t believe you said that I’m gonna go tell my mommy that someone was mean to my on twitter 😢😢😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @haofIeur @JEN0MILE multi means multifandom? the word multi has existed for years, it means that you like more than one thing. being a multi could mean you like a band and a tv show for example. you are by definition a multi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90skths @gothicpjms @strawberno @JEN0MILE I agree, that kinda my point, there’s a lot of pressure to stream constantly when their shouldn’t be because it takes away the fun from listening to music and stanning artists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsdigimons @JEN0MILE you’re 23 and you’re still saying this immature shit on twitter? this thread was about having a social life meaning you can’t keep up with everything all the time but clearly despite being a grown adult you don’t have a life outside stan twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90skths @gothicpjms @strawberno @JEN0MILE that’s great if you can do that because streaming is always good and ig streaming isn’t that hard but it’s unfair to put pressure on people to stream all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90skths @strawberno @JEN0MILE not everyone has the ability to even do that you know 😭 it doesn’t make them any less of a fan if they can’t stream 24/7 and watch all of bts’s content<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why do I have a multi in my mentions trying to say that I can’t have a little 7 in my dn because I’m a multi? what 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @JEN0MILE you literally have other groups as your pfp, header and on your profile? you’re a multi too? 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmjkeey @JEN0MILE great keep streaming! but remember that some people can’t do that all the time and that doesn’t make them any less of a fan! that’s literally all I’m saying lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natasha57O1 @strawberno @JEN0MILE agreed. it’s great to stream and support BTS but it’s unfair to put pressure on others who can’t do that. it’s important to be kind to each other. I respect you too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @JEN0MILE lmaooo not you trying to dictate whether I’m allowed to support BTS or not. it’s fine to stream whenever you have time but some people don’t have that time. please read the lyrics of pied piper to refresh your memory ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90skths @strawberno @JEN0MILE did you not listen to what BTS had to say in pied piper? no point being a “pureblooded” army if you’re gonna disregard BTS’s own words 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natasha57O1 @strawberno @JEN0MILE that’s fair if you can make time for it, but not everyone can. BTS made the song pied piper for this exact reason, it’s perfectly fine to support BTS whenever you can but you shouldn’t let it take priority over your life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmjkeey @JEN0MILE if you don’t have a social life then that’s on you, some of us have other priorities and we don’t have the time to stream constantly and keep up with everything. please go read the lyrics of pied piper if you need a reminder on this ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberno @JEN0MILE wym 🤨 nobody is forced to stream and keep up with everything all the time, we have social lives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TYsredrose yep, we made it out eventually lol but it was very tiring having to stand and wait for the line to move after we had already been standing for the entire concert, rip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TYsredrose I was with a friend so we talked a lot while we waited for the line to move, it was tough though because I saw a few armys who got claustrophobic or anxious because it was so busy :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND I ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE IT HALFWAY DOWN THAT LINE TO LEAVE OMFG I would’ve been there for an hour if I needed to make it to the front 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes because I was stuck in that goddamn line for at least 30 minutes just trying to leave the venue 😭 absolute scenes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elvins_keil @Black_Monaa @wxixp no ones saying that you don’t face danger too. but as someone who lives in London I have to be not only afraid of getting mugged or jumped but also afraid of getting sexually assaulted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToasterCrab @Donicme @wxixp it’s not a stereotype, unfortunately there’s so many men that are fucked up that women can’t trust any men at all because even the ones that look normal are actually creeps. ask any woman or girl and they’ll tell you they’ve been harassed or catcalled at least once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R_ievieB777 @W92Baj @LiberoLiam @Dystant84 @martin_payne @SamCoatesSky how do you know you don’t have covid? a lot of people have it but just don’t show symptoms. and covid has only affected a certain percentage of the British population so far, you could still get it. might as well be careful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberoLiam @Dystant84 @R_ievieB777 @martin_payne @SamCoatesSky but it IS transmitted through droplets. that’s the entire point of masks. they prevent you from spreading droplets everywhere and they prevent other people’s droplets from getting onto your nose or mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyomelettes @BBCVickiYoung weddings can be cancelled and rescheduled. funerals can’t be postponed for months on end. there’s a risk of the virus, sure, but you have no idea how much it hurts when you’re loved one’s friends and family can’t even attend their funeral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R_ievieB777 @martin_payne @SamCoatesSky that’s not true, masks prevent droplets from going everywhere when someone coughs/sneezes/speaks. in many countries, wearing masks was already normalised before the virus because it stops people from spreading or catching anything  https://t.co/gX9w0ixcX6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@M1ck916 @artbecomesyou @AleshaOfficial colour is not irrelevant. it’s your culture, the way you were raised, your life experiences and your background. recognising that he will have faced prejudice &amp; extra challenges as one of only a few black magicians is an important thing to mention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rubyreay @artbecomesyou @AleshaOfficial by recognising they’re a minority in their certain area of talent it’s showing appreciation for their hard work and perseverance. it IS judging him on his talent. it’s hard to keep up with a hobby or job when nobody else comes from the same background as you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastSpellbinder @80zsan @BoredImpy @euphoriabliss_ “most” ? where’s your source for that? and do you not understand how distressing abortions are? it takes a toll on your physical and mental health. it’s not like millions of people are using abortion as contraception because the whole process isn’t fun at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastSpellbinder @BoredImpy @euphoriabliss_ I don’t think you realise how hard it is for someone to give up their own child. even if they know they can’t take care of it. and pregnancy/birth messes with your body majorly + post partum depression exists, etc. abortion needs to be an option for kids and mothers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afriyieau1 @OT7_SUPERIOR @seokjinbit @siyeoncab there are less well known artists who have won a Grammy though! achievements are still a factor to winning but they’re not the only thing, and other groups have also had a strong impact but just not on the same international scale as bts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@innerjikook @daegusavagery @siyeoncab BTS deserves a Grammy but it’s important to realise that while BTS are the biggest kpop group internationally, that doesn’t mean that other groups aren’t also deserving of a Grammy. BTS deserved one even before they were this famous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegutaegist there’s many less famous artists that have won a Grammy though. I’m not saying that fame isn’t a factor to winning because it definitely is, but it’s not the only way to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoongizasativa @OT7_SUPERIOR @seokjinbit @siyeoncab not necessarily! there’s many more “unknown” artists that have won a grammy! fame may be a small factor but its still possible for an artist to win even if they’re not really in the public eye. BTS has deserved one for years so I really hope they get it this time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they played the dynamite mv before the BTS movie started and it really hits different on a big screen with immaculate audio istg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the break the silence movie just ended and everyone was like “awww :( “ lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OT7_SUPERIOR @seokjinbit @siyeoncab people don’t get grammys for fame and impact. they get them for talent. BTS deserves a Grammy because they’re amazingly talented and it’s about time they’re appreciated, but there are many others who are also talented enough to deserve a Grammy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegusavagery @siyeoncab they weren’t even hating on BTS? they said “BTS aren’t the ONLY group” so they still think BTS deserves one but they’re also appreciating the work of others?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastSpellbinder @BoredImpy @euphoriabliss_ contraception doesn’t always work, especially since most people actually use it incorrectly. if someone is forced to carry a child they can’t care for then the child will be at serious risk of neglect. the foster care system is overflowing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spyrothdragon @vivavelo @CJCovfefe @euphoriabliss_ —condoms aren’t foolproof and most people use them incorrectly so it’s still possible to get pregnant —you can’t just say “don’t have sex kids!” and expect that to work + teaching abstinence means that kids don’t get good sex ed so they’re actually more likely to get pregnant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk if I’m gonna make it and there’s only one cinema showing it tomorrow and it’s miles away 😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ilysb_93 @BrkMariMakiiii @SourPine_Apple @j_sa_tara so long story short khbs case can’t end until the police have gotten enough info to prove or not prove if YG affected HSH’s statement &amp; they still need HSH as a reference point so the investigation on khb himself is over but they can’t prosecute yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilysb_93 @BrkMariMakiiii @SourPine_Apple @j_sa_tara YG’s case is linked to his because YG has been accused of intimidating HSH to change her statement back in 2016 since this whole situation started in 2016 but the police literally said they didn’t investigate because khb “wasn’t famous” so they didn’t bother 🤦🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilysb_93 @BrkMariMakiiii @SourPine_Apple @j_sa_tara I had you blocked so I unblocked you to say this lol but he didn’t admit to taking anything, the police never said that and it was random news articles who claimed that. his very first statement on his social media, he said he thought about it but didn’t end up taking anything +<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m glad hsh has dropped off the grid lately and I hope it stays that way even after the cases she’s involved with have been closed. I hope she never gets the chance to ruin another innocent person’s career<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisoosC @AshuriYamamoto @Koreaboo she’s spread false rumours about many idols and has tried to ruin people’s careers. she’s a part of a very radical feminist group in south korea that are really crazy which is probably why she targets male idols. she’s also a dr*g dealer but she gets away with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrkMariMakiiii @ilysb_93 @SourPine_Apple @j_sa_tara he didn’t admit it, he’s denied taking anything from the start and his test came back negative. the investigation stage of his case ended a little while ago after the negative test results but the police are still investigating YG and HSH, so his case is not over<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emmaj_o @eversincesweet @onlytheIouis british people don’t ignore that those problems exist, we think the uk is shit, but we make jokes about America for fun because it’s just as bad over there lmao... like we’re not the only one with a crappy government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xoxoAli10 @OksanasVeins @evesdyke @tomatoesr_nasty @CHRlSTITTIES not taking british gangs seriously is also insensitive af, instead of getting shot at school we get stabbed partly as a result of gangs so it’s just as hurtful.

<|startoftext|>@HeyyyImTy bad people being able to get ahold of weapons illegally doesn’t stop good people getting them? and here in the uk the restrictions on guns makes it extremely hard for people to get them illegally. if America had more restrictions it would be the same for American felons too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OksanasVeins @evesdyke @xoxoAli10 @tomatoesr_nasty @CHRlSTITTIES there’s viral tweets on here that have laughed about british gangs and acted like they’re not serious though, both americans and british people say some unnecessary shit without realising the impact of it, and I say that as someone who’s dual nationality british-American<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeyyyImTy @eversincesweet @onlytheIouis you guys have loads of school shootings so isn’t it obvious to have more gun laws? at least a law which takes away guns from people who have been found guilty of murder, assault, etc? the uk banned guns completely and we can still protect ourselves<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the other place I wanted to go to requires ucas points to apply to a course and considering I’m only doing 2 a levels I feel like I’m not gonna get enough points to get on a course there because my grades are probably gonna flop... oh well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>so I gave up with my ucas form<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glitteryoongyu @nonmooniphobic @everythinvirgos but in this thread they’re saying that armys shouldn’t clapback to antis because it’s a waste of time so why would they do it themselves? and didn’t other group stans say the same thing to BTS a few years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_jeongay @Parkedjimin1 @everythinvirgos but isn’t it really hypocritical for them to complain about kpop stans boasting about their achievements to other fandoms when they’re doing the same thing 🥴<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nonmooniphobic @everythinvirgos exactly 😭 theyre saying that kpop stans only care about numbers and one upping each other but then 2 seconds later they’re saying “BTS is outdoing their faves” ?? they’re describing their own personal issues<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>markiplier has always been peng and I think we as a society need to recognise that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aya_Bonnet @yvfuls I think it’s mainly because some of the genres they’ve used to describe some songs are arguable, e.g. they put run and sea under “hiphop + r&amp;b” when some people might say they’re not really either of those<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s 1am and I have to wake up at 8am tomorrow... am I even gonna survive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not really 😭 but I guess there’s still quite a lot of places that smell like weed skdjjfjfj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>majority of schools yes but when we go to sixth form / sixth form college when we’re about 16-18 years old they usually don’t require uniform but they have strict dress codes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we drink more tea than most places but we don’t actually drink as much as the stereotype, and tea time is traditionally between lunch and dinner but now “tea time” is just another word for dinner time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you won’t believe this but its technically 5 😭 BUT you can only drink on private property &amp; you can’t buy it until ur 16, at 16 you can drink but only at a restaurant &amp; someone else has to buy for you, and at 18 you can do whatever you want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh and some schools have houses but usually only catholic &amp; private schools, I went to a school with houses but most of the time they weren’t really relevant and there was only “rivalry” on sports day at school lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOT AT ALLLLL way too many people come to the uk expecting hogwarts and get disappointed 😭 there are some private schools with uniform &amp; school buildings that looks like hogwarts &amp; we have boarding schools but everything else is completely different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a lot of the chav tiktoks are over exaggerating for comedy but they are pretty bad lol just watch “educating yorkshire” on YouTube and see for yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>she basically doesn’t do anything lol every now and then she has to sign something into law but she doesn’t really reject laws or anything because otherwise we would overthrow the monarchy ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>british people actually love spicy food, our “traditional” food is bland tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McDonald’s for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes lol for us “pants” means underwear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // food  we don’t eat them that often over here but they’re still a common food to eat and there’s lots of shops that sell fish and chips, especially at the seaside/the coast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England: a country Britain: England &amp; Wales Great Britain: England, Scotland, Wales the UK: a union of countries (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that we all drink tea and eat crumpets all the time 😭 and that we’re all rich apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lots especially kids tv shows!! Eastenders &amp; Coronation Street are very famous british dramas that have been televised for decades probably the most famous kids tv shows for my gen are Tracy Beaker, Horrid Henry, Blue Peter, Shaun the Sheep &amp; Horrible Histories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachimmy5 okay, but I would suggest using information that is clearly written to show that these are rumours because a lot of these screenshots describe these rumours as if they’re facts which is a little misleading. but thank you for clarifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tbh it’s really annoying and I’m very insecure about my voice so I’m scared that if I go to the US people will just make fun of me the entire time :( pls stop doing it the joke is old now and half the time you guys get the accents wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes but caffeine does smth to my stomach so I don’t drink it often<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // murder  a murderer guy from a really long time ago, nobody ever found out his identity but he killed a bunch of women in london<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m poor .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sure but I would probably have no idea what’s going on the entire time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celsius makes so much more sense 😭 low number = cold, high number = hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a p*doph*le 💀 although we often use it in a lighthearted way so if a british person calls someone a nonce it depends on the context if they mean it or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a lot of schools require it but depending on ur circumstances &amp; school sometimes you don’t have to do one. most common languages taught are spanish, french, german &amp; mandarin but you can also study ur own language if ur bilingual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cheerleaders: you can go to cheerleading classes but classes aren’t super common and we don’t have big sports events in schools here so we don’t have cheerleading teams prom: yes but only when we’re graduating, we don’t have homecoming or anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do we have what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALWAYSSS especially teenagers and young people lol sometimes they even leave the gates open in some stations so it’s kinda easy and the security guards usually don’t bother stopping you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no not really 😭 it’s crazy how American politicians have merch and stuff like they’re celebrities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact that you guys complain about “McMansions” lmao british people would sell an organ to live in one of those massive houses even if they’re a bit clapped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ny because it doesn’t seem that different to London in some ways so I feel like I could get used to it easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also some people learn about the vietnam war in school so we do get taught world history but still mostly british history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we learn about American history too but mainly british history, most of the stuff we learn is about the Tudor era, Victorian era, the Middle Ages (mostly the plagues in the middle ages lol) and the world wars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>our blocks of flats are similar to the ones you see in New York, New York and London are pretty similar in some of the building styles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. we call them “flats,” to british people an “apartment” is a billion dollar penthouse with marble floors and floor to ceiling windows 2. in the cities lots of people live in flats and even then they’re wayyy too expensive in London rip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t know lmao we still have to buy like life insurance and car insurance over here but I’m only a teenager with no car so it’s really not that important to me rn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>nothing it’s only the tourists that hype it up it’s just a clock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not at all similar lol our suburbs are villages and cute towns, “cottagecore” style usually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>dumb, obsessed with guns, actually believes stereotypes of british people, entitled, superiority complex, but also some of them are h*t 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a nightmare x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // food  we actually have a lot: shepherd’s pie/cottage pie, toad in the hole, chip butties, Eccles cake, Yorkshire puddings, bubble &amp; squeak, laverbread, scotch egg, bread and butter pudding, english breakfast, etc. some of these foods actually slap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, Cambridge, Oxford, Leeds etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we pay for it in taxes but tbh you barely notice you’re paying for it and then if you get hurt or smth everything is free upfront including ambulance, hospital food, medicine etc. you can stay in hospital as long as you need too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // food  yesss we have our own fast food places as well as delicacies such as chip butties 😙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>because the tabloids and weird newspapers create drama but in reality nobody in this country actually cares about the royals that much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES and I still watch their videos sometimes lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh for sure but not as many as america I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>either the royal family did it or someone who had a grudge against her, maybe an ex or something? idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he’s the British equivalent of trump but instead of being obviously racist, misogynistic etc. he tries to hide it LMAOOO all the young people hate him because he keeps screwing us over but the old people like him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // stabbing stabbings  I mean it’s the same situation here except you get st*bbed so... but it doesn’t happen that often in school I honestly just think the american government needs to get its shit together w gun laws lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>definitely not as often as Americans do our accents lol we live in american’s minds rent free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the exams we have to take to get into uni are harder than in America I think but the difficulty of actually getting in is the same, it just depends on how popular or famous the uni is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>usually they’re the school bullies and they peak in secondary school and you never see them again after that, they’re really irritating lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk that’s just the way it is, when you go on an elevator you’re supposed to stand on the left here too &amp; in school corridoors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not all the time in the south but yes all the time in the north 😭 we have weird weather because of where the UK is in the world, so one minute it could be sunny and the next minute it’s snowing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>other way around, young people hate brexit and the old people voted for it and screwed the young people over 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kind of the equivalent of American sats but harder &amp; compulsory &amp; only like 1% of it is multiple choice, the rest is written/essays. most people take like 10 gcses lol we kinda don’t have a choice (maths, English &amp; science are also compulsory subjects)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeystompers yeah for some reason when I google skz every now and then one of the members disappears lol I don’t even know why but it’s been like that for months, they randomly disappear and reappear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachimmy5 please delete this, it’s not a good idea to spread rumours. none of this will get justice for the victims and it probably wont even affect woojin because they’re not serious allegations. its better to focus on the victims, especially the first person who came forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cw // woojin  yall please stop spreading rumours. we should focus on the victims who came forward with their stories, especially the original victim. don’t believe stuff from people saying they’re “sasaengs” or “managers” because this won’t get anyone justice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ughdora the fake company thing has some evidence backing it up though since woojin follows the “company” account on both Instagram and twitter and supposedly he was the first person to follow it, there’s also proof the twt account was created today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ughdora I tweeted this earlier for this exact reason  https://t.co/qKzvyJcgdZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wetneptune I literally watched 2 tarot readings on YouTube a few days ago that said the exact same thing, I’ve had a couple of pretty deep conversations already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starhwaa THE ONE YOU QUOTED IS FAKE THEIR FIRST TWEET WAS AFTER THE OTHER ACCOUNTS FIRST TWEET SO THIS SECOND ONE MUST BE MADE BY SOMEONE WANTING CLOUT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twinkle_Taemint more importantly though I hope you’re okay and I’m so sorry that happened to you thank you for caring &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey can we stop making jokes about british accents now 😄 I’m very insecure about my accent and my voice and I’m afraid of getting made fun of if I ever go to America where half of my family live thank u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MICR0S0FT3RR0R @mxnalie @xboydivisionx we literally can’t tell the difference between American accents though, they all sound the same to me and half of my family is American 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboydivisionx agree but can Americans also stop making fun of our issues like gangs and knife crime too while we’re at it because those are equally as shit 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NlCKIPINK I doubt that jyp “does” anything to make sure their kicked idols can’t join another company but it’s probably just the fact that other companies are unlikely to benefit from accepting a kicked idol so it’s extremely rare for an idol to bounce back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>obviously woojin’s career can perish either way but make sure to focus on the victim’s story here since that’s most important, spreading rumours about other things isn’t going to help the victim get justice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall the whole “woojin made a fansite pregnant” thing has been a rumour that’s been going around since he left 10 months ago so take it with a grain of salt because since then I haven’t seen any evidence of that being true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_bts_joa @Day_sunflower2 @jjhzcl @cookytata0017 @STlCKYNOTE @jksdoIl also considering South Korean media it’s very unlikely that this victim will be able to hide their identity if they take the accusations further, especially because SK police don’t take much caution to protect people’s privacy. it’s a tricky situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_bts_joa @Day_sunflower2 @jjhzcl @cookytata0017 @STlCKYNOTE @jksdoIl unfortunately it’s not that easy... there’s already been the threat of legal action against the person who accused him and the potential that the victim could be sued. not everyone can afford to pay legal costs to take something like this to court either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovminnies  https://t.co/GB5v8IeYWt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjhzcl @cookytata0017 @STlCKYNOTE @jksdoIl I agree! believe the victim right away but keep checking for more evidence as the situation develops<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kunsbffie @sansdesi that’s true, I agree with that, the way he phrased his post overall is not a good way of addressing the situation and it makes him seem more suspicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosieschild_zyx that’s why I said “seems to be” since some of the Chinese tweets are questionable, I’m not denying that he could still have done these things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosieschild_zyx Chinese people do have twitter, countless people in China use a VPN to access banned social media platforms. but everything else is correct, right now he seems to be innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sansdesi if he knows for a fact he hasn’t visited a bar or somewhere similar recently, and if he knows he hasn’t met up with someone in that way lately. I still know where you’re coming from but the way he phrased it could mean “met” in a different way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookytata0017 @STlCKYNOTE @jksdoIl it’s still good to believe the victim but take it with a grain of salt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sansdesi I see what you mean but he could’ve meant “met them” as in “met up with them somewhere”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RanMaries @Serly_2001 @ElsisyaM @kchartsofficial @BTS_twt they’ve had more than one hit in their career! love scenario was the only one to earn PAKs but they earned at least one CAK from their debut song My Type, had many rooftop hits with other songs &amp; their predebut songs charted highly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamPURPLE_PINK @lmnblng @vantehobi_ @HANBINSLSD they didn’t get PAK for their other songs but they have gotten CAK (certified all kill) and rooftop hits. their other songs were still successful but didn’t meet the criteria for a PAK as PAKs are pretty hard to achieve!  https://t.co/5i9Bx6ISKQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ariflrt @HANBINSLSD you do realise that ikonics WANT ikon to disband, right? so they can leave their shitty management? 💀 thank you for your support ikonic borahae ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qwertytaex @HANBINSLSD they got the monster rookie title with My Type not Love Scenario, aka ikon have several hit songs... please do your research before clicking send tweet next time ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamPURPLE_PINK @lmnblng @vantehobi_ @HANBINSLSD nope, ikon had countless hits other than love scenario and the poor management from YG ent means that they’ve had several hiatuses so they haven’t been able to reach their true potential. they’re still one of the top bgs in Korea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>armykonics how we doing 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1022Hanbins @evilcyphers @jiwonsnatchwigs @verseryu ikonic delete this 😁 you’re setting ikon up to get dragged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daegusavagery @verseryu nope, armys have been dragging ikon after BTS best iKON’s record, both fandoms are in the wrong here as armys should celebrate without mentioning others and OP shouldn’t have tweeted this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJinieee18 @paragonbiiin @evilcyphers @jiwonsnatchwigs @verseryu my type, their debut song, did very well on charts and it was a hit! it earned them the title “monster rookie” their predebut songs from the survival shows they were on also topped charts both BTS and iKON have many hit songs because they’re both very talented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taehyungberry1 @evilcyphers @jiwonsnatchwigs @verseryu agreed, I’m tired of fanwars, both groups are record breakers so who cares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>being an armykonic on stan twitter is a daily struggle  https://t.co/EVdcloRnqh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanbintual I know but armchairs are always like that lmaoooo it’s the insecurity 😴 it’s better to ignore them tbh because they’ll accuse us of shit rather than admitting they started it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spectator there shouldn’t be a “debate” over whether people deserve human rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND ANOTHER 2 HOURS 25 MINUTES IN HISTORY ON FRIDAY WITH A NEW TEACHER RHAT I DONT EVEN KNOW YET FUUUUCKKK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trviaidol white t shirt + U&amp;I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrjfleur for some reason my bias is almost always the leader/rapper/producer for the group lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topspittinwraps also the phrasing &amp; wording of his tweets after the platforms tweet seem to be hinting towards the idea that he’s talking about a human rights issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topspittinwraps but Tyler’s whole career is based off of using his platform to speak about mental health so fans haven’t been asking him to use his platforms for that issue. so the original tweet has to have been about something else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fall_bobby no problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fall_bobby after a little while he tweeted this apologising and claiming his tweets weren’t about human rights. also on another note he’s already been in controversy lately because he keeps having big family get togethers with no masks or social distancing  https://t.co/iP5GmFIgPa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fall_bobby he then posted a bunch of tweets talking about mental health but it looks like he’s trying to use his mental state as an excuse for not talking about BLM (take that as you will, interpret this as you want)  https://t.co/MGUEQYi4po<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fall_bobby it started with this tweet, which made people upset because it seems like he’s making fun of the fans who have been asking him to spread awareness about BLM. ++  https://t.co/vZbYenz7e3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@131JINKI try keeping something that smells nice near your bed or under your pillow, e.g. a small bag of lavender. also here’s something I got from my cbt therapy sessions!  https://t.co/ePBpsRmYfs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blinkacarat sometimes I can find it funny but I’m also really insecure about my voice &amp; accent so the fact that we live in american’s brains rent free really doesn’t help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Revenge_era_02 @kamekkinnie um? it’s most likely he got them from dollskill since it’s the most major seller of that kind of fashion. if you simply connecting the dots with the context of his tweet... it sucks to have to see someone you looked up to in a different light but you gotta do it at some point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWins2020_ @lTZYZZ no ones obligated to have a discussion with you especially when your username has the name of someone with an extremely racist, misogynistic etc. history. if you want a civil debate then don’t chase after someone who shut that conversation down already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Revenge_era_02 @kamekkinnie they’re on the dollskill website, I don’t think they were made by dollskill so there’s a possibility he didn’t buy them from there but it would be the most obvious place he would’ve bought them from  https://t.co/GvCphXjFNK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lTZYZZ .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go to fucking bed I’m anxious and stressed to the point it’s making me physically ill I got only 4 hours or so of sleep last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>who’s tyler joseph? I don’t know a tyler joseph  https://t.co/gJgd8RlIvd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this tweet aged like milk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at this point I’d really like to see tyler joseph’s work and career go up in flames so I’ll start collecting firewood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so basically I’m either gonna be selling my tøp merch and collecting a bag or its autumn bonfire time baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you clearly have no fucking respect after tweeting that insensitive shit earlier and still not deleting it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>literally destroying every shred of respect I had left for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you can fight for other shit too please shut the fuck up please I’m fucking begging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU THINK THE REST OF US ARENT STRUGGLING TOO? BUT WE STILL HAVE THE COMMON FUCKING DECENCY TO SPEAK UP FOR OTHER PEOPLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFFFFFUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKK YYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOUUUUUU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the point is not alienating your poc fans and actually doing something as simple as tweeting a petition link but instead you’re spending your time typing bs paragraphs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOUR ENTIRE CAREER IS BASED ON PREACHING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH BUT YOURE MAKING US ALL LOOK LIKE A FUCKING JOKE BY USING IT AS AN EXCUSE FOR YOUR INSENSITIVE UNEDUCATED COMMENTS &amp; YOUR SILENCE ON BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylerrjoseph don’t preach on mental health when you literally just tweeted out something that is making fun of an issue which affects black people’s lives daily and destroys their mental health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you know what’s also a priority? spreading awareness on global issues like black lives matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>once again, fuck tyler joseph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Super1man234 that’s the point, Tyler isn’t focusing on real issues and social justice and is instead making fun of the people who have asked him to use his platform to spread awareness on issues that affect so many of his fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamekkinnie also it’s likely that he bought those shoes from dollskill which is an anti black brand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamekkinnie tweeted this, which seems to be making fun of the people who have been asking him to use his platform to speak on BLM + other global issues  https://t.co/vZbYenz7e3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fuck this I’m going to bed I’ve been through far too much today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaewonstattoos @hanbinikoni @tbzgotbey @audra_smiley @veIvetvs @tbzpin @joyuosly yes, apparently tbzpin buys sasaeng information  https://t.co/ovuyP7VAG5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanbinikoni @Jaewonstattoos @tbzgotbey @audra_smiley @veIvetvs @tbzpin @joyuosly the original person who had the photos was @/yumi_binic (and the whole backstory how they got those pics is still shady &amp; yumi is a rumoured sasaeng) but then tbzpin shared them with her friends too so tbzpin is still violating hanbin’s privacy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IceyRat @candyshorts comparing and contrasting his situation to other commentary channels who haven’t said the n word and been ableist is a pointless argument 💀 and the poki video isn’t the only reason he got banned, he had this shit coming for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IceyRat @candyshorts what he was doing was not criticism lmao he got banned for bullying because that’s exactly what he was doing 🤡 also hate speech and defamation is a crime and the amount of shit he’s said over the years is enough to take his ass to court<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustineDowds @JonathanSKay @IWTheDarkPrince @user31097 2 teachers aren’t enough to prove that every other teacher in the nation did the same. anyway, it’s better to give students the benefit of the doubt because in regular exams, a lot of students work hard last minute and get amazing grades. this year they didn’t get the chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanSKay @IWTheDarkPrince @user31097 you think the teachers knew that the entire country was going into lockdown months before it happened? the coursework offered up as evidence was from late 2019-very early 2020. marking up/down regular schoolwork doesn’t reflect on them as teachers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonathanSKay @IWTheDarkPrince @user31097 they weren’t able to do that. they had to provide adequate reasoning and evidence behind the grades they gave, using the student’s classwork and homework. they couldn’t just hand out grades for free, the students still earned their grades<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@giveurartbreak @wetneptune twin flames &amp; soulmates aren’t always in a romantic relationship, and u can have many soulmates over ur lifetime. ur soulmate/twin flame could be a friend or family member, for example. I guess it’s kind of a test of time to see if someone is ur soulmate/twin flame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giveurartbreak @wetneptune twin flames often have an instant connection/friendship with each other, but they might have disagreements at first. in the end they’ll overcome any disagreements. in a twin flame relationship, one person has masculine energy and the other has feminine energy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thiccSeok_twt @todoryong @GAYLIlLHYUCK yeah, this news about the stadium being built has been misinterpreted, it’s cool that the stadium has basically been inspired by BTS’s (and kpop’s) global demand but overall it’s not really for BTS lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thiccSeok_twt @todoryong @GAYLIlLHYUCK overall BTS might hold concerts at the stadium if they want to perform outside of Seoul since it’s being built in the province around Seoul, but to be honest if it was being built for BTS they would’ve made something bigger 😭 it’s more of a general concert venue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thiccSeok_twt @todoryong @GAYLIlLHYUCK that’s the point though, yes of course the stadium is being built partly because of BTS but not only for them. SK realised they needed more concert venues after seeing BTS’s global tour but this stadium capacity is less than half the size of what BTS has been selling out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nmjnslvt the stadium isn’t being built *for* BTS though. South Korea saw their world tour and realised that SK didn’t have many big venues. so the stadium is being built partly because of BTS, but not for them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrixieBeez @STANDBYH1M okay but let’s get back to the crucial point of you dismissing someone’s sexual assault allegation. sexual assault is a crime and it’s extremely comfortable and even terrifying for someone to experience. take it seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>is nothing sacred to 2020? nothing at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrixieBeez @STANDBYH1M it’s still sexual harassment. nobody is cancelling him, people are asking him to respond to these allegations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigHittedstan yes that’s true, BTS have made kpop more popular and more talked about 100% , but kpop was still well known before then. which is why I think it’s a bit ignorant / potentially xenophobic to say that BTS made kpop relevant when they actually made it more popular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to be completely honest I would celebrate if exams are cancelled next year because I get anxious as fuck during exams and I’m probably gonna get a shit grade anyway so might as well collect my shit grade without having to suffer through exams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyingJiiwon live footage of ikon rn  https://t.co/TxqN6ksPL7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way there’s still no mention of ikon at all omg either they’ve been put in the dungeon again until further notice orrrr they’re leaving the company 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elena12193913 @edeneterna maybe, but it’s a good step forward in the kpop industry for more idols to be open about their sexuality, gender identity and pronouns. Korea is still a pretty conservative country so some people might not take it well but a lot of people will probably support him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>funny how people who apparently don’t support ikon anymore will still tweet shady stuff about them constantly? so what’s the truth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&amp; also lowkey dragging ikon as well like how are you gonna drag his bestfriends like that? they’re a brotherhood can you even call yourself a binic if you’re gonna be shady towards ikon?? 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sorry but it’s kinda weird to me how some binics will go out of their way to tweet about how they don’t support ikon anymore 😐 anyways...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanbinsdoremi oh and their debut was postponed several times too! which could mean their contract start date was a while before their actual debut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanbinsdoremi there’s a debate if it’s 2021 or 22 but because a debut is planned &amp; prepared for several months in advance they probably formed their contracts before their debut, so the contracts could expire sometime in 2021 🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>redebut as 7 under 131 label I think 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also because it’s rumoured that ikon’s contracts expire next year omg they’re escaping the dungeon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s the way they didn’t mention ikon AT ALL though even though they bring in a good amount of revenue esp with concerts... they’re leaving I’m manifesting it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so basically they’re saying ikon is leaving YG by next year then 😁 strapping on my clown shoes now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>socially distanced concerts aka heaven for people with anxiety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erie_pink at Wembley last year they had a seated floor area so tbh I think this is fully possible for a BTS concert! they might have to perform more days or something to keep up with demand but it could work<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MonkeyM76370285 @StuartDillon1 @alexforeurope France literally tries to turn almost all their refugees back to the dangerous places they came from so of course they’ll try to come to the UK where they have a better chance. no matter what, if someone is coming from a country with starvation, war etc. they’re a refugee.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@101lestat @PeterTAGray @alexforeurope @Labour4EU France treats refugees arguably even worse than the UK. many of them get denied documentation to stay there and France tries to send them back to the death trap they’re escaping from. overall there’s probably more opportunities for refugees here in comparison to France<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dankennik @alexforeurope it’s not illegal if you’re an asylum seeker. asylum seekers can be granted documentation when they arrive at a place offering safe harbour. that’s literally how asylum works. plus, France often refuses to give asylum seekers documentation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkeyM76370285 @StuartDillon1 @alexforeurope also English is a more commonly spoken language than french so some asylum seekers may already know some English, so it would make sense for them to go to a place where they already have a rough understanding of the main language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkeyM76370285 @StuartDillon1 @alexforeurope because France treats refugees like crap, arguably worse than the UK does. plus, different countries have different healthcare systems, job opportunities etc. of course asylum seekers will look for the place where they have the best chances of survival.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@izzydoodlez @ratlmao hmm, I think it’s because pronouns don’t always equal gender identity either? I’m not really sure either though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love London but this place is scary as fuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzydoodlez @ratlmao for example, someone could describe themselves as a lesbian and have a female name, but might still prefer to be referred to with they/them pronouns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzydoodlez @ratlmao name &amp; sexual orientation don’t always equal pronouns, there are people with pronouns other than she/her who would also describe themselves as lesbian or use a typically female name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verityadriana sometimes... but to be honest, the maid costumes those girls were wearing aren’t really what “sex workers” wear. but yeah, be aware that both boys and girls end up going down this path and getting preyed upon by creepy adults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSHINEEGIRL people under 18 have always gotten free or at least discounted travel on public transport in London, but now the government wants to “temporarily” take it away from kids aged 11-18. lots of kids live miles away from their schools so now they’ll have to pay lots to get there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Telegraph using technology as a scapegoat for the pressure put on young people by crap institutions and the damage caused by previous generations is getting overused and boring at this point. we’re depressed because the government sucks and the adults don’t care, not because of our phones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Puppiesandmocha @BlackedHatGuy @Freeeed02564033 @Telegraph ++ baby boomers in particular had very little difficulty finding work due to the massive economic growth back then, in comparison gen z as well as millennials have faced recessions and mass unemployment. we have no choice to work hard to find work and survive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verityadriana unfortunately there are little boys who have a similar experience and debut as idols at a very young age. to be honest I don’t think it’s just a Japan problem either, take a look at kid’s beauty pageants in the UK and USA &amp; Hollywood as a whole<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TevitaMartin @TheMapReader @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus humans beings are more than just a number, 400 people = hundreds more loved ones who lost someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TevitaMartin @TheMapReader @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus “struck not killed” is my point, you can’t compare how many people are *struck* by lightning to how many are *killed* in cold water, it’s common sense? and I’m sure you wouldn’t be so dismissive if it was your friend or family member who died<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiwaBudda @TevitaMartin @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus lmao I guess that’s something you don’t really have to worry about then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TevitaMartin @TheMapReader @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus I think you’ll find only about 2 people get killed by lightning a year compared to 400 killed in cold water, if you genuinely think you can compare 2 to 400 then you should consider retaking primary school  https://t.co/8x1I5Cuijw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiwaBudda @TevitaMartin @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus sure, but way too many people just jump in without a second thought<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TevitaMartin @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus healthy people die of cold water shock every year, please know what you’re talking about before replying to me next time. at least I’m not gonna die of cold water shock or Covid like all those dumbasses not social distancing on the beach  https://t.co/Rm5IGA0l9A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Capt_Kremin @mayamayadeath @BABYMETAL_JAPAN hopefully they’ll include her if they use old content from before she left, cause she’s still part of the history of the group after all. but yeah unless she rejoins BM we probably won’t be getting any new pictures of them together as 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMapReader @TevitaMartin @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus a quick google search would’ve given you your answer but I guess I gotta do that for you  https://t.co/BO6e5BYk3r<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TevitaMartin @AlisonM54321 @brightonargus lifeguards, the RNLI and all water safety organisations say that jumping into cold water is dangerous. tons of people die each summer because they get cold water shock. it’s called not being a reckless idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Capt_Kremin @mayamayadeath @BABYMETAL_JAPAN sure, but she won’t be on the promotional materials for babymetal anymore. kinda sucks of course but it was her own decision to leave so she can’t be expected to promote with the group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I demand compensation from every wanker on that beach, why should I have to suffer the consequences of their actions 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so when we have a second wave in winter and none of us can see our families and friends during the winter holidays and celebrations... 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT ARE YOU LOT SMOKINGGGGG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EB0YBAEK bold of you to think they can sing or have any form of career in the music industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayamayadeath @BABYMETAL_JAPAN she might still be featured in the footage for metal resistance episode X if they decide to do a full recap of the past decade of babymetal’s performances though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayamayadeath @BABYMETAL_JAPAN yes, but since she left babymetal and is on hiatus it means that 1. they can’t make new promotional images with yuimetal, so she can’t be on merch like the postcards here, and 2. they might not have the legal rights to use her name or image<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayamayadeath @BABYMETAL_JAPAN since she left the group, it’s unlikely they have the rights to use her image or name on any new merchandise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nabiindaeyo break the silence movie is coming out soon! theyre doing a rerun of bring the soul in some cinemas too. BTS are gonna be performing at the VMAs on August 30th + they’re nominated for best choreo, best pop and best kpop. the new brand “tinytan” is gonna be releasing something soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4lm4c3 @h_hollylujah @Bradm25925003 @Telegraph that has nothing to do with this debate or cancel culture, you’re just looking for an excuse to shit on a movement seeking immediate reform and change. that’s another conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way they were doing the most to censor the HK protests and now their market value is nosediving 😍 satisfying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ah so tencent won’t be able to make money from the USA anymore... lmao karma’s a bitch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ultkeyk and when kibum creates a tiktok? what then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@probabIyasIeep technically that’s allowed though? you’re allowed to form a “bubble” with another family lmao. and you can’t really compare two kids playing together with an entire school with hundreds of kids spreading their germs around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a wise man once said, “fuck the government and fuck boris”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jintopiia nah cause it’s the way the gov wrote a whole paragraph saying they realise that a lot of students are struggling because they’re from poorer backgrounds, are SEN etc. but then said that adjusting for that is “difficult” so they’re doing nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maryammkx universities are gonna have to let us in with D grades at this rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithxliver also a lot of schools don’t really let students take 4 a levels because of the sheer amount of work &amp; time that goes into it, so unless you get stunning GCSE grades/convince them when you apply/go to a private or posher school, they might not allow you more than 3 anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithxliver 3 and an EPQ. 3 a levels on its own is a struggle so 4 is near impossible, a lot of people who start with 4 end up dropping to 3. EPQ only takes up the first year of a levels so it’s an extra qualification that doesn’t really distract from ur a levels + good on uni application<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VianneWalker @gracelisabethx why isn’t it clicking for you that if you keep supporting the tories they’ll keep screwing you over? the tories don’t care about you, love. if you don’t support what their ministers are doing then don’t support the party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>still can’t believe I have to go back to school in less than a month but the gov is still saying we don’t have to wear a mask there, still hasn’t adapted a levels to account for lost time &amp; my school hasn’t even told us our timetable x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yumi_Binic lmao still unclear if it was just the ad agency’s policy alone that is at fault or if Seoul metro’s policy itself would stop the ad from being broadcasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why do I feel unwell literally every evening it’s so tiring at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah idc what boris or the teachers say I’m at least gonna be wearing a mask in school lmao no point in exams if I d word from covid before I can do them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daryyyyyll @QuentinBlink @summertaemin that’s true, but since it encapsulates a lot of other genres it can still be argued that it’s not a genre in its own right. I guess it depends on how you look at it but imo it’s more of a category or description of music rather than a whole genre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daryyyyyll @QuentinBlink @summertaemin pop is a genre, kpop is just pop music in korean lol so it doesn’t really qualify as its own genre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also there’s a trend of having a “rapper” in every kpop group but sometimes these idols should just stick to vocals im sorry 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>quite a lot of kpop songs have unnecessary rap parts and sometimes the songs would be better without them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the way that tr*mp doesn’t even send prayers or good wishes for Australia and instead says “look guys they have a second wave so that means I’m better 😎” is just evidence that this dude is a narcissistic asshole who doesn’t give a fuck about anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plenkless @KimSussex3 @MetroUK it could’ve been one of their last chances to see their daughter, what’s not clicking? would you not visit your family member if they’re on the brink of death? there are stories of doctors unfairly turning off life support, sometimes you gotta fight for your relative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plenkless @KimSussex3 @MetroUK so when you’re on your deathbed you’re saying that you wouldn’t want to see your family?  the way that the police used force caused the man to have a heart attack and he was later de arrested. if the police’s tactic for dealing with a grieving man is to strap him to a trolley...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plenkless @KimSussex3 @MetroUK deal with it by giving the family time with their daughter??? they had been told she was being taken off life support only 30 minutes before. and the brute force they used wasn’t necessary either, the wife was dragged to the ground and the husband strapped to a trolley.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryRashford1 @Humblebumble22 @Councillorsuzie @MailOnline don’t the police wear the exact same gear for the exact same reason? and don’t the police use that to intimidate black people? but when the public does it back to try and get their voices heard, it’s suddenly a bad thing...? 🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dreaminmewgulf @desukidesu 95f is 35c lmao it was 35-36°c in the UK on Friday. air conditioning is practically nowhere to be found in the UK and we’re stuck in houses designed to keep heat inside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snackmaster35 @dojasbigtoe @alias_1431 @Kit_Fisto__ @shikyonohana @desukidesu that’s not true lol, when we say “built to keep heat in” we don’t just mean insulation. houses in typically hotter countries have thinner walls for example. british houses are literally designed to trap heat inside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BelladykeVK @seafl00r it’s still pretty wrong for an adult to wait until a minor turns 18, it’s still kind of predator behaviour...  but at 18, you’re a legal adult. there’s nothing wrong about a relationship between two adults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelladykeVK @seafl00r 16 is borderline a child. anyone under 18 is not fully matured and therefore not prepared to have a relationship with an adult. any adult who flirts with someone under 18 is a creep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelladykeVK @seafl00r if someone over 20 was willingly flirting with you, a 16 year old... you were preyed upon :/ it’s not okay for a grown adult to genuinely flirt with a minor, no matter where you’re from or what language you speak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>if this doesn’t go to BTS or normani I call bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>okay so rosalía did get a nomination even if it wasn’t for best latin... she better win this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbombalurina @folklore_69 @suna7twt @taek6o @PopCrave aren’t we talking about the VMAs not MTV, please pay attention to the conversation if you’re gonna keep replying 💀 the fact that only individual artists have been nominated doesn’t mean that a group can’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbombalurina @folklore_69 @suna7twt @taek6o @PopCrave here’s a group currently at number 2 on billboard’s artist 100 chart. 💀 a group or band can technically be nominated for best artist  https://t.co/Up3bdTNDCM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if loc doesn’t win I’m gonna be real mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbombalurina @folklore_69 @suna7twt @taek6o @PopCrave Asian acts winning awards on American award shows? also an artist doesn’t mean just one person in all contexts lmao so a group or band could still be nominated for best artist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folklore_69 @suna7twt @taek6o @itsbombalurina @PopCrave you’re the one crying, when BTS sweeps the awards you’ll be popping a vein  https://t.co/TMhhYnRcbV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folklore_69 @suna7twt @taek6o @itsbombalurina @PopCrave American award shows aren’t just for Americans, people from other nationalities can get nominated &amp; they have entire separate categories for them e.g Best Latin &amp; Best Kpop. you just wanna exclude Asian acts cause you’re xenophobic and jealous lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wworldwiidek @bbomchxcolat @Aya22662771 @toxicbIink every celebrity has some parts of themselves they don’t show to fans.

<|startoftext|>@Ioonacatchers damn really? 😔 the 3ds xl too or just the 3ds? it’s so annoying how Nintendo discontinues features on their older consoles even when they’re not that old skdjfjfk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if I manage to get the 3ds I want before taemin’s cb then you better believe I’ll be streaming on that too LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>especially because this is a pre release single so we can’t just buy the album right away. it’s really important to stream and it will really help more people get interested in his music so that the album will be successful once it’s released too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>shawols we need to step up the game for taemin’s comeback, he’s worked so hard for this and we’ve had plenty of time to prepare so pls take a few minutes out of your day every day to stream his comeback<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>okay so in all seriousness I think taemin’s story might have something to do with twins?? no idea about why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>taemin is pregnant with two Caucasian children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lmaooo the way I searched “taemin story” on twitter and there’s 19384884 shawols puzzling over wtf is going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>taemin’s ig story????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my legs and feet hurt SO MUCH rn I walked for so long today 😭 worth it tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NgviYpn @ChristianBankh2 @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira if you feel targeted or hurt when a woman says “I hate men” then you are the exact kind of man we’re talking about lmao if the shoe fits wear it! this conversation is now muted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @prodvslut @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira ur missing the point again 😭 ur not oppressed sir, women are, so women make jokes about men because we are oppressed by men 😭😭 you can’t equate a “joke” about an actual oppressor and murderer to oppressed people discussing their oppression in a lighthearted way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @ohmygayrl @NgviYpn @lolybit @AsaNotAkira “I hate men” ≠ “I hate ALL men.” two different statements. I’m sorry you were hurt by women and I’m not denying that women can be abusive too. but a lot of “jokes” directed at women are tasteless and insensitive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @NgviYpn @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira point is that men have said things like that about women for decades, even centuries. women turning those comments on their head and redirecting them at men doesn’t mean we genuinely hate men or will act on that. straight women say they “hate men” but obviously aren’t serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @NgviYpn @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira put it this way: if a victim of bullying makes a joke about their bully, it’s no big deal right? it’s just a coping mechanism, it doesn’t make them a bully too. but if a bully makes a joke about their victim, it’s a bit....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoongicable @UGHTAELISA @jmstime @whykelsey @Luckyjoon0 @elysianatz @jonghoswhore okay I agree with that. it’s fair to not limit them to one genre. but I’ve seen wayyy too many btspoppers who seriously crap all over other kpop artists. as long as you use the idea to not push hate on anyone then that’s fine but there’s definitely a lot of toxic btspoppers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UGHTAELISA @yoongicable @jmstime @whykelsey @Luckyjoon0 @elysianatz @jonghoswhore I know that locals have a problem with kpop which is why I’m saying BTS has helped to break some of those boundaries. they don’t need to fit the standards of xenophobic people + the locals will always perceive BTS as kpop so it’s a losing battle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @ohmygayrl @NgviYpn @lolybit @AsaNotAkira women saying “I hate men” is a coping mechanism for the things we have to deal with. when we say that we mean “I hate the way some men are raised and how some of them perpetuate bad behaviour.” if a man takes “I hate men” personally, then.... if the shoe fits 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @NgviYpn @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira where did I say that all men hate women lmao idk where you got that from? but men who say “I hate women” as a “joke” are ignorant of the fact there ARE men who actually hate women and are a danger to us so of course we’ll be suspicious of anyone who says that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UGHTAELISA @yoongicable @jmstime @whykelsey @Luckyjoon0 @elysianatz @jonghoswhore that’s literally my point though lmao yall btspoppers act like “kpop group” is a bad word 😐 BTS have already broken so many boundaries and stereotypes surrounding kpop so they deserve credit for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NgviYpn @ChristianBankh2 @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira if a man says “I hate women,” how else are women supposed to interpret that other than be wary or suspicious of them? there’s way too many men who actually hate women and act out on that through violence. if you wanna be considered an asshole by every woman around you, go ahead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaeyummie @btancvlt @AtoZfanboi @lavander_exe @whykelsey @diorzkv @elysianatz @jonghoswhore again though, suggesting that BTS have “outgrown” kpop is belittling other Asian artists from the genre. BTS have also said they don’t mind being called an artist or an idol or being considered kpop. BTS have broken so many stereotypes &amp; records in kpop which is a great thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBankh2 @ohmygayrl @lolybit @AsaNotAkira nobody is genuinely hating men here, the oppressed are allowed to make jokes and comments about the oppressor without it being discrimination. “hating men” because of years of objectification and discrimination is not the same as men who hate women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmstime @whykelsey @Luckyjoon0 @elysianatz @jonghoswhore BTS aren’t the only group being called kpop when they don’t exclusively make pop music. plus, being called a kpop idol isn’t a limitation and it shouldn’t be seen as such. BTS are one of the main groups changing viewpoints on kpop and they should be credited for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikrok00ksmos @AtoZfanboi @lavander_exe @whykelsey @diorzkv @elysianatz @jonghoswhore the issue here isn’t thinking that BTS is the best. the problem is thinking that BTS are “above” kpop and other Asian artists and therefore attempting to consider them as their own genre. but I agree BTS get tons of hate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btancvlt @AtoZfanboi @lavander_exe @whykelsey @diorzkv @elysianatz @jonghoswhore BTS isn’t the only group that gets placed in the kpop genre when they don’t make exclusively pop music. btspoppers are toxic because they act as if kpop outside of BTS is somehow below them — belittling the work and talent of poc artists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact it’s almost been a year since x1’s flash :( I don’t stan but they blew up really quick even though they just debuted, they were legendary :((<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>this sounds like it could be the soundtrack for a really cute studio ghibli film 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanillance that’s a nice backstory for how you got into shinee !! lmao I’m a slightly newer fan so I haven’t caught up with the older jokes but I’ll probably never be able to listen to Sherlock without hearing that now 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ok so I never heard about this before and I just listened to Sherlock to see what everyone’s talking about and I’m laughing my ass off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanillance agreed, I think people who aren’t shawols don’t really understand when we refer to him in present tense but i think it’s something good and unique about shawols, that we can appreciate him in the here &amp; now because his impact on us hasn’t changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s not the greatest but it gives me Avril lavigne vibes kinda so it makes it bearable lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me too! or at least I’ll smile at the moon when I see it &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY now if every shawol starts appreciating password then maybe it’ll make it to shinee’s world tour setlist 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyways back to my btshinee agenda  https://t.co/mWMsZGOCc8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BECAUSE THERES NO WAY—<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>literally though, I guess shinee sang it with a lot of emotion so it rubs off on you when you listen to it? idk but it has a sad song vibe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall have no taste in fashion or style, that lasagna hair was SUPERIOR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanillance jonghyun s*saeng 😤 can’t believe he wrote a song about the roach’s personal life like that smh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>obviously it was probably someone just pretending to be him onstage cause they were wearing a mask or whatever but did nobody notice him walking between them by their seats lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so at the twenty one pilots concert I went to last year tyler did this thing where he was onstage and then the lights went out and then suddenly he was standing in the block of seats I was in and I still don’t know how he did that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meisie13uit @bluevlade1 @Ade_HRV @Paula2517539517 @RobKerrigan6 @BBCDanielS she was 15 and told that she could live a life with no exams and no pressure to get a job and live her life all expenses paid. countless 15 year olds would’ve fallen for that idea, especially after months of grooming. nobody is immune to manipulation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meisie13uit @bluevlade1 @Ade_HRV @Paula2517539517 @RobKerrigan6 @BBCDanielS *WAS* okay with it. she was a child and she was manipulated and groomed.  strange how the government was so desperately looking for these kids who were manipulated into going to Syria but as soon as they find one she’s apparently not a victim anymore and it’s her fault.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eatsmokes he probably did it on purpose since it’s supposed to look like liquid hand sanitizer. he also did a similar drip effect for the sneezing rat on the train, it’s intentional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitsuneMetal Kagerou!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eatsmokes @TanyaNisa @Telegraph I feel like he may have made it look like that on purpose, it’s not the first time he’s used that technique in his work  https://t.co/8eq4p48BtN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonZev @greaserleo @theousherwood @MayorofLondon @TfL banksy recently did an artwork for a UK hospital and it’s going to be auctioned off to raise money for the NHS. it’s not a gimmick, it’s an opportunity. if you fail to see that then I wonder how often you miss out on similar opportunities<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonZev @greaserleo @theousherwood @MayorofLondon @TfL it would be an ideal world if TfL was properly funded but they AREN’T, which is why they had to accept a government bailout with nasty strings attached to avoid bankruptcy a few months ago. they threw hundreds of thousands of pounds away by getting rid of this artwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TanyaNisa @Telegraph nope, it’s a genuine banksy. look at the rat stencil. here’s the YouTube video  https://t.co/CmRBoBffZj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utd_nv @DanM______ @Telegraph sure it requires the train to stop at the specific station to see the full message, but that doesn’t mean it “doesn’t make sense.” tube trains stop at the same station several times a day &amp; the doors open in the same place on the platform each time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sunhfarm @colaflower2 because there are many words that would always be trending if twitter allowed them to, twitter makes sure that commonly used words can’t trend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binhwanpic she became a fansite for a new idol and blocked every ikonic she could find for no reason... so much for “staying true”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@echosvn I even tried to squish it before it went under my wardrobe but the attempt failed arghhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starryforhhj this happens on a regular basis 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a spider just ran across my bedroom floor and went under my wardrobe and it made me really anxious and made me start crying and now I’m sleeping downstairs! ✨🌸🙈🧚‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>so in the past like 3 days I’ve broken both my electric fan AND my alarm clock? which random object in my room will be the next victim? find out next episode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHUANG_Official congrats yifan! deserved! I hope her injury heals soon  don’t watch a competition that’s based on popularity vote if you’re gonna be mad when the most popular trainees win ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hana__131 @CHUANG_Official don’t call yourself a binic when you throw hate to others even while hanbin receives hate exactly like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newayssoum @Oogoedaimeng @Bae_Aruem @CHUANG_Official they’re called TRAINEES for a reason??? they’re not debuting right away and they’ll have the opportunity to adjust to being idols. yifan deserved to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cottonbunny07 @CHUANG_Official she’s literally a trainee and the group haven’t “officially” debuted by releasing a song/album yet so they’ll all get the chance to train more 🤨 yifan deserved to debut, the least you can do is congratulate her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my baby since the start of the competition, she snapped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall start tweets with “no hate but” and then start hating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cpop twitter is so weird and bitter I’m social distancing from it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>first time watching pdcamp and 2/5 of my top picks made it 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanillance @xueerism yeah I’ve seen some confusion about her name cause her name is Zhang Yifan! I hope it ends soon too, it’s not her fault that another trainee unfortunately didn’t get to debut this time around...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall get sooooo invested in a competition based on popularity vote but then throw a tantrum when someone wins because they’re popular 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanillance @xueerism the 2020 produce camp finals ended a few hours ago but this year there were only 7 trainees who got to debut. yifan got 7th but another popular trainee got 8th, people have been hating on yifan for getting 7th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe my queen Junyi didn’t debut?? when she was performing like THIS??? I’m heated  https://t.co/JBRRm1rSpq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tencent should’ve just debuted the top 15 like that would’ve literally been so groundbreaking  https://t.co/UKCc3Hh6rw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiegfriedIze @delmundovena309 you’re not some kind of professional performance critic so don’t run your mouth. 20 followers headass. sit down and support yiyang so she can achieve her dream and debut rather than picking on people more successful than you &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khbined burger pocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikahoneyjoong and you can STAY bitter! yeah it sucks that yiyang didn’t make it but it’s not yifan’s fault that tencent made the lineup so small. cry about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“yifan didn’t have a dream of being in a girl group” then why the fuck did she sign up for the competition, go through the entire audition process, and put in consistent effort in the show? pls proofread before clicking send tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KHCHENLEl then that’s strange. I hope tencent addresses this because they’ve already had scandals for vote rigging in other pdcamp seasons. they need to be much more transparent about voting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KHCHENLEl that’s the votes from today only. there’s been a few days since the ranking was last updated so yifan might have received a large number of votes in the last few days. I wish yiyang debuted too but it’s unfair to yifan to accuse her of winning fraudulently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KHCHENLEl sure, but it’s not a complete reflection because it gives *more* votes but it’s not the *only* way to vote. yifan supporters may not have spent as much on yoghurt votes and instead voted in other ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>can’t believe Junyi didn’t debut 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KHCHENLEl raising money wasn’t the only way to vote? the amount of money raised for each trainee isn’t a reflection of their total votes contributing towards their final ranking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is the kind of “screentime” that 95% of the chuang trainees got  https://t.co/xQPuhzXWGa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah it’s upsetting that a lot of talented trainees didn’t get to debut on pdcamp this year but that doesn’t mean you get to run your mouth about the ones who did. sit tf down  https://t.co/qZe8ehLUZK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourhap78370329 @ultliumeng just because someone unfortunately didn’t get to debut this time doesn’t mean you should be mean and nasty to the people who did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tencent missed out on debuting so much talent  https://t.co/UKCc3Hh6rw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YIFAN’S GONNA DEBUT  https://t.co/2FUy2oqlFQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>see why couldn’t tencent just debut a group with 15 members. I KNEWWWW that whatever these rankings would be, my heart would break nevertheless 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maryr62323720 I hope you enjoy getting spammed  https://t.co/GL9jKIrtAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicheBangtan @BTS_twt no stop I’m actually emotional 😭 I was so proud watching them on BGT and at Wembley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear the chuang theme tune is gonna be stuck in my head till my deathbed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IN SCREAAAMINGGGGG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>liu meng has really shown her potential, I hope she gets to debut whether it’s in this competition or somewhere further down the line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and then when the stronger part came in she could reiterate the point that her voice is strong and stable af. a power move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact that curley chose a softer song was a power move cause everyone knows how strong her vocals are already so she chose to show that she’s also capable of gentle songs too ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this was curley ranking 1st from episodes 2-7 while the rest of the rankings were a mess  https://t.co/aBafXYCf9V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also if yifan doesn’t make it I will cry x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>does anyone have a picture or something of shinee’s ring lightstick from 2013? not the bigger one from 2017 lol there’s a small one but I’ve only found like 1 grainy image of it online<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jinkizen since he’s still a kid too I hope he can grow out of that mindset. he’s probably just copying what he hears from other people :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elijahdaniel #forthoodshutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GratefultoJesus @lixfltr it was very good of him to do but it’s a shame his company punished him for it, and treated him like a child too? taking away his phone like that? just because he showed remorse for a mistake :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I FUCKING SNORTED  https://t.co/Iu8Eu2guSi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvtaeji also I’m CONSTANTLY finding out stuff about shinee that I never knew it’s crazy 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvtaeji I like following shawols cause a lot of them are funny as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess they never really abandoned their “herd immunity” bs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yvvbins @dubuprnt @joonismoonchild @119dejun agreed, there was another member who left the group to prioritise her mental health too so the other members of the group may have also been affected by jimin’s actions :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lixfltr almost all jype artists who made a personal apology for something had to get permission from jype to do so... and all of those allowed apologies have been for things that have upset korean fans. they truly don’t care about int fans or ca 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aubadehyun Jessie has a 6th sense. and look at jimin’s attitude here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clownisj @vivisphatass @ufwari @itskeyon nope lennon did too and he showed a lot less remorse for it, he mentioned it in an interview like it was nothing. Lennon was a messed up guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KpopMemetower @NendoIsLove @jjongsyibo @5hineebyourside nobody’s attacking the whole fandom. there’s clearly many armys who have been respectful and kind in this situation, and shawols see that too. but it’s important to take accountability as a member of the fandom especially because the toxic armys often have big platforms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaBlancoESQ @loverholic the issue here is that it’s not a genuine apology if they’re saying “not all armys” because they’re not accepting the impact of the toxic people in the fandom+when people say they cried for him it can be uncomfy for shawols<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuckAJuicyAss @blingblingest @SpotifyCares @minwols the original tweet wasn’t even about BTS what “moment” are you talking about 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eiSHAwol_ @hilda_basil @hayyy_png @chuukeyk tbh the interviewer asked “What’s the difference between BIGBANG and the other groups, EXO or SHINee?” and it must be pretty annoying when an interviewer asks questions about / compares to other groups... still surprising &amp; unexpected that he said that though 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ALSO DON’T BOARD ANY PLANES OR BOATS THAT ARE OWNED BY COMPANIES BASED IN HONG KONG! THEY CAN AND WILL ARREST YOU ON THOSE TOO! e.g. don’t travel using Cathay Pacific or Cathay dragon!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mortisha924 @grandslamgrand1 @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump @TIME also, this wouldn’t have worked if trump’s supporters actually showed up. by responding to the RSVP you’re not guaranteed a seat in the arena, so trump supporters would’ve still been able to attend. but they didn’t and the turnout was small<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mortisha924 @grandslamgrand1 @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump @TIME this isn’t lying or cheating... a bunch of people responded to trump’s RSVP for the event and just didn’t show up. considering that the voices of young people often fall on deaf ears, it was a stunt to show their opinion in one of the only ways they can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustVicki333 @robo_bobo604 @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump kpop is Korean pop music, it’s very popular among young people. a “stan” is someone who’s a big fan of someone or something, it’s a slang word used on the internet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaughtersofIna1 @Pearl1776 @RachMiata @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump nowhere in the law says this is illegal, sweetheart. responding to an RSVP and not showing up is completely legal and the idea worked! the president is a clown in the circus that is his campaign &amp; government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaughtersofIna1 @Pearl1776 @RachMiata @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump you genuinely think the MILITARY are going to take action on a prank made up by teenagers? also people used burner phone numbers to sign up for tickets to avoid their number being put on trump’s campaign mailing lists. the president and his campaign managers were outsmarted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mortisha924 @grandslamgrand1 @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump @TIME you’re real mad that a bunch of bored teens outsmarted the president and his campaign managers, oh dear Mortisha... did we upset you 😔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaughtersofIna1 @Pearl1776 @RachMiata @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump the entire idea was a prank to make trump’s event organisers prepare for a much larger crowd and make a fool out of them and trump himself. it worked. also the idea wasn’t ONLY spread on tiktok, it began on twitter and spread amongst young people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonghyunsstar if you need someone to speak to my DMs are open! I suffer from anxiety too and I’ve been through a few years of therapy so I have some advice leaflets and stuff if you need it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonghyunsstar if you feel like you’re struggling to manage your anger you should reach out for help and guidance, for you anxiety too if you need it. asking for help is hard but it’s worth it in the end if you learn ways to manage. don’t be too hard on yourself for being irritable sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonghyunsstar having anxiety is never just an “excuse”. it’s a valid reason to struggle in certain situations or behave a certain way! mental health is as important as physical health, if you break your arm you shouldn’t feel bad for struggling with things sometimes or asking for help<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crackaddict332 @Nanajcore @anggereginaldo @_beccaae_ @colita_d_rana @billboard @ygofficialblink @BTS_twt yeah lol, idk if the bundle is available on weverse shop but they opened separate websites to sell them to certain countries/regions so I don’t think a lot of people heard about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diksha7bts @doriseoks @miniflrt BTS has no radio presence either cause radio stations are xenophobic and refuse to play Korean artists 😭 grammys aren’t given based on popularity or streams either, many more unknown artists have won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crackaddict332 @Nanajcore @anggereginaldo @_beccaae_ @colita_d_rana @billboard @ygofficialblink @BTS_twt yes they do! like 3 months ago they bundled the preorder for the mots 7 vinyl with free downloads for both versions of ON. it was advertised and sold as a bundle too. which is pretty cool lol I ended up getting one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so tired but every night there’s always something that makes me anxious and then I don’t sleep until 2am :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nqzliii hmm but it’s still unfair to watch another group be nominated and then say “but BTS deserves it more!” both groups deserve a Grammy but neither needs one to be successful, plus the grammys are racist and xenophobic anyways so anyone who isn’t white is at a disadvantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kthangelics @moonchildsoty the official nominations aren’t out yet, billboard only made some predictions. BTS could still be nominated. also the prediction suggested superm for best new artist so them not being in the industry for long literally makes them eligible for that award lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@st4rryminie the official nominations aren’t out yet!! billboard made a prediction saying they think superm could be nominated for best new artist but we don’t know if BTS are nominated or not yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nqzliii grammys aren’t always given based on fame or popularity, several lesser known artists have won. plus, BTS has the biggest impact in the west so far but many people heard of other kpop groups way before they heard of BTS in some cases. I think both deserve to win one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChristineStergi @DrEricDing that would put a lot of people out of business and out of work. market stalls are often family businesses too. it would be a disaster to do that when a global recession is looming. instead, they could put stricter sanitising rules into place for markets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Real_StrayKids exactly! and the whole reason protesters are taking down statues is because they’re put pride of place like heroes but there’s no mention of how they were slave owners and racists, literally leaving out part of history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linobeglowing ok but you really won tho 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he says this as if the statue hasn’t been defaced by loads of other protesters before but racists only give a fuck now because it’s BLM protests 🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kingwonnie no it’s cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact that bail exists for crimes like m*rder is insane to me it’s literally like “if you or anyone you know is rich enough you can go free!!” like???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princesong_yoyo @junhoeoutsang for them to leave they would probably have to technically disband which is why people are talking about disbandment, although I agree that I hope ikon don’t take it the wrong way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCArtz1 @MSulli10 @kezz18 @carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange that’s the point I made though it’s not that we don’t care about others getting hurt, we can only concentrate on one issue at a time &amp; it’s not good to bring up other issues when people speak on their experiences and white people are NOT getting hurt for the colour of their skin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCArtz1 @MSulli10 @kezz18 @carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange it’s black lives that are being taken away and treated like they don’t matter. so we stand up and help black people unfortunately we can’t help everyone at once because we have limited resources, if there’s only 2 bandaids in a box we have to be careful with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCArtz1 @MSulli10 @kezz18 @carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange by saying *ll l*ves m*tter you’re distracting from the main issue if there’s 3 kids and one trips over, you’re gonna help the kid who tripped over. you’re not gonna give a bandaid to all 3 children that doesn’t mean we don’t care about the others<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KNGDaaanieI @welouv @soompi I’m not here to debate on which idols have done bad things lmao. you can hate idols for what they’ve done if you want, but the point is, many don’t get to continue their careers and if they do then they face hate as a result. you bringing those two up is evidence of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dani75375859 @princesong_yoyo @junhoeoutsang a cut of all revenue from iKON’s songs already goes to YG and other songwriters / producers so that wouldn’t really change even if they left the label too, overall I think leaving YG would be much better for ikon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dani75375859 @princesong_yoyo @junhoeoutsang who cares if they have to change their name as long as they’re ot7? also, there are many artists who have left their labels but are still allowed to perform all their songs and even keep their original name. they just have to negotiate with the old label, it’s possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>whenever a big truck goes past my whole house shakes, something literally just fell off my shelf ahhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welouv @soompi yep, having to leave because of a rumour is very unfair on the idols. I hope in this case that it was him to decided to leave as well, since some idols were under bad companies that just kicked them out rather than talking through their contract<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>one of my birthday presents just arrived and I have to wait more than two months to open it omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welouv @soompi but any idol who has done something worse has also left their group from what I’ve seen. I think for Korean celebrities, scandals &amp; bad mistakes have a much more lasting impact on their careers in comparison to western celebrities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alhaoma_ @Bangtan_Biscuit @soompi they suspended his activities to give time for the company &amp; him to talk through his contract and the decision was made that he would leave. I’m sorry you have to face this but this is how contracts &amp; jobs work, it’s not up to the company to “protect” him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princesong_yoyo @junhoeoutsang ikonics have been wanting ikon to disband for months because we want ikon back as ot7 &amp; we want all the boys out of YG ent because it’s is a terrible company, basically we want temporary disbandment so they leave YG and then get back together as ot7 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darsmercs @soompi hanbin was kicked out, he didn’t leave. delete this. these situations are not comparable, stop using hanbin to try and make a point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aiur_swan don’t bring up hanbin in relation to others. their situations are not the same at all, stop using his name to make a point<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange George Floyd is the main face of these protests. even if he’s done bad things, his passing was the trigger point for millions of people around the world rising up. I think that is enough to earn a statue in his honour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange a lot of people who have done bad things have statues. winston Churchill has one even though he was known to be racist. Ghandi has several even though he was also racist, slept with children, even allowed his wife to die... but they did something important, so they have statues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange does that mean he deserved to die? when that cop kneeled on his neck, all he did was pay for groceries. he already served time for anything he did wrong. plus, these BLM protests aren’t just about him either. they’re about everyone who died just because of their skin colour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCArtz1 @MSulli10 @kezz18 @carl_cnp @Amy40359896 @Dale__Emma @Lionbush @Sarkies_Proxy @SophiaChoudhury @daliagebrial @UKChange the fact that you slid in *ll l*ves m*tter there like nobody would notice... 💀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrsLouiseWS wasn’t the protesters who put the horses in harms way. I watched this unfold on the news: -the horses were way more jumpy than they’re meant to be, I doubt they’ve been trained properly -whoever sent the horses charging like that and kettled protesters should lose their job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gahan_frank @Kris_Tna @Tris_Stock please present the video evidence for this cause I find it hard to believe that someone had a brick just laying around? also police horses are trained to not react to situations like this and the other horses were jumpy yesterday too, they clearly haven’t been trained properly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlasgowMake @Aleen @jk_rowling so what do you say to all the women who have a uterus but don’t menstruate? are they not women just because they don’t bleed out of their vagina for some reason? you clearly don’t know enough about other women’s bodies to be speaking on them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I only have yw standard version rn so if I’m ever gonna get a preorder/limited ver it might as well be their first full album right? 😩 but mannn I’m gonna be broke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already spent money recently but that skz album looking real good rn haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>after getting home: —take a cold shower —submerge your face in a bowl of cold water for 15 seconds —to wash contaminated clothes, leave them to soak in a bucket of cold water for at least 2 hours then wash them separately from other laundry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>milk can be poured on the face/skin to help ease irritation from tear gas or pepper spray. however, it won’t remove all the chemicals so make sure to use soap &amp; water. only ever use water for an eye flush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to add to this: Hong Kong protesters use saran wrap to protect from tear gas. this allows you to wear clothes that are comfortable in warm weather but still be protected from chemicals. it’s also easier than changing your clothes if they get chemicals on them  https://t.co/RuY7SPqswS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arsenal_MemzFC from what I’ve seen nobody’s been looting. everything was calm while I was at the protest, any fighting with police was probably brought on by the police themselves. even when the crowd was calm the police outside Downing Street had a bit of an attitude<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HANBEANZ_ @okhanbinie bob posted this on ig, it’s good he acknowledged BLM but this could be interpreted as him supporting *ll l*ves m*tter... he didn’t include any hashtags or anything either which is a little disappointing  https://t.co/weS7dV4jyO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BOBBY_Community take care!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnLWumz @ShitChester a day out to the zoo is much less important than getting justice for racism-fuelled murder and brutality. yes, protesting is a risk, but either people die of the virus or they die at the hands of racists. we’re not left with much of a choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inoneofthestars it’s ok if you can’t! standing up for the cause and boosting black voices online is the most important thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>shitty pic but I had to crop out the faces of protesters. buses have literally been left in the street like this cause the protesters are marching in the road for miles around, police are there but they’re not doing anything, just watching. 100% peaceful  https://t.co/afczPbWoUA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall I just left the BLM protest in London and it’s showing no signs of slowing down, traffic is gridlocked in all directions, buses left abandoned in the road, protesters occupying Westminster square and chanting outside Downing Street. ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NAMTHIDDIES wym? I don’t blame him for this. it was a wrong decision made by someone else that made a lot of armys upset and uncomfortable. I don’t want locals &amp; antis associating yg w/ a murderer and he wouldn’t want to be associated with that monster either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@interrupted99 are you interested in anything else other than BTS? a book, a movie, anything? because that would make you a multi too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbjinkx I feel like it’s not unlikely, people often don’t know about bad people from other countries so it was probably a miss on the producer’s and bh’s part. def was a pretty major mistake to make tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall walk around like you have the power or jurisdiction to call someone a “fake army”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbjinkx bh released a statement and said it wasn’t him, it was a different producer &amp; they’ll remove the sample from the song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns @HMcbrexit  https://t.co/XNEQyQ1aIa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMcbrexit @DawkinsReturns I give a fuck about people being murdered because of their race because I have morals, yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns my bad, sorry for defending the rights of people who have been murdered and brutalised for centuries with their attackers getting away with it. only a lucky few of us have basic morals I suppose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMcbrexit @DawkinsReturns and yet a white school shooter who kills a bunch of people gets calmly arrested while a black man who just paid for some groceries gets murdered. funny how that tweeter didn’t specify the reasons for these people getting fired at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMcbrexit @DawkinsReturns the truth is that a black man can’t purchase groceries without getting murdered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns the right to not get murdered by police and the right to receive justice if they get murdered by police. a black man can’t even buy groceries without being killed, if you see no issue with that then book yourself into a psychiatric ward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cryoeng it may be dangerous but it’s either we risk catching the virus or we watch human rights being taken away and murderers get away with their crimes. both are bad outcomes. it’s up to the public to choose.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@euphoriabykoo how am I an anti? I don’t want locals and antis to associate yg with a mass murderer for years to come. I’m sure yg wouldn’t want to be associated with that nasty cult leader either. the apology was needed. I don’t blame yg for this. you don’t have jurisdiction to call me an anti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_StrayKids 100% agreed, it’s crazy how people are pulling the “fake army” card to people who voiced their opinion on this. an apology was especially needed cause otherwise antis and locals will associate yg with a murderer for years to come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@torongnessy @modooborahae a sample of Jim Jones speech was included in “what do you think?” Jim Jones is a mass murderer from America who killed hundreds of people including children. it seems like the producer didn’t know who he was and didn’t realise it’s bad to put that in the song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you are a person with morals before you are a stan of anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@basicallydunya @modooborahae it wasn’t a lie though, a sample of a mass murderer was genuinely included in the song so bighit removed it. it’s not good to cover up mistakes and 875 would never want their words to trigger someone so it’s good that it was removed from the song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_StrayKids yep  https://t.co/6S2jJt5Ltw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe people are genuinely outraged over 🐱 apologising. the song sampled a mass murderer for no clear reason, so the sample was removed. mistakes were made, there’s no defending that mistake<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kswift_11 shoes are super identifiable but black airforces blend in better so you’re probably better with them lmao. but get tf out of there if a riot starts cause then the police will be more likely to try and find / arrest you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeycesca also you can pour water on a tear gas canister to disable it. even better, put a traffic cone over it to funnel the smoke upwards before dousing it in water. here’s a video on how to do an eye flush for tear gas:  https://t.co/cfaqUoSLDg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maira100491 I found this thread interesting, it’s up to you what you make of this situation but I doubt the sample was used in a malicious way  https://t.co/ucwi76h75r<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage definitely. but again it’s another reason why we shouldn’t be so quick to relax lockdown. we were late to start it so we should be late to finish, otherwise it’ll only cause more problems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage that’s true, but people don’t adhere to social distancing. we’ve already seen that. even in 1918-1920 with the spanish flu, when lockdown ended everybody went to parties and there was a second spike in infections. lockdown is probably better for protecting the vulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage if you agree then why did you respond to the original tweet like that? it’s ridiculous to start opening schools up and everything now, even places in the world with a much lower rate of infection had a spike in deaths after reopening. it’s dangerous especially for the vulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage still though, I’m glad lockdown is in place. only a small percentage of the population has had it so far so all the deaths now is only a fraction of the possible total number. even if most people make it through we need to protect vulnerable people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage maybe if you looked at this year’s death count compared to the last few years then you wouldn’t be so gullible and would actually be able to grasp the gravity of this situation rather than believing someone who claims to be a doctor on YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage it’s very rare to die from a cold though. flu, maybe. but covid is on a completely different scale. it’s not even comparable to the flu or a cold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage also my mother who is 59 caught it in March, while she is bordering on the at-risk category she wasn’t too unwell, just a fever and lost her sense of taste. my family were sharing the same house with her, but my dad, 60+ yo, didn’t get any symptoms. but we all probably had it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage you know they’ve been testing people in mines and other workplaces and most of the people who tested positive had no symptoms? that’s what the experts are saying, you can have it but show no symptoms. you may be asymptomatic but covid-positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyMariex @wobbly_sausage colds are super common but coronavirus is still killing thousands more people than the yearly average. a cold won’t kill someone with diabetes. and covid is killing healthy people, even young people, with no other health problems. it’s something to be scared about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you want justice for a crime, *DON’T ASK FOR A PUBLIC INQUIRY* !!! public inquiries only collect information but usually nothing is done with it and JUSTICE IS NOT SERVED!!! Grenfell tower had a public inquiry and STILL NO JUSTICE 3 YEARS LATER!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamwwfc03 @MerciTheKat @LuxinLeumas being overworked isn’t an excuse for not allowing certain kids to feel comfortable and able to learn in school. if kids with learning difficulties can’t learn in class because their focusing tools are taken away then the teacher isn’t doing their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamwwfc03 @MerciTheKat @LuxinLeumas yeah but they shouldn’t have been banned, the only reason they were banned was because of crappy teachers who don’t give a damn about kids with learning difficulties or who can’t control their class. so yes it was caused by shitty people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@insideinsiIence that’s not true, Robert only curses people who take pictures of him without asking. if you just see a picture of him then you’re fine, you don’t need to say sorry, just don’t save the picture or anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been reading creepypastas and urban legends since I was 12-13, if you go to the museum robert’s in and take a picture without asking then he curses you and you have to say sorry. if you ask before taking it or you just see a picture then you’re fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall if you see Robert the doll on your tl, don’t worry!! he doesn’t get mad at you for seeing his picture, he only gets mad if you take a picture of him without asking!! you don’t need to say sorry 😭  https://t.co/14IVH6EZxK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraSchleifer @denise_dewald @BBCLBicker also we still have about 400+ deaths a day but they’re starting to open schools from June 1st and we have no idea if we can go outside or not because their advice makes no sense 😁👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraSchleifer @denise_dewald @BBCLBicker ah I feel you, I live in London which has been devastated by the virus, our government put us in lockdown too late because they said we should “take it on the chin” and had a “herd immunity” policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve__Atlas @denise_dewald @BBCLBicker fully agreed. I live in the UK, I haven’t be going anywhere let alone a nightclub. but places like South Korea have dealt with the outbreak well enough that there doesn’t seem to be such imminent danger over there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccane42 @denise_dewald @BBCLBicker they’re not “rethinking it,” despite the club outbreak their numbers have remained low and people have been going about some of their business as usual, with some places remaining closed and social distancing measures being in place. they’re doing much better than the rest of us<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve__Atlas @denise_dewald @BBCLBicker considering this is an isolated case of a cluster of infections and the millions of other South Koreans not in lockdown have been totally fine then yes, it’s not THAT risky lmao. never said it was a foolproof idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mats18821868 I think so! from what I’ve seen &amp; heard a lot of places are open but school isn’t fully back in session yet. it looks like people can do some stuff like normal but there’s still plenty of social distancing rules in place<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SugarBoxStudios @LBCNews the government is starting to send people back to school and work, no public transport —&gt; no one can get to school or work —&gt; schools and workplaces remain closed due to lack of attendance —&gt; massive recession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denise_dewald @BBCLBicker South Korea isn’t on lockdown &amp; this is their first major case of reinfections after they recorded no new cases on April 30. They only have 11,018 cases and 260 deaths. if you’re in South Korea, going to a nightclub really isn’t too risky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@92RyanLee @_Blackistani_ the education system is based on progressing from one stage to another. making them sit an extra year will not only put their lives on hold but also double the amount of kids in one year group when schools are already too full<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ennrjb I honestly don’t think this article is bad. it’s true to say that Bighit will suffer some losses in revenue &amp; profit this year &amp; the article also praised the company and BTS. it’s from a business standpoint so it discusses BTS from an outsider’s view<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt it could’ve been left at “they did that with a Korean album” and it would still have the same meaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @hoeforfilter @PopCrave @BTS_twt “something your faves can’t achieve with an English album.” it’s dumb as hell to start bringing that up when BTS is already on another level anyways and it’s trying to indirectly bring down others which is NOT a good way to raise up BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt I never said it wasn’t 💀 of course BTS are taking over the industry but again mentioning other people could’ve been left out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @hoeforfilter @PopCrave @BTS_twt again, that’s fair. but bringing up others was still unnecessary cause again, BTS are incomparable to others cause they’re going further than anyone else!! no one cares what others can or can’t do when BTS will keep doing THAT either way lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>apparently the definition of a multi has been lost over the years and multis are now supporting tweets attacking multis LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt yeah but why mention other people lmaooo could’ve just left it at that without the “yOuR fAvEs,” it’s childish and immature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoeforfilter @victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt read the image lmao talking about “your faves” when they could’ve just said “BTS did that with a Korean album!” and left it at that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt yellow text started talking about “your faves” as a comparison when what’s the point of comparing BTS to anyone or anything? they’ve surpassed everyone anyways lmao why even compare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple7even_ @BTS_twt “a wise old man once said: “they did that with a Korean album, something your faves...” etc. they indirectly mentioned others when there’s no need for comparison cause BTS’s achievements are incomparable lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @PopCrave @BTS_twt you can celebrate their achievements without trying to bring down other groups lmao maybe take your own advice and “focus on your faves”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhanaianSavage @MissLolli44 @paigeloufuller @ali9szn @utdgeorgia yeah, I think men don’t understand the dangers women face no matter where they live in the world.

<|startoftext|>@daixsu @BUBUPRlNT someone brought up a debate about how they feel that nct’s kick it song &amp; MV is a form of cultural appropriation or feeding into stereotypes. crybabykia disagreed and brought up how black kpop stans get treated &amp; got a lot of backlash as big accs jumped her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ILoveJoonie94 @kmthyngluvv armys also don’t like it when people bring other lightsticks to their concerts though, kind of understandably too. an online concert is not the same as a real life concert. yes, nobody is asking them to do that, they’re doing it because they like BTS?? not because they’re forced?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveJoonie94 @kmthyngluvv they’re taking time out of their day to watch the livestream even in the middle of the night. if you don’t think that’s support then you’re delusional and you need to stop gatekeeping BTS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amymckeownnn @Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham flu and coronavirus are completely different viruses. and flu vaccines exist to help prevent people from catching it.

<|startoftext|>@bangtanism89_ @BTS_twt “crashing” bangbangcon?? they want to enjoy the concert like everyone else. and armys don’t like it when people bring other lightsticks to BTS concerts too— but nevertheless an online concert isn’t the same as a real concert so it’s no comparable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UGHitEnt it wasn’t “some of those fandoms” who trended hate hashtags. it was BTS antis. you can’t blame an entire fandom by the actions of a couple of people in it who spend their time hating BTS instead of supporting their fav group. at the end of the day they’re not even fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@euphoriarchives @kmthyngluvv because they want to support BTS and they don’t have an army bomb so they use another lightstick to enjoy the concert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baangta @kmthyngluvv what’s wrong with saying fandoms? and how do you know they’re armymultis? the people who hate on BTS are also only a couple of people so there’s nothing wrong with saying “other fandoms are showing support” because they are!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveJoonie94 @kmthyngluvv um??? they’re showing support for BTS, how can you turn that into a bad thing lmao. they don’t have an army bomb but they got out a different lightstick especially, they wouldn’t do that if they hated BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham something even worse than it already is. it’s better to play it safe and wait it out at least 2 more months before lifting lockdown measures. if we lift it too soon we’ll get another surge in deaths which could have been completely avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham except we know the medical dangers that things like smoking create. coronavirus is a big mystery to virologists and until we have a vaccine it’ll keep infecting people. we might not even have an immunity after recovery which is a MAJOR red flag as the virus could evolve to+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyvivis 1600 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham not to mention people can’t just “lock down as they wish” without risking losing their jobs or getting kicked out of school. if schools and businesses reopen but the government says the vulnerable/older pop can stay home then the vulnerable will lose their livelihoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham if you actually read my tweet you would be able to figure out that only a small amount of people I listed would be considered “vulnerable”. anyone can get it and anyone can die from it no matter your age and whether you have health complications or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagamanx1 @ChimeneaBeulah @SophyRidgeSky @alexwickham you’re not thinking about the parents/grandparents/guardians picking kids up and all the teachers and staff and all the people who live with the kids... kids can spread it and have it without showing symptoms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@righty108 @NorbertElekes lmao just cause they brought the virus under control better than other countries did &amp; prevented more deaths doesn’t mean they’re lying? plus the fact that a lot of places are screwing with the death count more than China, the UK for example isn’t counting hundreds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been in agonising pain since yesterday cause I went cycling and my legs feel like they’re rotting away I haven’t slept at all and the pain is enough to make me cry xoxoxo  https://t.co/8AxhOt3E4l<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fall_bobby you’re right, he’s the only one with the backwards writing too!! since donghyuk is the ex cop that might have been why bobby chose to k*ll him? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and bobby’s the silver sh*oter and donghyuk was shot which suggests it’s bobby?? IDK 😭 #ikonpurge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also since there’s only 4 of them still around it’ll be hard to track down the k*ller without having to split up &amp; they have less manpower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it seems like junbob have to be the k*llers since Chanwoo said his father leaves no physical security in the bank. maybe looking for junbob would be better so then the others can approach them as friends instead of trying to attack... idk though 😩 #ikonpurge<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NAMTHIDDIES if it depends on the age of your phone cause the battery can get worn out, iPhone batteries get screwed pretty quickly, but I think you can get a replacement battery from the Apple store? my phone is only a few months old so I’m good for now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiuminbezoomin plantain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ash_MUFC_RFC @Iuckystryke @Yonny1975 aka don’t listen to online conspiracy theorists and comic books over actual scientists who know what they’re talking about and have researched similar diseases for several years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ash_MUFC_RFC @Iuckystryke @Yonny1975 lmao they’ve found more evidence linking the origin of the virus to wet markets than anything else at this point in time. animals being crammed close together in cages=easy cross-species spread of disease. there’s too many precautions in bio labs to allow for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yonny1975 @Iuckystryke @Ash_MUFC_RFC you say that as if other countries around the world don’t also eat weird and wonderful creatures. just take a look at France for example. plus it’s delusional to suggest the entire population of China eats wild animals lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yonny1975 1. the coronavirus was not caused by eating bats, it was caused by wet markets 2. wet markets exist all over the world so the virus could’ve started anywhere 3. China’s government is trash but don’t blame the whole country/it’s people for this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mhai_S21 oh in that case... I mean they could literally just google them 💀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SoftBearWoojin I think I saw something about that, it seems like for them it’s more of a coping mechanism for mh rather than just a fashion statement to make profit from... meanwhile I’ve seen all kinds of people wearing razorblade necklaces and stuff without thinking :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw// mental health, self harm  I really wish people would stop wearing razor blade accessories and shit it’s genuinely triggering and lowkey romanticising self harm but I don’t think anyone’s clocked<|endoftext|>

I get that it’s limited edition but it would be pretty bad if only like 0.0000001% of armys actually managed to get the lightstick 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gguksbubbletea @BTS13613ON @weverseofficial I’m sure they’ll restock since otherwise no armys will even be able to get the lightstick. they’ll probably make it available ww when most countries have relaxed shipping restrictions + it might be available at concert venues when the tour resumes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoboulis and they whitewashed a lil while they were at it this is heartbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoorimsimp tbh it’s a natural process to have moments where you’re less involved with things/people you like/stan so it’s often good to wait and see if the spark comes back!! but it’s still normal to fall out of love with stuff and it’s not a bad thing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@infireswithBTS @MicheBangtan @weverseshop they might make it available later when the virus lockdowns aren’t as strict! they physically can’t ship to a lot of countries right now so it might be available again in a few months or when the mots tour resumes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AddictWythAPen @hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV you can have the virus without showing symptoms. and going to see family IS going out and it’s still a risk. world governments aren’t saying “don’t visit your families” for no reason lmao this is literally advice from scientists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanbinbubs period promote the producer of the year  https://t.co/NP91zwGpbn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV I’m not trying to cancel tyler but I’m concerned that he’s not following the rules especially because he has a baby daughter &amp; several very young family members who are more vulnerable to getting sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV sure but that’s still breaking quarantine rules and putting each other in danger. quarantine rules say that you can’t even meet up with friends/family because it’s still possible to infect each other. you can only properly social distance with who you live with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s funny seeing kpop stan’s drunk tweets on this app cause no matter how bad the grammar is they still manage to tweet a fancam no problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV fair enough but would a family of 14 really be living together?? I kind of doubt it especially since they’re all financially pretty well off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV if you think a family of 14 are all in one house together for quarantine when loc and all their previous social media posts suggest that they’re still living separately then idk what to say to you lmao. you don’t have to cancel him just don’t be an apologist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheissgolden we still need to hold him accountable cause he messed up, even meeting family puts everyone in danger. even being super hygienic isn’t a guarantee you won’t catch it from a family member &amp; it’s irresponsible since babies have weaker immune systems too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam79548242 @21bonegrips @lilredmaddi I did a proper look and there’s this lmao. sounds like Jay meant that his family are only meeting up with each other and not going out otherwise but that’s still breaking quarantine rules since meeting family also puts you in danger  https://t.co/fdLWePc2Lf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam79548242 @citrusbelle_ @UrFavIsADumbass I’ll say it again Tyler broke social distancing rules  https://t.co/GNA8er0uZy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skilly1010 @ughyari people who live together normally aren’t breaking quarantine because they’re socially isolated together. the 14 people in Tyler’s family aren’t living together and therefore by meeting each other they’re breaking quarantine and putting themselves in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotytyler_ @tori48768024 @BLURRYFACEMV yeah uh I don’t think such a big family would be living together  https://t.co/7wu49RnSKj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NEWAMERlCARIANA @LouderThanRough @60soasis @spideysbowie nobody can physically see what they think of with their mind’s eye, it’s not like a hallucination but more like you can make an image in your head. like when I’m reading a book, it’s almost like watching a movie in my head because I can “see” the characters<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>what’s the point of debuting a group if you’re gonna snatch the opportunity from under their feet shortly after and only give them and their fans crumbs for the short amount of time they’re around :/// just make them a permanent group????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>temporary groups really shouldn’t exist like imagine saying to someone “here you can achieve your dream!! but only for like a year with minimal cbs and promotions &lt;3 “ it’s so mf unfair to fans and the artists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also how limited edition are they talking because,,, it’s gonna sell out in 4 seconds and if they only make it available for a month or smth it’s gonna be like 0.00001% of armys who actually get one lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tbh I hope it has new features as well as the ver 3 bluetooth stuff cause otherwise I don’t really see the point of making a new lightstick lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yall think the limited edition mots lightstick will have bluetooth or nah<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 I’m not saying woojin didn’t make mistakes, I’m saying it’s not like chan told us what he did 😂 we have no idea what woojin did to leave the group so it’s no use speculating saying how much he hurt the members cause we don’t know that for sure either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 he’s 19 years old, he’s not a child. whatever woojin did, his age wouldn’t affect the way he handled it. plus again, we have no evidence to say what woojin did was *that* major. he slipped up but it might not have been as bad as you think it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 fair enough, skz had to work extra after he left, but it’s still not entirely woojin’s fault. mistakes are made and both skz and woojin are doing good now. chan probably only brought it up because we wanted an explanation but it doesn’t mean we should hate on woojin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 not necessarily since the label can terminate a contract whenever it wants since it’s the initiator, please learn how a contract works omfg 😭 there’s several idols who have done nothing to breach a contract but their crap company still terminated it for nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 they’re literally all adults?? even jeongin is a grown adult now?? yes he made a mistake and it had an impact but that’s not an excuse to spread rumours and hate on the internet. this is the type of bs than happens to chan CONSTANTLY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 you sound like a child. “iTs aLL hiS fAuLt!!” is exactly what an angry little child would say when something goes wrong and they want someone to blame for it. woojin making a mistake doesn’t mean he was trying to sabotage SKZ. now MOVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 ah so you’re a company stan? that immediately tells me that logic is not an asset you have lmao. if you’ve known jype for 10 years and still managed to be blind to the fact it can suck sometimes... 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 jype is no different, even watching the Nizi episodes you can tell that 💀 it could easily be that simple since chan only gave us a rough explanation as to why woojin left, it’s YOU who’s trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehanprint @skskiz @Ievanter1 but you know what he didn’t say? to go around spreading rumours and hate about woojin! if you don’t wanna support woojin as a soloist then sure but NOWHERE did chan say “blame woojin on twitter for me”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehanprint @skskiz @Ievanter1 so woojin taking a break from work AFTER leaving the group suddenly makes him so wrong?? he has nothing to do with skz’s promotions so he’s allowed to take a holiday lmfaooo. and every group has to rebrand after losing a member. doesn’t make it all woojin’s fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @thehanprint @Ievanter1 again that’s your interpretation lmaooo, twist it however you want to make woojin the bag guy but it still won’t make it reality, this isn’t a k drama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 he could’ve meant anything by that, everyone’s heard the stories in the kpop industry about how if one member is late to a dance practice or something then they all get disciplined. it could’ve been as minor as that. it’s not an excuse to start talking about mental health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehanprint @skskiz @Ievanter1 and how does that have anything to do with woojin? he had highlighted those insecurities way earlier than that but maybe you weren’t paying attention enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 did chan say that? because that’s your interpretation. you might see this as a big drama and you wanna paint woojin out to be the bad guy but it’s not reality 😌 nowhere did chan say he compromised the group in any way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skskiz @Ievanter1 it compromised their future as 9 but stray kids were already doing well and didn’t face any losses in terms of popularity after he left. and people make mistakes. Chan didn’t say what that mistake was so for all we know it could be anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoftBearWoojin Apple said stan shinee pewwiod<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_instacom3dy @savy_incarnate @damienxpat you’re right, as you said “you don’t HAVE to” so there’s your answer. also a lot of people expect trans people to come out to them even when they’re only *considering* a relationship with them because they’re purposely trying to avoid dating a trans person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@savy_incarnate @damienxpat you only care about that info being given to you because you’re transphobic and you don’t wanna date a trans person<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet as I said, this isn’t the modern day 😂 please learn some reading comprehension before replying to me you twat, in recent years viruses are never given geographical names because they’re never caused by anyone or any country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet viruses mutate. since the animals were in close quarters it could spread among species easier. it’s rare that viruses jump between species but it’s possible. that’s what happened here. not the first time it’s happened either mate. it’s happened outside of China too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet viruses are never naked after country of origin nowadays, literally because they could start anywhere at all. ebola is called ebola, nothing to do with where the cases started appearing and being diagnosed first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet Chinese propaganda hasn’t said anything of the sort, this virus could have literally started everywhere. if you think wet markets should be shut down globally then that’s your opinion. but it’s not their fault when the rest of the world is the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet also this didn’t really start from eating animals either, it came from animals being kept in poor and cramped conditions. animals are trafficked around the world, there’s a HUGE animal trafficking business in the UK too. if the virus started here, you still think it’s our fault?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet wet markets don’t just exist in China. people eat weird and wonderful animals outside of Asia too. this could have started ANYWHERE. and China has contained it, they barely have new cases in places where the virus was everywhere a couple months ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pspspspsp hanbin pspsppsps Demo 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet whistleblowers were silenced but the news still got out. and still NOBODY CARED until it infected the rest of us. China’s already contained the virus. we haven’t. it’s not China’s fault that nobody gives a shit what happens in other countries even when people are dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet they didn’t. info quickly spread about the virus and was available MONTHS ago but no one cared and the media didn’t report on it. it was only when it infected people outside of China that people started giving a fuck. it’s not China’s fault and they controlled the spread well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet we’re already infected. we can’t get more infected, that’s impossible 😂 if we’re at home then we’re not coming into contact with others so we’re safe! also if we shut the borders then NO medical equipment, NO food imports, NO supplies, NO new nurses/doctors from overseas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet then that’s your choice. doesn’t sound like you’re being forced to work. that’s your risk to take, dont blame other people if you’re not staying at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet okay, so what’s your job then? and if there’s only one person on shift then you’re still very unlikely to catch it because you’re still social distancing and not likely to come in contact with the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyresomeAngel46 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet not when we’re all in self isolation. everyone arriving here will be UK citizens needing to get back home, or key workers coming to help our NHS. if everyone’s at home then new arrivals won’t infect us. please think and digest what I’ve said before replying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA43211792 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet travel is why the virus is worldwide, yes, but travelling now won’t change anything because as you said, it’s everywhere. even if people keep travelling (again, only key workers that we NEED are travelling now) it won’t make any difference or increase the virus cases here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @StevenA43211792 @10DowningStreet the only people that will be using public transport for work are key workers, like NHS workers, because no one else is allowed out of quarantine. it still proves my point that even when people arrive here, it won’t change the likelihood of catching the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junhoeoutsang junhoe a hater<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA43211792 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet exactly, so even when people arrive from other countries then as long as we’re all isolated we still won’t catch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyresomeAngel46 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet how will it spread to people when we’re all in isolation? 🤔 and the people who live here that are still wandering around are also spreading it! even when more infected people arrive you’ll still have the same likelihood of catching it, it’s basic science<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@golden131obby it’s worth a try 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyresomeAngel46 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet when they arrive here they will be under the same isolation rules as us unless they’re key workers (which they ALMOST DEFINITELY ARE if they’re still travelling here, lots of doctors/nurses are travelling to help other countries). if we all stay isolated then nobody can infect us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA43211792 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet the UK already has the virus, so even when people from other countries arrive here it won’t make this any worse. it’s basic science. also anyone arriving here will also have to be in isolation the same as the rest of us who live here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA43211792 @LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet if all airports are closed then we can’t have food, medical resources etc. delivered to us. most planes arriving here now are cargo planes carrying stuff we need. even if passengers do arrive here, we’re already infected so they won’t make the situation worse than it already is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJT_1986 @10DowningStreet the UK is already infected by the virus. even if people come in from other places, it can’t make our situation worse. not to mention many of these planes will have few passengers who *need* to travel or they’re cargo planes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@morbxtch @SkullReaperx @HaliyaJam maybe not since the actor was around 10 when she played the character and she’s 14 now. I think the character is supposed to be closer to 6-8 years old in Train to Busan so she would be 10-12 in the new film. also su-an or her manager may have declined the role in the new film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccultAlien @HaliyaJam I think they were referring to the character Su-an. the character is called Su-an, same name as the actor playing her in the first movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkullReaperx @HaliyaJam the actor is different but it could be because the original actor is too old for the part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>woman* I can’t spell 😍😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HOONAPAPARINGO @PelePerformer except there’s not even evidence to say that happened either... some accounts say he slept on the floor etc. there’s a lot of contrasting statements and still no evidence to prove he did anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HOONAPAPARINGO @PelePerformer he’s been acquitted 14 times and the way the law works is innocent until proven guilty. whatever you think of him there is no sufficient evidence against him to prove that he did anything shady<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yoonsguks there is no such thing as a “worst song on persona”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsTOH2O @ddaengifyuagree @BTS_twt if you count their solos, collabs etc. then I can almost guarantee they have more than 100 songs. that’s a lot to expect fans to listen to in a short amount of time. today I was listening to BTS for 3 hours straight and I still barely listened to a fraction of all their songs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsTOH2O @ddaengifyuagree @BTS_twt who are you to tell me how much BTS means to me?? I explained how I prefer to stumble across songs by BTS than go through every album manually because I can appreciate the music more that way. your superiority complex is really showing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsTOH2O @ddaengifyuagree @BTS_twt also BTS work super hard to put out lots of new content and music. I mean, they’re releasing a new Japanese album already!! it’s hard to keep up with so much content and it’s not good to overwhelm new fans by expecting them to listen to all their old stuff + their new stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsTOH2O @ddaengifyuagree @BTS_twt you don’t have to listen to everything at once to be army. I’ve been an army for over 3 years and part of the joy of it is finding songs from them I haven’t heard or I forgot about. not everyone has the time or the motivation to listen to hundreds of songs all at once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s so close to 2M please stream 😔😔  https://t.co/zql6wloTiD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOTHEX0 why does his jaw look like that 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cosmicstay yes exactly,,, they really work so hard to give us so much content &amp; they already have a new Japanese album coming out, I think it’s a lil crazy to expect everyone to keep up in order to call themselves army<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsTOH2O @ddaengifyuagree @BTS_twt saying things like that will only turn away potential fans &amp; it makes you look like you have a superiority complex 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also part of the joy of stanning BTS for me is constantly finding new songs from them that I’ve never listened to before / forgot about, I can appreciate the music more if I listen to it over time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ sure lol fair enough  https://t.co/IeiWvFxfKw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ from personal experience I usually know right off the bat if I connect with a song, even with English songs when I don’t immediately understand the meaning of the lyrics it can still hit different and have an impact on me I guess  https://t.co/gksWZFqHrN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ hmm if you’re not into pop music there’s a lot of Korean hip hop and plenty of other styles, a lot of “kpop” artists aren’t even actually pop artists. it’s easy to make the assumption that all these artists are Korean one direction but it’s not the case  https://t.co/NP91zwGpbn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ you can!! there’s no such thing as a language barrier when it comes to music, it’s good to listen to music in other languages like french and Spanish because you’ll be surprised with how many good songs there are  https://t.co/6riobVgNqs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ no lol I am not attracted to every artist I like, also there are lgbtq+ people who like kpop so they’re not always attracted to their fav musicians either. if I only liked them bc they look good I wouldn’t listen to their music if I didn’t like it  https://t.co/deG6hV2TwI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shashan71504652 @xotbirdox @DzKimo_ yeah lol there’s whole YouTube videos showing lyric translations to loads of different languages it’s p cool how we can enjoy music from anywhere in the world  https://t.co/PmumDcCtIv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TAEMlNTED thank you so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAEMlNTED the entire school/government system is a complete set up against poor kids, kids with physical (and mental) health issues and kids with SEN... it’s really showing now and the gov still does nothing. vote for clowns get a circus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i have never been more at peace since i blocked katie hopkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAEMlNTED the rule’s actually been around for a bit 😭😭 it’s a problem because even kids with immunocompromised parents or underlying health issues literally can’t stay home without risking a fine, even if you have symptoms ur attendance can still drop if you self isolate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAEMlNTED if your attendance drops below a certain level you get a warning letter that your parents could be fined by the government, if ur attendance doesn’t improve the local gov can give each parent a fine of £60. my parents have had to pay it before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAEMlNTED lmao good idea but my only issue is my attendance is already really poor and I don’t want my parents to get fined 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so tired rn and the schools STILL aren’t closed I’m gonna scream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you wouldn’t say “you stan yoongi so that means u probably have a broken arm rn!” start treating mental health the same as physical health because they are just as important thank u<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I JUST FOUND OUT WONHO IS FREE MY GUYYYYYY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoeforSM @shawol_ways mainly how much they’ve been talked about / searched for on social media. groups that just had a comeback or maybe had a scandal will often rank high in the list, but it’s rare to have an inactive group rank so high!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivekJChauhan15 @Edwardo0831 @peytnhaag @Ejiketion and again I’m not entirely sure why we’re having this conversation since the virus did NOT start from eating raw meat. it started from unsanitary conditions in wet markets + the sale of exotic animals. which also happens across the globe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivekJChauhan15 @Edwardo0831 @peytnhaag @Ejiketion “most dishes”? where did you get that from? and again there are raw meat delicacies around the world and millions of people eat sushi outside of Asia?? food containing raw meat is always prepared in a way that won’t cause sickness or adverse affects in the consumer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivekJChauhan15 @Edwardo0831 @peytnhaag @Ejiketion most people don’t eat raw meat though?? videos of people eating raw meat get spread around by xenophobic people especially now because of the virus + the misconception that it started from bat soup. and other countries do have raw meat delicacies lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starryjunnie maybe because you just drank a lot of liquid?? I think it’s easier to feel bloated after eating / drinking something warm too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emotionalbbi @xanxtam @Inniessmile27 @valwithluv @_changjinnie_ @HEICHOCB97 it’s not totally the same but we know what word was originally there so it’s odd how he took song lyrics with that word and just tried to cover it up...

<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon I don’t wanna continue a conversation with someone who thinks the most vulnerable people in society can d*e. you have some serious issues to be able to say that without a second thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon I never said that the poor should be left to suffer?? my own family would struggle severely in a quarantine I know it’s not an ideal situation HOWEVER you clearly said that people should be allowed to d*e so let’s focus on that shall we<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon good to know that you think people with other health conditions, including your own sister, are expendable :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon again though this virus is gonna be tough for everyone no matter what the government does, yes there’s consequences of quarantine and the poor are always at a disadvantage in these situations but again it’s better than letting vulnerable people d*e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will never shut up about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ok but the REAL cultural reset was the big time rush and shinee collab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon it’ll be tough for a lot of people if we get quarantined but I guess many people will have to kind of treat it like a regular school holiday. hopefully the government will ensure that employers have to pay their employees sick leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboredgalx @luvvinjoon what will also be detrimental is if kids with asthma and underlying health conditions d*e just because we don’t wanna be at an inconvenience but go off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanEvanParker @OliverC26152412 @fumerosbeatz @TinkerpussBCcat then the government or the universities should be able to help international students. also it’s better to struggle a little during this epidemic than to have the most vulnerable dy*ng unnecessarily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daddysatan6669 @OliverC26152412 @fumerosbeatz @TinkerpussBCcat it won’t if the government provides support for businesses and employers as I said, I’d rather have a small dip at most in the economy than loads of vulnerable people getting seriously ill and the NHS suffering more than it already is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mix1682 @OliverC26152412 @fumerosbeatz @TinkerpussBCcat in some ways yes but as we can see from other countries, when schools are closed everything’s closed. the whole area gets quarantined and everyone stays home even if it’s not super strictly enforced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evielhooper1 @luvvinjoon point is, people with health conditions like asthma are likely to get seriously ill with the virus and they’re not expendable. prevent the d*aths of others rather than worrying about yourself too much, we’re not the ones who will suffer the most<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evielhooper1 @luvvinjoon you won’t be able to go on holiday if all flights are cancelled and the virus continues in summer because we sent tons of kids to exam halls to spread it. you’ll literally get more time to revise and they could even drop the grade boundaries to help you lot out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btbtbtsuga1 @cvpidbyun they can’t go out with their friends if a proper quarantine is in place. plus closing schools has been proven to be one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of viruses, everyone knows kids pick up all kinds of stuff at school and bring it home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverC26152412 @fumerosbeatz @TinkerpussBCcat not if they quarantine the whole country. all the government need to do is to make sure that employers pay their employees for time off and that’s pretty much it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warmkjh flies are gonna be like “it’s free real estate”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galaxycb97 jeeties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vmkreaI @_changjinnie_ @HEICHOCB97 clearly you know joon personally so phone him up for me and provide some evidence for this claim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARGHKIVE @_changjinnie_ @HEICHOCB97 multis are still army. pretty much everyone’s a multi anyways because youre still multifandom if you like western artists or books or movies as well as BTS. doesn’t mean you like BTS less, BTS themselves like other things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valwithluv @_changjinnie_ @HEICHOCB97 he didn’t,,,, he used a substitute which is very much still bad and needs to be apologised for asap. don’t spread misinformation tho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@131Ftmm @hanbin_spotify op means his personal Spotify, their account is dedicated to saying what songs he (apparently) listens to. his artist page is still up but it seems like he doesn’t use Spotify anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowoonLagoon also idk how my sixth form thinks it can change the dress code as if students can afford a whole new wardrobe of business clothes 🤡 they’re talking smth about tailored clothes too like this is a public school hello???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowoonLagoon oh nooo 😭😭 the secondary I went to from year 7-9 had long skirts too, you can always tell who the year 7s are because they’re so short that their skirt sometimes reaches their ankles.... it’s genuinely ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wait a minute now my school literally changed the dress code description on their website— they’re actually making it stricter brb gonna go riot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@softjoonss @vocaIinist I literally have an army bomb emoji thing in my bio?? 🔍 and being a multi doesn’t mean I like BTS less? I’m sure you like other things outside of BTS too which would also make you a multi 🥴<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@inoneofthestars ah true lol sorry ig if you have a whiteboard only then pick chalkboard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hold on which kinda board do you have in classrooms at your school<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@inoneofthestars dunno but I pulled it out the bag and I’m free to forget every maths related thing I ever learned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you’re worried for a celebrity then be worried for them WITHOUT bringing up other celebrities who have passed it’s unnecessary and lowkey disrespectful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilshitdamon it’s one thing to be worried for him but don’t bring up artists who have already passed, it puts people into unnecessary panic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angeIchenIe he looked high as a kite in every episode of that show but he’s just vibing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inoneofthestars got a 5 in the resit though and STILL don’t know square roots 💫 absolutely wizard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abigail2waeng @tamethybunny @armys_protect @txt4thgenleader you can’t expect millions of people to apologise for something they haven’t done or weren’t involved in. the small amount of people who were angry then mostly don’t care much anymore since everyone knows the lightstick changes color now so it’s not a big deal anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abigail2waeng @tamethybunny @armys_protect @txt4thgenleader as a shawol and a moa I can confirm that most shawols didn’t like this whole drama and didn’t support the hashtag. the number of people actually supporting the hashtag was pretty small and the entire drama settled a while ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mariapotatooo @Nathira_BTS @wooftxt @SadButBTS @armys_protect nah what I’m saying is that people who got angry were wasting their energy. we knew the lightstick was color-changing and the color in the teaser was almost definitely *supposed* to be green because of txt’s new album. but it’s a waste of time talking about it now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hobisplan3t @YE0NJOONS @bonnetsnjuice and anyway it’s really not a bad thing to sell merch with music either lol it’s just getting more than one item for a slightly cheaper price at the end of the day, still counts as an album sale and there’s nothing shameless about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hobisplan3t @YE0NJOONS @bonnetsnjuice mmm but selling the vinyl with the free downloads still technically counts as a bundle. I’m an army so I don’t understand why it’s a big issue anyways lol. BTS still generated a huge number of sales either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you’re 16+ and still fuelling fanwars on the bird app then you have some serious issues and you should log out while you work on them 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nathira_BTS @wooftxt @SadButBTS @armys_protect tbfh I don’t know why this account is bringing up this drama again when everyone knows it was a pointless drama between a few people and it’s not relevant anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nathira_BTS @wooftxt @SadButBTS @armys_protect some shawols said that the color shown in the lightstick teaser looked similar to shinee’s official color. tbh it was all a misunderstanding and most shawols agreed it was a silly thing to argue about. the lightstick changes color anyways so it’s not a big deal anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamethybunny @armys_protect @txt4thgenleader how is a whole fandom gonna apologise?? not all of us were saying the same thing?? also nobody said anything about the group people who did open their mouths only questioned the company<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hobisplan3t @YE0NJOONS @bonnetsnjuice but they did technically use bundles... the vinyl is sold with downloads of ON which is a bundle. bundles aren’t a negative thing and they’re good to boost sales and make fans more likely to buy a product.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexborsayy @4chloebear @BrettPransky getting quarantined properly &amp; cared for is the issue. it’s one thing to try and quarantine yourself and another for doctors to quarantine you. you’ll get food made for you if you’re properly quarantined and you’re less likely to spread it to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4chloebear @BrettPransky I live in the UK which has the NHS and I can see a doctor pretty much whenever is necessary, it’s you lot in America that won’t be able to see a doctor because you can’t go without getting into serious debt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bigshitHoe @BTS_twt that’s ok, we all kinda fall out of love with stuff sometimes. I know lots of people who aren’t really in the fandom anymore but they’re still casual listeners. tbh you’re still supporting BTS so I don’t see why anyone has a problem w this lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChoiceMusicLA instead of being unprofessional and continuing to reply to people in this manner, you need to realise that running rampant on your business twitter isn’t going to improve your business and instead makes you look like you don’t know what you’re doing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nightskycities @_RKArchive @Jiminsgrapes lord of the flies is a famous novel about a group of boys stranded on an island. the conch shell in the book is important because it brings the boys together, but it breaks when the boys start to hate each other and ultimately they burn down the island<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Candy5782908 @toooldtobe1 @hmvtweets if they truly gave us the group pcs because of the charting laws they would’ve advertised the album differently / told us / told the stores selling the album. the fact that we have 0 information suggests that this wasn’t intentional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Candy5782908 @toooldtobe1 @hmvtweets I doubt that’s the case, even with only group pcs the laws say that an album can’t chart if it comes with any freebies at all. also technically the group pcs are still “undisclosed” because they were advertised as random and we didn’t know about the pc problem until now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toooldtobe1 @hmvtweets it’s likely that in a couple weeks when this batch of albums sells out and stores order more, we’ll have other photocards available... unless the supplier makes the same mistake and we all start pulling one specific member<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toooldtobe1 @hmvtweets I’m pretty sure it’s an issue with the manufacturer / supplier since we weren’t warned beforehand, they probably printed the ot7 photocards first and sent out those albums as the first batch without realising we need a variety of photocards 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ibelhope @MuneNour @Minimoniemie @JINSAINTLAURENT @SpringDayKV613 yeah it’s not necessary to get overly angry about this, even if it’s unexpected it’s only really a minor disappointment for some of us and it’s definitely not BTS’s fault! tbh I’m still happy with it but it would’ve been better to know what we were getting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibelhope @MuneNour @Minimoniemie @JINSAINTLAURENT @SpringDayKV613 I get that and I trust that it’s genuine organic paper but we don’t have any official evidence of the sources,,, also it’s still kind of a shock as a consumer, they could’ve made a regular photobook with organic paper or at least made the paper thicker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mymikrokosmos7 @SpringDayKV613 the paper quality means it’ll be hard to use them as posters without damaging them. apparently it’s organic paper which is a nice thought but it is a bit disappointing and unexpected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MuneNour @Minimoniemie @ibelhope @JINSAINTLAURENT @SpringDayKV613 how are they ungrateful? we’re spending money on this product, we’re allowed to complain a little if it doesn’t meet our expectations. doesn’t mean we don’t appreciate the work that went into it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@155Sadia @UKBTSARMATION @lightschaeyoung @aegyojk_ @MercuryCeleste @taetaechia @BTS_twt still though it’s weird how this happened with no previous announcement, if it was intentional for charting laws I feel like they would’ve said something... still disappointing either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at first I was like “oh that’s kinda cute you get posters even if they’re thin” but that’s... the photobook? idk how to feel 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jung_HoSeokJin @taesdelicacy nobody’s said anything yet too so I still feel like it’s a behind the scenes problem. especially because pcs types are usually manufactured all at once so the group ones were probably made first and sent out as the first batch so without realising we need a variety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jung_HoSeokJin @taesdelicacy but it still kind of counts as undisclosed since we weren’t told we would get group pcs until we opened the album and the album was advertised with random pcs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jung_HoSeokJin @taesdelicacy yeah but that doesn’t explain all the group pcs! the law says an album can’t chart if it comes with freebies and there’s still freebies in the album so that can’t be why we’re all getting the same thing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearyeji yeah 😔 hopefully the supplier realised their mistake or other groups don’t decide to use that supplier for albums or it’ll become a repeat problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearyeji I don’t think this problem is caused by the regulations, the laws say an album can’t chart if it has any freebies whatsoever. basically kpop albums can’t chart unless they’re cd only. the group photocard problem is probably the supplier’s fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartthedoctor that’s what I mean, even with the group pcs it doesn’t solve the problem with chart laws so the fact we’re all pulling the same photocards probably isn’t caused by the laws. the album will still be unable to chart because we didn’t know we would get group pcs until we purchased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKBTSARMATION @155Sadia @lightschaeyoung @aegyojk_ @MercuryCeleste @taetaechia @BTS_twt yes they’re new but that still doesn’t explain all the group pcs. they would still count as a free item under the laws meaning the album will be unable to chart. it’s almost definitely the manufacturer or supplier here that made a mistake in printing or supplying albums<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearyeji I’m pretty sure this pc problem won’t affect other groups and it’s a one off mistake of the BTS supplier. HMV’s albums all seem to have the same group pc problem for BTS but i doubt other kpop albums will be affected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyIsAKiwi the UK charts laws will affect other groups but it’s not the laws that’s causing the group pc problem right now. it’s probably the supplier of the albums. if other groups use that supplier they might end up having the same problem but it’s unlikely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartthedoctor since we didn’t have this issue with persona I think it’s a one off, especially since we haven’t gotten any official mention of the chart laws affecting albums so it’s probably just a mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartthedoctor depends, I don’t think it’s the chart laws causing this but it’s probably the UK manufacturer / supplier. contacting the sellers e.g. Asda and HMV and asking them who their supplier is might be a good idea so we can explain the issue to the supplier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearyeji 1. if you buy overseas it doesn’t count to the UK chart but you shouldn’t have the pc problem that we have over here  2. it’s probably not the chart that’s causing the pc problem but the local manufacturers / suppliers that messed something up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@155Sadia @lightschaeyoung @aegyojk_ @MercuryCeleste @taetaechia @UKBTSARMATION @BTS_twt but that still wouldn’t explain it... we’re still getting photocards from the album so even all group pcs wouldn’t solve the chart issue. I think the album supplier or manufacturer messed up at some point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminzies @KiwiJHS the issue is with the UK supplier so if you order from somewhere like HMV you’ll probably get albums from the UK supplier since it’s the closest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>if we get robbed of heaven AGAIN I’m rioting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taesdelicacy again though in theory it shouldn’t really affect kpop albums since you know you get a photocard with the album... I hope bighit or the UK album supplier(s) address it soon because some kind of miscommunication must have happened somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taesdelicacy + in theory even if this was meant to happen it doesn’t really solve the problem since we didn’t know we would only get group photo cards until we bought the albums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taesdelicacy it’s weird that they haven’t released an official statement about that though. plus in theory that law shouldn’t affect BTS albums since in the album description it says you get a photocard and the law affects only undisclosed items in albums.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@outrokthh BLACK SWAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin @DowoonLagoon oof in that case... 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin @DowoonLagoon shipping from weply is insane though 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowoonLagoon @flowerbabyjimin yep. armys from other countries don’t seem to be having this problem either so I guess you can order from anywhere that isn’t the UK to have a chance at getting a single member photocard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyjay1994 yes but nevertheless we didn’t know we would be getting nothing but group photocards until we bought and opened the albums... the fact they’re all the same would still not solve that problem if it’s really stopping the album from breaking into the UK chart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin @DowoonLagoon technically it is a disclosed item though since it’s in the album description that you get a photocard and a postcard. and even though we have this issue it doesn’t change the fact it’s still a pc in an album<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowoonLagoon @flowerbabyjimin I’m not sure but in theory if you order from abroad you shouldn’t have the issue with the group pcs since it seems to be just an issue with UK stock of the album<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGONISM technically it is specified prior to purchase as it’s included in the item description of the album though... and even every pc being the same wouldn’t make a difference since they didn’t tell us it would all be group pcs before we bought the album<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90sandbts fr.... people think kids can’t have mental health problems or that you can’t be bullied from a young age. I was bullied since I was 4 and it still affects me now. schools and adults never take it seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asda @BTS_twt hey, could I ask who your supplier is for these albums?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyjay1994 I wouldn’t think that album contents would have an impact on charts, plus this is a new issue that we didn’t have with persona or anything... not really sure what’s going on w this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin ‼️ this is from their website  https://t.co/P5vdvSn3kH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin good idea, good luck in your quest 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin if your albums are shipped here from abroad you might not have the pc issue, looks like it’s just UK stock... also instead of weply you could try ordering from  https://t.co/NSqdWhWyBP instead of .co.uk because shipping might end up being cheaper lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@puffincraft honestly 😭 I love the group pcs but the anticipation is just gone, kinda takes the joy out of it really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixuries hmm, depends on if the amazon seller is using local UK stock or if they’re shipping from outside the UK ig since it seems it’s just an issue with manufacturers or distributors here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyjay1994 @btsbanter in fact my mum suggested they might have manufactured or distributed the albums with group pcs first which might be causing the problem, aka unless they stop sending them out in batches like that we’ll have separate waves of just one type of photocard in every album<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin i mean you could try hanging on to them in case pc traders outside the UK are trying to get ahold of the group versions lol,, but you should send them back or complain since there’s clearly a production issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGONISM oof 😭 in theory Tesco should be the cheapest place to get it though so maybe you won low-key<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerbabyjimin yeah it’s pretty messed up.... probably the fault of the UK manufacturers and distributors and the way they made the albums + photocards. they might have made or sent out the ones with group pcs first so individual member pcs will only show up later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGONISM if Tesco doesn’t have them Asda and HMV should!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsbanter @amyjay1994 probably the UK manufacturers or distributors messed up at some point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@army_bts_uk what pc did you get? people have been saying albums in the UK have only the group photocard and there’s no individual member pcs :|<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>f in the chat for photocard traders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the group pcs are adorable of course but it’s a bit unfair for uk armys that we basically have no chance of getting anything else ://<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bruh apparently some BTS album manufacturer messed up the UK orders and there’s only group photocards in every mots 7 album<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlanTho59976503 @Boxneeds23 @machiavelli411 @BBCBreakfast @sajidjavid @patel4witham @BorisJohnson ...and another one. the stats for people who haven’t applied for settled status are high. that means deportations are only going to keep rising in number  https://t.co/qSt1el3yc3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Boxneeds23 @AlanTho59976503 @machiavelli411 @BBCBreakfast @sajidjavid @patel4witham @BorisJohnson plus a lot of people nowadays are being deported when they haven’t committed a crime and they’ve never visited the country they’re being deported to. that’s wrong nevertheless<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae breaking the boundaries of being an idol and instead going further than that. again doesn’t mean that BTS are the only ones considered as artists 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae what is the “usual standards”? you’re generalising based on the fact that the music is Korean. you wouldn’t do that to western artists. you’re just as bad as the westerners who made the word kpop because they don’t see it on the same level as western pop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae many other Korean singers are considered as artists. “idol” shouldn’t be a negative term.

<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae lmao that’s like saying Ariana grande can’t become popular without being associated with pop music. BTS made it into the western market anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae point is they’ve already broken the boundaries of that term. why would you erase their hard work to break away from stereotypes? and try telling the locals that they aren’t kpop. they will always be seen as kpop so instead of fighting that support them in changing the meaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keywols yas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae that’s not the case, you’re ignoring the success of earlier gen groups who were already climbing global charts in the early 2010s. even the late 2000s for some countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae lmaooo they still don’t sell more than all groups combined 🤣 that’s a sample of the top groups in a certain expanse of time. plus going back to the original matter they’re still kpop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanTho59976503 @machiavelli411 @BBCBreakfast @sajidjavid @patel4witham @BorisJohnson fair enough I guess but it’s still kinda odd to deport someone to country they don’t remember or recognise (or might not even speak the language of). plus in that case we should take back all the British nationals living elsewhere who have committed crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanTho59976503 @machiavelli411 @BBCBreakfast @sajidjavid @patel4witham @BorisJohnson interesting that white foreign nationals that have committed terrible crimes aren’t getting deported but Jamaican nationals are? interesting that we would deport people who have all lived here for years or even since they were kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanTho59976503 @machiavelli411 @BBCBreakfast @sajidjavid @patel4witham @BorisJohnson how much you wanna bet that there’s very few (or no) white people in the list of people they’re trying to deport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae if BTS were truly the only kpop idols recognised on a global stage then other kpop artists wouldn’t be topping the world album charts too. BTS has great success but that doesn’t mean that other groups aren’t successful at all. that mentality got BTS stepped on as rookies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae have an impact.  BTS aren’t the only group that have had great success in the US either. former president Obama mentioned SHINee in one of his speeches. you can’t claim that BTS are the only ones recognised globally because that isn’t the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae sales in the US isn’t the only criteria for success. yall drag groups that target US markets but then think success revolves around the US. the biggest genre in music right now is pop so BTS are big amongst pop artists, but there’s other stars that aren’t pop artists that still-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae BTS don’t sell more than the groups combined lmaooo bighit’s revenue is bigger than the collective revenue of the big three but I have no idea where you got it from that they sell more than every other group 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae also who cares what locals think? locals don’t decide whether a group is successful or not lmao. most people won’t be able to list off names of artists who make a genre or style of music they don’t like or listen to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmelHammad1 @namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae I’m not saying other groups had the same impact but BTS aren’t the only group having success globally. locals probably can’t name stars from the rock industry either but that doesn’t mean that rock music doesn’t have an impact for example<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kiladaaa @GGONISM @PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt I agree kpop isn’t a genre but BTS still fall under the term “kpop” by definition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kiladaaa @GGONISM @PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt the fact that you’re talking about “manufactured music” clearly shows how you think BTS are the only Korean artists that compose/write their own music 😶 perhaps a lil xenophobic... “Korean artists are all manufactured! not BTS tho”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_LoveRoha @hvpeworlds @selenap0425 @yourcoupdegrace @MAXMusic @modooborahae you misread what I said lol they’re in the same category as other kpop artists (and global artists!!!) but no artist or group is the same. you can’t compare Beyoncé and Billie Eilish but they might end up taking part in the same award show for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @GGONISM @Kiladaaa @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic bruh the person who wrote that said themselves they’re open to debate damn... plus try telling people who haven’t heard of BTS/kpop that BTS aren’t kpop lmaooo you’re fighting a losing war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt “kpop category isn’t big enough for me” he’s saying that the stereotypes of Korean music don’t define him and he’s more than them 🥴 they don’t want to limit it to kpop because people think kpop is all bubblegum pop. they’ve worked past those limitations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It bURNSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JYST GOT CHILLI IN@MY EYEEEE HELP  https://t.co/obCdzhjMH5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt because BTS is the biggest artist in kpop right now so obviously he’s gonna give them credit individually because they’re bringing millions into the SK economy. doesn’t mean they aren’t kpop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kiladaaa @PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt kpop artists don’t just belong to the big 3 companies, plus bighit has a higher revenue than all the big 3 COMBINED. I still believe BTS are kpop but they’re breaking stereotypes that people try to drag them into<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjunhole UNBELIEVABLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hvpeworlds @selenap0425 @yourcoupdegrace @MAXMusic @modooborahae “not representatives of kpop” means that kpop is more than just BTS and there are other artists who are different to them.  and I already said they don’t wanna be confined to kpop because people judge kpop and stereotype it. they already broke those boundaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ok I have politics class please pray 4 me this class is dead boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>btspoppers are a disease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hvpeworlds @selenap0425 @yourcoupdegrace @MAXMusic @modooborahae that’s because the word “kpop” was created because white people dont wanna see Korean music on the same level as western music lmao BTS themselves have said they are a kpop group by definition but they won’t stick to stereotypes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namgiseok391218 @MAXMusic @modooborahae other kpop acts are also having an impact globally lmaooo it’s not only BTS that are experiencing success otherwise yall wouldn’t feel so threatened by this tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @kazuburger @darklingschime @MAXMusic @BTS_twt this doesn’t make any other group unsuccessful lmao just not at successful as BTS. but BTS are still kpop whether you like it or not 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnimalsMatterUK @skycarlton you do realise that it’s not just Asian countries that do that? and some meat is mislabeled on purpose by sellers so you’re not eating what you think you are. eg. Tesco selling horse meat as beef a few years ago in the UK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 true but i still don’t like comparing numbers because journalists see that and wanna start comparing BTS to other groups like that in their crap articles lol. BTS’s style and message is what sets them apart from other groups and it’s what got them their success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 that’s what I mean, usually rookie groups start off completely unknown to the industry but superm didn’t. however they’re still technically a new group and no one knew what to expect from them so to me they’re rookies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 yep lol, BTS are forming their own path and theyre their own people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 rookies that have members that aren’t already known in the industry, like BTS or TXT. all the members were previously known so yeah I agree they had a headstart in their popularity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 also comparing numbers of both groups is encouraging journalists to compare BTS to others all the time... I think it’s best to say they’re both very different groups and leave it at that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinniepiphanies @yangsbtw @MiCasaOT7 not necessarily. a lot of people didn’t want to support the new group/subunit. they’re not classic rookies but they’re still a rookie group who didn’t have total support in the beginning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MACIPIINK true, idk why they made the whole of BTS go up n perform when it was only namjoon who did the collab and they were just gonna put everyone at the back anyway 💀 glad I didn’t watch it sounds like a shambles to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MACIPIINK kinda weird how billy ray cyrus who also hopped on the trend gets to be front and centre while BTS are pushed back tho, it was lil nas’s song so how come he gets to be at the front but the other collaborators don’t 🤨 kinda odd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THICJ00N you lot are so wrong for this 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes it also doesn’t change the fact I can like the storyline / characters / theme of a game and become a fan without having to physically play it lmaooo stop gatekeeping and find a hobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes when you’re struggling to make ends meet they will be a luxury 🤩 you clearly grew up in an environment where your parents hand you everything on a silver platter and you can always afford what you want. can’t relate. the only consoles I have are a Nintendo wii and dsi mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes ok so why can’t someone become a fan of a game without playing it?? people can show the same level of devotion to a game without having to drop a few hundred on a console to play it. gaming streamers are popular for a reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes I can show support without having to pay for a subscription service. being a fan isn’t about how much money you can put in someone’s pockets. it’s about loving what a person does and trying to spread that joy to other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes sorry I’m not privileged and rich enough to buy games consoles and video games just to play games I’m interested in 🤪 same way I can’t always buy merch for the artists are like. ur entitlement is scary lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EB0YBAEK yessss akskdjfjfgjvk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EB0YBAEK yes lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alias_Sal @LAbundantia @ChaddoesThngs @BadGamingTakes why would I need to buy a subscription to be counted as a fan when the money from that goes to a company and not the actual artist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MariAndAnne @XIAHTIQ “most people don’t know shinee! ...but I do” I have 2 laugh. also the hashtag meant “pearl aqua is shinee” which isn’t really a nasty hate hashtag but ok<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@angelvmins selling a ticket for way more than face value is wrong in itself but everyone knew BTS was having a cb which usually =tour anyways... if they knew they wouldn’t be able to afford to see a group they preferred then why even buy a ticket lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ena_Wen @shadow_twts @BTS_twt Wembley is bigger by about 8,000 seats<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks I wouldn’t say that’s exactly serious hate lmao and anyway we all know nobody can do shit to change a lightstick &amp; merch already in production. nothing will really happen as a result of this so the people that are getting mad can scream into the void if they wanna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezilil @tmhseok @elisa_jkm @fvevita @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks I’m not trying to defend the people who are getting pressed about this. txt’s colour is more green than shinee’s and the lightstick changes colour anyways. but please don’t think that all shawols are like this when shinee, BTS, txt &amp; their fandoms have gotten on well in the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezilil @tmhseok @elisa_jkm @fvevita @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks ok so we’re on the same page then. a few thousand still doesn’t represent a few hundred thousand. a tag will also have tweets under it that disagree with the tag itself which is what helped it trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezilil @tmhseok @elisa_jkm @fvevita @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks they clearly agreed that shawols were being annoying about this whole issue lol therefore it’s not as if the entire fandom is losing their marbles over a colour that isn’t actually even our fandom colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bangtanjongsuk @elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks we have been I already dropped several receipts in response to someone else. never said we were saints I clearly said I don’t agree w any of this so put your reading comprehension skills into practice before you reply next time! 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks I clearly said I don’t agree with it, please read my tweets thoroughly before responding 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fvevita @elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks you make it sound like we all had a secret meeting where hundreds of thousands of us said “yeah, let’s be dumb online!” that’s simply not the case lol. also Korean fans often do silly things anyway, we saw what happened with Chen lately. don’t judge many by the actions of a few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fvevita @elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks not trying to play victim, just pointing out how some people trying to defend txt are saying some nasty ass stuff and nobody’s really calling them out apart from shawols. no need to make this uglier than it already is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks the hashtag wasn’t even a hate tag it means “pearl aqua is SHINee”... it was purposefully worded to not ignite serious hate... I don’t agree w it either way but people aren’t really trying to drag anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks it wasn’t exactly a major trend tho lmao. everyone was using that hashtag including people who disagreed w it. the tag only trended in a couple places<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @fvevita @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks shawols have always moved in silence. it’s when we don’t move in silence that our favs get dragged and people start bringing up mental health thinking it’s a drag. here’s a couple examples tho  https://t.co/xxd5JeOgx1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks lmao some people sure did. see how it’s dumb to say armys tried to claim purple when in fact it was just a couple of bored twitter bitches? just turning it to a diff perspective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fvevita @elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks again though, you can’t see a group of people doing something and then say that every person in a fandom did it too. people do and say stupid stuff online. doesn’t mean the rest of the fandom agrees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks ok in that case does that mean people can say that every single army out there was also trying to copyright a colour by saying purple belongs to BTS? every fandom has its dumbasses unfortunately it’s simply not preventable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks lmao how do you know that? did you see every single person in the fandom try to drag BTS? I don’t think so. I lot of this fandom including me is not only a shawol but also an army or a MOA. a group of people in a fandom being annoying doesn’t mean you can trash the entire fandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisa_jkm @tmhseok @DZ_lamo @soobinscheeks yes they did especially since BTS &amp; TXT both like shinee. BTS get on especially well with shinee and TXT look up to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>tv show stan twitter is starting to influence me lads we are walking into hard stan territory 🧍‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk who needs to hear this but an edit is not a fancam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 that’s a bit different to what I’ve heard. I’ve heard that most Koreans call kpop “idol music” and BTS still fall under that idea. I don’t think the term “idol” should be seen as a bad thing. again it’s about a prejudiced perspective. BTS have broken those boundaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KieranJC20 @lcvesicktae @itvnews I agree there needs to be more education for young people. but I knew about the menstrual cycle by age 9 because my school taught it to me, and very few people will have a period before that age. I think they’ll be educated enough to know the value of those products.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 I think it’s better to say that BTS are kpop but also demonstrate how they’re breaking the mould &amp; breaking boundaries. I feel like that would give people a much better view of BTS and of Korean artists as they stop putting them in a prejudiced box<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 I agree with that. however a lot of people saying that “BTS aren’t kpop” just say that because they have a prejudiced view of other Korean artists. I think BTS will always be seen as kpop by the locals and it’s kinda hopeless to scream into the void.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KieranJC20 @lcvesicktae @itvnews there’s also toilet paper in bathrooms. there’s not a whole lot of people who grab loo rolls from their school toilets to muck around with them. sanitary products aren’t really different, anyone with a period at least knows not to mess about with them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KieranJC20 @lcvesicktae @itvnews how would it be abused? it would just make it easier and less embarrassing to grab a pad or smth lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 it lists kpop as a genre because western people don’t wanna see Korean music on the same level as western pop lmaooo so why would yall btspop armys try to say they’re not kpop when you should be challenging people’s perceptions instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 they said they don’t represent kpop because people always think kpop = BTS which it doesn’t. they’re saying there’s a variety of kpop artists. plus they’ve already broken the mould surrounding kpop idols and they will always be viewed as idols nevertheless 🥴🥴🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 all their other songs are in Korean therefore they are still kpop / k-edm / khiphop artists 🥴 I thought that was obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skzamgel @HEEJINCY then fight that negative connotation rather than trying to separate BTS from the kpop industry. I agree that black swan isn’t exactly pop but even western artists get their music incorrectly labelled as the wrong genre so it’s not specific to BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 also stating that they are “not a typical kpop artist” means you’re generalising based on language / ethnicity and proving op’s point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBest0fM3 kpop isn’t a genre. even yoongi said that. kpop is just the pop music genre in Korean. so BTS can be considered kpop or khiphop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lcvesicktae @itvnews they weren’t government funded before ig but honestly what’s the point if they’re not gonna put them in the bathrooms so we don’t have to go to the school office n ask<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andiironda @gwangjuslight I would say they’re kpop lol however it’s important to listen to music without prejudice and since BTS cover a wide variety of genres I think there’s something for everyone in their discography<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mxria90s @jikookandsprite @gwangjuslight @BTS_twt they also said “You can call me artist (artist) You can call me idol (idol) 아님 어떤 다른 (다른) 뭐라 해도 I don't care I don't care I'm proud of it (proud of it)”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jounieverse @s7turday @gwangjuslight lmao so you’re suggesting that BTS are the ONLY Korean artists that create their own music? take a seat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vminsduet NOOFOKFJGGJ LONDON ARMYS OUT HERE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTI84800885 he handed his phone over to police and allowed himself to be questioned suggesting he knew he could have evidence so what now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop I never said he had any accusers 🤡 the police are saying he may have committed crimes however<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop well he’s accused now lmao the new charges are apparently genuinely accusing him of things like: 29 counts of prostitution for foreign investors, sharing naked photos etc. yes there’s nothing confirmed yet but I never said there was anything confirmed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop I didn’t stan at the time but when I found out after I stanned I did genuinely hesitate. but since his accuser dropped the case with no further issues I have no problem with him at all &amp; continue to stan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lynn67363299 @britt08192413 @drakpop1589 @allkpop ok that’s fair. mainly I just think people should take a step back and support him quietly rather than arguing and defending him. that way you can celebrate if he’s found innocent or be less affected if he’s guilty. I did that with someone I stanned in the same situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop because yall are invalidating potential victims. yes innocent until proven guilty, I already said that, but simultaneously you can quietly consider him innocent instead of jumping to defend him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zineb14102000 @drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop because I ain’t accusing him 😙👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop rather than constantly defending someone who MIGHT have done bad things, you could sit back and wait as things develop. it’s not as hard as you make it sound lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop lmao I was a fan of another person who was involved in bad allegations, I took a step back while it was going on and quietly supported but waited. turns out they weren’t taken to the police and the accuser’s story kept changing. can yall not do the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britt08192413 @drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop lmfaooo I ain’t but ok 😙 if it turns out you defended a bad person it won’t make you look very good babes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTI84800885 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop if she’s being filmed without consent it’s still illegal, and honestly it’ll probably be pretty obvious if someone’s being filmed without consent. plus the fact he turned himself in when the police started investigating suggests he knew something was up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drakpop1589 @Lynn67363299 @allkpop ok but yall still defending him when he could’ve done all sorts of horrible stuff 🤡 wait and see before you jump in his defence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lynn67363299 @allkpop I think it isn’t right to defend someone when they could be guilty. he’s innocent until proven guilty, however he didn’t speak up about the video he saw of a woman being hurt by others. I feel like the way he didn’t say anything is really bad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @goIdensunx @vantescunt that happened to me, because my year did well in tests when we were 10/11 they raised the boundary for maths and English tests when we’re 15/16 so long story short I failed maths and dropped 3 grades in English lit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @goIdensunx @vantescunt also grade boundaries change so you can ace the test but if the exam board decide to raise the score needed for a grade then you’ll get a lower grade anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @goIdensunx @vantescunt lmao that’s 2/3 exams for each subject (chem, biology, physics). it’s almost worse having more exams because prolonged torture + your total is based on an average so if you fail one exam you kinda fail them all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @goIdensunx @vantescunt plus we often do multiple final exams a day and that goes on for months. GCSEs are about 2/3 months of exams so you’re constantly studying. we have more exams than America too, there’s 6 to 9 science tests you’re required to take depending on which course you choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @goIdensunx @vantescunt you can get extra time, but having life changing grades all reliant on a couple of exams is still tough. I have anxiety and as a result my grades drop drastically if I start getting anxious during a test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goIdensunx @kris10cain @vantescunt exactly!! it puts loads of people at a disadvantage if they don’t cope well with tests / need extra provisions for exams. and if you wanna resit to get a better grade it costs a ton so kids who don’t have that kinda money don’t have the chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP THAT ASS BITCH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>if I get my results and I haven’t passed maths. god.  https://t.co/3RRbdXiAlv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris10cain @vantescunt ok but in the UK literally our entire grade is based on testing, we still do homework, presentations etc. but it counts for nothing except for avoiding detention if you don’t do it 😭 our colleges don’t have multiple choice either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@V0REJINNIE connect BTS is when they set up screens in places to advertise the comeback, they’ve done it for a while apparently so we’re probably getting another ad like the one in Trafalgar Square last year<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>tw//  in year 5 they lost my application form for therapy. in year 8 they said I “didn’t cross the threshold”. in year 9 I started started self harming and that’s when I finally started getting help. if I had started therapy earlier I would’ve gotten a lot better sooner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CAMHS is underfunded, understaffed and the training therapists go through is not enough so stop them from saying stupid shit to kids and outing them to their parents<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SANRlSE no it’s ok!! people wanted to cancel out of respect for jonghyun but shawols dont mind!! it’s not cancelled at all, take part if you want to 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeIIowsang people wanted to cancel it out of respect for jonghyun since he passed in December 2017, but his fans don’t want it to be cancelled and we have no issue with it going ahead 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@multistanheart nah, shawols don’t want it to be cancelled...... selca days aren’t disrespectful and it’s fine to go ahead with them, I’ve seen lots of shawols on the tl insisting to not cancel 💖<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>bored of fighting terfs now how should I get views and piss people off next hrmmmm  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan please go back to the original topic as I do not want to draw out a conversation with a grouchy old lady on twitter who will kick the bucket sad and alone as trans people live their lives happily as they should  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan trans people want the same rights as everyone else and that does not affect me as a woman and will not drastically change my life forever  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @BloomPandy  https://t.co/Ui9rVLE9LL   https://t.co/2BYBQSuzqt   https://t.co/qMUDhv0rkm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan LOL, adults who are TERFs and can’t keep themselves from trying to control the lives and gender identities of others who have nothing to do with them aren’t people whose opinions I would care about, sweetie.  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan you’re diverting to an entirely separate topic to avoid the main argument, you remind me of a bad politician  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @tibby17 people holding a bat pretending to break their phone screen is not a direct threat, not directly in response to anyone and targeted at young people who aren’t as easily offended as you  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @BloomPandy biology also backs up the idea of people being trans due to variation in chromosomes and several other factors. if you would like article links then I will gladly provide  https://t.co/ZBj3fWySKr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan lmao would you like me to ask my adult friends and the adult fans that I follow for their opinion on this or would you like your head to remain up your arse  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danish_Karen @tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan thank you for taking the time to look at my account to distract from my point because you feel threatened by me and can’t find anything else to say in response  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan my life doesn’t revolve around the people I support and the music I listen to but you’re trying to distract from my point because you feel threatened by the weak foundations of your argument collapsing beneath you  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @tibby17 also, trans women are women. whether you like it or not.  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @tibby17 that’s an outdated ideology and blatant transphobia. phobias are meant to be overcome so please speak to trans people and hear their stories before demonising them.  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan where did you come to that conclusion? adults listen to this music too.  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @BloomPandy because a video draws attention to my tweet and I can do whatever I like on twitter.  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s always the boomers who are TERFs sighhhhh  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @SorchaMacLennan I am a woman lmaooo and yet I still support trans rights because they in no way make me any less of a woman and my femininity is not fragile unlike yours clearly is  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @BloomPandy it’s not a serious threat it’s just millennial / gen z humour but ok you can stay out of the loop if you wanna   https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SorchaMacLennan @tibby17 offensive humour is not a serious threat but rather a response to rowling’s hate speech  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tibby17 @BloomPandy TERFs can’t take a joke huh....... boomer culture  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @AllianceLGB you should be saying that to yourself since you’re clearly so intent on controlling others gender identities  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @AllianceLGB naw they can live happily when people like miss maya, miss Rowling and YOU learn to respect them and stop blaming them for a lady losing her job when she brought it on herself  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @AllianceLGB trans people literally just existing is not taking away anyone’s rights 🤨 they’re asking to be treated as who they identify as, this doesn’t take anything away from anyone  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloomPandy @AllianceLGB actually her contract expired and wasn’t renewed and it was HER hate speech that cost her her job, not anyone saying anything lmaooo  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jacky_North @helensteel12 that’s a different sorta convo though main point is that people can identify who they wanna identify as because it harms nobody  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanWils85095455 @edanaming says the transphobe lmao nice logic  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exiudeux NO FUCKING WAYYY 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanWils85095455 @edanaming bruhhh we got an old man using emojis now they’re advancing but unfortunately their transphobic mindset isn’t  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@switchseokjin why would you think that? ily and I love it when I see ur tweets in my tl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShurelyNot @NormanSiebrasse then why you keep replying and cussing me out? interesting logic you have  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorEris_ @ShermanatorYT @ShurelyNot @NormanSiebrasse I use fancams for precisely this reason: to make y’all mad enough to use slurs as a response lmao nice 1  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cdnwaters @DrDebraSoh please re read my previous tweet for an answer to your question, reading comprehension is something that you should’ve learned at a young age  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hurting some transphobes feelings tonight 🥺  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShurelyNot @NormanSiebrasse aw did I hurt your feelings 🥺  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAOOO transphobe down  https://t.co/ug6hybmzX5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchellTWilso2 @DrDebraSoh the way to help those people is allow them to identify the way they wish. they’re not hurting anyone and it doesn’t directly affect you at all so why get mad over someone living their life and minding their business?  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShermanatorYT @ShurelyNot @NormanSiebrasse a video draws attention to my tweet and makes a viewer more likely to read it while also getting your panties in a twist, a win-win  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helensteel12 but they aren’t male though. they are a women and most get surgery to appear as such, therefore they face catcalling and mistreatment the same as we do. not a hard concept to understand  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdnwaters @DrDebraSoh I don’t usually lmao you’re missing the point ma’am, accepting people for who they are isn’t hard stop trying so hard to misread my tweet  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchellTWilso2 @DrDebraSoh there’s no room for conversation when it comes to accepting people for who they are and not supporting blatant hate speech (which is a crime! 😘)  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fighting with transphobes was a good idea, I’m getting views AND making em mad yaaassss  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlessandraAster gender is a social construct and trans people have been around for thousands of years, it’s 2019 and you’re still transphobic?  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marksovac @MForstater gender is a social construct, trans women are women and trans men are men. learn to respect others before tweeting  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShurelyNot @NormanSiebrasse you made an entire account dedicated to discrimination against a minority and hate speech, please get a life and learn to respect people  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aniobrien @MForstater @Docstockk minorities should be represented by our government and the fact that you say otherwise is evidence of the privilege you have and your high and mighty attitude  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoniaPoulton trans women are women  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helensteel12 trans women are women and face the same discrimination as us + discrimination because they’re trans, this tweet is the perfect example  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDebraSoh no, we can’t. trans women are women and they deserve to be treated as such, if you believe differently then you’re transphobic  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godblesstoto “reasonable” in your language must mean hate speech and disrespect towards a minority  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madeleinekearns if people centuries ago could respect trans people then so can you  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanessaOblinger there’s a difference between being feminist and being a TERF. one respects trans people and people with gender dysphoria, the other doesn’t  https://t.co/ZBj3fWySKr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shygirlpaigy ok TERF  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharrond62 please educate yourself on why trans people want/need to change their gender before tweeting  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllianceLGB anyways support LGBT rights and speak out against institutional transphobia  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edanaming TERFs everywhere nowadays huh  https://t.co/ZBj3fWhhST<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pizerhall @cheekybananaboy @ModJack just like thatcher in 1935 who privatised tons of British owned companies and would’ve done the same to the NHS if we had the chance. and once she was out of office labour got a landslide victory. big red flag innit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizerhall @cheekybananaboy @ModJack wild assumption to make about millions of people. also do you have nothing to say about everything else Boris has done? if so we can end the convo here x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snugyeoI the ga tickets are spilt into numbers to organise what areas people go into the standing area so 1-20 is a free for all while ga2 should mean you get a specific area close to the stage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snugyeoI oh, so ga2 must be where you’re supposed to be standing! Wembley arena standing area is one big rectangle, I’m not sure how they organise it but ga2 will either mean right, left, or at the front of the pit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snugyeoI general admission 2, I’m assuming the number means the order you’re supposed to be let into the arena in or which part of the standing area you’ll be in? so GA1 will be closest to the stage and GA2 is slightly further back<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daesddeux @ConfessingToKai @adorekais dreadlocks nowadays are linked to the Rastafarian religion, also POC who wear dreadlocks are still discriminated against for their hair. it’s not right for people from backgrounds w no history tied to dreadlocks to wear them when people still face injustice for that hair<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realskybro2465 @Discount_Soup he could’ve called us out and I wouldn’t have said shit lmao idc if someone doesn’t like kpop but THEN he made additional comments that crossed the line. the fact that nobody’s complaining about not liking kpop but instead about his other comments tells u all u need to know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peepeem45244039 @Discount_Soup is that your final answer  https://t.co/cC2JC5tGVT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thelunarguy_ @Discount_Soup it wasn’t all of us my guy one troll doesn’t represent absolutely everybody. and yes that stan loona shit is annoying I think everyone can agree on that lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TBUnbroken @AmbrosiaXOX @Discount_Soup you really used ur phone space for a racist video yeesh please get a life before hopping into my mentions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoaAmdam nah it’s wrong on both sides. just saying it’s really not a good way to try and get back at people by dragging others into it which is precisely what h3h3 just did in one of his tweets 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legacy1942 I understand, I just feel a little uncomfortable mentioning those who have passed since so many people bring them up as a way of “getting back at kpop stans” so unfortunately we have to be pretty careful. I feel like he would have felt strongly about it too though ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbrosiaXOX @Discount_Soup doesn’t mean that the entire damn race is racist holy fuck please listen to yourself before popping up in my mentions again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManLikeAnte @AmbrosiaXOX @Discount_Soup lmao I wasn’t using the word nonce seriously you fucking doughnut sit tf down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ultkeyk additionally  https://t.co/Dj3ODeZllr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelelMorn @Discount_Soup people who obsess over their favs are weird, at the same time though there’s nothing wrong with sharing pictures and videos of your favourite performer, people have been doing that for decades already anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelelMorn @Discount_Soup lmfao imagine thinking that people who like non-English music are koreaboos omfg that’s crazy x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbrosiaXOX @Discount_Soup that’s an extremely racist generalisation, you have some issues please work on them 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelelMorn @Discount_Soup wait then do you think I’m attracted to you or smth......  https://t.co/Ay03iio8O1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimbio56 @The_JEW_Spencer if you say the n word then yes!! 🥴 a word with centuries of oppression tied to it!! please educate yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w9npil why is this so funnykdjdjdiid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_COSTRA_ I started watching a while ago and stopped because he’s done shit like using slurs and saying the n word too... edgy humour is great but he crossed the line way back and is completely unapologetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_eriique fair deal  https://t.co/lD5yqx1cUq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Discount_Soup I’d have to disagree lol but either way he deserves to be dragged to hell and back because he’s an absolute nonce so either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelelMorn @Discount_Soup says the person who quite literally just used a slur whew please get help asap and let people live d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollieSavesBees tired of seeing innocent people being dragged into this bs though it’s fucking tiring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_JEW_Spencer he still said it though and racist slurs are still slurs no matter what context they’re in lmao even idubbbz was uncomfortable and that’s an achievement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_COSTRA_ at this point he’s made similar mistakes in the past and still hasn’t learned, there are so many more similar content creators who don’t screw up like that so I’d rather support them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Discount_Soup he sexualised young girls and has said racist and all sorts else in the past, don’t try and defend him 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legacy1942 don’t bring people’s names into this it’s highly disrespectful and makes their fans extremely uncomfortable thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollieSavesBees as of online ab*se doesn’t also happen in the music industry as a whole but y’all just wanna single out kpop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imafantasticbae you have “biG bAnG iS 5” as your display name sit this one out apologist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoaAmdam we sure can complain when innocent people are getting disrespected, y’all are lowering yourselves to the same level as the shitty stans and you’re not even getting back at the trolls because they usually don’t even stan the people y’all are disrespecting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doombabadoom @131LSDdiscount I’m DMd now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>there are so many catfishes on this dang bird app and y’all keep falling for it lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhythmToTheGuns @SOPETOES @ybovieth @BTS_SHINeeGirl @everqlows I hope he actually gets cancelled this time around. offensive humour is great until it’s no longer funny, with any luck people will go and look for better content and let his channel kick the bucket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhythmToTheGuns @SOPETOES @ybovieth @BTS_SHINeeGirl @everqlows he’s been commenting on people’s su*c*des... he already crossed the line and he’s just taking it further. people defending him like their life defends on it just because “kpop bad” is an absolute piss take when they would never defend him otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhythmToTheGuns @SOPETOES @ybovieth @BTS_SHINeeGirl @everqlows I get that, you’re right. the only thing he should be dragged for is his ugly personality imo. still though I can understand why people are so pissed, all his recent tweets have just been adding to the situation and revealing his true colours as the shitty person he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kpop stans may suck ass but the stuff h3h3 has said is unacceptable and you can’t defend that bs #h3h3isoverparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ganzo47845251 @jiuspinky it’s a direct quote there’s not anything to be taken out of context when the context is clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuywhoisUnknown @jiuspinky sexualising minors is not something to be joked about, and let’s not forget his xenophobic comments too x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhythmToTheGuns @SOPETOES @ybovieth @BTS_SHINeeGirl @everqlows you’re not lmao but people like him deserve to get dragged to hell and back<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doombabadoom @131LSDdiscount open ur DMs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anxiqty @NoaAmdam I’m not saying you can’t hate the stans lmao I’m saying that disrespecting other people who have passed to try and “get back at them” makes you just as bad as they are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhythmToTheGuns @SOPETOES @ybovieth @BTS_SHINeeGirl @everqlows criticism is ok but damn people like h3h3 deserve to be called out for xenophobia 😐🤚<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Proper_Logic @PrisonPlanet lmao if that logic was true then people who carry knives to defend themselves in London wouldn’t be de*d. if a gang member sees you have a weapon, you’re screwed. you’ve clearly never seen a gang in your life mate. sit this one out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gucciiizjm @pewdiepie he’s not TASTELESS yeesh  https://t.co/IeiWvFxfKw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proper_Logic @PrisonPlanet I can tell you that I’d probably be dead by now if guns were legal here. gangs are everywhere and knife crime is common. if they had guns instead then you can bet that we’d be as bad as America with shootings. 😶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proper_Logic @PrisonPlanet police haven’t confirmed anything about a suicide vest so that point is invalid. and again the police responded really quickly. maybe if the American police force could say the same...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nctjh7 I can imagine :/ I hope you can make your way home soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proper_Logic @PrisonPlanet attacker was neutralised quickly by police while nearby UNARMED civilians held them down. guns weren’t needed for someone to step in and stop the attacker. glad issues in the UK unrelated to you get under your skin though :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ratters1975 @David67631668 @ladbible but you just proved my point. it isn’t different. some nutter attacking people, gets shot by police. nothing new. wait and see before you and others use this as an excuse for islamophobia or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sblockedagain @EyesOnQ would’ve been a much worse incident if they had a gun and shot a ton of people. people will always find a way but no guns = less damage when they do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mfs27280146 @Fr33Sp33ch5 gun ban definitely working since a lot more people wouldn’t be alive right now if the criminal had a gun rather than a knife, mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proper_Logic @PrisonPlanet shots were fired by police &amp; you can bet that if the nutter had a gun instead of a knife, a whole lot more people would be dead by now. screw off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nctjh7 I don’t but my mum works around there &amp; my dad usually goes via London Bridge to get home from work too. my mum didn’t have work today thankfully but I should probably warn my dad. weird that tubes aren’t stopping because they said they would 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nctjh7 oof good luck!! last I heard the soonest trains will run through London Bridge again is about 5pm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ratters1975 @David67631668 @ladbible TV and media coverage doesn’t equal terrorist attack. it’s receiving attention because shots were fired by police &amp; it’s in a popular tourist spot. we don’t know anything yet so don’t jump to conclusions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nctjh7 I thought you can still get trains from the underground? If not is there any way you can walk away from the London Bridge area and get a bus somewhere else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWingless @David67631668 @ladbible deep in my heart I know the police have said nothing yet and random knife attacks are common in the city.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David67631668 @ladbible there is no evidence that this was a religious related attack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hanbins_dahlia that’s true, but that’s the contract limit. CL had her solo debut in 2013 but her contract expired this year so maybe iKON’s might not be as long? if iKON can’t leave anytime soon then hopefully YG will just go bankrupt or something lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hanbins_dahlia + their contracts potentially might expire next year if it’s a typical 5 year contract<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Google translate isn’t always reliable but it seems like there’s also free shipping available at least in Korea (excluding Jeju). PLEASE wait to order your lightstick to avoid getting scammed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so I’ve seen some stores selling the preorder for like £60 and I’m telling y’all now IT’S A SCAM. the price on this website is only about 40,000 won (about £26). wait until the lightstick is released to get a less crazy price or preorder from here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bangtanzie @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD I love myself and others in my fandom but I’m not afraid to call out people who step out of line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outrotearbyul @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD 2 people making fake accounts totally represents the entire fandom doesn’t it wow big brain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAESLIONESS @Shadow_knj because you joked about my favs and a member leaving the group 😭 just double checking so you know how dumb you sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outrotearbyul @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD because people checking if the method was allowed triggered a bunch of people accusing us of cheating and all sorts, both sides started this one. takes 2 to tango<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_knj @beautyfulJOON @MONOCHlLD oh trust me I am lmao that whole being secretive about the line method thing was wack. and some of their tweets coming up on my tl... blocklist expanding by the minute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justmin10243133 @Shadow_knj @TAESLIONESS JEO MUN-EUL YEOLMYUN MWODEUN DA DOEL GEOSCHEOLEOM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bangtanzie @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD I drag SOME people in my fandom for saying outta pocket things but I still love being an army and I’ll support BTS till the end 💕 pretty sure that makes me army<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAESLIONESS @Shadow_knj I’ve been stanning since 2016 and I went to their sold out Wembley concert. and hobi’s staying w me thanks 💖  https://t.co/IeiWvFxfKw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY @outrotearbyul @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD omg please stop replying to tweets that don’t involve you and find a hobby. this award ain’t based on charts and numbers anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outrotearbyul @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD yeah but dragging the fandom of ur competition? nah. outta pocket. you can encourage people to vote without dragging others. it’s unnecessary and the fact they’re a big acc makes it worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beautyfulJOON @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD no need to drag the fandom of ur competition though! it’s childish and makes army look bad especially since they’re a big voting account + being a stay and an army is hard enough already pls let me live 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY what clout? who? and me saying that SOME armys are doing dumb shit doesn’t mean that I don’t think BTS deserve the award damn 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_knj @TAESLIONESS oh I know that because I’m army too 👁👁 don’t be running your mouth about other groups though ma’am and just focus on that streaming and voting like BTS deserve xoxo  https://t.co/bShmj06A0d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY yep that’s exactly what I’m saying thanks 🥰 this isn’t some kinda “one sided beef” when both stays and armys are slipping up and saying outta pocket things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bangtanzie @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD ma’am please I’ve been an army since 2016 💀💀 don’t be so quick to call me some kinda fake army when I’ve streamed their songs and voted for them for years xoxoxo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outrotearbyul @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD y’all don’t need to bring up numbers to bring down others though. BTS’s success is their own. don’t compare &amp; contrast because that’s exactly what y’all don’t like anyway. talking about who outsold who when it comes to award competition is childish too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD “oUtSoLd” only makes any sense in a song sales concept aka the group themselves.... either way though talking about who outsold who is childish and there’s no reason to drag ur competition like that smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAESLIONESS @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD good luck when BTS go to military 😭😭 it’ll be fine they’ll just be gone for a bit don’t lose hope of a comeback 😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY that’s not what I said 😭 both stray kids and BTS really deserve that award but they deserve it equally. both their fandoms are working hard to vote for them and the groups themselves have worked hard too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bangtanzie @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD your fandom is also my fandom lmaooo I’m an army 😴😴😴 I don’t like seeing other armys drag people for no reason tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadybangtan_ @NutellaOt7 @BTS_twt ok see it how you wanna but at the end of the day I’m just tired of people fighting when both BTS and skz deserve that award 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FAKE ARMYDKDJDJDJD it’s an honour  https://t.co/vCuLZU0jiY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MISSION PASSED! respect +  https://t.co/4NlWUEDi8I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY the fact that armys also found this method out and had the opportunity to use it (and DID use it) meaning both sides in this used a dodgy method so it takes 2 to tango<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY strange how you’ve heard about “infinite votes” but I haven’t 🤨 and the award show itself haven’t said it’s cheating lmao they just removed that as an opportunity to get votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD “we oUtNumBeReD them” literally indirecting my favs who are their main competition in this award omg please learn some reading comprehension skills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bangtanzie @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD should’ve sat there and scrolled past my tweet without bringing up ur tired ass argument.  https://t.co/5CWw2E8oLg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Shadow_knj @MONOCHlLD calling me an anti when I’ve been stanning my boys since 2016 😭 I’m just trying to show that this isn’t “one sided beef” and armys aren’t perfect lil angels but go off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MONOCHlLD please learn to read before quote rting me. “oUtNumBeReD” “oUtSoLd” trying to belittle skz’s success and acting as if that makes BTS deserve the award more when<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY naw I’m upset about them talking about “oUtSoLd” “oUtNumBeReD” like a three year old child as if that makes BTS deserve the award more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadybangtan_ @NutellaOt7 @BTS_twt AHEM “outnumbered” and “outsold” is definitely an insult lmaooo it’s like “wE’rE sO mUcH bEtTeR tHaN tHeM!1!!1!1” it’s so childish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha just because they were told to vote the right way doesn’t mean they did! under a lot of voting account tweets there’s armys encouraging people to do that method anyways lol it became a level playing field<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha ma’am i don’t like interacting w problematic people so I’ll just block them. and army “clapping back” isn’t necessary anyways, a couple people ain’t worth army’s energy. army has power that they can’t be wasting on sad bird app bitches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY here’s some examples out of MANY tweets accusing stays of cheating  https://t.co/djetcQVusJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha armys also found out that method pretty quick and also used &amp; spread it though so that’s not an excuse, again both fandoms are in the wrong and you can’t even use that voting method anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha it isn’t one sided beef when I showed you all those receipts of armys doing the same back. stays and armys both messed up on this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VANTAENRY except all the tweets with a decent amount of interactions which I also provided. and ok 1 dm but please take note of all those other tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nausadea @btsarmyshan thanks lmao 🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadybangtan_ @NutellaOt7 @BTS_twt I don’t have a screenshot of that and I’ve looked and I haven’t seen one. can’t provide evidence for that 1 because they deleted it a few hours after tweeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smilingjeonginn imma wait patiently for a response.  https://t.co/GGgDf1GLqi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nausadea @btsarmyshan trust me my block list is extremely long 🤩 also I am focusing on my favs lmao I’m an army and a stay, I literally can’t focus on my favs any more than this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MONOCHlLD I don’t have a screenshot and I’ve looked but neither does anyone else. @btsvotingteam tweeted about BTS being better than skz or something along those lines but they deleted it. happened a day ago now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha one sided beef where? y’all realised the voting was happening and attacked us for just trying to win an award sheesh  https://t.co/1A7CjmDiAj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_7ndA_ @orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha some people say dumb shit on this bird app but that’s the case for every fandom maam I don’t accept that person’s actions believe me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>continued again x and this isn’t all of it either  https://t.co/iMbwoWx1jQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>continued...  https://t.co/ZhKZKItpcw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jooniesherz yeah I get that armys didn’t know but some people were coming for skz’s and stay’s throats when we just?? breathed?? accusing us of cheating etc etc and for what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oumaya_Chan @orphicvis @channieracha an unnecessary and rude clapback!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jooniesherz she was talking about how armys said they would boycott this award but as soon as skz started winning y’all started voting and getting mad that skz are in the lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSaliha998 @BTS_twt and in case you didn’t know, here’s a tweet from armys doing the same thing  https://t.co/apibGxq1j1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orphicvis @Oumaya_Chan @channieracha second one isn’t though! 🤩 neither is all the other tweets which I can show to you if you need to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nausadea @btsarmyshan second screenshot isn’t. there are also many other examples that aren’t fake at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetiepiestae @bangwoolsus @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt nobody said it was cheating, the method was simply disabled &amp; army also started using it too but ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NutellaOt7 @BTS_twt I can also provide more receipts of armys accusing stays of cheating if you’d like 🤩 not to mention a BTS voting account deleted a tweet where they were insulting stray kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsarmyshan armys have said things too, don’t act like stays are the only nasty ones  https://t.co/RDGN7dI0iB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NutellaOt7 @BTS_twt they only replied like that because an army said this but ok  https://t.co/qBmZaGovzh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oumaya_Chan @channieracha not when there’s others doing a similar thing  https://t.co/ZR6BK0olqE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polytaekey it’s definitely not every parcel that gets charged lol, they would never be able to check every single one so it depends on which ones the workers pick up and decide to charge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polytaekey damn that’s creepy lmao. the only reason they randomly drop charges on people is as a money making scheme :/ makes me scared to order stuff<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParkSoo00333189 @dreamBTSwork @btsvotingteam thank you for understanding!! I can’t decide who I want to win the award more, it would be great to see BTS win at the AAAs again but stray kids also worked so hard 💟 I’m glad BTS are doing well in mamas though so I’m sure they’ll be collecting awards there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_xWhalien52x_x @jiminie_lee @btsvotingteam hablo español también cariño 💜💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TEngineer0 @taerainynight @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt perhaps. but army have had setbacks in voting before and still got to first place. I don’t think enough armys know about the voting yet since they’re also busy with streaming parties and voting in the mama awards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@numbcheuks @saidbangtan @BTSVotingFam @BTS_twt potentially, yeah. award shows these days are all set up in some way to make money and then ignore the votes anyways. but BTS did win legitimately through votes last year so this award doesn’t seem as bad as the others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TEngineer0 @taerainynight @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt you’ll hear about it once they’ve responded to the emails people have sent them or when that method isn’t useable anymore. in the meantime it’s a free for all and ANYONE can use it meaning everyone has equal opportunity to get more votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@numbcheuks @saidbangtan @BTSVotingFam @BTS_twt where did I say that lmfaooo I want them both to win, I wanna see BTS win another award as they should but stray kids have also worked hard this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TEngineer0 @taerainynight @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I know I’m not the judge about that but again, the people running the competition haven’t said anything. and since armys found out about the first loophole I’m sure if any others are found they’ll hear about that too. it’s still a level playing field<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotatoStarrrr @Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt yep, both groups really deserve the award and it would be cool to see BTS win it again. 💜Woojin left for personal reasons according to JYPE, nobody really knows the details but it looks like he updated on kakaotalk to say he’s ok (we don’t know if it’s really him tho lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TEngineer0 @taerainynight @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt the voting is fair. both fandoms know that method of voting and both can use it. AAA haven’t said it’s not allowed yet. everyone has an equal chance to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTS_TXTalways @mtstarnews wym dirty tactics? AAA awards haven’t said that that method isn’t allowed. and now both armys and stays know that method so both can use it to get more votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirah183 @Jinruel1 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt that’s only one fan. one fan doesn’t represent everyone, most people have been voting using points from ads and creating accounts. also, AAA awards haven’t said any method of voting isn’t allowed yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patricia_BTS_PT @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt you shouldn’t allow fans of musicians to affect how you see the musician! you can like a group without liking their fans. I can understand that you only stan BTS but other groups and their fans work hard just like armys work hard for BTS. 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt yeah, good luck!! stays have been doing mass voting for several hours so that’s probably why the votes increased? the same thing happened in round 1 of voting where stays mass votes and got them to win. kinda the same way armys streamed BTS songs and made them chart lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@numbcheuks @saidbangtan @BTSVotingFam @BTS_twt ??? biased how ? I stan both groups so I don’t mind who wins the award at all. how is that being biased ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotatoStarrrr @Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt also stays are doing a similar thing to armys, armys streamed BTS songs in response to the PCAs being rigged and got them to chart. stays are voting for stray kids because a member left the group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotatoStarrrr @Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt tweets about this definitely aren’t in the same amount as tweets for other awards though. I haven’t seen any at all on my tl and I follow a ton of armys. I’ve only seen tweets from stays about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patricia_BTS_PT @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I’ll talk about them if people are indirecting their fans accusing them of cheating. y’all mentioned us first. liking more than one group isn’t a crime luv 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blizzard0fHell @HOBIforehead18 it’s questionable but the people running the awards haven’t said anything yet. also both fandoms know the method so both have the ability to use it, but both are also avoiding it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jhoseok1997 @cuddlino that’s because yall are focusing on mama but not on the AAAs. I’ve barely seen armys talk about the AAAs but BTS are doing great in mamas. stays are putting all their energy into AAAs so they’re in the lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@numbcheuks @saidbangtan @BTSVotingFam @BTS_twt because they weren’t mentioning the group’s name so I didn’t either + I don’t wanna mess up their searches on twitter lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotatoStarrrr @Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt stray kids also have a very big fandom. I’ve barely seen armys tweeting about this award, theyre still focused on mama awards. stays have been 100% focused on this award so there’s more stays than armys voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patricia_BTS_PT @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt a lot of stray kids fans are also armys. I’m an army and a stay so I support both groups for this award. that’s why I’m on this account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotatoStarrrr @Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt just because BTS aren’t winning doesn’t mean the votes for stray kids aren’t legit. 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbngtn @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt me too. armys have been busy with other awards so not many know about this. and stays have been working really hard to get this award for stray kids so they’re outnumbering armys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikonavy gonna become like Susan and spread a couple rumours just to get them out of there for free  https://t.co/ARDDlgc107<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikonavy cold milk gang, imagine using ur precious time on this earth to heat your milk before pouring it onto your cereal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starryforhhj @sweetiepiestae @chemsik_ @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt same my notifs have been blowing up for a couple hours because I’ve been replying to them lol. some of them are cool but a lot are really making this a bigger deal than it needs to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbangtanpop @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt because a lot of us are armys. including myself. I don’t mind who wins this award because I love them both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loveforeverbtss @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt they are winning fair and square. the people running the award haven’t said anything in response to methods of collecting points &amp; stays have been working really hard to get this award. not many armys know about the voting yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikrokosmosara @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt it’s just stays mass voting. lots of stays have been working hard to get this award for stray kids. also not many armys know about the voting yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iarmylovesBTS @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt the same way armys do it. planning, organisation and mass voting. stays doing what armys have always done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTS_TXTalways @gcfchimmy @btsvotingteam AAA haven’t said it’s cheating yet. it’s not hacking or anything, stop making it seem like the worst crime ever lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starryforhhj @BTS_TXTalways @AipatEnelym @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I mean the process of deleting and remaking the account may be a bug or smth idk but we’re not exactly hacking and AAA haven’t said anything yet lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starryforhhj @sweetiepiestae @chemsik_ @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt literally what point are they trying to make I really don’t understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTS_TXTalways @starryforhhj @AipatEnelym @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt doesn’t mean that all the votes were gained that way, AAA haven’t said this method isn’t allowed yet, and both stays and armys know this method meaning both are able to use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeon_bunn I’m trying to reconcile and explain things to people and it’s going somewhat well but in terms of voting I’m letting fate decide :&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>jjong looking ethereal as usual 💕  https://t.co/BuVtXJEnNM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeon_bunn I felt this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ceren48316230 @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt good point but again armys have been trending hashtags and voting for other awards at the same time too (armys are multitasking gods istg). which is why I don’t think that many armys know about this award and I’ve seen many who can’t figure out how to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ceren48316230 @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt it sounds like a lot but I was looking at round 1 of voting too that had no real opportunities to cheat votes and stray kids votes were increasing that quickly then too. see it however you want to but I’m a fan of both groups so I’ll be happy whoever wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ceren48316230 @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt mass voting doesn’t mean constant gains in votes. people start slacking and others catch up. this has happened to armys in several other awards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilyoongimeow_ @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt believe that if you want but please respect the result of the vote no matter who wins the award.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ceren48316230 @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt stays began their mass voting before armys did and had been planning for it for weeks. also BTS have been nominated for more awards so armys have been trying to focus on several awards while stays have only needed to focus on this one. stays are also a big fandom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlemaokitten @jjgokk @seungbunny3 @btlovelyy @jibootae4 stays are a very big fandom. also in round 1 of voting (which didn’t involve downloading an app or collecting votes), stray kids won with 1M+ votes thanks to the same mass voting method that stays are using now. I think it’s legit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HOSEOKBlSEXUAL also stays started their mass voting before armys and planned for it since round 1 of voting (which they won with a similar mass voting technique). as a member of both fandoms I don’t see a problem with either fandom’s voting techniques<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HOSEOKBlSEXUAL the app’s server is struggling because of the amount of votes so it takes time to catch up. that amount was gained over a longer period of time. also armys have been focusing on other projects while stays have solely been focusing on this award and stays are also a big fandom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smilingjeonginn @alnnwsh @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I’m a stay as well as an army and I’m tired of people attacking each other over an award lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taetaeken_ @seungminhot @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt hidden agenda?? I literally hadn’t heard of that method at all until the voting account mentioned it and I have lots of stay mutuals. this is not a large scale method and now both fandoms know about it so both have the opportunity to cheat if they wish. it’s fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btlovelyy @jibootae4 @jjgokk @BTS_twt yeah but would they really be bothered to spend hours voting against BTS? is there any evidence that other fandoms are voting for stray kids? no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlemaokitten @btlovelyy @jibootae4 @jjgokk @BTS_twt the app’s servers are lagging because of the sheer amount of voters. those votes weren’t gained in 3 minutes, the server just takes time to catch up and refresh vote numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ceren48316230 @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt that’s because stays started their mass voting. they did a similar technique in the first round of voting, which was done online without logging into accounts and stuff, and they won that round with 1M+ votes. just because BTS aren’t winning doesn’t mean anyone is cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjgokk @seungbunny3 @littlemaokitten @btlovelyy @jibootae4 the app is lagging since so many people are voting. it will refresh votes whenever you refresh the app or whenever the app’s server catches up. those votes weren’t earned in just 1 minute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlemaokitten @btlovelyy @jibootae4 @jjgokk @BTS_twt of course not. but both fandoms know about this method now and I hadn’t even heard of it until recently. both fandoms are avoiding this method from what I’ve seen. whoever wins deserves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jiminie_lee @btsvotingteam I can understand why you’re questioning it since a lot of awards are rigged these days *cough* PCAs *cough* but so far this award seems legit and everyone’s voting hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BangtanRemedy @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I understand. a few people have been accusing stays of cheating but I know that’s not all armys. I’m an army and a stay and so far I think this competition is fair and whoever wins deserves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jiminie_lee @btsvotingteam personally I hadn’t even heard of the line method until now. I doubt stays have been using it. plus, stays won the first round of voting too when the line method wasn’t necessary / didn’t exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kik0_02 @TXT_bighit I mean the blackpink win was genuinely rigged since apparently the PCAs retain the right to choose themselves who wins in their terms and conditions and BTS were leading in all award categories. otherwise I agree lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btlovelyy @jibootae4 @jjgokk @BTS_twt no they’re not. lots of other fandoms don’t even like stray kids in the first place and anyway, you have to download an app to vote and not even petty people could be bothered to do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taetaeken_ @seungminhot @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt what I mean is that both fandoms know about this method now. both have the ability to cheat if they want to but from what I’ve seen, both are avoiding this method. the votes are legit and fair. stays have been mass voting for 5 hours too which is why they have so many votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I understand where you’re coming from! I don’t think many armys know about this award, it’s award season so I think they’ve been focused on winning other things for BTS while the other fandom have been completely focused on this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Felixjump_ I’m a stay as well as an army so I don’t want people attacking each other over this award lmao, good luck &amp; keep voting!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jiminie_lee @btsvotingteam both fandoms know about this method and both are avoiding it. I hadn’t even heard of this method before it was brought up here. the majority, of not all of the votes are fair so whoever wins deserves it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johanna28264128 @btsvotingteam nobody cheated on the PCAs, that award was rigged. this award is not rigged and both fandoms are avoiding the line method so it’s a fair fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jin_RM0810 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt their votes are jumping because they’ve been mass voting for about 5 hours. the group lost a member recently so their fans have been working extra hard to win them an award. whoever wins has won fairly 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justbangtan_ @Linalin0602 @jacqTCE @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt both armys and the other fandom have heard of the line method now, both are avoiding it as well. good luck to armys 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BangtanRemedy @Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt I don’t think the line method has been used a lot but both fandoms have heard of it now. I’m certain both are avoiding it because its unfair and the unfair votes might be removed later anyway. good luck to army, keep fighting 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dreamBTSwork @ParkSoo00333189 @btsvotingteam thank you for being respectful! I’m a stay and an army so I voted in the first round but I’m sitting this one out because I can’t decide who to vote for lmao. I’m glad stays are coming together after their misfortune but I also wanna see BTS win again hehe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YooWoohoo @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt charity award where? the voting system is fair, the other fandom are working really hard too. just because BTS aren’t winning doesn’t mean it’s not a fair voting system and it doesn’t make the award a “charity award”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alnnwsh @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt the other fandom aren’t cheating, whoever wins this award has won it fairly. they’re gaining votes quickly because the group lost a member so their fans really want them to win. keep voting and good luck 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taetaeken_ @seungminhot @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt you can make multiple new accounts without the line method. both armys and stays are doing that to get more votes fairly. whoever wins the award has won fair and square<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justbangtan_ @Linalin0602 @jacqTCE @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt nothing’s fishy. the other group lost a member recently so their fans really want this award, and their fandom is big too. they also won the first round of voting with a lot of hard work, this voting is round two. it’s not rigged, whoever wins the award wins it fairly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khouloudkhelil1 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt their fandom is very big too and the group lost a member recently so they’ve been working extra hard at voting! they’ve planned for this award for a little while too and won the first round of voting. this is the second round<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGirl19895311 @072018May @TEngineer0 @RebecaBarAba @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt everyone is having app issues because their are so many people voting for both groups! don’t be disheartened. the fans of the other group have been mass voting for almost 5 hours and they won the first round of voting for this award too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TEngineer0 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt it’s not! the other group also won the first round of voting, this is the second round. the group lost a member recently so their fans have been working extra hard to vote. so far the competition isn’t rigged at all, whoever wins the award has won it fairly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tapo66462298 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt the other fandom are also working hard since their group lost a member recently! theyve been mass voting for almost 5 hours. whoever wins the award definitely deserves it, I’ll be cheering for both groups 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nee_nee1112 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt fair enough 💜 I think the app can’t handle the power of both armys and stays lol 😂 I’m cheering for both groups, good luck 💜💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alnnwsh @BTSVotingFam @BTS_twt there’s no evidence that everyone voting is using that method. also this is the second round of voting and stray kids won the first round too since their fans have really been working hard. they’ve also been doing mass voting for almost 5 hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YooNoelle @SagarikaDebbar3 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt multis aren’t voting for stray kids unless they stan them. stray kids lost a member very recently so stays really want this award. they’ve been mass voting for almost 5 hours. whoever wins really deserves it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bts_our_apanman @SagarikaDebbar3 @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt stray kids fans are voting really hard since stray kids lost a member recently! they’ve been mass voting for almost 5 hours. whoever wins the award really deserves it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amiira7_ @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt stray kids fans have been mass voting for more than 4 hours so their votes are going up quickly! honestly ARMYs and stays are working really hard so whoever wins deserves it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParkSoo00333189 @dreamBTSwork @btsvotingteam they’re not buying votes. Stray kids lost a member a few weeks ago so their fans have been voting a lot for them. whoever wins the award deserves it, no matter who wins they won fair and square<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@i7K0N I think people are mainly mad because BTS were leading in all categories but the people running the award show chose blackpink to win. the whole thing was rigged since blackpink are linked to the company behind the award<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DAWNLINO_ b.i left (was kicked out....) several months ago, he was trending again this month because of his birthday &amp; the rest of ikon sending him birthday wishes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hyyhkoya @Shakira_Mingi also she claimed to be a former YG trainee although YG said they don’t even have her on record. she probably failed an audition or something and now she’s spreading rumours for fame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hyyhkoya @Shakira_Mingi a drug dealer. she exposed h*nbin for supposedly taking drugs (although even if he did it was seemingly only weed). now she’s going after MX members too because she’s desperate for fame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodDalietxx ikonics are happy with October since ikon showed support for Hanbin’s birthday lol, but just throw the whole 2019 away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THROW HER IN JAIL ALREADY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe the same drug dealer that exposed H*nbin has now done the exact same thing to W*nho. put her in jail before she causes more damage #원호탈퇴반대<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 bruh I- the only reason I don’t like it when people say “BTS aren’t kpop” is because many of them act like all other korean music is bad except BTS 💀 I call all my favs pop artists rather than defining them by their nationality but for the locals, BTS is kpop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yunvogue @dkyounly what kinda dicks have you seen because that’s.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biggestchumby those fucking levels literally took hours to complete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princwss @busanbreeze I’m not saying they’re not important, I’m saying people are really defining themselves &amp; others by what music they stan and making it like some kind of cult following which will only make more people hesitant to actually listen to BTS’s music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 their main genre is pop nowadays and they also have elements of other genres. overall, they are pop artists while their older stuff was a hiphop style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 yeah, not all music that is called “kpop” is actually pop music and it is kind of used as a label, but again, since BTS are closer to a pop genre now, they are still kpop. whether that label should be changed or not is something else entirely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princwss @busanbreeze they’re still suggesting that to like other groups you have to be “brainwashed” first 🤡 even if they meant only in some cases they’re still taking this WAY too seriously, it’s music it was never that deep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 no, what BTS said was they don’t want to be the “faces of kpop” because they don’t represent the entire industry (which needed to be said tbh). BTS are still kpop artists by definition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maira100491 I knew someone was going to make this omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 kpop: korean pop music LMAO that’s literally what BTS is??? did you read your tweet before sending it 😐 BTS themselves have said they’re kpop please listen to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princwss @busanbreeze except she’s suggesting that people ONLY become multis because they doubt BTS which isn’t true. she’s also saying that if you’re a multi you prioritise other groups and like BTS less 🤡🤡🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsot7ami @busanbreeze y’all act as if stanning BTS is a cult or a religion damn they’re just a group 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purpleminimoni @BTSAteezNCTStay @Divine13430 pretty sure it’s korean pop music which makes it kpop but whatever makes you sleep at night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiadvocate1 @busanbreeze that literally makes you a multi lmao, stanning more than one musician, kpop or otherwise, makes you a multi but ok<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jesidaw @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt hopefully there won’t be any big fandom clashes. also I think MOAs are a pretty big fandom since a lot of ARMYs support them too! last time I checked they were leading in the categories they’re nominated for 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flower_Kpop @samadrita_basu @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt @TXT_members @TXT_bighit yes they do wym! I would say the majority of ARMYs support TXT so they have a strong fan base as a result, and Ateez are really big now! itzy and X1 are newer groups so honestly I would say they’re the ones with slightly smaller fanbases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesidaw @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt ok, but people announcing a “collab” like that is always meaningless anyway and doesn’t go to plan. at this rate TXT and Ateez are most likely to win the award anyway so I feel like it’s useless to start a fanwar over something that won’t work out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flower_Kpop @samadrita_basu @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt @TXT_members @TXT_bighit either way TXT or Ateez are most likely to win at the moment so it’s not something to get bothered about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flower_Kpop @samadrita_basu @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt @TXT_members @TXT_bighit one person tweeting “LeTs cOLLaB” doesn’t mean it’ll actually happen 🤣 those kinds of things always flop and they’re meaningless, no use starting an argument over nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samadrita_basu @jkvvjk_ @BTS_twt @TXT_members @TXT_bighit they’re not any fandoms, I have no clue what OP is referencing since it’s pretty much every fandom to their own in award shows #BTS #MAMA2019 #MAMAVOTE @BTS_twt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCollection4 @Notjustbtstras1 @worstpeoplew I understand that, but the cases he is involved in are numerous and have a lot of connections with other people. the way the police are taking a while to sort this one out &amp; keep connecting him to other crimes also makes him seem suspicious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @givemesomefoodu @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA can’t ignore it when people are saying such extreme and misinformed things about mental health, she’s talking about things I’m directly affected by in such a horrible way... “maybe if I was more depressed”.

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @givemesomefoodu @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA I’m not even using an article, I’m using what she said herself on her social media. doesn’t get more straight from the source than that. she’s trash, accept it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fIuffyrose never thought I’d say this but stan twt has taste   https://t.co/qETq1xhpWT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @givemesomefoodu @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA potential collaborators don’t know her luv. she’s irrelevant which is why she’s clutching at straws for fame. and Im not harassing her lmao, just criticising her for what she’s said and done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leonkimia @EXLYTH_ ok fair enough but don’t go around stanning him, just support him in silence until we know for sure he’s innocent or guilty 😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @givemesomefoodu @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA people are accusing her because she keeps saying messed up shit and acting entitled. what she said about mental health was offensive, she’s acting like she’s somehow amazing and special by doing a bit of work on a BTS song, etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leonkimia @EXLYTH_ a sheep who is actually up to date on the case and knows that there’s no guarantee he’s innocent 😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @givemesomefoodu @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA except she admitted that she didn’t write many lyrics of the song. Halsey wrote the chorus. not to mention that people only click on the song for Halsey and BTS, not for her. she’s a white person trying to take credit for the achievements of minorities 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @givemesomefoodu @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA not as much as BTS and Halsey 🤡🤡🤡 people clicked on the song because of them and she’s acting like she had a huge amount of participation in the song smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellitusmyg the sound quality is really good &amp; much better than other products. plus since apple removed the headphone jack you need wireless headphones or something anyway   https://t.co/8AxhOt3E4l<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saquiba862 @PopCrave EXACTLY I’m worried she’s gonna become some sort of mental health poster girl and used as “evidence” of the “cruelty of the industry” when every music industry is just the same smh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Debrezzy_ @Rover829 this dance &amp; skin is literally based on a kpop group &amp; their song dumbass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToXc_Sanchez @OriginalFunko @FortniteGame that skin &amp; the emote that goes with it is based on a kpop group. fortnite would have to make another deal with the group’s company to make this happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Honeyhope___ if you want a blocklist then I have one with all those people on it 💕 feel free to take a break if you need to, your mental health comes first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Superman_Blink tell me their account names if you see any more, I’m making a blocklist with all of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eveIynisgone become just as bad as them because you’re repeating their behaviour*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @givemesomefoodu @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA also what she said about depression is HUGELY disrespectful. she’s playing victim and almost acting as if she struggles with mental health issues when she doesn’t. “I’m not depressed but if I was I MIGHT have died!!” it’s a disgusting thing to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RisingJimin @givemesomefoodu @monosmoonchild @NeraArfaz03 @JoonsTinyMoon @Kpoppercutie @pastelalpha @MELANIEFONTANA that entire long paragraph is full of “me” “I” “I’m”. it’s not about Sulli. she’s making it about herself and playing victim in a situation which has nothing to do with her. she only cares about bullying when she can talk about herself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reddit_Sucks @cphrtae all of y’all that bopped to despacito wanna be Spanish sooo bad   https://t.co/lD5yqx1cUq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peppablink the most important and legendary tweet ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MELANIEFONTANA maybe if you didn’t make someone else’s passing about yourself. maybe if you didn’t make someone else’s song sound like your own just because you wrote a few words...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>too bad your poorly written articles contributed to stirring up hate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bts5Tae drop the @ she’s going on my blocklist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>quick tw: some of these accounts are really bad. please just block and don’t look at their tweets if they might upset you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsvolume working on a blocklist rn when I saw this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polardrew there were definitely trolls making fun of other people. but doing it back as some form of revenge makes you just as bad. be better than the trolls rather than copying their behaviour &amp; being disrespectful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw// still getting a blocklist of some of the worst people making fun of the recent news. some racist tweets too. It’ll take me a while to finish this one, it’s a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cksdn_0 @duhitzmark I’m surprised too, I’m glad he’s very respectful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeynepciki2003 this is mostly true but I would disagree that kpop idols are worked more than western artists. many western artists work a lot and produce a lot of music. unfortunately it’s the music industry all around the world that needs to change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>apologising after the damage has been done is no good. this goes for everyone. don’t say things about people you don’t even know who haven’t done anything wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ok which one of y’all got me suspended for 12 hours. about to make a fresh blocklist because of recent events<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gonetoosoup @OH_mes2 it’s literally a leaf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vil4no @KelKonic @OH_mes2 Dispatch is a news website which profits from people clicking on their articles. the best way to get clicks = make things up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chan_kuris @queeniemalx @OH_mes2 I think you’ll find that it’s illegal for information on an ongoing investigation to be released. the police themselves said YESTERDAY that they won’t release any info. dispatch can’t be trusted &amp; if a police officer actually said anything then they’re breaking the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadelineMaureen @TSiK0N @OH_mes2 how do you know he committed a crime? are you somehow a professional police officer with access to a ton of evidence? and it’s not running away to another country if he’s literally just doing his job since the police didn’t investigate him back then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy what evidence lmfao? please tell the police asap if you have evidence, obviously you can do a much better job than them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy his own testimony literally says he THOUGHT about purchasing but didn’t go through with it. please learn to read x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>luv he’s literally just sitting down 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wbk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @DeeD89172651 @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy except a reporter supposedly spoke to one of the ikon members who said that he was forced to leave. nobody can confirm the truth of this but it’s a possibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessdan @shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy he didn’t lol. read his statement again. he said he was going to but he decided against it because he was scared. he stated he was in a dark place when he considered buying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy a response like “lol sure” makes it obvious that you’re insecure now that you’ve found out you’re wrong. yes we can wait for the police to finish the investigation but you were jumping to the conclusion that he’s guilty before 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy he hasn’t lmaooo, y’all seungri stans were complaining about fake articles and people being misinformed but you’re here doing the same for Hanbin. The police can’t make any statements on an ongoing investigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @joshysmum @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy that’s a nice double standard you have there lmao. Hanbin’s case has taken more than 3 months so far when cases like his usually take a couple of weeks. apply the same logic 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CypherTH0T @EyJoontro @Koreaboo we’re also talking about YG management lmfao my point is still valid. also considering how this CEO has been allowing some crazy schedules for other artists then blackpink is next. don’t say I didn’t warn you when ur favs start being forced to work constantly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dizzydizzydeja plus the fact that weighing people like that is pretty meaningless since some people have heavier bones than others which impacts their weight on a scale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the amount of YG stans and ot5 bb stans I’ve seen around lately 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noeul_82 @choitopismyway @OH_mes2 nobody knows that yet. the police have not issued a statement on his current position in the investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getreadyhoetime hey! mental health comes first! if you truly think you can keep fighting then you got this but it’s ok to sit it out sometimes! take care of yourself, Hanbin would want that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheapconfession I doubt that it is. according to some people he was interviewed as more of a witness than a suspect since the drug dealer is also under investigation. if there’s no evidence that he didn’t buy/use anything then they can’t do anything to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hanbin anti blocklist! 🥰  https://t.co/lF0CenY8kL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheapconfession he asked for it. doesn’t mean that he actually even ended up buying anything. it’s only a crime if there’s evidence to back the claim that he bought or used drugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bro twitter just gave me a pop up saying “you’re getting a lot of notifications” omg fame is so challenging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eliziticamd there is a chance that he bought drugs but please don’t say anything about how he “was going to buy more” and “evaded justice”. there is nothing to back that up &amp; the police already looked into this back in 2016 anyway. otherwise I agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this article is more accurate than the previous one at least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheapconfession he didn’t admit anything though. the police can’t reveal information like that on an ongoing investigation. these are all rumours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its__got7 @Koreaboo ty 💕💕  https://t.co/5s9wJ0yRbK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gnani_gi do your best to educate him and if he doesn’t listen... you know what to do 🥰 lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aa26005097 @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 very true lol. also with Seungri he keeps getting accused of more and more things. Hanbin’s case has gone on for ages because the police can’t even find evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aa26005097 @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 the fact that he’s in the police station does not make him guilty. if that was the case then Seungri would be in jail already. the police have interviewed Hanbin and we can now wait for a verdict on his case. the drug dealer and YG will also be interviewed. that’s it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jadoudou4 @Koreaboo is* a witness (according to some info) I’m so tired lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>congrats Indonesia 🇮🇩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aa26005097 @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 they shouldn’t be translating fake news. the police haven’t said anything yet so the article is nonsense. he only left the police station a few hours ago and the police still haven’t interviewed YG yet. and police can’t reveal information on an ongoing case<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@5unshine01 @channiescloud @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 don’t compare this situation to other people if you don’t want those other people to be dragged. any situation in which false information is spread is a bad situation because it causes defamation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jadoudou4 @Koreaboo because this news article is fake. the police haven’t said anything yet, it’s likely that Hanbin isn’t a witness and nobody knows if he admitted to anything. we’re defending him because there’s no evidence and it’s only weed anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vil4no @Koreaboo the police haven’t said anything yet. we don’t know if he’s admitted to anything, the police have no evidence and it’s likely he isn’t a suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wyakpop @Koreaboo the police have released no official statements yet. in fact, some are saying that he was interviewed as a witness, not a suspect. he hasn’t admitted to anything as far as we know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way predictive text typed “YG go bankrupt agenda” for me 🤣 says a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yo maybe I should change my bio back to the YG go bankrupt agenda one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mygfjisoo because the police have no evidence that he did anything, he claims he didn’t and when he was questioned by police today it sounds like he was there as more of a witness than a suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>following everyone defending Hanbin rn lmao my ratio is gonna be terrible but o well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yutodasenpai @channiescloud @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 naver articles aren’t official and the police haven’t actually said anything yet as far as I know. they are due to question YG soon so they’re not done with interviews. it’s also past midnight in Korea and he only came out of the police station recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glouissy @SuriwanL @OH_mes2 OP originally tweeted this with a new pic of Hanbin at the police station. it’s not good to spread those pics right now because it encourages trolls and hate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choitopismyway @OH_mes2 nobody knows what charges he has yet but usually there are lots of complicated charges linked to 1 crime. however, it sounds like he wasn’t interviewed as a suspect but more as a witness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mimyuun @Monina489 @mycupofyou @standonghyuk @OH_mes2 obviously, who isn’t? Hanbin sexy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babybmingi @OH_mes2 spreading pictures of Hanbin when he’s been in a tough time lately is bad and causes hate and trolling. it’s better if those pictures aren’t spread around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channiescloud @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 fair enough. still weird that the acc would post such a vague article that he APPARENTLY admitted to some charges but they don’t even know what they are yet. I think it’s unnecessary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linkin_verb @channiescloud @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 no, when more reliable sources come in and the tension has calmed down. he’s only just come out of questioning with the police. ikonic translators will be able to find reliable articles and translate those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purplecherie @Monina489 @mycupofyou @standonghyuk @OH_mes2 we know they have a khb stan acc lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channiescloud @ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 yes but I wished they didn’t. I’m glad they deleted the pic of Hanbin but I still don’t think it’s good to spread misinformation. please don’t take naver articles as facts until things can be confirmed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ltyttm @exokonrise @OH_mes2 translating now is not a good idea since lots of rumours are being spread. most ikonic translators aren’t translating at the moment because there’s no way of telling what’s official and what isn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CmdeSxxedcer @mycupofyou @standonghyuk @OH_mes2 did you forget about your twitter name for a sec? “spread the love”? how about you actually try that for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mycupofyou @standonghyuk @OH_mes2 people don’t want to see pictures of Hanbin in his current state spread around, it could cause trolling &amp; it’s generally not very nice to see him upset &amp; struggling :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AprilHunter things like rolling down windows in cars and developing photos... those things still exist and still happen. it’s not as if the newest technology has completely taken over and everything from 30 or so years ago is gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilHunter very true, but my original point was that so many boomers &amp; Gen X-ers think that most of the stuff they used to do isn’t done by newer generations, which isn’t true. most of the stuff on the hashtag I do regularly and I know many others who do too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quailtenki probably start glitching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilHunter pretty sure y’all didn’t invent half the stuff that millennials did but go off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hwngcuIt she’s not exactly romanticising it. she doesn’t glorify it in any way, she talks down on it. she often talks about societal issues in her music &amp; has said how she likes storytelling (back when she was on The Voice).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heoneypot @youthjinsoul  https://t.co/bpQ22AbimW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaavimansilla99 @CintyaAyuM1 @allkpopTHESHOP @pinkachewnel @allkpop lots of companies mistreat their artists but none as bad as YG. not to mention how Jennie seemed to be struggling a few months ago and YG did nothing at all. and how blackpink don’t have enough security at airports even though they get mobbed. blackpink deserve a better company<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaavimansilla99 @CintyaAyuM1 @allkpopTHESHOP @pinkachewnel @allkpop there’s plenty of bashing towards other companies lmao. but YG is far worse. using iKON as an example: gave them old, broken boots for a live performance, little funding for concerts and some mvs, made them sleep on the floor, overworked them, made B.I perform with a bad eye...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leliixfee @lvtinycaratstay imagine being that jobless yikes. they’re clearly just projecting their own insecurities because you’re really pretty 💕 I stan u now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady okay. but, yet again, please don’t say there’s anything to prove his innocence. even though the police suck at doing their job, it’s up to them &amp; the prosecution to decide his guilt or innocence. hopefully they’ll decide that soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady you can quietly support him and hope for his innocence but again, don’t jump to conclusions. I had a similar issue with an artist who was accused of something bad a few years ago. I stopped openly supporting them until I could be certain they weren’t guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady clearly I’m managing to keep up pretty well despite not even stanning bigbang. in every case, there’s going to be contradicting evidence but there needs to be enough evidence to prove him innocent or guilty, which the police are struggling to do because the police are trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady and I’m not condemning him. I’m saying that you can’t assume he’s innocent when he’s only innocent until proven guilty. people can’t walk around saying “he’s innocent and there’s evidence that he is!!” when that’s not the case at all. y’all are spreading just as much misinfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady I did know about the burning sun case. I also know that the fact that the he’s continually being accused of more and more things also increases the chance that he’s guilty with one of those crimes. not to mention he (apparently) admitted to some allegations in his interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ANhe0neLrc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJohnXD @doomdadady yes but y’all seem to be jumping to the conclusion that he’s totally innocent. there’s no evidence to prove that either. you shouldn’t give someone undying support when there’s still a chance they’re guilty of *several* crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaavimansilla99 @CintyaAyuM1 @allkpopTHESHOP @pinkachewnel @allkpop hate to YG won’t really affect blackpink. also, YG holds back its artists. blackpink members would probably have solos much sooner if they wanted &amp; potentially more cbs if they weren’t under YG. also there’s a lot of evidence of YG treating its artists really badly...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HibaLoutfi1 @Jaavimansilla99 @CintyaAyuM1 @allkpopTHESHOP @pinkachewnel @allkpop we do know what’s going on behind the scenes tho. there’s a lot of evidence of YG artists being mistreated. also, Yang Hyunsuk is not a good man. he’s a p*do and handled things very poorly while he was head of YG. he’s also a big source of company scandals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HibaLoutfi1 @Jaavimansilla99 @CintyaAyuM1 @allkpopTHESHOP @pinkachewnel @allkpop they could have become artists &amp; had promotion in a better company. the company doesn’t make the artists, the artists make themselves with hard work and dedication to their job. YG holds them back by refusing to give them the solos and comebacks that they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dopefwings @minalikeytt it depends on the group, song &amp; choreographer. gg songs can be hella hard to perform. choreos like the one for fancy by twice look simple but they’re actually very difficult especially when gg stage outfits are usually harder to dance in<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FreeSoulRi not to mention that it’s better if he admits to crimes because if he denies it &amp; is found guilty then he’ll get a harsher sentence. if I were you I would hope that he did actually admit to things because otherwise the law will punish him a lot more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeSoulRi even closed door interrogations can release a small amount of info to the public. they won’t release everything that happened in his interview but some info can still get out (especially since the SK police is far from perfect lmao)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomfunmi @idefendbangtan @allkpop that’s not true. he’s accused of multiple different things associated with gambling and transferring money overseas. he’s admitted to some of these things but not all. that’s how the law works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xsooxs @nichiechans @Koreaboo I did, looks like he could still be prosecuted for many things and again at least be put on probation 🤣 he’s already admitted to some of his gambling charges, that will be used against him in his court sentencing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeSoulRi well he’s admitted to some charges of illegal gambling in his police interview, so he’s already told the public the truth 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hekatesgal @Koreaboo except he literally did lol. every news site is reporting it. he admitted to some charges of gambling in his police interview, so his statements will be used in court later and he’lol be found guilty or innocent of each gambling charge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xsooxs @nichiechans @Koreaboo he’s still accused of things luv. if he’s found guilty then he’ll be at least put on probation. also he keeps being accused of more and more things, just accept he’s a criminal and go. he admitted it himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSARMY2013_06 @Koreaboo they can’t throw him in jail immediately lol they’ll take his interview and use it in sentencing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idefendbangtan @allkpop when you’re taken to court you’re usually accused of multiple things. so he’s admitted to some charges but not all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PenguinPounder @serenityjhs kpop stans also mass reported the *trolls* that made fun of Etika’s death. twitter is an open platform and people can tweet whatever they want, just delete twitter if you’re going to get upset about it :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PenguinPounder @serenityjhs you’re backtracking 👀 you’re suggesting that they don’t deserve popularity or a platform &amp; you’re acting like kpop artists are any different from other famous artists lmao. looks like somebody’s in denial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PenguinPounder @serenityjhs I’m pretty sure saying they “all copies of each other”, are “spreading like a freaking disease” and are “a problem” is racism but keep denying that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PenguinPounder @serenityjhs racism? in 2019? on twitter? it’s more likely than you think<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CinemaDoll90 @kfernandz1 @taesbbygirl18 @AgustDxDdaeng except my point is that the whole point of the raffle system is to stop scalpers when scalpers still resold tickets anyway 😂 might as well not change the whole system if it’s not going to help anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iuvjuns  https://t.co/EgfgRuALne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@875hyyh the current lottery system in SK is for floor seats and first floor seats too though, BigHit said: the poor ARMYs can sit at the BACK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byjinxo why was that the first thing I thought of I’m so sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byjinxo Jin or the fish lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kfernandz1 @CinemaDoll90 @taesbbygirl18 @AgustDxDdaeng not everyone looks at announcements or looks at the raffle info. as I said, people didn’t know that they do full identity checks to match the tickets to membership info and your ID. also the fact that you have to bring something to be ID’d with is over the top<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SUNMIJK all that and you forgot about iKON 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namdohyonist omg  https://t.co/tGDkSmq9kI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmnvy oh, and you can only get 1 ticket via the raffle meaning that many won’t be able to come if they need a parent / guardian / friend to go with them 😅 there’s a lot of different issues this system could cause<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmnvy also, even if only some of the tickets are being put in the raffle, the remainder that are on regular sale will be even harder to get ahold of then they already are which will also allow scalpers to sell those tickets at unbelievable prices to get desperate ARMYs to buy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmnvy not everyone can afford to pay for the membership, especially since shipping costs are insanely high. plus, there’s no set ticket price - you only learn the price of it if you win, meaning some people might not be able to pay it if it ends up being too expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sh8wol thank you 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmnvy I know that. the fact that they even do ww concerts is great. but the raffle system is unfair and unnecessary and will result in lots of people missing out on a chance to see them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oooh taste I’m glad I stanned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohbana @moodyranika congrats on your graduation!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealUnkle1932 yes!! I saw Minho in Hwarang and I thought he was great, I stanned shinee pretty soon after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sh8wol drop a link I wanna see it too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minstradamus_93 @lgbtxe @flwrytae harder because: you only get 1 ticket which you can’t sell or exchange, you’re in a raffle against many other people which makes it unlikely you’ll win, if you win you have to claim the ticket quick before they give it to someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foreverrrain_ @starrykoo_ @Dr_Raccoon @taesbbygirl18 @dulsetproject or they can just talk to the ticket resale companies and stop them for allowing BTS ticket resales! or just stop people from selling the tickets for way over face value<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CinemaDoll90 @taesbbygirl18 @AgustDxDdaeng also, if they still have tickets for general sale, there will be less available as a result of the raffle and it will make it more of a bloody nightmare to buy BTS tickets. and obviously, scalpers will still be reselling those tickets instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CinemaDoll90 @taesbbygirl18 @AgustDxDdaeng they might be TRYING to stop scalpers, but it’s not going to work. at the Seoul concert, people didn’t know that you can’t resell the tickets and got scammed by people who sold them anyway. there’s no foolproof way to stop scalpers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serendBTS @PJMPR0MISE I hope so, I really don’t want people being scammed like that... if BigHit does end up going ahead with the raffle then I guess we could ask stubhub and other resale sites to ban the sale of the raffle tickets? idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmnvy @softpjmx that’s the point. $60+ for membership + around $100 for a ticket in the raffle if you win, and you only get 1 ticket that you can’t resell or anything in case you can’t attend. it’s an unfair system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DDAENG_ZERO @cocoa_yoongz @minyoonglie “a few” will end up being all the good seats if we let BigHit go ahead with it. sale tickets will end up being right at the back / restricted view seats &amp; it’ll be even more of a war zone trying to get on ticket sale sites...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myoonggis people will try to drink water from the water cannons to survive because even a drink from the venue’s water fountains is lottery only<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serendBTS @PJMPR0MISE people don’t know that though. scalpers will still resell tickets to unsuspecting buyers which means someone will end up getting scammed. this has already happened at their Seoul concert with this system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrykoo_ @Dr_Raccoon @taesbbygirl18 @dulsetproject I think they’re trying to say that people who buy it just for the tickets after this announcement will only encourage BigHit. people can still buy the membership just for the benefits, sure, but if loads of people rush to buy just to get raffle tickets then it won’t end well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrykoo_ @taesbbygirl18 @chxrryjeons F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrykoo_ @Dr_Raccoon @taesbbygirl18 @dulsetproject yeah but not everyone WANTS the benefits of the membership. they just want to see BTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrykoo_ @taesbbygirl18 @chxrryjeons BigHit said themselves that they’re going to roll it out for worldwide concerts but they haven’t confirmed when they’ll do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CinemaDoll90 @taesbbygirl18 @AgustDxDdaeng but you still have to pay for $60+ membership on top of that &amp; you don’t know the ticket price until you win. it’s still gonna make it way harder for many people to attend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJMPR0MISE the lottery system will make it near impossible to bring friends to concerts w/ you. they’re trying to avoid ticket resellers but tbh there’s always gonna be resellers. my mom says they should just sell tickets in person at a box office like back in the day lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like a lottery system will be annoying &amp; make it harder to bring friends w/ you to concerts... 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ppuyo131 @soompi I stan iKON too but no need to drop fancams in BTS posts lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usinthelouvre some sixths forms and colleges have open days on results day or just after for late applicants!! try looking up some near you and see if they have an open day, you should be able to phone them up too to see if you can send in an application form<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chuusmiles wasn’t Pluto apparently coming back to the group though? apparently her fans encouraged NASA ent to take her back 🤩 my queen moon is so underrated though, Earth would be nothing without her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would suggest getting any iKON albums you want now in advance in case anything is re-recorded later on. buying now also means you might still have a chance to get Hanbin photocards and items in the album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phuntshoklingd1 @sseurekii @beibeibin the tweet is basically saying that iKON won’t release any new songs until at least after September, which probably also means they won’t have to re-record old songs to remove Hanbin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so iKON won’t have any comebacks or new songs until at least after September. they probably won’t re-record old songs either. #iKON #iKONLEAVEYG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yatihussin @sseurekii 3Q = third quarter, basically a business term that means between July &amp; September. the original tweet is saying that iKON won’t release new songs between now and September at least, which also means they probably won’t have to re-record old songs to remove Hanbin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Giblet91318315 @adriansradical @EllieG2016 angry? you’re the one who seems mad lmao. you can’t even find a decent argument so you start calling people 11 year olds. if you’re tired of seeing fancams then either suck it up and get used to it or delete twitter. not hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heiynetta the only facilitated iKON because fans literally had to beg iKON to debut after YG kept putting them in competitions. YG only made iKON a group because they were all the same age. their budgets for concerts and stages are always low. iKONICs have no reason to thank YG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>iKON being reported on by billboard 😌...... but why now 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansradical @Giblet91318315 @EllieG2016 can’t do much about it 🤷🏻‍♀️ it might get annoying especially if it’s the same video over and over but you kind of have to grin and bear it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bestofkhb because iKON and iKONICs come back stronger each time. you don’t become strong without hardship. if iKON can pull through then so can I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88rising where’s the apology for the shitty management &amp; the encouragement of moshpitting which resulted in multiple people passing out? not to mention how water was $8 🤡🤡🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@honeyboysyubs last time I went the DJ was really jumping around and trying to get into the music too 💀 like idk what topshop are thinking but people will avoid going into the store just to avoid the second hand embarrassment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeppgebu it’s so awkward lol like what was she trying to do, there was no space on the damn car I’m dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princesungie eye-  https://t.co/psGRFujw48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeyboysyubs definitely wouldn’t expect it since it’s still pretty hard to even get albums around here 😂 also why does topshop have DJs now, it’s so awkward to walk into topshop and see someone on turntables lmaooo at least the DJ at your topshop had good taste<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefactnews if it’s not all 7 then we don’t want it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjunhole we should take the other half of the car while we’re at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeyboysyubs yeah, Lush actually plays a lot of kpop lmao, I know this fully well and I still have a heart attack every time they start playing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idknabeela yeah, there’s one store I know which is getting lots of new ones so I hope other stores do the same 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_stinry @DhuduDhudu @aiysha_abubakar @Koreaboo they may be united but that doesn’t mean that the Chinese government is perfect. the government controls the population and limits freedom of speech, and China is clearly trying to take control of Hong Kong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hmvWestfield hey, do you have twenty one pilots in stock?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DhuduDhudu @aiysha_abubakar @Koreaboo interesting, especially since China banned social media. maybe they’re trying to send some kind of message that they actually have support (which they essentially don’t lmao). if people really are being controlled then it’s a shame that their careers will take a hit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idknabeela they did but London HMVs are so behind like I only know one (1) with any kpop albums at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aiysha_abubakar @Koreaboo I don’t think they would predict how much backlash they would get for showing their support to the government. it’s good that you’re open to two sides of the argument though, if lots more celebrities post the same thing then that might hint they’re being forced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THEY WHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aiysha_abubakar @Koreaboo social media is banned in China though. still seems off that celebrities would post on social media rather than say it themselves if they’re truly being “forced”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missDVIP92 I don’t think jinhwans mom was following originally even before the case but she followed now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilverHammers @Wethepeoplehope except cigarettes are harmful and not usually sold but pharmacies. the birth control pill is already relatively difficult to get ahold of and often requires a prescription, they’re only making it harder for people to get what they need (sometimes to survive)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getreadyhoetime I love the way you decorated your konbat!! so cool ahhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilverHammers @Wethepeoplehope they’re a pharmaceutical company. you would assume that they would sell birth control since birth control helps many people control serious health conditions as well. refusing to sell it means a drop in profit &amp; it alienates then from other companies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberIsAQT I’m at 4, anything above 5 would be too much to handle tbh lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiufluff TELL HER SHES DOING AMAZING!! iKON would be so proud omg ❤️🧡💓💛💚💜💘💞💖💝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilverHammers @Wethepeoplehope they’re making it harder to access that right and remember that other companies may well follow suit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HabibaMayaa same but I’ll take a dip in the Thames 💀 looks like I’m goin for a swim<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HabibaMayaa idek, I feel like the exam boards will screw us over w/ high boundaries but idk if they’ll be able to without making the whole of Britain fail lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oljvn I voted up because I’m prepared for all the exam boards to collectively fuck us over with grade boundaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoDiscussions you know it’s real when even the doctor who fanpage is tweeting about it, oh god<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKell16559758 I’m not trying to hate on jihoon’s fans because you guys really had a good voting strategy. but I have a hunch that starpass intervened to prevent anyone from iKON winning the competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKell16559758 I know that jihoon’s fans were voting hard which is why he was in the top ranks for ages and managed to maintain 1st place. but if u read my thread, I talked about lots of suspicious things that make it seem like starpass rigged the competition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jowanheda @sseurekii exactly. which is why all YG artists should leave. YG is a cruel company that throws away talent. iKON and the other YG artists would easily be able to find another company like Pnation to sign to if they leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oom9oo thanks!! 💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dboy_YUNKI thank you 🥰<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@llkmsll thank you!!! 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jowanheda @sseurekii Hanbin’s contract cancellation was only “easy” because YG chose to cancel it. it’s much harder for iKON to try and cancel their contracts themselves. also, there’s a lot of evidence of iKON being treated badly by YG. I can send some proof if you like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viktorioes @ulikethischain NOOOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kralcnad_ @prismaticmia @LiveNationUK but many people have asked the same question literally. also you must have misread my reply because I was intending to respond calmly lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Multifandom__K_ that’s fine if you want to keep voting for him. but I find it very suspicious that he suddenly reached 1st, I think starpass just doesn’t want iKON to win. well done to you guys though, he was near the top ranks this whole time even before 1st place 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kralcnad_ @LiveNationUK nope, she was never taken to court over it &amp; there was a lot of inconsistency with the accuser’s story. innocent until proven guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Multifandom__K_ still, it wouldn’t make sense how he suddenly gets millions of stars, especially since the starpass app was down for maintenance. after the app was updated, he suddenly had lots of votes even though nobody was able to vote during maintenance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a screenshot of the starpass update notes. “fixed” vote system? sounds suspicious 🤔 especially since solo ranks changed entirely after this update.  https://t.co/i2GtcnbR8p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Multifandom__K_ here’s my thread explaining how the jihoon votes really aren’t legit 😊 no hate to jihoon or his fandom but the starpass competition is rigged  https://t.co/wfL9EFCFSw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dkdlzhs78 @heol89 nope. I made a thread with evidence that those votes for the 1st and 2nd idols are totally fake.  https://t.co/wfL9EFCFSw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the silverstar counts for the top two idols are only increasing by large amounts a few minutes apart, evidence that the votes aren’t legit. star counts for Bobby and Jinhwan go up by only small amounts consistently, so those votes are real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the two idols in the lead reached those places within less than an hour. even starpass posted evidence that bobby and jinhwan were in 1st and 2nd place. suddenly other idols gain millions of stars??  https://t.co/0bJxYHpGeR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>watch how the silverstar counts for the 2 people in the lead do not increase while the counts for Bobby and Jinhwan do.  https://t.co/WRkui7EVGA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom it may say “migrants” but that’s only because the countries are avoiding calling them refugees since under law they’ll probably be forced to take them in. the fact that they’re fleeing from a war torn country does make them eligible for refugee status<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mingiteez literally, he’s so underrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom they’re fleeing from Libya which is a war torn country, technically they still count as refugees. people fleeing for their lives is not an “invasion”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ej9ozn4txpsK8kE I’m judging it from their actions. they were crying at their concert. Bobby looked a lot angrier than usual. it’s obvious they’re upset about it. even if you don’t want to support Hanbin, you should at least understand how the rest of iKON feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ej9ozn4txpsK8kE nobody is forcing ikon to wait for Hanbin. iKON are clearly upset about Hanbin leaving, you’re blind if you can’t see that. you’re not a fan if you can’t understand that iKON are upset about Hanbin. don’t be heartless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ej9ozn4txpsK8kE #iKONDISBAND nobody’s forcing ikon to miss Hanbin. ikon still want Hanbin back. if you’re not OT7 then you’re not iKONIC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@softyundong if you say so “buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz uh oh”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@softyundong didn’t you just say bday was ur favourite ikon song 😶😶😶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BWsWidowBites @mystic_babe_ please explain to me why ur pressed when the BTS stans are only trending it because one of the members said “I love you 3000!” which is still a good thing for marvel stans? please ur intolerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@softyundong @yvndong I can’t hear you TAKE IT TO THE LEFT SIIIIDE RIGHT SIDE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BWsWidowBites @mystic_babe_ the problem is y’all are getting pressed over a twitter hashtag when the BTS members are known marvel stans which is why kpoppies are trending it. 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanluvr Chris if ur reading this...... make an extended version of road not taken thank u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanluvr are y’all forgetting that chan has a stan twt and is probably seeing all of this  https://t.co/UMgK3FWqJX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BWsWidowBites @mystic_babe_ and why do you think it’s trending again? maybe it’s because kpop stans took it over 🤪 put 2 and 2 together<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@istanjunbob @STARPASS_Global yeah, I don’t think the other points from the profile will be counted. because this is a separate competition, whoever is at # 1 and # 2 should end up winning the prizes and other points won’t be counted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@istanjunbob @STARPASS_Global I think that’s based on previous votings, on the artist page it also shows rewards (previous voting wins?) so I’m assuming it’s just an overall total that counts other competitions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CHANNUYAAAA @STARPASS_Global that would make it harder to get one of them to the top though, if the votes are given to Bobby then he’ll reach 1st and then we can vote for the other members afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junes_hoe true, but it would be nice to still get an ikon member that billboard. and if they eventually (😒) get around to refunding our stars then we can use those to vote and then just uninstall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shookethaaa apparently it was an OT6 stan that reported Hanbin. might have been only the 1 person but they still removed him 🤨 even when clearly Hanbin was getting enough support that he was at 1st place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STARPASS_Global too bad that it’s unfair and you remove the person in the lead after only 1 or 2 complaints from hateful people 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@always4iKON if we’re going to keep voting, it’s a good idea to focus on getting Bobby to the top first and then choose another member to vote for to get 1st and 2nd for the boys. otherwise it’ll be harder to surpass other artists on the list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtzlmtzl @itsmebobbySUrFn are you kidding?? that’s so stupid... let’s focus on getting bobby to the top spot and then maybe try to get another member to second to get them both on the billboard 😂 don’t mess with ikonics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@j_euphoric @Donghan01655966 don’t forget I stan BTS too. but I can respect the work of older groups because they also made an impact. BTS are getting billboard awards, time magazines etc. because they broke into the western market but they respect their elders for helping them do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_euphoric @Donghan01655966 um? BTS paved the way in terms of breaking into the western market but older groups built popularity across Asia before them which allowed them to do that. also, SHINee has significant buying power and regularly chart well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donghan01655966 also the way that new gen group stans forget that their own favs have thanked the older gen groups because they’re the ones that made kpop popular in Asia &amp; outside of Korea and they made the first step to breaking into western markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donghan01655966 that whole comment was incorrect lol. Suju and other older gen groups are popular outside of Asia but they don’t get the same publicity &amp; concert opportunities like newer gen groups. also “koreaboo” 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@igurluvonrepeat @epicvision299 @nintaeyongdo having a share in a company means you technically own part of the company and you can profit or lose money from that. a stock is a collection of all the shares. stock prices fall=less people are interested in buying shares<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wepurpleknj @ceyvmin that’s very true, nobody deserves to have stan twitter attack them like that. but it’s important to admit that he made a mistake and upset people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamjadenj @giveittoMYG @mat1bub @Stray_Kids are you kidding? years ago, kpop idols were shoved into the gutter for dating. nowadays they can freely say they’re dating someone and their agencies can’t do anything about it, otherwise fans worldwide will come for their throats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamjadenj @giveittoMYG @mat1bub @Stray_Kids I’m not defending anything but I’m also not about to go around diagnosing people with mental health issues. it invalidates people with actual problems. and I’m not defending the abuse they receive, I’m attacking their companies for it like everyone else is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_xhanjisung @xuxipal @jeongues it might be the fandom name but those lyrics were taken from a different song where the n word was used. he just said ninjas instead of the actual word. it’s not as bad as actually saying it but it’s still inappropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaneffects @lovingbangtchan literally  https://t.co/meerw5Q2nq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@straykeedsss @xuxipal @jeongues I’m glad we could have a good discussion on this ☺️ thank you for understanding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@straykeedsss @xuxipal @jeongues again, I can’t speak on this issue much since I’m not POC, but black stays were upset by the hair and the fact he used “ninja”. an urban dictionary description still doesn’t make it ok that he used that word to replace the n word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@straykeedsss @xuxipal @jeongues I’m not personally offended since I’m white, but black stays were. liking the culture is good but respecting the culture means not wearing the style since even now, people get racial abuse about it. the hair is more than a fashion statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FroSpirati0n @ehisonjaaa he wore cornrows/box braids and used a substitute for the n word in a song. he’s been getting a lot of hate for it ever since &amp; it upset stays<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wepurpleknj @ceyvmin many people spoke up about Lisa wearing box braids. Chan is also getting hate because he used a substitute for the n word in a song. since the hairstyle he wore is associated with years of oppression of black people, it was not his place to wear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taescvnery @ceyvmin clown detected  https://t.co/LTliOFXWCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@straykeedsss @xuxipal @jeongues they were intended to be a cornrow/box braid style, there’s audio of him at a fan meet saying he chose the style himself since he likes the culture. it was still not his place to wear it. also, I have NO idea what you mean by “asian version of the n word”????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giveittoMYG @iamjadenj @mat1bub @Stray_Kids honestly, people keep bringing this issue up. it would still be good to see evidence that he’s educated himself so black stays can feel comfortable again. nobody deserves to get dragged by stan twt and the way people are assuming mental illness now 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giveittoMYG @iamjadenj @mat1bub @Stray_Kids yeah my tweet was mainly aimed at the first person, sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kangaroo_CB97 skz and stays:  https://t.co/meerw5Q2nq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giveittoMYG @iamjadenj @mat1bub @Stray_Kids no he’s not. don’t go diagnosing people you don’t know with mental health problems, it invalidates people with genuine problems. also, supporting kpop artists puts their managements in the spotlight, meaning companies can’t get away with mistreatment anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluegalaxy2000 @asyareedus @onmyradarr @hwangksm yes but it was still used instead of the n word &amp; it sounds similar to the n word which is what makes it insulting. those lyrics were taken from another song where the n word was used and he just said “ninjas” instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hyunicrisp it sucks that black stays get silenced when it’s you guys that were really affected by all this. at the very least, it would be nice to see evidence that he’s educated himself on the issue and moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xuxipal @jeongues he wore cornrows &amp; used a substitute for the n word in a song (he took some lyrics from another song and said “ninjas” instead of the n word). I stan skz but I’m not about to act like he didn’t fuck up there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taxityler @AlexaTalavera7 @jeongues an apple isn’t an apology. you can support chan but you can’t excuse what he did luv, it was wrong and offensive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kpopbaddict @V0ICESKZ he wore cornrows &amp; used a substitute for the n word in a song (he took some lyrics from a song where the n word was used so he said “ninja” instead). I support Chan but I can’t support what he did 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luggnutss I’m a girl but ok mr luggnutss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luggnutss did u read ur tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kpopbaddict @V0ICESKZ this. there’s no evidence that chan is having a hard time with mental health so we shouldn’t assume things like that  https://t.co/V1q4SnYlM3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovedovejoon no idea but it’s a possible reason why he didn’t apologise. anyways I’ll be waiting on that apology or at least evidence that he’s grown from this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itzyzela someone decided to diagnose chan with poor mental health (🤡) so this started trending. not the best hashtag to use since it makes us look like we support what he did but at least he’s getting appreciation I guess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chulojeongyeon @sunlightjae both of these tweets are correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAMPROUDSTAY what he did was not irrelevant, it was a bad thing to do. he helps me too and he doesn’t deserve this amount of hatred but you have to realise that what he did was wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SANDRUXISS @shirmhir Sin embargo, el caso aún está en curso, tenemos que esperar hasta la conclusión<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_shmree_ I think he knows now that he should apologise but JYP’s restrictions may be stopping him. JYP artists can’t really say anything unless they have permission. I’ll still be hoping for that apology though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lidiahsin2u nothing actually, some clown just decided to suddenly diagnose him with mental health problems and everyone’s trending the hashtag even though it makes it look like they support what he did :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtbbkings @shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy I wasn’t directing that at you, it was at the other person. you stan ikon and know what’s going on with them so you can speak about them, the other person can’t since they know nothing about them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtbbkings @shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy except they were literally saying just that. saying that he’s guilty without knowing that there is no evidence for that and HB’s statement said he didn’t. they shouldn’t open their mouth because they don’t actually know what they’re talking about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yanyangjeongin @yutaismymoon who said I stan him? lmao what he did was wrong but I still have the decency to support ot9 and wash my pussy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy if you minded your own business you wouldn’t have mentioned HB 😂 the delusionnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notyong nothing and chan from skz did nothing either lmao people are just trending it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vminsknj @yutaismymoon you’ll have to type more than that if you want to clear the searches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtbbkings @shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy yep, I agree. that’s mainly why I’m arguing with the other person, she should focus on bigbang and especially G-Dragon since he might be coming back soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deawrld Chris / bang chan from stray kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir just because the media gave ikon the name “next bigbang” doesn’t mean that YG treated them that way lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @svtbbkings @Dr3amers_Whimsy ah yes, ikon and BTS, both successful and talented groups who haven’t been accused of selling prostitutes, are still relevant and they can actually trend hashtags!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yanyangjeongin @polyjoons @itseungjin ok great but he had the opportunity to do so, chan might not. he still doesn’t deserve rabid stan twt coming for his neck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir spoiled where? your standards must be pretty low to consider ikon “spoiled” despite the fact their concert props, microphones, outfits etc. are old and broken when other artist’s aren’t. not exactly the next bigbang, hm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtbbkings @shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy people only ever mentioned bigbang because bigbang members have been accused of taking drugs but their contracts weren’t terminated, HB’s was. that’s unfair. also my tweet meant that it’s not only ikonics mentioning bigbang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovedovejoon other JYP statements / apologies have only gone ahead with permission from JYP from what I’ve seen, like Tzuyu’s from 2016. I want him to apologise but I’m not sure he would be able to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtbbkings @shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy I’m not bringing in top and GD, it was the person I’m responding to that mentioned them. I wasnt trying to mention Bigbang members in this discussion. I agree that G-Dragon should be believed. don’t get me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir if you keep trashing ikon &amp; HB then you can watch as YG gets away with kicking out its artists just like they did to HB over and over again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir oh my goddd please learn to read. I CLEARLY said that YG treats all of its artists terribly, it’s not a competition. you tried to say that ikon is privileged so I informed you that they are the opposite of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir oh god I’m shaking in my boots. terrified lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir because I didn’t see a single ikonic saying anything about daesung or gtop &amp; I can’t apologise on behalf of ikonics if ikonics didn’t do anything &amp; don’t want to apologise 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir I think I’m talking to a 12 year old on twitter who is defending people without a second thought and trashing other artists without knowing anything about them. the fact that you’re a VIP is irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir delusion* also just because they had many concert goers doesn’t mean they bring the most revenue, the stats say that iKON make the most for YGE and that’s the facts... facts don’t care about your feelings 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SANDRUXISS @shirmhir hay evidencia pero la policía no lo ha dicho, todavía está acusado de crímenes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir I don’t represent the whole ikonic fandom, sorry sweetie 🥰 the only coward here is you, hiding behind a screen with a twt name like “Seungri the great” ewww the great prostitute seller you mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir but that’s exactly what I’m saying, if you knew how to read you would’ve picked this up: your favs are being treated like this too! treat HB &amp; iKON with respect and hopefully it won’t happen to them too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir and in the YGE is garbage Olympics, ikonics will always win since ikon bring more revenue to the company than any other group which makes ikonics a lot more likely to contribute to YG’s downfall rather than any other artist 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir they only faced the media &amp; the public when they were certain it wouldn’t affect their court cases &amp; when it was approved by their lawyers, HB doesn’t have that opportunity yet ☺️ that doesn’t make him a coward, it makes him smart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir I can almost smell ur stank breath through the screen... 🤢 I’m pretty sure I know how YG operates: they lie, they get involved in scandals, they lie some more, abuse their artists, and then they lie again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir HB said himself that he only ever gets criticism from YG. YG was looking for an excuse to take the attention off him and his scandal and kick HB out and he got two birds with one stone. again, this could happen to ur favs too if you remain ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir all their MVs and concerts are much lower budget than other artists... privileged where? iKON wishes. also YG had more scandals revealed about him on the same day as the HB issue, kicking HB out was a cover up &amp; part of YG’s jealousy &amp; hatred to HB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir omg here we go! iKON being “spoiled”! why bother arguing, you’re the dumbest bitch alive 🤣 ikon were used for views when they were forced into survival shows, fans had to beg for their debut, they received barely any promo from YG-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir the exact same thing could easily happen to ur favs at any time because YG ent is garbage, would you still call your favs cowards? and for legal purposes he would have avoided saying anything because he’s smart and knows the police don’t have shit on him lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir so what I’m saying is that my boy didn’t have a choice in the matter because YG abuses all of its musicians, including ur favs. also the fact that u care so much about bigbang and winner but you don’t even know they’re being mistreated is so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polyjoons @itseungjin doesn’t mean that someone should be attacked online when company restrictions make it difficult to confront issues like that! 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir again though, you can’t deny the fact that it’s extremely unlikely that HB could’ve left if his own will when his contract was terminated within only 4 hours ☺️ maybe if you had informed yourself before opening your mouth you would’ve figured that out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir too bad that ur favs are accused of something a lot more serious than just *thinking* about taking drugs 🥰 u must be so hurt that your favs might be prostitution ring leaders lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir YG have also said that HB asked to not be credited on his own song... YG are liars, if you truly believe that he left fully of his own will then you must be stupid &amp; blind to the fact that ur own favs are being abused under YG ent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir where’s the evidence that the post on his IG was his? don’t you think that YG has control over their artist’s accounts? you’re naive. and whether you believe her or not, there’s still no evidence that HB’s contract termination was his own decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir keep telling yourself that, whatever makes you sleep at night. too bad daesung has been accused of something now too, watch daesung and Seungri get dragged some more then. ur favs are criminals x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir aw, are you sad that you have nothing to say to this? are you sad that you don’t even know how lawyers work? I better stop before you start crying 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ehisonjaaa I still think he does need to apologise but using your (very precious) time at hi touch to bring it up yet again is :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@V0ICESKZ he literally breathed about hatred online and people start diagnosing 🤡 it’s good to support him but the origin of this tag &amp; the way people are just defending his past actions without a second thought is clownery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onmyradarr @hwangksm to put it simply, the leader of skz wore cornrows and used a substitute for the n word in a song. obviously this made stan twt go nuts but lots of stays were trying to defend what he did even though it was wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hwangksm THANK YOU. we have to acknowledge that what Chris did was wrong &amp; we have to be tactful about what we say to avoid stan twt coming for our necks more than they already are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir and now there’s also evidence to suggest he didn’t leave ikon willingly so your statement that he did is bs. not to mention that a decision like the cancellation of a contract wouldn’t happen in hours like it did with HB if YG had actually asked him about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir denying what? I’m the one stating the facts. HB hasn’t admitted to anything and there’s no news from police and prosecution, showing that he’s likely innocent which is why he was already cleared years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir a lawyer isn’t friends with a client. lawyers only work with clients on legal terms and don’t form an opinion or become friends with clients. reporter kang has shown support for HB through her article soooo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ridejiwon the parody I’ve been waiting for  https://t.co/kyPLbqeE71<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir your English is decent but too bad you’re using it to talk shit that nobody wants to hear, hm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir except the reporter is clearly not on hsh’s side lmfao 🤣🤣 you’re so misinformed it’s hilarious, keep your mouth shut since you know nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy bigbang don’t claim you if you can’t accept they took drugs and think of it as “shit behaviour” it’s literally a 12 year old state of mind. taking drugs isn’t that deep. stop running ur mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy where did he admit to buying drugs? his statement said he almost did but didn’t, stop pushing a false narrative. I don’t know what you mean by “what you as a fan did” because I haven’t done shit. and if you think taking drugs is that serious then unstan BB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir A. an interviewer claimed to have interviewed a member of iKON who said HB WAS kicked out against his will. again, you’re misinformed so don’t open ur stank mouth if you have nothing interesting to say B. you can’t spell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy lastly, nobody came for the rest of bigbang and if anyone attacks Seungri that’s probably because he’s been accused of all sorts of things and linked to many other crimes. you have no right to open ur mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy also HB hasn’t admitted to anything, there’s no news from the police or prosecution and his statement says he THOUGHT about purchasing but didn’t. again, the police have found no evidence against him. you’re misinformed, don’t chat shit when u know nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy “B.I’s shit behaviour” the way you call his behaviour shit but your favs are some kind of angels 😂 your double standards are hilarious &amp; taking drugs is nothing serious- especially since there is no evidence that HB even took anything! 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooboredtofunc1 @btsandtherest best response, you win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsandtherest it’s a shame that y’all can support BTS when they reveal their mental health issues but y’all drop the act as soon as it comes to someone else. unstan BTS they don’t want u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikonadore yes but before debut is a training period. it’s just odd that a member of twice trains for 10 years but others train for 8 months...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourlocalbby @insomniablinks @taeyunkii @Iuvjuns @smoljungkookbun I’m p sure your name is “moonchild from the sky” and you have a BTS header and you’re using a shitty BTS meme as a response but ok whatever you say babes x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy people attacking Seungri isn’t exclusive to ikonics and nobody attacked the other bigbang members. saying that it’s unfair that YG treats its artists so differently isn’t attacking anybody lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @Dr3amers_Whimsy if people attacked seungri then it’s probably because he’s been accused of things a little more serious than *thinking* about taking drugs 🤷🏻‍♀️ ikonics are complaining because it’s odd that others have taken drugs and haven’t been kicked out but HB was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HJBYJDC7 isn’t Hanbin the only one who said he’s never kissed anyone or had a girlfriend? and the rest of the members are like 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikonadore any except cube, SM and probably JYPE too because of the way they treat their artists. JYPE is better but the way they make some artists do years of training and others do months is a bit :///<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Min__Preston $450<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dr3amers_Whimsy @shirmhir literally nobody called him “druggie”, ikonics are tired of HB being called that so they wouldn’t force the name on someone else. nobody “slandered” him or bigbang. ikonics didn’t do shit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taeyunkii @Iuvjuns @yourlocalbby @smoljungkookbun if it wasn’t aimed at ikonics then they wouldn’t have brought up Love Scenario. point is, ikonics are staying in their own lane and i say that as an ikonic &amp; an ARMY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fIuffyrose fr SAME I could possibly just about afford a ticket last minute and I’m literally a 30 minute bus ride away from Brixton but my mom isn’t happy lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuuwice are you kidding? 6 minutes away from the academy last night, police were everywhere in a cordoned off area. crime rates are crazy there. and late comers may have been pushing but again, you’re the one who created a shambles of a queue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuuwice you’re the one who camped and put yourself in danger (it’s literally Brixton you should know better) and the main reason that the queue became such a shambles that people were hurt and crushed. don’t put the blame on others, ur the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sutoreikids it’s the taking part that counts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outroyoongIes I’m literally a 30 minute bus ride away :,) next time I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_EDSPLOSION ur taste in music is superior omg have fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jxtangerine there’s a few people in line giving some away, scroll through the latest tweets in #straykidsinlondon and you should find a few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yitamins sell on stubhub, there are literally hundreds of people looking for tickets there so you’re way more likely to sell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneSummerGirl43 @spookstown sure, they shouldn’t push in, but unfortunately this is pretty normal for arriving early to concerts. security can’t do much since it’s still about 2 hours before doors open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayphi2 the worst part is they could STILL get hurt, the academy is known for having dangerous situations after concerts... people need to be more mature and careful than this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jellyjeellyy @Stray_Kids try selling through stubhub, it’s easier to sell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Slytherin_AF_ sell through stubhub, you’re more likely to find a buyer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@songh9s if you’re selling, sell through stubhub. you’re way more likely to get someone to buy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spookstown yes but there is no official numbering system and since you got there earlier than doors-open time, you’re not entitled to get in first :) especially if you were camping since last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilmochi18 standing area doesn’t have an allocated spot, it’s sort of first come first served with how far you are from the stage. unless you bought a ticket in a specific section, it won’t say it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayphi2 apparently the police were at a cordoned off area just 6 minutes away from the academy, looks like there might have been a stabbing or something... it’s so dangerous, people should’ve thought twice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayphi2 I wonder how many crackheads have approached them so far 💀 seriously it’s such a dumb idea to camp, yikes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luv4bangtan exactly, Brixton is not safe. even the O2 itself is known to be really dangerous, especially after concerts. everyone has to keep their guard up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayphi2 people were camping last night too,,, it’s not safe in Brixton and there’s nowhere to use the toilet or anything lol I wonder how they’re surviving tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HxllySutton I’m just wondering how they’re gonna use the bathroom 😶 camping is never a good idea, especially in Brixton lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ymnights @parkersavengers @loblymin @fIirtseok yeah, the tweet is from may and the islamophobic stuff surfaced in June. his only response to being exposed for being islamophobic was a meme he tweeted. 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkersavengers @ymnights @loblymin @fIirtseok that tweet is from before the islamophobic comments surfaced, he hasn’t apologised for those and didn’t care when people exposed him for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uncovr_theworld @starrylip @MarissaRenee411 @fIirtseok @sadistjeons exactly, he was totally unapologetic when people started cancelling him and showed no remorse for what he said<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia what did I rt with a slur? I’ll un-rt it. also I understand she was comparing the situation to BFree but BFree is a lot worse and a lot more recent. and she didn’t need to drag bobby. if you wanna be done here then that’s fine lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notyourcrust @Mayakosmos if something happened then she probably would’ve made a video on it or something lol. I’m just saying the way she came across to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNTD apologist???? wym apologist lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosyheekie she would look amazing in a trash bag wym<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia she could’ve praised Namjoon without dragging Bobby and associating him with BFree, BFree is a lot worse lol he deserves to get dragged to hell and back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyingJiiwon it’s very hard to drop people sometimes, I was in the same situation a few weeks ago, but things really get a lot better afterwards ♥️ I wish you the best<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia same message @ OP too tbh lmao. I hope ur plant is doing well, keep her well fed luv x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esotaeric but then you put too much or too little milk, where’s the BALANCE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia and tbh both iKON and BTS’s careers have been hindered by various different things so honestly no need to use that argument here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia ikonics have heard all that before so she was probably expecting it but there was no need for her to jump the gun lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @WreckingIKON @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia please keep it civil lmao we respect everyone’s faves here because they’re all talented and deserve recognition tyvm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HJBYJDC7 damn Hanbin’s respecting women game is strong here 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyingJiiwon don’t be friends with people that don’t communicate w/ you, you deserve better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sseurekii I doubt that there would be promo material like that &amp; that note if their accounts weren’t somehow monitored by YG. similar thing with twt accounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sseurekii that’s what I’ve been thinking, I think their IGs are monitored / owned by YG or something because the apology note on Hanbin’s IG probably wasn’t his own &amp; all members have Killing Me promo material on their accs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chayllafoula @mori_niku @joonpedia lmfao they blocked me earlier, they hate being wrong about something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mayakosmos they way I saw Sherliza at the Wembley concert- she didn’t exactly look thrilled to be there lmao her eyes looked so DEAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia OP was saying RM “slaughtered” Bobby and that he’s “scared” to make a comeback to Joon, that’s hatred right there 💀 people who are denying it are clowns but it’s easy to understand why they’re mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubblyhoseokie @aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia because OP was attacking Bobby. saying that he maybe only won SMTM because of his company... OP’s trying to create fanwars 🤢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@morphtylerr ur dream showed u an ideal world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTS paved the way but so did this song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia still doesn’t add up that they felt the need to attack another artist for irrelevant bs from 2014 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia I think it’s being blown way out of proportion. a rap battle is bound to have some disses in it, that doesn’t mean the rapper dislike each other and it doesn’t mean anything. bringing this whole thing up was an obvious attack on another fandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia and yet she’s also insulting Bobby in return. and the fact that OP even brought up this thing from 2014 is unnecessary. and the raps from both side don’t matter-they were competing in a rap battle. what else would they do, praise each other?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia I didn’t call it fake. I said “misinterpreted” because this person is quoting an article in which Namjoon himself said he didn’t take the whole thing too seriously &amp; high-fived Bobby offstage. OP was only looking at one side of things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@songschelin here’s iKON on stage k. whatever struggles or difficulties you face, you’ll be able to overcome them! don’t let anything stand in your way  https://t.co/5gn1osEvML<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia that’s fine. the issue here is that people are acting like this is a big issue when both Bobby and RM are on good terms w/ each other. there are fancams of Bobby dancing to BTS at award shows. starting fanwars is unnecessary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iKONallforLOVE @shxxjin @joonpedia still a very good quote, perfect for this situation lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedKaii1 @NikuNikuMori @joonpedia they blocked me lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephy_bts @adore7kon @joonpedia as long as you realise that the whole bobby and RM thing doesn’t matter then that’s cool. BFREE is a whole clown and I wanna see HIS dumbass getting dragged rather than Bobby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NikuNikuMori @joonpedia BTS aren’t the only group in existence, imagine listening to ONLY BTS 💀  https://t.co/kF6HqqFmc8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“multis are not ARMY” I think BTS would disagree  https://t.co/NhyEsjs2mC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikuNikuMori @joonpedia damn you’re entitled 🤡 just because I like other groups doesn’t mean that I like BTS any less. BTS were the first group I stanned and they remain my favourite group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikuNikuMori @joonpedia shouldn’t you be saving your energy for supporting YOUR faves ☺️ also I’m an ARMY too lol, I’m smart enough to realise that RM is too busy to care about something from 2014 that was cleared up years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ayedemonsitsme but wouldn’t be they’re still? they are...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonChild_Jeon @joonpedia not fake, just misinterpreted. RM himself only saw Bobby’s diss as a “light jab” and nothing more, there’s really no hard feelings between either so I happily stan both 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikuNikuMori @joonpedia bobby and RM were competing in a rap battle. what do you expect them to do, praise each other? if you really think either of them will still be pressed about this then you’re delusional. move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephy_bts @adore7kon @joonpedia BFREE drama is worse than this. Bobby and RM have no hard feelings, this was back in 2014 and they high-fived off stage. RM himself said he didn’t think much of the issue. focus on attacking BFREE rather than an innocent person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iKONallforLOVE @shxxjin @joonpedia wise words I’m stealing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikuNikuMori @joonpedia the answer: both won since both of their groups are popular and successful despite difficult times and there’s no hard feelings between either rapper 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoseokrin @weini_2pm @joonpedia @jshgmbl um? OP was clearly attacking Bobby. ikonics just don’t like seeing ikon being insulted over something from 2014, the same way ARMYs wouldn’t be happy if this happened to them too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aotybobby @RNTD @joonpedia and even if he did target Joon, they were competing in a rap battle. what else do you expect them to do, praise their opponent? and remember that they high-fived off stage, there’s no hard feelings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikonichanbinie @Buns_ie @joonpedia also remember that they were competing on a show. it was a rap battle, not a serious argument or hatred between them lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliteyoongi @joonpedia except he didn’t LMAO his lyrics weren’t even a diss and even RM considered it a “light jab” rather than anything serious. they were competing. don’t start unnecessary fanwars ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uwujinteddybear imagine having stray kids look UP at you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IwejuoLilian @SincerelySeren @naija0329 I’m not ignoring anything and saying “most of them” hate ARMYs is completely wrong. most multifandom people are also ARMY because BTS is what introduced most people to kpop in the first place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IwejuoLilian @SincerelySeren @naija0329 you’re assuming that every other fandom hates BTS which is stupid. the only people who support hateful comments are also trolls, it doesn’t matter which fandoms they say they’re in. again, don’t stir up hate between fandoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gurlwluv it’s not even £22 lmao I live in the UK and shipping costs make it close to £50 + it’s actually hard to get ahold of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yumeyoongi if that’s the case then I hope she can get the help &amp; support she needs. but I’ll wait until she herself says if she’s bipolar or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IwejuoLilian @SincerelySeren @naija0329 nobody from their fandom supports their hateful tweets, only other trolls do. don’t stir up hate between fandoms. and sure, don’t take their bs but the best thing to do is report and block. trolls love attention from replies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoonghji @luvsjungmo @LanaKook5 kpop doesn’t have significant cultural ties but I don’t think it’s right for people who aren’t Asian to debut in the kpop industry. they’re only there to profit from POC success &amp; kpop should remain dominated by people from Asia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoonghji @luvsjungmo @LanaKook5 that’s true, but the fact she put it on her Instagram as well... I think idols need to be educated on not wearing these hairstyles or posting about them &amp; if they choose to ignore that then that’s when it’s a real problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SincerelySeren @naija0329 I just think that “punching bag” could have been phrased differently, I wasn’t trying to attack you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really made my layout aesthetic JUST for Hanbin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it really is missing iKON hours huh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bruh WHO’S RTing BTS SMUT ON MY TL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheryyjin anyone who gets 3+ likes on every tweet tbh lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren don’t forget that jimin is one of the most well known idols to those who aren’t interested in BTS or kpop! he’s extremely popular still, a few people’s bad words are less than the overwhelming support he’s getting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren I get what you mean but at the same time a lot of the online hatred he’s getting is down to BTS’s popularity, the same way every other musician is dragged. people who do that should be called out but it can’t really be stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoonghji @luvsjungmo @LanaKook5 especially since dreadlocks are a part of the Rastafarian religion and the people who practice that religion have been and continue to be suppressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoonghji @luvsjungmo @LanaKook5 not racist but cultural appropriation. braids &amp; dreadlocks belong to certain cultural backgrounds, I don’t think it’s right to wear the hairstyles if you’re not from that background.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren also I am an ARMY, I’ve seen the hate jimin gets ever since I became an army in 2016. you can be upset at the hatred but please stay level headed, being level headed is the best way to defend others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren because I’m trying to be realistic. saying he’s a “punching bag” is a weird comparison to make and I found it over dramatic. I’m not downplaying anything either, please know that there’s really not that many people actively attacking j!m!n online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoonghji @luvsjungmo @LanaKook5 it’s not their stylists who decide to post pictures of those hairstyles on social media. Kai did that even months after kokobop era and STILL calls it “reggae hair” or something. you can’t excuse Joy for doing this either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CardKpop2 ur bio really did all the talking for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>someone just said Woojin can’t sing and I’ve never laughed harder 🤡🤡🤡 are we talking about stray kids’ talented lead vocalist Woojin orrrr  https://t.co/W0TdJP8o1I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JENNlEGOD also using a slur against Woojin is insecure sad girlie on stan twitter culture 😔 awwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JENNlEGOD looking at this thread you really hate people with distinctive noses... ur missing out and I disagree with this whole thread but go off  https://t.co/B0V70XddjG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren also it goes both ways, a lot of my favs are attacked daily by random saddos on twitter, mainly because of their looks, and ARMY is nowhere to be found unless BTS are also mentioned. it’s a shame that fandoms often struggle to help each other out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren because everyone’s an ARMY in 2019 and the top replies to those kinds of posts will always be ARMYs. if you scroll you’ll find a wider range of people calling them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jhopespritee 83% not bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Takoya nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @hneyseok @BTSKingsIn19 @BtsBoricua @AugustIsAnArmy their music might not be too similar to other kpop music but I guarantee you that they sing in Korean and are from Korea. therefore they are a kpop group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @hneyseok @BTSKingsIn19 @BtsBoricua @AugustIsAnArmy did I have to? BTS and their music are rewriting the “formula for success”, that’s what the title means. but remember that the formula being rewritten here is for other kpop groups (aka they paved the way)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren the point is that it doesn’t matter what fandoms these people are from, it matters that they’re so full of hatred &amp; boredom that they pick on people while hiding behind a screen. attack the person for their attitude rather than mentioning their fandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren also you assume that I didn’t report this person. I say that fandoms “don’t claim them” because a lot of people push the narrative that every fandom is coming for BTS’s necks which is false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren indirecting me in a tweet is... 🤨 also clearly this person has been called out so they’re not getting away with anything, like I said people don’t let hatred towards BTS just happen. and larger accounts are much harder to suspend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren you think people aren’t attacked for spreading hatred about BTS? they get the worst of it, their accounts get suspended and deleted often. and it’s not “every other fandom”, it’s jobless twitter trolls. no fandoms claim them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naija0329 @SincerelySeren I wouldn’t say thousands, also “punching bag” is a bit over dramatic lol, twitter trolls are jobless and pick on idols because they’re bored and sad. Jimin is too busy being rich and famous to care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pointeshoes_3As because both dance and skating take a lot of talent, skill and dedication? 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SincerelySeren @naija0329 no need to be so dramatic lmao nobody claims people who pick on idols for no fucking reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PVMIN95 @hneyseok @BTSKingsIn19 @BtsBoricua @AugustIsAnArmy he said “we aren’t the representatives of kpop” and then added that kpop is a diverse genre that isn’t all about them 😂 BTS are a kpop group, how else would they pave the way for kpop lmfao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mochisncream_ @LlPS0UL ok but the tweet isn’t saying that’s wrong, as long as you respect other groups that’s fine. the problem is people who like only 1 group and drag the rest for no reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artsytaee @LlPS0UL that’s fine lol, this tweet was calling out people who stan 1 group and drag the rest for no reason<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior there’s not a single kind of medicine that everyone will react well to. it’s unfortunate he had that reaction but again, he’s the kind of person that others have to protect by getting the vaccine. refusing the vaccine yourself will kill him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior I’m not declaring that article as fake since it clearly says that the aluminium is there for a reason and just stating the amounts in each vaccine. but you took it out of context and made it seem like a bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior kids who are hurt by vaccines are the ones who need the herd immunity from other kids getting vaccines. some react badly to vaccines so they can’t take them, they’re at risk. so the ones who can need to take them to stop disease passing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ppuyo131 if they choose option B, they may be able to get all the rights from their songs since Hanbin is under the korea music copyright association and wrote all their songs. also if they join a reputable label the label should be able to buy the song rights too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior “much of the small amount of aluminium that does enter your bloodstream will quickly leave your body in the urine”. quick google search on how aluminium leaves the blood. vaccines are safe and save lives. sorry to debunk your fake internet articles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior it literally says on the photo you sent. “some vaccines contain aluminium salts... help the vaccine stimulate a stronger immune response and increase efficacy”. it literally just makes the immune system respond better to make the vaccine more reliable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iKONdense @hanwoo131000 @Zita9125 you could have just tweeted without having to include the tweet about suga because people WILL make their own interpretations and fanwars WILL start. I understand what you meant but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aissatad_ @jeontros @BTS_twt the “holy oppa” ruined it luv  https://t.co/tNFuT6ajl2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkpop1989 @iKONIClikkiee @allkpop yeah, the media really spun a lot of lies around the investigation. however, it’s still uncertain what the police are actually accusing him of since the police are handling the whole thing terribly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoplookup @shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop at this point it’s a waiting game to see what happens with the case but the police are currently too busy cleaning up their own act to release new info and find who’s guilty and who’s not 🤦🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkpop1989 @iKONIClikkiee @allkpop what I meant is that just because more stuff is being found on other people doesn’t mean that Seungri didn’t do anything. there are several sexual harassment cases unrelated to him, sure, but he is still being investigated on other charges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoplookup @shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop it’s a shame to see the police screwing up other investigations too and watching the media spread false info, it’s unfair to the idols who need to be looked into properly without media interference and corrupt &amp; careless police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoplookup @shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop if he is ultimately found innocent then I’ll believe the verdict but ALSO realise the case is screwed so other criminals probably got away. the police really messed this one up to the point people barely know what seungri’s charged with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GToD88 @shirmhir @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop it’s true that the focus was unnecessarily on Seungri just because he’s a celebrity involved in this. the information around the scandal is all over the place but that doesn’t make seungri innocent. the investigation is still underway so we should wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Hakes @Epsilllon_ @TrulyTayo @ajplus I know that 😂 but clearly you would say the same to migrants coming into America. you can’t just expect the migrants to leave without making the citizens pay for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkpop1989 @iKONIClikkiee @allkpop that’s true, but that doesn’t mean that Seungri isn’t still under investigation. many other crimes have been unearthed in the club’s investigation but that doesn’t mean Seungri has been cleared of any involvement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrassi @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop the police are all over the place and we honestly have no idea what Seungri has been cleared of or even what he’s accused of. the whole investigation has been interfered with. also by “abuser” I meant “sex abuse” in terms of illegal sex activity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoplookup @shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop also, yes, innocent until proven guilty applies, but many have undying support for Seungri and refuse to believe he *might* not be innocent... it’s important to keep in mind that he’s innocent for now but might not be later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoplookup @shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop she wasn’t actually looked into, someone accused her but didn’t take it to the police. there was also multiple things wrong with the whole story so it’s safe to assume that she’s innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Hakes @Epsilllon_ @TrulyTayo @ajplus nothing is free 😂 if the government deports them it’s still on taxpayer money. sorry to break it to you but again, if you want them to leave then YOU’LL have to pay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirmhir @GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop but don’t you doubt him a little? there was an artist I support who was accused of something similar a few years ago, I stopped listening to her music until the issue was cleared up. you can support Seungri but you can’t act like he’s definitely innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirtywavexx @sseurekii @Fillefatale4 @allkpop I’m glad we can agree on that. overall I think people are jumping to the conclusion that the investigation is over now when it’s not, the club and Seungri are still being looked into and lots of other illegal activity is still being found...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirtywavexx @sseurekii @Fillefatale4 @allkpop the article mentions 10 policemen who were arrested. also, it said that people were arrested for taping sex videos in the restrooms which may not be rape but it’s still illegal and still suggests potential sex abuse. the club isn’t clean at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mygyonce shawols don’t do shit on this bird app, why tweet this  https://t.co/H0B2kcG7MM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GToD88 @onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop uh? I’ve looked into the investigation myself and I’m not “ignorant”. nobody here is screaming, you’re refusing to see the truth that seungri’s name HASNT been cleared yet. nobody knows if he’s guilty or innocent, why support him when he could be guilty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanwoo131000 @Zita9125 @iKONdense fair enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirtywavexx @sseurekii @Fillefatale4 @allkpop they DID say it happened elsewhere, they clearly stated that others have been jailed for activity in the club’s restrooms. it also said policemen have been arrested for messing with the investigation which is why I said it flopped. you didn’t read the article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Hakes @Epsilllon_ @TrulyTayo @ajplus so how the hell do you expect them to leave? 🤨 if you want them out then pay for their travel. otherwise they’ll just have to stay 😂 sorry mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingstonGraham @setoacnna @YouGov you think SERENA would double fault??? in a game against an amateur where the pressure is off? nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Hakes @Epsilllon_ @TrulyTayo @ajplus lmfao go back home with what money? are you gonna pay for the trips back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onlyforbang @Iuvsakura @allkpop they just said they didn’t want delulu stans who support Seungri no matter what in their mentions. being informed is one thing but supporting a potential abuser while the investigation was going on? nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkpop1989 @iKONIClikkiee @allkpop just because someone isn’t innocent either doesn’t mean they can’t reveal someone else’s criminal activities lmao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirtywavexx @sseurekii @Fillefatale4 @allkpop so I read the allkpop article, they “can’t confirm” illegal activity happened IN THE VIP ROOM but it did happen elsewhere in the club. not to mention that the investigation already flopped because of corrupt policemen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanwoo131000 @Zita9125 @iKONdense that’s very true, but again OP was comparing him to other artists which is risky since other fandoms already want to come for our necks at any given opportunity. OP could have made the tweet without RTing something w/ Suga<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosiesamiraa that’s true lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noatrill @iKONdense the original tweet could easily be interpreted to mean “Hanbin should deserve this rather than Suga” which does ignore the fact that Suga is also hardworking and talented. we should be careful w/ tweets to avoid other fandoms attacking too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zita9125 @iKONdense he has been though, he won producer of the year. his talent has been recognised, we shouldn’t compare him to other talented and successful producers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior not to mention that these amounts of aluminium are all less than 1mg and are used to stimulate a better immune response. they’re in there for a reason: to make the vaccine work better lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilian37864118 @stevensenior Vaccines have less metal / minerals in them than food 😂 we consume about 7-9 mg a day just from eating but I’m pretty sure eating food isnt bad for you. again, do your research before believing everything you see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OH_mes2 Carlyn! Z-Girls are legendary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosiesamiraa I can kind of see why they talk about their achievements so much since they literally came from nothing and got to where they are now. but it does get irritating to constantly see “rt to vote for BTS” on my TL lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iKONdense Suga is a great producer too. don’t deny someone else’s talent pls<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dwddaeng @lanaavids death threats are never ok but people speaking up against her is a good thing. white people need to stop trying to debut in the kpop industry to make profit and her unpopularity sends that message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwddaeng @lanaavids because kpop should be dominated by asian!!! people!!! the same way that reggae should be dominated by poc! again, she’s trying to profit from the success of kpop which is NOT okay for her to do. white people shouldnt profit from poc success<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dwddaeng @lanaavids except he’s actually Asian 🤡 Lana’s white, she shouldn’t be allowed to debut in the kpop industry when she can just debut in the mainstream pop industry instead. she’s a white person profiting from asian success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwddaeng @lanaavids no because she shouldn’t have debuted in the kpop industry. she’s not Korean. the kpop industry should be dominated by Korean people, white people need to stop trying to make everything about them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LikeyStan123 @Ninaaaaass people were commenting all over his live-streams, he knows at this point. also, a few people criticising the actions of one person in a group does not make them disband. you can’t act like idols need to be protected from criticism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namethesay_17 imagine going all the way to Heathrow paying transport costs and EVERYTHING like that... couldn’t be me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LikeyStan123 @Ninaaaaass because it’s replacing the n word from the original lyrics and sounds similar to the n word. until Chan says something about the issue, people WILL “assume” which is why he should probably speak up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LikeyStan123 @Ninaaaaass the cornrows were probably not his fault since it was almost definitely a stylist who decided to give him that hairstyle, but it would be good if he cleared up the whole issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LikeyStan123 @Ninaaaaass he used “ninjas” as a substitute for the n word. he needs to stop doing things like that in order for people to stop coming for his neck. also, the beginning of the year wasn’t long ago and there hasn’t been a proper apology yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mingispeach @aegyobunny @BTS_twt I didn’t know they stanned day6 lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicothemisery omg please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjiminheart men are the most important things in life. uhhh INCORRECT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unforgi29319118 @BigE9043 @CBSNews again, it’s not that simple. contacting family members of the children is difficult and remember that these children could be coming from dangerous places. until something is sorted out for them, they shouldn’t be kept in places like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ninaaaaass I stan ot9 but a formal apology would be nice :/ he needs to be educated so nothing like that will happen again and people will STOP coming for his neck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTS_tookmyheart @rvspit bang chan wore cornrows back in April and used a substitute for the n word (“ninjas”) in a song. people aren’t happy :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BallerinaBarby @Ghostcat10 @CBSNews yeah, they’re just dodging the topic since it’s controversial, but it’s a humanitarian issue so something needs to be done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sseurekii ikon were always used to boost the popularity of other groups and they probably weren’t expected to do well when they did eventually debut. but when they were popular, YG continued to use them for profit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sseurekii YG used them for attention by putting them through award shows against their will. then when they debuted, Hanbin proved himself as a better producer than YG himself and that made him pissed. lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@han_beanss but that’s the issue: so many idols are taken advantage of by news outlets who blow things out of proportion for money. the news outlets need to be stopped in order for idols to look out for each other without fear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krung2Hearts @kontatoesgc it’s been downhill ever since he signed. iKON and Hanbin have been treated like dirt since the very beginning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigE9043 @CBSNews not that simple, there are kids who have been separated from their families in these facilities. you can’t send a child anywhere alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ghostcat10 @CBSNews I suppose, but it would be a lot better to change the way these immigrants are dealt with rather than keeping them in unsafe and overcrowded conditions with no information of what the future holds for them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZerexYT assuming that everyone who listens to kpop would disrespect the dead like that is very wrong. there are plenty of shitty people around but you can’t judge a whole group of people by the actions of a few.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@myginseoul it sort of follows the same pattern of games like mystic messenger, which also handle difficult topics and don’t have a super obvious tw. but they could’ve probably added it into the game desc of something at least 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7BTSaf a whole 9 / 10 years old ma’am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews sure, but that doesn’t mean they have to wear clothes that are “meant” for their gender lmao. it’s 2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DecemberTwenty8 where did they confirm that? links?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misttralton or perhaps one of the members actually had an eating disorder which became very public and now they’re telling their history and showing how these things can be overcome ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARMATIONMEETS I’ve gotten nowhere, I’m abroad with no WiFi so I can’t get the app until tomorrow :,) I just wanna be Jin’s manager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews no, they can’t. the idea that pedophiles use LGBT as an “excuse” is an outdated and incorrect one. LGBT people are just looking to live their lives comfortably, the least you can do is give them basic respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews nope, high heels were made for men too! but they became popular among women and eventually the upset around women wearing them died down. my point remains: times are changing, people can wear whatever they want :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews not everyone who wears the clothes associated with the opposite gender is a “drag queen”, otherwise women would all be drag queens since heels were made for men 😂 please let your children wear whatever they want, they’ll grow up to be well-rounded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews I’m not offended at all, I’m just wondering how you think that LGBT people &amp; drag queens are all pedophiles. it’s an outdated and uneducated mindset to have. plus, your kids might grow up to be LGBT themselves whether they’re “brainwashed” or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanberrie EYE-  https://t.co/1gVujHR8Fj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosies_samira either that or they just have really good posture I guess lmao, I never sit up straight at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews the population is big enough, having kids is no longer a necessity. and little kids can wear whatever they want, you sound like the creepy one here by insisting that girls wear “girl clothes” and boys wear “boy clothes”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosies_samira nah that’s a lie, everyone gets stomach rolls if they slouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FerletsYT @SkyNews that’s what they’re doing, they’re just gonna add in things like “but two women can love each other too!” and “you can still get STIs from same sex relationships”. just making people aware of the concept of LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALinTEAL31 @markg_15 @SkyNews it’s not “agenda crap”. the young kids are taught about the basics like how people love each other and kissing, the older ones are taught about sex and using protection. the LGBT info will mix in with this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saintkoos @ch8ng because he may be problematic but he doesn’t deserve to get involved in twt cancel culture because it’s toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IuvIy_ you can call him out for his bs as much as you want but insulting his appearance just makes you seem like a clown 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IuvIy_ don’t comment on other’s appearances when your profile pic isn’t even you 🤧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ikonavy on the Mirror newspaper in the UK too, at least on their website. I checked and the article is pretty factual without much bias so at least it’s not dragging his name through the dirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyingJiiwon this is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen omg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tae_Squishy he looks like a very sweet boy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@freckledaussie @PotworekMonster @namethesay_17 omg is that jungkook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yyunbins that’s true, but many people write to newspapers and radio stations in response to news and sometimes the news report is corrected if they get any information wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yyunbins since it’s a British company asking questions, I’ll be able to see if they say anything incorrect and I can write to them myself ❤️ generally the company report on things like this quite well though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myginseoul good luck on your exam &amp; I’ll be waiting for video or it didn’t happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lalisaaa_28 even if the company shuts down or something, it gives the musicians a chance to sign to another company and maybe re-debut, which could end up being a lot better than staying in YG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yungho0diegurl ikon are coming too x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kangtaehyungs @soompi but he’s stepping down from his position as owner too by the sounds of it 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my performance for #YGIsGoingToJailParty  https://t.co/Tq5lVqg8aH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheezbols @nevvywithluv @godlencloset he just announced he’s leaving YG Entertainment! the evil has been defeated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunseokrin @Cheezbols @nevvywithluv @godlencloset you can’t judge many by the actions of a few. you can’t act like ARMYs aren’t problematic too, but you wouldn’t see the entire fandom as toxic just because of a couple of people 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoongisPeitho @SerieTV46 @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt that’s why I’m saying that the members could leave. after their Japan promos, it wouldn’t be too hard to end their contract. also, all the attention is on YG for other scandals like Burning Sun. people were already boycotting the company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@victoria_carran @chananddara @SerieTV46 @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @YG_iKONIC @BigHitEnt @weareoneEXO I’m an ARMY too by the way. I don’t appreciate people casually stepping over other groups without knowing anything (aka. the scandal is entirely made up). I’m proud the boys are on top too, but you didn’t have to indirect other groups. unnecessary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoongisPeitho @SerieTV46 @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt YG is going down at this point 😂 so many scandals and now YG himself is being investigated, it’s never been a better time to leave YG. either that or he’ll try to save himself (and his stock value) by allowing Hanbin back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoongisPeitho @SerieTV46 @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt there’s still a good chance that Hanbin could be allowed back, or the entire group leaves and re-debuts in another company. I think people are following the account because they’re seeing if YG says/does anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWICEpavetheway @ikonadore @SerieTV46  https://t.co/NufjzAzPMp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fdzlkfli k. lemme say again: this doesn’t mean that every fandom hates BTS &amp; you can still support a musician without liking their fans. end of discussion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanteintro terminated his contract. this all happened within the space of less than 4 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanteintro Dispatch claimed that Hanbin bought and took drugs (which is not true). YG defended him at first, but then Hanbin released a statement saying he THOUGHT about it but was too scared to actually buy or use any.  He then announced he’s leaving iKON and YG ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantstanbois clowns. clowns made this 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@min_yoon6i @dionysoskth @godlencloset 👁👃👁 running ur mouth about other fandoms is literally what causes them to attack BTS, don’t stoop to their level darling. just focus on festa x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@min_yoon6i @dionysoskth @godlencloset uh? firstly I’m an ARMY too lmao. secondly, I didn’t see ANY iKON fans joining in on the November BS. don’t assume that everyone from every fandom was coming after BTS because that’s not true at all. ikonics including myself were defending BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsongjinhwan at the very least I want all 7 members to be safe and doing well ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheezbols @nevvywithluv @godlencloset that’s true. I still think that all fandoms should use this as an excuse to take down YG and shitty media sites though, before they attack more musicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dionysoskth @godlencloset fair enough, this is still a chance to finally shut down YG so I’m taking the opportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@130LUVS thank u for ur support ❤️  https://t.co/v8Mfd1cIet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MashaBTSSNSD @godlencloset 🤡🤡🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheezbols @nevvywithluv @godlencloset “the other day”? receipts please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dionysoskth @godlencloset sure but you gotta have some sympathy for the artists, take down YG but we gotta get their idols OUTTA THERE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godlencloset except the one fandom you’re indirecting here didn’t shit on BTS 🤡 yall have to realise that the whole world isn’t against BTS smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joei_ortega17 @k8indaeyo thank you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teddykrunk37 they could leave sooner than that. because of all these scandals in YG, it gives them a good reason to leave &amp; they should be able to just about pay off contract fees and stuff. another company will surely take them in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShahlaMohyi @CNN “abnormal”? “harmful”? he didn’t even take anything, the media are spinning a web of lies. someone thinking about taking drugs as stress relief for mental illness isn’t “abnormal” behaviour. the fact that it’s being brought up years later IS abnormal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyNi97990645 @CNN he literally said he didn’t end up buying any after all 💀 they’re really trying to ruin the poor guy’s career over nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcjgcf this is legendary where’s your fame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boywithvmin @jamaisvr I googled it and it really isn’t that serious 🤡🤡🤡 it was years ago and he barely said anything, the media love blowing things out of proportion. let’s focus on actual homophobes instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boywithvmin what homophobia 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kwon_Seulgi0307 thank you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arpitajk @btspaveddwayuwu @currythot @HOBISH0PE any company is better than YG at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arpitajk @btspaveddwayuwu @currythot @HOBISH0PE this is the chance to stop YG and kmedia before they ruin more careers, if they are just allowed to continue then every other fandom will be affected too. it’s sad that Hanbin has to be attacked over nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been reading all these articles about poor Hanbin for the past 6 hours and honestly... #StandWithHANBIN  https://t.co/mDepf68lps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meowduh the BTS disbandment party was NOT caused by fans of iKON! at the very least, you should use this as an excuse to finally take down YG ent once and for all. their artists deserve better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arpitajk @btspaveddwayuwu @currythot @HOBISH0PE he didn’t make a mistake, he didn’t even do anything 💀 dispatch just pulled it outta their ass. people shouldn’t be blaming bighit but EVERYONE should be trying to encourage YG artists to leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Koreaboo delete this trash  https://t.co/Uwo8MV8hOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imaintrovertfan thank you. it’s appreciated, everyone wants to know that he’s ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mizaphine @Istan_LEGENDS_ @lovelyyjaem @dnctzenx thank you!!! we really appreciate your support 💜❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__geniusSuga @kthmixtaepe ikonics are fighting back and the help from other fandoms is really appreciated. I think everyone can agree that YG needs to be shut down and their artists need better companies. everyone’s tired of YG scandals and behaviour at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ughjunhoe I did find this video:  https://t.co/bQZu5w4scR but I’m not sure if it was the actual interview since there’s no English subs yet. either way, YG really messed up here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkashiyaYuko @btsxxjiminssi @kthmixtaepe @ohhhmamamay a member of the group iKON had his contract terminated over a scandal, and it was announced he’s leaving the group. lots of people have been talking about this, YG entertainment were very unfair to him and iKON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__geniusSuga @kthmixtaepe thank you! as an army and an ikonic it’s pretty irritating to see people make fun of a group that’s fallen apart when BTS almost disbanded only a little while ago...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliveir78057948 @k8indaeyo I found a video though, there’s no English subs but:  https://t.co/bQZu5w4scR I also haven’t seen that anyone “started” this since its spread a lot, I doubt someone would have been able to spread something that far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k8indaeyo update: I found a video.  https://t.co/bQZu5w4scR not sure if this is the interview everyone’s talking about and there’s no eng subs just yet but it’s something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ughjunhoe @k8indaeyo lots of people talking about it on twitter, a few who saw the broadcast. pretty sure it’s real since so many people are mentioning it and this whole thing is already spreading everywhere, so it’s not unlikely YG would have said something already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k8indaeyo I can’t find any footage of the broadcast yet but it was supposedly on national TV. I’ll keep looking but at the moment everything’s too chaotic to find it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k8indaeyo YG did a live interview on TV and said it himself. I can’t find the broadcast just yet since it happened only about 40 minutes ago but he said himself that he terminated the contract BEFORE Hanbin posted on IG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poutychanwoo I’ll be ready to write down the names of every reporter who harasses him. I’m ready to ruin their careers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandiacogadh @xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano um??? I do agree ahdhdhfjdj. me and her have been having a discussion just fine. I believe he’s innocent until proven guilty. what more do you want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meownme @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I know that and I agree with that. I wasn’t trying to say he’s guilty in the first place. I was providing evidence to show that he COULD be so we should wait and see what happens with the scandal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ferdunno @taecessive @btsarmeoily it’s hard to find out now that this whole issue with poor Hanbin is everywhere. it sounds like it was new stuff linking YG to the scandal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ferdunno @taecessive @btsarmeoily YG have been in chaos trying to get ahold of him, I’m glad YG are already feeling the impact of this mistake. some people are saying someone reached out to him (it could be his manager) so at least it looks like he has support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ferdunno @taecessive @btsarmeoily they are!! more information on the burning sun scandal was released today and this is the perfect excuse to cover it up! not to mention that Hanbin has been on TV shows and everything lately, iKON are about to comeback... dispatch and YG timed this on purpose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meownme @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano not always, even high profile criminals haven’t always been arrested straight away. I guess time will tell and we’ll have answers about him soon, the police need time. we need proper answers before we can say he’s guilty or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandiacogadh @xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano he IS charged AND accused with multiple things which relate to selling prostitutes to business partners. and I’m speaking respectfully with others since I won’t attack people I don’t even know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ferdunno @taecessive @btsarmeoily apparently it was only weed in the first place, when weed definitely isn’t as serious as other drugs. but yes, I hope he gets help since he’ll feel terrible right now. some fans have seen him recently and they’re keeping an eye on him since he’s alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taecessive @ferdunno @btsarmeoily exactly!!! even though Hanbin said he had only THOUGHT about drugs! and all the dispatch articles are deleted now since even THEY realised that there were major flaws in what they claimed against him. YG made a horrible mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandiacogadh @xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I’m not trying to say anyone is guilty or innocent here. you can support Seungri if you want to. but saying you’ll keep supporting him even if he’s found guilty of running an underground prostitution ring... that’s worrying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ferdunno @taecessive @btsarmeoily YG drug tests their artists every 2 months though! and also, the person who could have sold Hanbin drugs was caught in 2016. he said that Hanbin asked for them but never received any so the police never accused Hanbin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unknownprik literally one of the most famous BP songs that made a lot of people fans of them... I hope blinks can support ikonics through this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I guess only time will tell at this point. the media is really getting in the way of the police being able to actually do their job, let’s just hope the media back off and everyone will get genuine answers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Winneoot4 okay, that’s fine and it’s your decision. I also think Seungri is innocent until proven guilty. but again, thinking about weed is not a crime and the police never had any charges against Hanbin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano apparently some of the evidence got messed up too and a lot of dealings could have gone under the table to various different places. if they want concrete evidence of that then they’ll really have to dig, if they do then they won’t release that to the public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano yeah, they basically expected instantaneous prosecution without realising how long the process takes, so they started making things up and assuming things to have a scoop. it’s a shame since it’s hard to tell what’s a fact and what’s not now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Winneoot4 except there Hanbin has also passed all the drug tests in YG for years, AND the person who could have sold him the drugs said that none were ever delivered to him. which is why that stuff from 2016 was dropped, since hanbin was proved to not be involved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano that’s exactly what I’m thinking. glad to see someone who thinks the same way, I’ll follow you for that one lol. and again, thank you for informing me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano that’s true. I think the police are trying to keep things under wraps to avoid any potential evidence being disregarded because it was shown to the public. but because a big celebrity is involved, the media are parading it around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I’m glad we can agree on that, and thank you for being respectful. either way, I hope we can get more reliable news on this case and everyone involved and I hope it reaches a conclusion soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano mainly media articles. yes, they can’t be trusted, but it’s usually the media who can get the most info from the police. I’m going on what I’ve seen around, which is why I said “suggested” and I didn’t say that it’s a genuine charge against him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano you can’t rely on that statement though. but that’s a good point. let me say again, I’m here to say that he’s not innocent, but not guilty either. I also wanted to know more on this case too so thank you for informing me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I don’t support those people who tweet things and don’t take it seriously. I do keep the victims in mind. he’s innocent until proven guilty but the victims are still victims until there’s proof that they’re not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I can’t provide receipts now since I’m busy, but there’s plenty of articles on google. and again, it was SUGGESTED that he MIGHT have misled women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @bandiacogadh @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano he was in the chats though, his messages were revealed to the public. since the business was partly owned by him, he would have given those women to business partners. and now it’s been suggested that he “tested” these women too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandiacogadh @xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I care about the victims. if people didn’t care then people wouldn’t be talking about Seungri. people liked the post about Seungri because he’s become the face of the whole issue, no one knows the other guys but everyone hopes that they are prosecuted too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Winneoot4 smoking weed will NEVER be as bad as exploiting women. you can’t compare them, especially since B.I said he THOUGHT about taking it but he never did. smoking weed doesn’t harm anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano thank you for supporting B.I, ikonics really appreciate it. I also see where you’re coming from and again, you can support him if you want to. thank you again for supporting ikon through this scandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandiacogadh @xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano how could you say that when you’re a woman yourself? this goes further than prostitution, it has also been suggested that he misled these women. if you support him if he’s found guilty, don’t expect people to respect you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I don’t think anyone’s blaming him for other scandals. I think it’s unacceptable that people bring him up all the time, but we don’t know what he did or didn’t do yet. it’s your choice to support him so go ahead, but don’t assume he’s innocent either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano they failed to get evidence when looking into “funds and records”. that’s only about the embezzlement charges. there hasn’t been much revealed about the other charges because the police are still working on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I’m not sure what you’re trying to say here. but they only said that they had no evidence for the embezzlement charges. again, I’m not saying he’s guilty or innocent, I’m just trying to show that he’s still under investigation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I’m sorry that people have said those sorts of things to you, I know exactly what it’s like to see someone you support do something terrible. supporting him is your choice. I hope you have a nice day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano the other charges can still be held against him. also did you see my other reply? the articles you sent me show that they are still getting evidence against him and he hasn’t been cleared just yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I think it’s definitely ok to support big bang through all this, but supporting a potential criminal may be something you’ll regret if he’s found guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnyllix @BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano it’s ok if you believe in innocent until proven guilty, but it’s probably batter if you don’t support him until you’re sure. one of my favourite artists had a scandal a while back and I didn’t support her until I could be more sure that she’s innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano they’re still collecting evidence which shows they still see him as a suspect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano the screenshots you sent prove that. look at them again if you want to see. “destruction of evidence”, “extent of the suspect’s involvement”, “suspect’s position paper”, “evidence collected previously”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano also, I’m not accusing him. I’m challenging YOU who is defending him. I am not saying he’s guilty or innocent. but you shouldn’t assume he is innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano time limitations can be extended. I have family members who do law, don’t try me. just look at other law cases online, they take months or YEARS to collect evidence and bring someone to court even when they’re guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano I already replied to someone else who sent me these same screenshots, but I’ll say it again. this was only about ONE of the charges against Seungri. he has many other charges which the police have found evidence for. this is not proof of his innocence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano not yet, but court cases can take years and the police are working fast. you shouldn’t defend someone who might have exploited women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano except the police haven’t dropped charges against him. they haven’t said Seungri is innocent. you can’t say he’s completely innocent until it’s proven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano that’s about the money allocation within the company rather than the other accusations against Seungri. neither of these things make him innocent, they just failed to find enough evidence to say that he was sending out money in an unfair way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano so, last time you checked, the police were saying they still have a ton of charges against him and they can’t say he’s innocent. you’re proving my point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano that’s about the arrest warrant. all it’s saying is that they can’t pull together a solid reason to arrest him. the same thing has happened to even extreme criminals.  both of those statements show that Seungri is still a major suspect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano also, it was recently suggested that Seungri even “tested” women himself before giving them to business partners. Seungri is still involved in this whole issue, you can’t assume he’s innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenachourSylia @mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @MeljanLascano but even you admit that Seungri is involved. as part of the business group, he would have known that women were being sold to business partners and he would have sold them himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @BenachourSylia @MeljanLascano there is, the police have only released some information from the group chats. it has been said that there are videos associated with him.  think what you want to, but you asked for evidence so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mylastmelodrama @chimchim_jpe @Psych_99 @BenachourSylia @MeljanLascano there’s plenty of evidence. the police have the group chat messages and the videos he took of women having sex with other men. they have witness accounts and accusations from the business partners and the women involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggukftkth thank you. I’m glad to see other ARMY supporting other groups. everyone saying “exclude me” doesn’t realise that this is the chance to take down YG, it’s about time that company closes down and its artists go somewhere better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ httpx_skidsxbp #suedispatch and also: #ikonleaveyg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KYERIMS2 @artsyseuIgi he didn’t even take drugs by the sounds of it, he said he considered it. and YG artists are screened for drugs every 2 months and he’s always come out clean. him and ikon don’t deserve this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBaekAguas @oecphoria @loeykjm @OH_mes2 you can’t say anything about racism when Ka1 was fully posting about wearing braids RECENTLY 👀 i dont exactly hate EXO but they’re problematic for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taeminsleep the only people I saw doing that sort of stuff were gg stans 🤧 I didn’t see a single ARMY. also, EXO make great music but they still need to apologise for the things they’ve said to avoid this sort of backlash<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pjmidle it was either Wembley or BH who did the Forever Young thing at London. fan projects are rarely supported outside of ARMY so I’m not surprised they didn’t do the same thing in France (and I don’t think they knew that French ARMYs planned forever young)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjmidle I think the plan was to sing in between the performances, which apparently did actually happen (although I haven’t seen videos of it??)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dont_needa_name @MermaidBangtan @crackbtsheads @vantesari still slightly questionable since he should’ve probably known that braids in general just... aren’t for him 🤧 but at least it was like a one time only thing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dihaechan @stanlistBTS @LamisDelka I sort of agree, accusing other groups of plagiarism with 0 research makes BTS stans just as bad 🤡 but it’s usually BTS getting accused of plagiarism and when other groups do something that could have been stolen, everyone stays quiet :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gidlefriend @vantesari that’s fucking funny though shdhfjfjjfjf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vantesari they did some cultural appropriation stuff recently and I’m not really into their concepts / music anymore. I support them a little but I definitely don’t stan anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dihaechan @stanlistBTS @LamisDelka yes. people are always naming kpop groups as “the next BTS”. there is no next BTS, and I feel bad for groups like NCT that can’t be appreciated without being compared to BTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@letgojk @BTS_twt that high kick was iconic, she already knows all the movements! she should be more confident in herself, she could easily become the 8th member of BTS 💜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petalpjimbles if you can’t bring anyone else then maybe offer it to someone outside the venue? I saw a couple of people outside yesterday just before the concert started, so they might have no gotten tickets or bought fakes accidentally. you might make a new friend :))<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petalpjimbles try bringing a family member maybe? my friends cancelled on me a few days before the concert so I just brought my mom and another friend! don’t sell your ticket since this concert is for YOU, not the friend!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryASprague1 @VictoriaLIVE @BarbaraNtumy @Abortion_Rights men have been on women’s hour and discuss men’s issues and that happens regularly. also, “bring about its downfall” is a little over dramatic. just watch a different news channel if you don’t like the BBC. not hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jooniehxney ur not the only one :/ but don’t feel too self conscious since you look FINE and everyone will be looking at BTS so one spot won’t matter!! ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Park_Dimineee he’s too babie to be intimidating 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryASprague1 @VictoriaLIVE @BarbaraNtumy @Abortion_Rights women’s hour also discusses men’s issues though 😂 and again, I’m NOT defending this. there should have been a good counter argument to prevent the show from being one sided. but I think calling it propaganda is a bit of a stretch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jumpsuitsummer @kyokashii man-guh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryASprague1 @VictoriaLIVE @BarbaraNtumy @Abortion_Rights yes, there should have been an alternative argument. but it’s not as extreme as propaganda. also I’m not sure why you’re branding me as a “man hater” when this conversation suggests nothing of the sort? you seem childish.<|endoftext|>

I know that biological men have an advantage. but that advantage is also lessened by hormone therapy, the same way a female to male transitioner can do well against men thanks to hormone injections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkorpi @LiamDan36816827 @MoonMam45435991 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal and yet I am a woman and I don’t feel at all threatened by people getting the right to do not be discriminated against. the law does not directly affect sports in any way. people deserve their rights, John<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkorpi @LiamDan36816827 @MoonMam45435991 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal yes, you’re right, except male-to-female transitioners take hormones to change some aspects of their body &amp; reduce testosterone levels. That reduces the advantage significantly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiamDan36816827 @johnkorpi @MoonMam45435991 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal perhaps, but variations in things like bone density already exist within the female population. I wouldn’t think it would add any disadvantages that sportswomen already have just because of normal variation in women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkorpi @LiamDan36816827 @MoonMam45435991 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal I have seen it and I have educated myself. I didn’t say that people won’t be put at a disadvantage, but I said i don’t think it would be a significant disadvantage, particularly if it’s a male to female transitioner in female sport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiamDan36816827 @johnkorpi @MoonMam45435991 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal not necessarily. trans people take hormones in order to influence their appearance, voice etc. during their transition.

<|startoftext|>@Henriatta11 @NcPennywise @phatman__scoop @CNN the meaning of marriage isn’t important. I believe that everyone should be allowed to get married. a Christian marriage may be deemed inappropriate for an LGBT couple depending on your outlook, but marriage isn’t necessarily linked to religious belief anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NcPennywise @Henriatta11 @phatman__scoop @CNN you’re just trying to over complicate things to convince yourself that you have the right to control other people’s lives. you’re also assuming that every gay couple are sodomites, which isn’t the case at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkorpi @MoonMam45435991 @LiamDan36816827 @MikeHun43153477 @LambdaLegal giving a minority their rights isn’t anti-anything. it’s democracy and equality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NcPennywise @Henriatta11 @phatman__scoop @CNN it’s a declaration of love between two unrelated, consenting adults. that’s the meaning of marriage. gender shouldn’t matter, people can’t choose who they want to marry. love isn’t a choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carissa_owl6 oh well, I’m sure you did great anyways 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NcPennywise @Henriatta11 @phatman__scoop @CNN are you genuinely comparing incest to gay marriage??? seriously, just let people live. being gay should not be an issue in 2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmmmjoon @ThemTatas @NaegaFox @joonie_culture as you should 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheReturning1 @BernieSanders also, those statistics don’t take many things into account. in places where abortion is legalised, the majority are performed chemically within very early stages of pregnancy. the rest of the stats are virtually meaningless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheReturning1 @Sita5000 @BernieSanders and? there’s still so many other circumstances in which it would not be safe or appropriate for a woman to raise a child or even go through with the 9 months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamvander007 @illusions017 @akkitwts @HillaryClinton getting rid of what could be undeniably a human life is a bad thing but until there is more support for women during and after pregnancy and a better adoption system then abortion needs to remain legal to avoid serious consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamvander007 @illusions017 @akkitwts @HillaryClinton rape may only make up a small percentage, but there are a myriad of other issues women face that would put themselves and a baby at risk. women you know and respect may well have had abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smar04 @amdahwd69 @HillaryClinton so she won’t have to see rapists pass on their genes successfully? so she won’t have to see women die from illegal abortions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smar04 @amdahwd69 @HillaryClinton so she won’t have to watch scandals about doctors not helping women having miscarriages because of fear they’ll  be accused of assisting abortions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdahwd69 @HillaryClinton try the UK, our weather isn’t the best but we have free healthcare &amp; legalised abortion ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamvander007 @illusions017 @akkitwts @HillaryClinton difference is, an abortion doesn’t affect an actual PERSON now does it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheReturning1 @BernieSanders I’m pretty sure the most vulnerable humans are actually victims of rape, domestic abuse and pregnant teens (which have functioning organs, a brain, memories and relationships)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jvk73114637 @jayk190405 @itatchis I partly agree. but many people seem to be letting Kai off the hook here when he needs to be educated, it’s annoying that rather than educating their idol they’re just dragging BTS into things<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@613heaven @jeonmidoriya @snidget2 they did. not as significantly as BlackPink or BTS, but many people were drawn to kpop since they stumbled across girl’s generation (and other groups like 2NE1).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blinkyoarea1 @markookjn she needs to learn. you can’t let things like this slide even if they’re your favourite idol(s). if she admits her mistake and apologises then she’ll have no more issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ag56340112 @AliaSyafiqa90 @6110kjn @markookjn they weren’t forced to wear the braids though &amp; an interviewer asked them if they thought it would offend people. they just said “she’ll kill it”. they need to apologise either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beamhoya @snidget2 it is though, girl’s generation actually make good music. I don’t think the OP was really trying to attack anybody so no need to be disrespectful 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeonmidoriya @snidget2 girl’s generation paved the way for next gen girlgroups &amp; they managed to break into western music as well. don’t be disrespectful when the OP wasn’t in the first place, ARMY has to put up with enough fanwars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilioherce BTS fans are just tired of people attacking the group for things that other western groups have gotten away with for years. the only reason BTS are discredited is because they’re not white. have a nice day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gt500cws @JonSears14 @UN and again, I’m not saying everyone should be allowed in. it shouldn’t be a free for all. I think people should be educated and shown what options they have and places they can go — that way, they can choose to be sent back or try their luck elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gt500cws @JonSears14 @UN that’s my point. people from Syria are fleeing civil unrest which erupted into violence and has killed many people. I think it’s unfair to see people seeking help and just sending them back to their deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gt500cws @JonSears14 @UN I think it’s unfair to assume that all asylum seekers aren’t running from war. many of them were regular middle class citizens but civil unrest has put their lives at risk. countries shouldn’t be required to house them, but they need to be moved on somehow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gt500cws @JonSears14 @UN that’s true. but again, there needs to be a different option than just sending them back. many of them don’t understand the law or the process of getting a visa, causing a large amount of illegal immigrants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kazeninaritai88 @btsoutsoldyall nah you sit at the cool kids table now 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonSears14 @gt500cws @UN also, the system you have to go through to get a visa needs to be more transparent. it would help to ensure that illegal immigrant numbers drop and people understand what they need to visit / stay in a country legally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonSears14 @gt500cws @UN I 100% agree. however, the government really has to implement that. at the moment, countries are just turning everyone away. asylum seekers should be allowed at least a short stay while they’re background checked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanteintro I’m from London, close enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gt500cws @JonSears14 @UN lower qualified migrants take jobs that need doing e.g. janitorial work. better qualified people take jobs as nurses and doctors. a more open and diverse society makes a country look good. I could go on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@controtweet @WHO @WHOAFRO @pahowho @WHO_Europe @WHOEMRO @WHOSEARO @WHOWPRO @DrTedros the cause of this is people travelling to other countries and bringing back the illness and spreading it because people aren’t vaccinating their kids.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@themadman90 @antoniodelotero but it will never achieve 50% effectiveness. a better plan would be to make it easier to figure out how to get a proper visa to reduce the amount of illegal immigrants, and increase border patrols. more jobs + less illegals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jake_palmiscno @Fight2SaveMOACA @zainabnc and which source did you get that figure from? many different websites state many different figures for how much illegal immigrants cost. at this point, figures like that can’t be used correctly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RolfeIt @allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc yes I do. I’m just pointing out the flaws in your point - that although some tests have been carried out on reaction time, there’s no real evidence that this directly affects gaming skill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwoGiow @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc that’s true. the studies haven’t been taken very far though, and haven’t been applied to gaming. it’s an important point, but also has its flaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bombagetti @100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc yeah, you’re right. there definitely could be a lot more women climbing the ranks though, it’s sort of sad to see female gamers never take gaming to the next level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vgman94 @NoBop2000 @ISpeak4Me_HBU @MarzooqIsBack @zodiacninjazz @SlawterFly @darrienjw @Mr_Evertson @tictoc you clearly don’t know enough women lmaooo. y’all really think we just talk about Ariana Grande? sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keegsthesavage @allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc that’s true. I don’t agree with the original video that sexism is all it’s down to. it would be really awesome to see more female professional gamers though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KernelCoconuts @100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc not necessarily because women aren’t as capable though. there are still some women who make it to high ranks. it’s just that not enough women attempt to make it to high levels in competitive gaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pikipie @allenpurp @100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc lmao he blocked me too. I guess he realised he was wrong 🤦🏻‍♀️ tragic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bombagetti @100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc never said it was lol. I was just providing a reason behind the lack of women in professional gaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RolfeIt @allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc and yet women still compete just as well as men in esports, suggesting that reaction times aren’t largely varied / can improve with further stimulation. thanks for actually showing genuine facts though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin I’m so sorry Kathy. my grandma is the same at the moment too. it almost makes me not want to see her since her dementia has changed almost everything about her. I hope you can push through these hard times and I wish you well ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keegsthesavage @allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc I’m just saying it’s not because they aren’t as good lmao. clearly there are women who have done well in professional gaming, but not many women choose to make it that far. not because they aren’t as good but because they just... choose not to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leoless5 @100TEsports @TateOrtena @tictoc that’s sort of what I mean. women surely have the ability to progress to professional gaming, but since the career is male dominated, they often choose not to. idk, as a woman I see many others who feel like that 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allenpurp @Pikipie @100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc I looked it up and found nothing that supports your theory. women and men’s brains function differently, but there’s no solid evidence that men are better than women at skills needed for gaming. and anyways, men and women compete at the same level in esports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc you have to prove yourself right first. I bet you haven’t even watched any female pro gamers play before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@epi9ine @TateOrtena @allenpurp @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc yes, guys function better in regular sports and exercise. but men and women have the exact same skill levels in hand-eye coordination. neither gender is naturally better than the other in videogames, that’s just facts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nN_Dota @DerekLandy the way Saracen doesn’t know absolutely everything relates to a writer’s process: having a rough idea of where the story is heading but nothing is definite until it’s written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nN_Dota @DerekLandy I think the reason that Derek said that Saracen was “borrowing” his true name was just another suggestion that he IS Saracen. once again, it would make sense since Saracen admitted he “knows things” but “not everything”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoBop2000 @MarzooqIsBack @zodiacninjazz @SlawterFly @darrienjw @vgman94 @Mr_Evertson @tictoc that’s what I’m saying, that people shouldn’t start whining about what people say to them in games because everyone gets shit every now and then. I’m sorry you’re attacked for being NB though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allenpurp @TateOrtena @100TEsports @Leoless5 @tictoc biology counts when you’re talking about muscle mass and ability in sports. there’s literally no difference in hand - eye coordination between men and women. women are just as good as men in videogames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100TEsports @TateOrtena @Leoless5 @tictoc I think many women don’t make it to esport levels because they’re aren’t many other women around that they can relate to 🤷🏻‍♀️ they should brush it off and keep going of course, but it’s tough when you’re surrounded by mostly guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoBop2000 @MarzooqIsBack @zodiacninjazz @SlawterFly @darrienjw @vgman94 @Mr_Evertson @tictoc but women do experience a different kind of toxicity. guys will jab at each other for their gaming skills but women face sexist remarks. still, you’re right, it’s always better to brush it off and ignore any dickheads in game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GamergirlUprise @MsDayglo @IAmMardikins @thedeyfamily @IrishTimes @boclondon giving the child to another person may cause legal issues since surrogacy is illegal in many places and you may be accused of it. also, what about women with health problems that may die during childbirth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GamergirlUprise @MsDayglo @IAmMardikins @thedeyfamily @IrishTimes @boclondon you’re not taking into account the mother’s situation. she may not be able to look after a child (e.g. too poor) and the adoption system is already over full. anyway, in this day and age, you can’t stop people from having sex.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenHolloway79 @TwistedCM @Jydemanworld @JonSears14 @UN migrants aren’t JUST coming to the UK. and it doesn’t take a whole lot of research to find that the countries that these people are coming from are devastated by war. it’s either they die or they go to another country, there’s no other option for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philto @angiebUK @lbcbreaking and your point is? migrants take jobs that need doing and they’re grateful for what they have. they’re just looking for a better life, why is that such a huge problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHolloway79 @TwistedCM @Jydemanworld @JonSears14 @UN they’re not “fleeing from France”. they have travelled through France and are now attempting to reach the UK across the channel. that’s an easy misunderstanding for you to make, they really are fleeing from war and death though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael76851525 @angiebUK @lbcbreaking if you’re so worried about not understanding their language, download duolingo and start a course. there’s more than just the English language, get used to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael76851525 @angiebUK @lbcbreaking if by benefits you mean the government funded benefit system - benefits are only given to those who desperately need it and even then they’re extremely difficult to get. you have a very warped view of places like England with many migrants.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TwistedCM @Jydemanworld @BenHolloway79 @JonSears14 @UN Migrants aren’t “on the streets begging for money”, they’re busy earning their keep and living a better quality of life. The migrants on boats are fleeing war and death and they deserve to be helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jydemanworld @TwistedCM @BenHolloway79 @JonSears14 @UN Well, the UK is supposed to be leaving the EU so it doesn’t really fall under the EU’s decisions anymore... too much strain has been placed on EU countries since places like the US are too unwilling to do their part and help them too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelmarCPA @angiebUK @lbcbreaking My evidence is that I much prefer being in a schooling and working environment with many cultures present and represented, and I’ve seen how migrants take jobs like nursing that I can benefit immensely from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael76851525 @angiebUK @lbcbreaking And how do you know this?

<|startoftext|>@jcrowder55 @UN but many people fled from those countries during wars. many children in WW1 and 2 fled abroad or away from their homes &amp; families. that’s essentially what migrant families are doing too. we don’t need to provide for them - just allow them to live<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HughFreeman14 @UN nobody is being silenced and people are being welcomed into the countries they want to build their futures in. it’s far from “a dictatorship”. it’s called democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonSears14 @UN no, they’re not. countries like England who have taken in large amounts of migrants have seen amazing benefits from it in the long run. you shouldn’t generalise the rest of the world just because you’ve been told it’s dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcrowder55 @UN many migrants are families fleeing war or extreme poverty in their countries. it’s good to fight for your country but not when you and your children are in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryPatman1 did you ever do biology at school? at all? the last ice age was caused by natural fluctuations in the earths temperature. now we’re in a period of warming, but human’s impact is making this process worse. there’s so much evidence to global warming.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kate___Travers I don’t think you necessarily need to print it out as long as you have the email and barcode as proof of purchase. but to print the ticket, you just need any printer that can connect to your computer, so you could use a library printer and computer if you don’t have one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseKal123 @HollieCulham there are many ticket resellers owned by the O2. ticketmaster is a reseller. so ticketmaster, viagogo, AXS, and the O2 are all at fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shonajimin @BTS_twt @BigHitEnt technically they’re not the fastest sold because a huge amount of those tickets went to resellers 😂😭literally 1000-2000 tickets still up for resale it’s tragic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leoliee_ tickets are often freed up last minute before concerts, either people can’t come or the space that was saved for stage setup can be given to the public. I would recommend just waiting it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeartuShook they might not be at Heathrow, and the airports are sorta far away so nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbialicia the problem is, many resellers don’t actually use bots and just make a ton of fake accounts to get tickets...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HirenShah096 @demonlord221b it’s just an estimate, but I would say about 15,000 or more tickets didn’t go to genuine fans. there are 40,000 seats in the O2. all of the tickets that didn’t go to fans are being resold, for prices literally over £56,000 each in some cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTS are going to have empty VIP and standing areas in the arena because resold tickets won’t match the new owner’s ID and security won’t let anyone in.  We need justice #BTSLONDON #BTS3rdday @BigHitEnt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeraLou1 @TheO2 Ticketmaster, AXS and Viagogo are all resale sites that increase the face value of tickets to make profit.  Viagogo is even facing legal issues with the government because they’re not transparent with prices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeraLou1 @TheO2 it is sort of their fault. they willingly sold all the tickets to resell companies when they could’ve sold them directly through their website.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fattts95 @bangtansilan maybe they wanted to be closer to the crowd? like the smaller the arena is, the more that you can interact with the crowd properly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jackcomebachh meeee, @crackedphonecase is my instagram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taebaeno_1 @BTS_twt @BigHitEnt @bts_bighit they were sold more than 1 minute early, which meant that all the bots got in first before ARMYs even knew what was happening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@euigeoguks and keep checking ticket sites and the official O2 sites, because they might take tickets back from illegal resellers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF YOU STILL NEED TICKETS: -&gt; wait for resellers to get desperate and drop the price  -&gt; keep checking the O2 website &amp; the ticket websites  -&gt; more tickets will most likely be available closer to the concert date  -&gt; pray for #BTS3rdDay  #BTSLONDON #AddNewDateO2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF YOU’RE GOING TO BUY RESALE TICKETS, DO IT THROUGH STUBHUB!  StubHub are an official resale site.

<|startoftext|>@JoanneGhazaleh Viagogo is currently in court for selling tickets for super high prices, so that probably means that other ticket sellers will be attacked for their prices too. 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_T_S_A1R4M3Y @KiraEdwards24 @KiahLauris has been planning a meetup with ARMYs that didn’t get tickets, you should see if you can come lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jiminmicdropx flying to Korea is cheaper than buying tickets at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaPoderico it wasn’t “newbie ARMYs” that stole the tickets, it was non-ARMYs who wanted to make profit from resale. every ARMY deserves tickets whether they’re new or not<|endoftext|>
