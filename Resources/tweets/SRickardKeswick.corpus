<|startoftext|>@OMPMH @johncusack Ahhhh. Ewww. Well then. This Canadian does not negotiate on a woman’s choice. Screw him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncusack I never watch American news. As a Canadian, I’m fairly impartial. I thought Rick had a lot going on to mitigate and handled it pretty well. They were coming at him a lot and his defensive behavior seemed only natural. Don’t agree with much that he had to say, but he did well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophielui Bawling! This is so extraordinarily beautiful and amazing. Peace and unity at last. They can rebuild what Obama created and what has been torn apart in the last 4 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSocialCTV I just made a lot of noise and walked around loudly until he woke up. Then as I was pouring myself a celebratory glass of wine, I was like, “oh hey! Get this? Trump has Covid!” (All while trying to hide my glee).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just give it a rest, man. Give your thumbs a break and go have a nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is implying Corona virus makes you feel better than you did 20 years ago. Wut? Guys, maybe Covid attacks your weakest area- in his case, his brain. #trump #TrumpCovidHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton What Chrissy and John have done for people all around the world that have lost a baby is incredible. To share that kind of pain is the most vulnerable and honest thing anyone can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh sweet lord. I just saw the parade. What in the what? #TrumpCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. What is happening here? Why is Trump in a suit video messaging the world  thanking soldiers? Just go rest and shut up, man. #TrumpCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everywhereist Wow. Absolutely terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen My heart breaks for you, Chrissy. I am truly so sorry. I know this pain. No one deserves it. Sending you all love. Take your time, be gentle, reach out, hide away, feel it all. You are so loved baby Jack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikeggibbs 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
