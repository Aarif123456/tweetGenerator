<|startoftext|>@TaylorLWrites The ridicule comes not for having the opinion but if the criticism becomes incessant.  It‚Äôs annoying if the purpose of the gathering is to enjoy that thing. It‚Äôs party pooping if you‚Äôre primarily cutting it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulRMQ In other words if you‚Äôre a Debbie downer you‚Äôre asking to be ridiculed. Also if the odd person takes a leak in the pool it‚Äôs not really that disruptive but if a lot of people are pissing in it continually they‚Äôre gonna get grief. That‚Äôs fair. Leave the pool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulRMQ Within a gathering of ‚ÄúFANS‚Äù however it‚Äôs just common courtesy that those who dislike a huge part of the thing  be less vocal &amp; give the floor to those who do like it. Otherwise expect to be frowned on for booing in the clubhouse. Fairly, the ‚Äúhater‚Äôs‚Äù opinion is worth less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NerdRage42 Interesting. It‚Äôs just hard to believe that a film with an audience rating that low brought in a 1/2 a billion in 4 days AND is showing no signs of slowing.<|endoftext|>
