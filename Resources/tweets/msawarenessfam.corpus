<|startoftext|>@Trump2020Vote4 No, no he won't. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th. Trump knows this, so does everyone around him. He's using this nonsense for political donations.  If you truly believe what you said, you're going to be very upset Jan 20th when Trump is no longer president.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waleceigel @onlytruthhere @gopcaleb Yes, yes he can. Read the details on donations. Any donation under 5 thousand he can use on whatever he wants.  Look for yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waleceigel @onlytruthhere @gopcaleb Actually, it is. Read the fine print. Any donation under 5k goes directly to Trump's pac with no restrictions on how it's spent: meaning it goes into his pocket.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@worldofjimjim @dright247 @DeanBrowningPA I see you get all your information from TrumpTV 🤦‍♀️  You have no idea what you're talking about 😂 hilarious. Proving once again why Trump loved the poorly educated.  Conversation over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnVierra3 @MrMichaelBurkes Actually, they denied both. The two dissents said they believed it should be heard BUT that they wouldn't have ruled in Texas's favor even if they had heard it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMichaelBurkes 😂😂😂😂😂  This case had no chance from the beginning. It's complete BS. Democracy won today.  Trump is fired, Biden will be sworn in on January 20th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldofjimjim @DeanBrowningPA We are not Venezuela 🤦‍♀️ and America is not going full socialist, that's scare tactic bs. We will however actually help our citizens and stop catering to the top 1% as we have the last 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldofjimjim @dright247 @DeanBrowningPA You just drink up everything Trump says huh? Sad.  Biden will be president for at least 4 years. The fact you're talking about Biden like that when he's only 4yrs older than 45 and in FAR FAR better shape. And if something were to happen to Biden, I welcome a President Harris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldofjimjim @DeanBrowningPA 😂😂😂😂😂 Socialism lmao. You do realize that firehouses, public schools, hospitals and so much more is "socialist" right? 🙄  We are the wealthiest nation on earth, we should provide MORE for our citizens than nations that have less than us but still do for their people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldofjimjim @DeanBrowningPA You're 100% wrong. Trump is gaslighting his supporters so they will continue to donate to him, anything less than 5k goes right in his pocket.  The courts can see this election was fair and Biden won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanBrowningPA No, actually, they proved that we are still a Constitutional Republic and our votes matter, they proved that one man can not try to sue his way into winning the presidential election.  It. Is. Over.  Biden won, Trump lost<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz No, what's unamerican is refusing to admit that Trump lost and instead continuing on with this nonsense that it was rigged. It wasn't. If it was, we'd certainly have gotten rid of #MoscowMitchMcTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz It shouldn't even take a SCOTUS ruling to see that Biden won. Every state has said over and over there was no fraud but 45 supporters continue to believe the liar-in-chief. It's insane.  Maybe you'd understand if we'd have done the same in 2016, but we didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz These baseless lawsuits and this BS from Texas is trying to undo the will of the people! That's EXACTLY what that is, to invalidate legitimate votes because he lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PauloG25 @scruffster1 @drewKanyeJudah @theangiestanton Clearly I am if you don't understand the fact that that is now IMPOSSIBLE because ballots have been separated from the envelopes that had the signature. 😂😂😂😂  Educate yourself plz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PauloG25 @scruffster1 @drewKanyeJudah @theangiestanton They have counted and recounted. Biden won fairly. Clearly you don't understand how the process works in most states or you'd understand why it's too late to verify ballots 🤦‍♀️  Many states do NOT have the name of the voter on the ballot, including here in Ohio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz Oh it definitely will cause complete chaos if they steal the election and give it to 45! Of course! The vote was held and TRUMP LOST! So yes, there will be hell if they try to steal that from us after enduring 4 years of hell under the orange dipsh*t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz And I strongly disagree since you feel the need to say our votes don't count and only yours do. How truly unamerican. And yes, we were upset because we saw what was coming....and we were right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdBigCon @gatewaypundit Complete BS!  You can not say that if your team lost then it must be fraudulent!!!! That's not how America works!  America decided and we chose BIDEN!!!!  MAY TRUMP ROT IN HELL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciaal @realDonaldTrump If they were to overturn the will of the people to have Biden, as we elected in a fair election, it will cause a civil war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianWalk1r Showing ALLLLLL your ignorance in this video 😂😂😂😂😂   You do know he wouldn't even shake your hand right? 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz I'm not worried at all. It's comical to watch all the MAGAs cry and whine because they lost fair and square.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTrumpFanKJV God is certainly not on Trump's side. He is EVERYTHING God says NOT to be, and if God chose Trump in 2016 then it was GOD who chose Biden in 2020!  It's over. Biden won. Trump lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scruffster1 @drewKanyeJudah @theangiestanton They will, it's baseless claims and rumors from a sad man who lost an election.  Biden won, it's over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EitanaP @theangiestanton @OhioAG @OhioAG  please don't. If you do your reputation will be scarred forever.   BIDEN WON, ITS OVER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephAriola7 @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump But it is 🤷‍♀️   Biden has FAR more support but we are smart enough to not put our lives on the line to go to a rally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatewaypundit @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump Another Covid super spreader event 🤦‍♀️   Wonder what they'll be yelling when they have killed a loved one so they could go hear a con man lie to them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen88398154 @MrXXplosive @seanhannity @tedcruz Biden did win fairly, and that's why today was the 50th case dismissed. There WAS NO fraud that would change the fact that BIDEN WON.  It is over. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleGirl1028 @seanhannity @tedcruz Actually, you're wrong. They denied both. Read the paper. Part of what they denied was hearing the case at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4boymommi @ChristianWalk1r 😂😂😂😂😂😂   No tf he doesn't. Trump has been FIRED. He is out on January 20th and there is nothing he or his cult can do to change that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianWalk1r I'll be back for your snowflake tears when they deny that case as well since it's complete BS made of fabricated rumors and not any facts whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theangiestanton And it will be denied just like the case was denied today.   Sorry but Trump can not steal this election from the people. We spoke, and we elected JOE BIDEN not 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂   How pathetic. You KNOW Biden won and 45 lost. Get over it.   This case will be denied too since there was #NoElectionFraud<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DjgGerhart @fern_wildflower This is his 15 year old granddaughter kissing his cheek.  There are pics that look like 45 is kissing on the mouth when it's not.   I'm open to anything information and yes I'm a democrat but most of us stand up when someone does something horrible, regardless of party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@comradebrandee @DjgGerhart @fern_wildflower It's not really an epic response lol. 🙄  The one is his 15yr old granddaughter kissing his cheek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ant0medina Absolutely! That's unacceptable what's happening and my heart goes out to you and everyone that they've basically murdered. I'd get a lawyer. I'm sure there has to be one willing to take the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjgGerhart @fern_wildflower Okay I'm not a fan of those at all, and will certainly do some research on the context of them, but definitely not cool. I will say though that Trump has paid multiple settlements to multiple parents for molesting/raping kids. Boys and girls, not to mention the 20+ rapes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guarantee you if America had done a monthly check, like other nations that haven't been hit as hard, we wouldn't have a spike in crimes!!! People do things they never thought they would when they are desperate, when their children are starving, when they are facing homelessness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/2 I see people complaining about the rise in crimes this year and it's astonishing to me that they fail to mention that America has left those most vulnerable to flail in the wind! People are suffering and have NO money, so of course crimes will go up!  #StimulusChecksNOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@obviouspropaga2 @BrianKempGA I don't, but our votes do and Trump lost by more than 7 million votes. He's 1-41 in court cases. He knows he lost, and so does anyone paying attention. He's just continuing his claims so he can keep making money off his cult. Any donation less than 5K goes into his pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikhk47 @danahigbee @VeritasSola @BrianKempGA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  No, no they didn't. There was no fraud or anything like that. That's why all his lawsuits but one have been thrown out of court, some by judges he appointed!  This is all a scam to get more money<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@obviouspropaga2 @BrianKempGA It's done. Trump lost. It's over. Biden will be sworn in on Jan 20th no matter how much crying or threatening his cult does.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TriaRyder @LifeWithoutLack @Barnes_Law @BrianKempGA @GaSecofState @realDonaldTrump Oh it's happening. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th and there isn't a damn thing Trump or his cult can do about it but cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnes_Law @BrianKempGA @GaSecofState @realDonaldTrump If it's so rigged, then why even vote in January? Seems pointless to me if it's already rigged. Why waste your time. Just #boycottGArunoff and teach em a lesson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKempGA So if this election was so rigged , why even vote on January 5th?  Probably should just #boycottGArunoff 🤷‍♀️ it's rigged anyway right? Why waste your time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mahyuta @webcav1 @ErrolWebber @BrianKempGA Oh I hope I remember to come back to this on the 14th when your magical dreams of another 4 years of Trump are crushed.  He's lost. It's over. No matter how much he whines and cries....it's over. @JoeBiden IS our President-Elect. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErrolWebber @BrianKempGA You clearly don't even understand how GA voting works 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Unbelievable 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrianKempGA Stay strong sir! We may disagree on a LOT but I'm proud to see a republican refusing to bow to Trump.

<|startoftext|>@battletested5 Facts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bubblebathgirl Because he knows like the rest of America that this is BS. There no truth to the claims, that's why Trump is now 1-41 in court cases about the election.  He's conning his supporters so they'll continue to donate to him, and any donation under $5k he can use as he likes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GJL2012 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @dbongino @charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr My comment was peaceful. I 🤣 and said my opinion on it. May not be kind but that's because we are watching 1/3 of our country be lied to by 45 while he knowingly spreads false conspiracy theories as an excuse for his loss. He did the same thing in 2016, till he found out he won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My honor roll student is failing because of virtual school, but we have no choice since 45 failed us and left the country to burn. I'm outraged.  We shouldn't be where we are rn.  This was preventable!!! Now these grades are on my son's school records forever. Thanks you POS 45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just my two cents on the subject..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>family line is from. As of now they don't and that's why saying black pride is not racist, they don't have an option to say "Algerian Pride"or"Egyptian Pride" or other African countries. White Americans can say "Irish Pride"or"French Pride" because they KNOW their family lineage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White pride is racist BS because we know what country our families came from, Black Americans do not and by no fault of their own. And for the idiots, Africa isn't a country....it's a continent. They deserve to have that information if they want it so they can know where their...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think our government should partner some way with Ancestry or 23andMe and offer free DNA testing for every black american. Most have been robbed of their heritage. This is why there is a HUGE difference between Black Pride and White Pride. 1/?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kimmer4444 Interesting they've linked Multiple Sclerosis. I have Multiple Sclerosis and there is no known cause or cure, so I'd really love to know how they can link MS to this. Does this mean a vaccine caused my MS?<|endoftext|>

I know my history and have seen how this works, yes they do, but 45 has gone FAR beyond any former president. He's used our tax dollars as his piggy bank, him and his disgusting family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity I'd much rather pay for that than be paying for 45 to go golfing more than 300 days, or for his children to go on lavish vacations!   He's conditioned you to think it's freebies, it's not. The wealthiest nation on earth can afford to do for it's citizens what other nations do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity History will not look kindly apon him or his enablers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity Lmfao he deserves ZERO credit for anything bedsides spreading this virus far and wide while encouraging others to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity You're either blind or just incredibly misinformed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity This was absolutely preventable, if our president had given a half a damn, but he didn't. And doesn't now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity He is racist. 100%. It's just those who are also racist don't think so because he makes it seem like it's okay, but it's not. And he is racist.  If our response was like other ind. nations, we wouldn't be here. And in June ,I believe, Jarad said 45 was in charge now, not docs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity Also, his closing didn't work. There were still over 40,000 allowed in after that AND the cases here have been linked to Europe, so that ban was pretty pointless. FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity He is racist lol. And we have more deaths per capita than any other nation! That's unacceptable. 45 failed America and allowed this virus to get out of control. Hell, he's STILL having parties with hundreds of people, unmasked and right next to each other. This is the #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!! #MoscowMitchMcTraitor  has to go! What he's done has been COMPLETELY unacceptable!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlysonMetzger You're 100% wrong and hopefully I remember to come back in 2022 to remind you how wrong you were 🤣🤣  And your party is telling their people in Georgia NOT to vote lmao! It's pretty GLORIOUS actually. Dems are going to win the two seats in Georgia and it will be Trump's fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlysonMetzger So it wasn't political malpractice to you for #MoscowMitchMcTraitor to sit on TWO bills that passed the house since MAY!?!?  GTFO 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJL2012 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  No, he hired the swamp! And on January 20th he is GONE! Thank God!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@48nylady @gammasusan @seanhannity Grandma is 100% correct. This was preventable, if 45 had taken this seriously and not called it a hoax, if he's promoted masks and social distancing, but he didn't. He instead pretended everything is normal and ignores the 270,000+ dead Americans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebonnets4U @seanhannity 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  No. No one stole the election lmao. That's why Trump is 1-41 in court cases, some by judges HE appointed! He lost fair and square and no matter how much he cries about it and lies, he's gone Jan 20th!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny Wrong. She held it up because their bill wouldn't ACTUALLY help most Americans! It helped THEM and their rich buddies. #MoscowMitchMcTraitor is to blame. 100%!

<|startoftext|>Another day with OVER 2,700 Americans DEAD from Covid.   This was preventable, remember that.

<|startoftext|>This is so f'n disgusting and selfish. Some of these assholes will have to mourn a loved one that they kill due to their negligence and conspiracy theory mentality.  It's so gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pam_sands It's awesome that they are spreading a virus that will kill people? It's awesome that some of these people will have to mourn a loved one they killed with their negligence?? No. No. That's not awesome at all, it's disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFNYC1 @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor Not patriots, idiots who don't care about anyone but themselves. Some of which will have to mourn a loved one they've killed with their negligence.  That's not patriotism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_Cats_ That's the complete opposite of patriotism. It disregard for the health and lives of your neighbors. It's selfish and irresponsible, and some of these people will now have to say goodbye to a friend or relative they've killed with their negligence.  Certainly nothing to applaud<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lisaling also, they are making the heroin crisis worse with the restrictions because people have no choice but to get relief from the street rather than a doctor as it should be.  And many lie and say they started with pain meds and that made them addicts, no. That's a cop out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaling how about a story on how pain patients are being left with nothing and treated as drug addicts because of the "opioid crisis" which is actually a heroin crisis but is mislabeled and misleading?  It's ridiculous. Join the FB group "don't punish pain" and see for yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine STOP ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO DO STUFF YOU KNOW THEY WON'T DO!!  TAKE SOME DAMN ACTION AND HELP OHIOANS!!

<|startoftext|>@marklutchman 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️  It's NOT a coup, it was a FAIR election and he LOST! It's that simple.  If there was this fraud you claim then why have all the lawsuits been thrown out? Why has Barr said there is none, why did down ballot republicans win if it was rigged! #MoscowMitch wouldn't have won!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theofili3701 @marklutchman 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Trump LOST, it's over. Biden will be sworn in January 20th and all the crying, whining and lying from 45 can't stop that 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertFKelly1 @marklutchman He already lost.....it is over. Biden won. Period.   My question is if it was so fraudulent during his administration, then why was it so much safer and trusted during the 2016 election under OBAMA!? Thought 45 was so much better...🤣🤣  Trump LOST, accept it and move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklutchman He won't be inaugurated ever again 🤣  I'll be back to see your meltdown on Jan 20th when #PresidentElectJoe takes office as our 46th president!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cheezhash @Phillip_027 @nicolebailey @Sash107 @JoeBiden And if it's someone you are against, you should educate yourself in what it means before forming an opinion. Research what something means before railing against it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheezhash @Phillip_027 @nicolebailey @Sash107 @JoeBiden Because it means to defund them and redirect the funds to others who can help them so police aren't having to handle mental health calls and basically all calls. It's too much for police to handle and it's part of why we have mental health crisis met with bullets instead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gyab_x @VOICEOFCHID It was done for decades and kept income equality in check. Now they pay less than those making poverty wages. Unacceptable.  https://t.co/FM1P6iIn3L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VOICEOFCHID For decades the tax rate was in the 70's for the extremely wealthy.....the reason is because even paying that they are still disgustingly rich! Lower income people shouldn't pay higher tax % than the wealthy.  https://t.co/5foQ3jHtzH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jiminica1 This is exactly why there is such a huge income inequality already! The filthy rich won't pay their fair share and it's gross. In no world should lower income folks pay higher percentage in taxes! #TaxTheRich #BidenHarris2020Landslide #BidenHarris2020  https://t.co/BQ3Gb73iGa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The ENTIRE reason the income inequality is so bad is because selfish a-holes like @50cent don't want to pay their fair share.  Just look at the charts below. Why in the everlasting fuck are broke folks paying more than those wiping their asses with cash!  #EatTheRich #TaxTheRich  https://t.co/sGZfjC2XZC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@50cent Go look at what the rates were back in the 50/60's.....when income equality was the closest. The entire reason people like you can wipe your ass with $100 bills is because you don't pay your fair share of the wealth. Selfish af.  https://t.co/FdocRc6SDT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasbless @BlairBrandt @Deplorable4Trum 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Trump hates you....but you'll vote for him???? That's pretty damn sad. Smh. Go ahead though and vote for your racist leader. 🤦‍♀️ And if Trump is bringing freedom back, why hasn't he done it already? He's been in office 4 damn years and only made the US a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairBrandt Definitely #Biden. Without a doubt.  And news flash, Trump is ALREADY president! Why hasn't he saved it yet??  Everyday I'm more shocked at how gullible cult45ers are. It's sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amuse @seanmdav This virus is BRAND NEW and of course it takes time to understand it. It's logical that things change in that time. If you actually listen to him and not the spin from cult45 you'd see that his instructions have changed as the information has changed.<|endoftext|>

Republicans keep flip flopping because Trump is. Not Dems fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter I don't by any means think Biden is this amazing wonderful perfect guy....not at all. But when comparing to Trump and his history, both in and out of office, Biden is by far the better choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter Yes and it was completely wrong, which he's come out saying it was wrong and he wants to fix it. That's how a leader acts. Admit fault and learn from mistakes. That's not Trump. He has NEVER taken responsibility for anything he's done. Like ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter That was def fucked up, I absolutely agree. And he's done some shit that wasn't good. Is he a fantastic option who's screaming for the changes we're fighting for? No. But he also isn't a hateful bigot piece of shit like Trump.  Your vote your choice, but 4 more of this bigot. No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FavGhostwriter @Beans1612 How do you know wtf I know???? 🙄🙄  I know Trump is openly racist and is using any black face that will be his puppet.  If you honestly think Trump's a better option then I truly feel sorry for you. That's sad af.  But do you. 🤣  Byeeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter Besides setting laws that make life harder and his dog whistles to racists has made us far less safe. I've seen it directly with my own children who never faced racial slurs until 2016 after Trump made it normal to be a disgusting human being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter Because he's basically a nazi, like Jews supporting Hitler.  Makes zero sense at all.  Dems have done a lot: civil rights, voter laws, etc!

<|startoftext|>@tap357 @dannymoshow @icecube Working with a white supremacist will be good for POC????? 🙄🙄🙄  No Trump doesn't give a slice of a damn about ANY person who's not white.

<|startoftext|>@Br3rR @FavGhostwriter Have you actually looked at Trump's adopted plan????

<|startoftext|>@melindagail1101 @NewTornadoAlley @senatemajldr Oh yes. We are taking those seats and probably more due to his actions. We know he sat on a bill since May then went on vacation.

<|startoftext|>@thebias_news Because he's refused to take a test before being on stage for an hour, indoors, without masks. The only reasons for that is he's scared to debate or #LindseyGrahamHasCovid and doesn't want to disclose that because then they can't shove through their SCOTUS vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC No. This isn't going to work as your excuse. #LindseyGrahamHasCovid otherwise he'd have no problem taking a Covid test.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I've been on steroids multiple times for my medical condition and it makes you manic.  You are CLEARLY manic right now.   Your staff should NOT be allowing you anywhere near your phone!   Completely unacceptable. I'm so disgusted.  #ShameOnTrump #COVID19 #SteroidMania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7/7 *He just responded. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE OUTRAGED AND THE FBI IS NOT HIS!  It is 9:30pm and this is his first acknowledgement of it at all. #DomesticTerrorists #GovernorWhitmer #Terrorism #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5/7 This should be completely unacceptable to every single American!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4/7 Here's the extra shocking part, we have heard nothing about this from the president or from the attorney general! Trump called for people to be arrested today, but it was Obama and vice President Biden. Not a single fucking word about plot towards the governor of Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3/7 Two of these men have been identified as being at the armed protest in the capital to pressure her to open Michigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/7 This wasn't just random talk. These people were making plans to murder the gov and incite a civil war in the US. They had bought supplies, a taser to aid in their abduction, blew up an explosive to test for use on police. They had trained, and had had surveyed her home 2x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/7  So that you all understand what happened, today 13 domestic terrorists were arrested for planning to abduct and murder the governor of Michigan and her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's very telling imo that we have NOT heard anything about negative test results from #BillBarr or #RudyGiuliani . My guess is they both are positive and have been told to keep quiet.  Also odd we haven't heard anything on the condition of #ChrisChristie  #Trump #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stepp1A @TheJusticeDept @GovWhitmer @FBI @WhiteHouse @GOP My guess is because Trump said not to and/or he's trying to hide that he has covid (since he likely does)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Those struggling, who may lose their homes from eviction or having to go to food banks, remember that TRUMP ended stimulus talks today until after the election.

<|startoftext|>@unleashthetea @realDonaldTrump Not happening 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ItsSnapCat @MaxHolt6 @CharXRenee @realDonaldTrump I never said anything about MSM or whatever, I don't watch that either. I get news from multiple sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsSnapCat @MaxHolt6 @CharXRenee @realDonaldTrump I understand your view being you're in Portland.... but understand that most of the protests have been peaceful.  Most who want the police defunded are not saying they don't want police, it's saying let's help them by funding other programs to take some pressure OFF them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsSnapCat @MaxHolt6 @CharXRenee @realDonaldTrump Clearly you've been manipulated by Fox Entertainment because the VAST majority have been peaceful AND many of the ones that got violent were outsiders coming in to cause chaos, to try to distract from the message of the protests.  You really need to get real information<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsSnapCat @MaxHolt6 @CharXRenee @realDonaldTrump Ummmmm what world are you living in??? You guys absolutely are, only you guys burn up cities over sports 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump Disgusting.......smfh.  Death cult for real. So gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsSnapCat @MaxHolt6 @CharXRenee @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Trump loves America!? That's hilarious!!!  Trump loves Trump..... period. He doesn't give a slice of a damn about his supporters! Lmao. You cult45 folks are bat shit crazy. Death cult for real!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichSweetz Also they need to find out EXACTLY when he first knew. I think he knew earlier than he is saying because the timeline isn't adding up. Insane and incredibly/criminally negligent but completely possible with him. I think it's more likely he found out Wed or Thursday morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichSweetz Completely agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasGirl4Trump It's been a few days, the time it's typically mild, so I wouldn't celebrate yet ... And I certainly think he deserves to be miserable for a few weeks and see what he has called a hoax, but I don't wish him death....to be clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichSweetz I don't know you but I vote option number two lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Islandgirlpixie @gofundme I'm sorry I can't help, I also have MS and it's not fun. I hope you get the help you need 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rozdieterich @alexplitsas I think actually it's on each person to understand what something is before criticism of it. You can't expect others to explain it if you truly care what something actually means<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyWhite54 I'm so very sorry for your loss 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rozdieterich @alexplitsas Yeah, we do want the police defunded..but again that doesn't mean to eliminate them. At all. The only ones who think that are those on the right who haven't actually tried to understand what it means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Completely delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire That pathetic photo opportunity didn't prove he's healthy at all, it actually probes the opposite since he easily could have WALKED out and waved from the lawn. It just put more lives at risk yet again and proved nothing except how narcissistic he truly is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exjon Right because comparing a man MURDERED by police AGAIN and the public upset is the same as another of his useless photo ops...🤦‍♀️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexplitsas Clearly you don't understand what defunding the police means because it does NOT mean we don't care about them or that they would be eliminated. Smh 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @CNN and seeing all these people in front of Walter Reed Hospital screaming and honking and all I can think is how FURIOUS I'd be if I were a patient there needing rest!

<|startoftext|>@DiamondandSilk Yep, I'll pray for him.....pray he has a horrific experience full of pain and agony. Not death but as close as possible without dying.  Amen  #TrumpVirus #RoseGardenMassacre  #TrumpLied200KDied #TrumpDestroysDemocracy #coronavirus #TrumpKilledAmericans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta I think after you pass on to the afterlife, you'll be pretty shocked where you end up. Everything you've said and posted is completely reverse of what the bible teaches. Yet somehow you think you're Christian!? Hilarious!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta Oh and just because it's on a meme doesn't make it true. Educate yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you're bat shit crazy lady....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta America is NOT based on Christian principals. Separation of church and state. Not to mention there are many many religions practiced here and it's part of what makes America free us the freedom of religion. Stop putting religion in politics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta Mmmmkay. You're obviously too far gone to see that you've been manipulated by false fear created by republicans. Lol. It's ridiculous. They've been saying the same stuff for decades and it hasn't happened yet. Oh and the whole pro-life thing seems to end immediately after birth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta Maybe get some new material before the next election.... you've been using the same ones now for two decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_delany1 @Acosta 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I pray you educate yourself and get your IQ in double digits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sabrina_McDa I'm confident he will end up positive too, along with other Republicans. Still 7 more days that those there could be without symptoms and be testing negative but Actually be positive with a viral load too small to pick up yet. It's coming...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine @LtGovHusted I pray he is miserable and has a long nasty recovery....amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo I just wanted to point out that in Trump's video you can see where he has an IV under his jacket. His right arm is thicker near the elbow, and that's how mine looks when I have had IV treatment for Multiple Sclerosis. Saying that to say that video was made in hospital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler I hope you end up positive, you deserve it.  This is not China's fault, this is TRUMPS FAULT for downplaying the virus and politicizing masks!!  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LexerD1986 @samstein @Susan_Hennessey I am not saying not to hire her because she has anything or any disability. I'm saying she isn't forthcoming about her health period.

<|startoftext|>@LexerD1986 @samstein @Susan_Hennessey I am disabled, I understand disability discrimination and this isn't that. She isn't honest or forthcoming at all. There is already talk of Covid being a pre-existing condition, and she should have disclosed that she had it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFallenTitan @TwitterMoments 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 he's horribly overweight, has heart issues, high cholesterol and is 74yrs old. I don't wish death on him, but I certainly think he'll have severe symptoms and he deserves just that! #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterMoments Funny they said that yet Trump had ONE thing to do today, a phone call with seniors about Covid, and he DIDN'T DO IT. He had Pence do the call.  With any hope his symptoms are getting worse 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DigiCruiter @GovMurphy He isn't asymptomatic, he HAS symptoms and has had them for days. He KNOWINGLY came even after being in contact with Hicks and knowing she was positive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joan48605822 @jenstringlegaul @FLOTUS No that's not at all true, just spin from far right folks. Democrats are not trying to make America socialist, and by the way you do realize that firemen, police, public schools, and so much more is "socialist" right??

<|startoftext|>So I got a new window a/c awhile ago and was so pissed it wasn't getting or keeping my room cool enough. I couldn't understand why it kept turning off and on.

<|startoftext|>@uxsolid @C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine 🙄🙄🙄  At the end of the day this pandemic has been an epic failure on the part of #Trump and this #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uxsolid @C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine I actually do know a lot about Japan, been there multiple times and my ex was stationed there for 4 years. They've handled this FAR better than America, and we had horrible restrictions on testing too and still do in many areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uxsolid @C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine And they still have a lower death percentage than we do....if they were worse off then they would have a higher % of death than us, and they don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uxsolid @C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine They've only tested a few less per 1 million people and much of that is because they don't have as many who are sick. The more sick people you have, the more you have that seek testing. America's response to this pandemic has been a horrible failure. History will prove it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTiscoming @Salty218 Actually they are proven to work but only if all wear one. I wear one to protect YOU and you wear one to protect OTHERS! Also this virus has a two week incubation period so while you THINK you are healthy, you may not be and could be the reason another person dies. Pretty selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine And Sweden....yeah not doing so well right now.  https://t.co/1DoKSszKb7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine Get your facts together. Japan has had less virus and death than many of our states have had! Hell Ohio has almost 100,000 cases alone!!  https://t.co/WsDgWwR3ue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine I don't buy that for one second without proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C95569157 @Keggs719 @GovMikeDeWine No, actually he isn't and I hope you live long enough to see that it's actually YOU who is on the wrong side of this. Other countries haven't politicized this virus so they've gotten control of it, unlike America which has this "my life is more important than yours" mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine And yet you waited FOREVER to mandate masks, opened Ohio WAY TOO SOON! Completely irresponsible. I feel like complete shit and IT'S YOUR FAULT! If I don't survive this thing you'll have a law suit on your hands! My family has already been instructed.  #OhioSucks #ScienceMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope people realize now how much voting MATTERS! Had everyone voted blue in Nov, we would have a Dem Senate and have raised min wage by now AND passed the Hero's Act that has been passed since MAY!!!

<|startoftext|>@niravb Sadly you're absolutely correct. I've said from the beginning that America will be hit the hardest, I wanted to be wrong, but it seems I wasn't. And it was all preventable smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohiobrt @GovMikeDeWine What leadership!? The ones not wearing one do not care one bit about his please please bs. A leader would mandate masks through the state before we are forced to shut down AGAIN!  All the progress we made was undone by opening too fast and too soon. Smh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niravb Ohio is going to be Florida in one month sadly. #DeWine started this strongly then caved to the bs, reopened way too soon and too fast, now we are skyrocketing. Sad and completely preventable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine YOU FAILED US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine CAN YOU BE A LEADER PLEASE!? Mandate masks for the state before we have to lockdown again!!!   What happened to listening to SCIENCE!??  #DewineDisappointment #MandatoryMasks #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine And yet you're still allowing contact sports to have practice in RED counties 🙄🙄  Ohio is so screwed .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myshelbrona @GovMikeDeWine Completely agree, these anti science morons don't care one bit about being"asked" anything. A mandate is absolutely necessary or we will be Florida in a few short weeks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mark my words, opening now is WAY TOO SOON!   I get people need things but you don't eat a raw chicken just because you're hungry....you wait for it to COOK!

<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine Thank you, and please consider pushing back the reopening until at least mid May. If relaxed on the1st , much of the progress that's been made will be undone. This is literally life or death for so many of us, young and old. Please reconsider sir. Our lives are in your hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan @CDCgov Absolutely<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan are they are doing anything for the disabled/elderly on SSI who spent their money trying to prepare for this and keep ourselves safe? I couldn't pay bills because I had to purchase supplies and I'm not alone!  #CoronavirusPandemic #disabled #HelpUsToo #WeMatter #Help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeDeWine Please lock down Ohio! People are NOT listening, they are still out everywhere acting like everything is fine.  Also, Lucas County has stopped testing the public, THIS IS NOT OK!  I'm #HighRiskCovid19 and if I get this it will NOT be good. Please, close the state and test!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnaCabrera if @VP is getting tested today, why in the hell is he on stage with all those people!?!?    Their actions are why others aren't being responsible about it!  #Covid_19 #CNN #StayAtHome #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hoccomoccoLA @AprilDRyan I agree, and trust me I was PISSED election night 2016. He's definitely the #WorstPresidentInHistory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichellePoulos1 @AprilDRyan You're right, but the problem is people aren't listening. Also, the first Ohio death was 3 miles from me yet Lucas County will no longer test the public die to lack of supplies......that's insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deborahgtv1 It's awful. The first #Covid_19 death of Ohio was in Maumee, and they've stopped testing the public here because they don't have the supplies. Only Healthcare workers and those basically dying.... Terrifying honestly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chill93til @weiss_melissa @AprilDRyan I absolutely agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable.....how anyone can approve of his response is insane! HE CAUSED THIS BY HIS REFUSAL OF TESTS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotty2971 So very sorry for your loss 🙏💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizzbeth5301 @AliceRiversong @AprilDRyan Absolutely agree. This is his fault. Honestly if anything happens to me I'd like my family to see about a lawsuit against the government and Trump for negligence. Not sure they could but I've encouraged them to try if I die from this at some point. It could have all been stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weiss_melissa @AprilDRyan I definitely am! I've been on my own lockdown for about a week here. Praying for everyone who's high risk and so scared for my mother and sister 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheaterssuck91 @AprilDRyan It's very scary. Stay safe 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan Honestly every death lies on the lap of Trump. They knew since January!! I am #HighRisk , I'm terrified and furious. Plenty of time to plan the response, this could have been prevented. The lives of the vulnerable matter! We deserve to live just as everyone else does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CPinx @dandiemann @AprilDRyan They have. They've known for months! We shouldn't be where we are now. This  could have been avoided completely if we had proper leadership. Praying for your daughter and MIL.....and all others #HighRiskCovid19  My mother, sister and I all have MS. I also have Lupus. Terrified<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dandiemann @AprilDRyan It's sad but I agree, possibly even higher at this point. I think America will be the hardest hit country because of the poor planning and response. They knew since January 3rd. No excuse for us to be where we are. None.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blu_joon @AprilDRyan That's terrible. We don't stand a chance of getting a handle on this without appropriate testing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan We just had the first suspected death in my county, waiting for his test, and they still have stopped all public testing due to low supplies. They are only testing Healthcare workers, even with the first coronavirus death being about 3 miles from me 😭  I just want to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dandiemann @AprilDRyan I'm definitely glad, but it's not ramping up everywhere. I am absolutely positive this thing is everywhere by now. We just had out first death in Ohio presumably from #Covid_19 , waiting for test. Even with this they are no longer testing the public in my area, and he died here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan Terrified. I am high risk, so is my mother and my twin sister. My county has COMPLETELY stopped testing the public. Only Healthcare workers from now on. We have no idea how many in Lucas county Ohio have #Covid_19  The response to this has been a disaster. Testing isn't happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The American response to this #Covid_19 has been a huge FAILURE! We are so fucked. And he's attacking reporters for completing legitimate questions!  #WorstPresidentInHistory #WorstPresidentEver #coronavirus #CoronaCrisis #COVID #VoteThemOut #Disgusted #Disgraceful #childish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, this could have been prevented #MyQuarantineInSixWords<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know so many Americans that have #COVID19 symptoms and can't get tested. Other countries should seriously avoid America right now. I'm sure we have tens of THOUSANDS of undiagnosed cases. #TESTVIRUSNOW #testing #TrumpPandemic #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #AvoidAmerica #WeNeedTestingNOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#HowIGot86d  Because I'm an idiot who got drunk and told my boss that once I got engaged I may move away 🤦.

<|startoftext|>@zcat03 @Mytquinn69 They feel emboldened by our president's dog whistles. They feel like it's ok to show their bigotry. It's now something they are proud of rather than  feeling the need to hide it as they were before. It's gross and I'm seeing sides of people I wish I wasn't seeing. It's very sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta I'm not a DeWine fan but in this case he didn't expect the judge to deny. Since then he has talked with the Ohio Health Director and decided they will declare a health state of emergency here so that they can postpone it.  It IS postponed until June. #Coronavirusohio #OhioPrimary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cottage_orchard @Acosta @lauferlaw I'm not a DeWine fan at all but in this case he didn't expect the judge to deny it.

<|startoftext|>sat within 2 rows of you, you would be picked up and quarantined as well.  When we got off the plane they had us walking in a single file line and they used a temp camera to scan us as we walked ...if anyone had an elevated temperature then they went on for further testing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I traveled to Japan during the H1N1 crisis and they had screening set up seamlessly.  They had everyone fill out information cards before getting off the plane, it had our personal information, where we would be,number to reach us and we were told that if anyone tested positive..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I believe there are FAR FAR more cases of #coronavirus in the U.S than we think. We've barely done any testing and many are still thinking this is less dangerous than the flu, thanks to Trump 🙄. #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusTestingFailure #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eman61170174 @fcpsnews @FCPSSupt They definitely should. I honestly think all schools everywhere should close. I'm sure sadly there are FAR FAR more cases than they realize because we have barely done any testing. As of yesterday a total of only 11,000 tests had been done total in the entire country. Scary stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eman61170174 @fcpsnews @FCPSSupt Actually there are 5 confirmed as of last night and many others waiting on tests and test results.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LnotH11 @joncoopertweets Yep and I was wrong. I'm grown and not afraid to admit that 🤷 Still believe #Sanders will be the nominee. If #Biden is the nominee, Trump will win again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done with @CNN  all they do now is bash #sanders and I'm so sick of it! America wants real change! Your bashing him is just helping Trump win in November! STOP THAT SHIT! Sad because I used to love CNN! #sanders2020 #MedicareForAll  #SickOfTheBashing #StopTheBias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianChena3 @joncoopertweets Never once said that, but I've spoken to a shit ton of people and almost all of them have said they are voting for Sanders, and so are the people they know, except a small few.

<|startoftext|>@LnotH11 @joncoopertweets Lol ok lol. Believe it's way more than 5, I don't care if you believe it or not. Watch what happens tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fucking terrifying....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport You're wrong. The majority DOES support him, and the last 3 caucuses have shown that. So will super Tuesday.

<|startoftext|>@TheRealMerryB @joncoopertweets Yep I am. As a mother of biracial children and VERY involved in communities of color, I'm not just talking out of my ass. It's fine though, don't believe me and talk shit, but watch them polls on Sat. Sanders will win.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Yes he absolutely can! No doubt whatsoever....in fact he has a better chance than anyone else. We NEED a candidate like Bernie that has a movement behind him. None of the others have a movement behind them, if they get nominated, we get Trump for 4 more yrs.  #Sanders2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Resist1948 @joncoopertweets Not going to happen. America wants #Sanders , not more of the same old thing. We need a candidate with a movement behind him.....and that's definitely NOT Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sclly21 @BernieSanders @JonJonleb Wholeheartedly disagree. His plan would absolutely work.

<|startoftext|>@senrobportman Awesome, but are you going to do YOUR job and vote for witnesses?The ONLY reason not to get more info to make an informed decision is to aid in covering what they are obviously trying to hide. #WitnessesAndDoucuments #TrialsHaveWitnesses #TrumpIsGuilty #WitnessesMustTestify<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IPSYCare If it can be billed a few days later, as you do when funds aren't available, then why not give us an opportunity to pause until that day so our account isn't overdrawn and we don't have to pause the whole month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #GOP questions are ridiculous. They are clearly doing all they can to cover up any facts and witnesses.

<|startoftext|>@IPSYCare PLEASE find a way for us to be able to pick out billing day...or at least get the ability to pause payment for a few days. Instead I have to pause whole months when I had the funds LITERALLY the next day 😭 #FixItPlz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IPSY PLEASE find a way that I can pick the billing date! I've paused now twice because my funds came the next day.

<|startoftext|>Something to think about with the Trump saying "take her out" then saying he meant to fire her: If someone said on tape to "taking him out" about Trump, they would have secret service at their door because it's something that's said as threat to someone's life. #TakeHerOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gypsy374 @lisaling I'm so sorry for your loss :(  and for your brother's loss. I can't imagine. Brings tears to my eyes for your brother, I'm a twin and I just can't imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimteramoto @lisaling I haven't been to the twins festival since I was a child but I remember seeing quite a few sets of triplets and quadruplets! Might be worth it to try and go one year! My twin and I are planning on going next year 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaling Great episode! Planning a trip for my twin and I to the twins festival next year! Haven't been there since we were 9! It really gave a great image of what it's like being an identical twin. Fun fact: my ex accidentally slapped my sister's butt cuz she was wearing my jeans 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This drives me crazy! MS has no cure, pushing anything as a CURE is wrong and not accurate. Don't fall for it!  #MultipleSclerosis #MS #MSmeme #MSawareness #cureMS #NoCure #MSissues  https://t.co/VOzakuFBYn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaling @CNN Definitely sitting here crying for the married twins.....every time I hear of a twin losing their other half I sob like a baby! I don't think I could go on without my twin. My heart goes out to them. #ThisIsLife #Twin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My identical twin and I ❤️ #TwinLove #IdenticleTwin #twinning #twin  https://t.co/HC8jqFDM0f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtStan88 @CNN @lisaling It's definitely a bond like no other! They will probably fight like crazy like my sister and I did but if you punish one the other will be angry lol. An unspoken #Twin rule is I can talk about my twin but no one else can lol lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @lisaling My identical twin and I used to joke that we had spare parts for the other should one of us need a transplant 🤣  I can also tell when she's in trouble, a few times in our lives I've suddenly gotten this awful feeling and had to check on her, each time she was in danger. #Twins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtStan88 @CNN @lisaling They are adorable! I'm a twin, and they are blessed to be ❤️ they will forever have a best friend and person they trust with their life. It's amazing to be an identical twin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaling @CNN Something else interesting, my twin and I both have Multiple Sclerosis but I know other identical twins where one has MS and one doesn't. We may look alike but we are individuals. This is my sister and I right before we lost our Father in 1987  https://t.co/3dnl9eOqXf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaling @CNN I am an identical twin and love watching shows on them to see what's accurate and what's not. It's so hard to understand the twin bond unless you are one. The love I have for my twin is as strong as the love I have for my children and I'd defend her with my life. #TwinLove<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AUndercover1995 @KamalaHarris Have any of you anti-abortion morons thought about how many unwanted children that would be? How many would need assistance, raising crime rates when they are teens,more becoming drug addicts and more. Making a woman have a child she doesn't want IS NOT always good for the kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AUndercover1995 @KamalaHarris You're delusional. You don't like abortion? THEN DON'T HAVE ONE, but you don't get to tell other women what they can and can't do, and judging women who have had one makes you a truly ignorant. Abortions have happened for hundreds of years, it's just now they are less dangerous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So @SenSanders is supposed to just volunteer extra money to taxes because he thinks the wealthy should be taxed more!? GTFOH! I think McDonald's employees should make more money but that's doesn't mean I'm gonna pay $20 for a $8 meal! #Bernie2020 #TaxTheRich #TaxReform<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McKinleyBcubed @ThePassageFOX @c_chikezie @SaniyyaSidney @hicusick @Brianne_Howey @echriqui @MPG Fantastic!!! Ready for season 2 now!! The wait is going to be terrible, I LOVE this show!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi I agree on this tweet BUT I completely disagree that we shouldn't impeach him asap! This man is clearly a danger to our country and the entire world! He ignores the extreme threat of climate change, promotes racism and hatred, created a trade war and so much more! He has to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An unfortunate reality for many of us. It's perfectly normal to have fear at times, but if you find that it is consuming you, consider talking with someone.

<|startoftext|>I am so fed up with doctors dismissing woman's legitimate medal complaints as depression, anxiety or being emotional! It's far past this practice to end!

<|startoftext|>@GOPoversight @RepMarkMeadows As far as you saying you can't be racist because you have family of color, that means ABSOLUTELY nothing! On the contrary, you can be racist and have biracial children of your own!! My Aunt is very racist and always uses my biracial children as her "I'm not racist because" card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPoversight @RepMarkMeadows Your behavior and that of the rest of the GOP was disgusting. Not one of you actually cared to get to the truth, your only goal is to protect Trump and that IS NOT YOUR DAMN JOB! Also, using a black woman as a prop was absolutely racist and wrong. Shame on you all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, I meant @RepMarkMeadows not Miller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlemon congressman Miller can ABSOLUTELY be racist, having people of color in the family means NOTHING! I have biracial children, my Aunt is absolutely a racist, yet uses our kids as her "I'm not racist" card. It pisses me off! You can even be racist with biracial kids !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonyaSeaturttl1 @SelmaBlair @GMA @RobinRoberts They are also finding links between MS and other autoimmune diseases. If you have a family member with ANY autoimmune disease some docs say you have a higher risk too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonyaSeaturttl1 @SelmaBlair @GMA @RobinRoberts It's not hereditary but it does have a genetic component. If a person has a direct immediate family member with MS then they have a 4%-7% risk. Two years ago they found the gene that causes progressive forms of MS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib Absolutely!!! I had a child as a teen, my credit has been a mess since before I was even an adult because of medical bills. The entire credit system we use needs to be fixed!! How can a person with bad credit get better if no one gives them a chance because of their bad score??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SelmaBlair @GMA @RobinRoberts I'm definitely going to look this interview up to watch later! I also have MS. My mother, twin sister and I all have it.

<|startoftext|>Watching @blackmirror on @netflix , love this series! Season 4 episode 1 is my favorite!! Captain Daly is batshit crazy! #BlackMirror anyone know when season 5 drops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching @TRVLRSseries again, so disappointed they cancelled it. Bad move @netflix. Now I'm watching @WaywardPinesFOX  again! I need a new season on this series too, it was another great series I was upset to see cancelled!  :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Yet another reason to do Medicare For All! End private insurance companies for good! Then the gov't can negotiate lower drug prices and consumers can pay reasonable prices, instead of having to choose to eat this month or get my medicine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reuter_chuck @realDonaldTrump You can't look at a person and "see" their immigration status OR if they are even immigrants!! So basically you're mad that your city is becoming browner....you're just another bigot out of hiding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Oh man that's hilarious! 😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Colt45Wild @rants_off @julsbreakey @Nappy_Snitter @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I just lost a dear family member. I honestly don't give a shit about this debate anymore. Have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and helping those who truly need the pain relief WITHOUT JUDGMENT!   Please rt thread and to help anyone fighting chronic pain ❤️  #WeArePatientsNotAddicts #StopJudgingUs #ThatsPartOfWhySuicidesAreIncreasing #StopPunishingThoseInPain #HeroinCrisisNotOpioidCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and desperate for pain relief, it's hard to understand turning to something as drastic as heroin, but those of us with chronic pain NEED you to try to understand more that some pain you can not just simply "live with"! There needs to be a balance between not enabling addicts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but part of the problem is people in legitimate pain are now being denied help and turning to heroin to stop the pain because they can't find pills on the street anymore but heroin will always be easily available. Until you've been in so much pain that you're suicidal.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes people who are legitimate pain patients, like myself, be judged as an addict before they know a single thing about me or my health simply because I require pain medication to survive.   I understand we have a heroin crisis in this country.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women who are raped react in many ways. Some act out, some try to act as if it didn't happen, others isolate themselves and more! What a woman does before or after she is raped in NO way justifies rape or excuses it! #JasmineEiland #StayStrong #StopJudging #NoMeansNo #SheWasRaped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be strong #JasmineEiland ! I'm so sorry that happened to you! Please try not to let these fools hurt you any further ❤️ #IBelieveYou #NoMeansNo #ThatWasRape #DominiqueWilliamsIsARapist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rants_off @julsbreakey @Nappy_Snitter @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump No one is trying to take your guns or repeal the 2ns amendment lmao. Having common sense gun laws is....well....common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec you are seriously almost as much of an embarrassment to our country as 45 is. It's disgusting. History won't remember you kindly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime Why why why even have @KellyannePolls on the show anymore? I can't handle her. She never answers questions and ALWAYS talks over you nonstop.

<|startoftext|>@rants_off @julsbreakey @Nappy_Snitter @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Gun laws that aren't in effect across the country, and only in certain cities, won't show a difference since they can be purchased few miles away. For real stats, look at other countries with stricter gun laws for a more accurate showing of how gun control works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodsTeapot She doesn't have one. Grow tf up. If you truly believe she is a man, you need mental help. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi No vanity wall for Trump!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBumbop No that's was actually Melania Trump a few years back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodsTeapot She is a woman and that whole "she's a man" thing is so ridiculous. ANY woman knows when you were certain clothes it wrinkles in some places and bumps up in others. Bet I can find a picture of Trump with man boobs...does that make him a woman?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodsTeapot Michelle is 100x the woman Melania is. Melania is an ex nude model, Michelle has several degrees from prestigious universities. Michelle is gorgeous naturally, Melania paid for her looks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luvwine1126 @manderson12369 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump If I called you a name it was because I confused you with another reply I had gotten. I apologise. I'm new to Twitter and still trying to understand how it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drury_brent @spirit61371 @realDonaldTrump 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 that's hilarious. Your supreme leader 45 already said long before that he owned it ...and he does. #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@krause_steph @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You obviously make no attempt to understand the Dems side or you would know that we are not against walls in certain areas, the issue is we do not need a wall sea to sea and it is NOT a crisis, and that drugs come in entry ports and illegals overstay visas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaSwartz8 @wendytee41 @timothystoner @richard123166 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I agree wholeheartedly. I always try to be respectful to people and explain my views and almost every time it turns into a bash the left/Obama/Hillary session. It's dumb. Pisses me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendytee41 @timothystoner @LisaSwartz8 @richard123166 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I'm resisting his hatred, his racism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia and all the other horrible things he represents. I don't know who told you the left loved him but they certainly lied to you. The economy is due to Obama, not Trump. He does NOT keep citizens safe unless white<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I support this wall 100%! #Impeach45 #NoWall #TrumpShutdown  https://t.co/B8suhGxSWa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendytee41 @timothystoner @LisaSwartz8 @richard123166 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I'm a adult woman and my views on things almost always align with progressives but there are times I disagree with things. I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong, I wish those on both sides would. We would get much further as a country and heal some division if we all did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I was unaware of the family members. If that's the case I definitely disagree with that. I just feel the gov't needs to be opened then both sides need to come to an agreement. I personally am against wall funding but if we get citizenship for DACA it may be worth it. Not 3 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matigrje @luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump That's bs and you know it. Making over sweeping comments like that do nothing but further the divide between Republicans and Democrats. I'm so against this whole degrade and demean each other shit, and yes I realize it's both sides and it's easy to get caught up in it when angry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan Yes and his spin story his mommy paid a PR group for is BS. There is a video of kids from that school in blackface from 2015  https://t.co/CO41u3rzZ2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She was going to show support and solidarity to our troops, unlike Melania and Pompeo and his wife who all have went on trips since shutdown. Melania went to Mar-A-Lago the same day Trump stopped pelosi from visiting the troops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Also why he wouldn't have pressed hard for the wall the last two years while he had control in Congress. He already knew Dems would offer way less than they did. That's common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I don't believe it's a crisis. It's legal to seek asylum at anywhere at the border, not just entry points. Do we have a problem? Yes, do we have a crisis? No. I'll look more into the overturning thing. That I didn't know. I do not believe the wall warrants a shutdown at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Btw, I am not on often, I won't be able to respond quickly. Also, I prefer to debate like adults, can we agree to cut name calling and degrading each other plz? If you prove a point to me I'm not too proud to admit it. Imo I don't feel that the last time it happened matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump That's completely irrelevant, the fact is they could have and chose not to. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Doing that, which they had every opportunity to do, would have been 100x better than agreeing to a deal then changing his mind and shutting the government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump .......they could have done it. There was zero need to shutdown government. It's not speculation lmao it's been done before to pass bills  https://t.co/x2yROOk4OS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump those of you replying that they needed 60 votes, let me remind you they could have stopped filibusters making it only require a 50 vote majority to pass. If it was important enough to shut the government down, seems like it'd be important enough stop filibusters...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuigiVampa1974 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Let me educate you a bit, they could have stopped filibusters making it only a 50 majority vote to pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvwine1126 @Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Please stop acting like you are all unaware that they had the power to eliminate filibusters, changing to a simple 50 vote majority if they chose to do so. If it's important enough to shut down government now, why wasn't it important enough to do that then, during caravan crisis?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC You should be ashamed of yourself!!! We Dems HAVE been willing to give towards border security, just not a 15th century answer to a 21st century problem!! Hope you didn't plan on being a senator past this term because you basically just let everyone know you are 45's lap dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CortesSteve @AC360 @CNN Mexico will NOT be paying for the wall and you know it! This is a MANUFACTURED crisis! If it was so important, why not pass it when Republicans have FULL control of Congress?? Expecting Dems to give him something that even his own damn party wouldn't approve!!! Smfh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CortesSteve you are delusional if you think Mexico is ever going to pay for that useless and ineffective wall your supreme leader wants! Open your eyes ffs!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You could NEVER have done what @BarackObama did. You are not even 1/4 the man he is. Thank God we didn't have you at that time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Bullshit. Don't believe a word you say or write. This sounds awfully similar to your fake doctors letter and other letters you write and try to say others wrote it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraSetmayer @CNN @BrookeBCNN @AOC @60Minutes Disagree with you 100% on your thoughts about Congresswoman  Ocasio-Cortez interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraSetmayer Could not possibly disagree with you more about @AOC . At least she takes responsibility for errors and doesn't try to push them off as "alternative facts" to avoid admitting being wrong. Look at the bigger picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC You should be ashamed of yourself for selling your soul and country out to trump. Shame on you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Michaeljp2424 @RashidaTlaib Hope you say the same about Trump...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib I agree and support you 100%! Funny how people had no problem with Kanye dropping the f bomb with 45 but somehow your truthful words are offensive. It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump We stand with you! Do not give in to his stupid wasteful wall! Thank you! #trumpresign #ResignTrump #TrumpShutDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Hold your ground sir! Do not give in, period! Dems stand behind you and we do not want this dumb wall, if he wants to keep a promise then he should have Mexico pay for it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Not with our money you're not!!! The PROMISE made was that MEXICO would pay for it, NOT us!!! #TrumpResign #TrumpShutDown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oculus Do you have any contests to win an Oculus Go? I'm a twin, we both have MS so we rarely see each other anymore. This would be so perfect for us to spend time together since our disability keeps us stuck home! Unfortunately we are both on a small fixed income now :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaywardPinesFOX Pleeeeease bring us a season 3!! I absolutely love tho show, I've watched it so many times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jalexbrinson @NestaCooper Brilliant job! Nesta also did an amazing job portraying a victim of domestic violence, honestly I really love the  whole cast. You all are very talented!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jalexbrinson You are a phenomenal actor! Unfortunately I've been in an abusive relationship and your facial expressions and body language was so on point! Great show and great talent from all of you! Begging for season 4! I already binged 1-3 in less than a week! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sclly21 @EricMcCormack @netflix @bradtravelers @Carrie_Mudd @TRVLRSseries please please make season 4! I absolutely LOVE this show! The storyline is brilliant and the casting is PERFECT. The amazing actors makes this show so believable! We NEED a season 4!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂 you do realize this is 100% false right!? They are NOT chanting that they want you! Only your cult will believe such a ridiculous lie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump you are seriously disgusting. My 14_ year old niece is more mature than you. Can not believe we have a child as our president. Can't wait until Mueller crushes you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics please please please do this Fact Check box on every single time and also anytime Trump speaks!! They cannot be allowed to spout lie after lie to the American people!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Please stop your childish husband from destroying our country, thanks. Also, please don't say one more word about "Be Best" until your husband stops bullying everyone! He is truly a monster., and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sherebee @TeamPelosi @BenMcAdams I'm 100% democrat, but Medicare for all is very important to me. No need to have the pre existing discussion if EVERY american has health insurance in a system like Canada's for instance.  I will ALWAYS be a democrat and support the other issues you mentioned, and more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi @BenMcAdams So glad to see this!! I do have a question though, do you support a Medicare for all system? I VERY much so do, I need to know where you stand on the issue. I fight MS, Lupus and Fibromyalgia and I can't see the doctors I need to! Our current system is broken beyond repair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wow, you really have no idea how our government works, do you? I can not wait for Mueller and house dems to take you down! You're a disgrace to this country and history will remeber you as the worst president our nation has ever had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr lmfao um newsflash....Rick Scott has NOT won. That vote is still being counted!! Smfh! How pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr You are Trump's lap dog and history will remember you as such! The people of america want Mueller protected from this deranged president! NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!!! PASS THE DAMN BILL TO PROTECT MEULLER NOW!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scotiajim I don't understand why people are so nosey sometimes! #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_melsroom yes, for people to understand, I should have clarified that #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevelWoman @keep__smyelin that's definitely true #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lte66 some days I do believe so #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearest_monster omg YES #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotiajim mine are becoming more visible now too #chatMS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dearest_monster yes! Absolutely agree! #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_melsroom it just seems if people don't have MS in their families they do have some kind of neurological diseases #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevelWoman @keep__smyelin. I hope so, and other diseases too! #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lte66 I definitely agree #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenrios0945 I agree, there seems like there has to me #chatMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_melsroom I still think there is, my opinion means zero lol, but it just seems there has to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q1 Do you think there is a link between MS and other neurological diseases? #chatMS<|endoftext|>
