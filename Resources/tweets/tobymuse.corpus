<|startoftext|>Listening to this now - it’s great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraNavarro @jimwyss Thanks for retweeting - I’ll be drawing the names for the signed copies in a few days time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a life. An authour who wrote intelligent and engaging novels that were read and enjoyed by millions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this going to be seen as kitschy in the future, like picking up an old USSR flag when visiting Moscow?  https://t.co/hTShFywiDk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best journalism books ever written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 Or equally, generalizations are often stupid, reflect lazy thinking and will lead to the wrong conclusions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olesyalyuzna Sorry to hear this. Hope you all get better and soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hasta cuando los Colombianos tienen que aguantar un estado incapaz de hacer nada. Que rabia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Hanrahan And what's incredible is how uninterested the media is in this whole world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieDebusmann @Jake_Hanrahan I think they really do want violence - they romanticise it. They take pride in cuts and bruises, violence gives their lives meaning. Violence as politics. There's a great biography of early Italian fascist d'Annunzio that gives an insight in to the allure of violence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Hanrahan I wonder if the "election fraud" may have already been the Ruby Ridge/Waco, the justification for what's coming down the line. There's a weird energy that is not being reported on enough - see one of the chants was "Fuck the GOP".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Hanrahan Agreed. But as it becomes more normalized, images of chaotic scenes on the streets, that will push politics in a certain direction. Those people marching yesterday are convinced of two things: Trump was cheated and Trump will be president again next year. It's combustible here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Hanrahan meant to include @BernieDebusmann as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Hanrahan I think that is part of it - but I also saw two sides looking to fight. Both sides wanted the street violence and I worry we're normalizing political violence. And that has its own consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_Not_Carlos Very cool to hear you enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminFogel @PhilKlay @apagliar Intensification of an ongoing counter-insurgency. There was a real fear that the rebels could seriously advance - those FARC victories in late 90s were deeply worrying to DC I’d say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catalinagilp Ha! Ivan Duque chatshow host  https://t.co/dxO5TOYSBb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dirty Gold is the best account I’ve read on Latin America’s massive illegal gold underworld. Fascinating, fast-paced, it documents the wild west of the gold industry, filled with memorable characters. Dirty Gold reads like a thriller. You should pre-order it now  https://t.co/VLBN0wtTqN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruedareport *There* I don’t live there any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruedareport I saw this one and couldn’t understand the controversy (and apparently a load of Colombian women couldn’t either). That the media would report it...foreigner opines on Colombia is a entre genre of news here anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 Mosul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminFogel @PhilKlay @apagliar Especially the helicopters and planes. Colombian illegal groups have never found a way to neutralize air power. The dissident para Doble Zero who fought the army and the paras, told me: “On the ground, we always beat them. But I can’t do anything against the helicopters”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenjaminFogel Thanks Benjamin, glad you enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilKlay @apagliar @BenjaminFogel I think the military aid did tip the war against the FARC. But in the boom of articles saying Afghanistan needed its own Plan Colombia, Colombia was the model to follow etc, they never bothered mentioning the crucial role the paras had in weakening the FARC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilKlay @apagliar @BenjaminFogel Plan Colombia in 2000: We will cut coca crops by 50% by 2005.  Duque with record coca output in 2020: We will cut coca crops by 50% by 2023.  We never move forward, always in circles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julianrademeyer @JasonEligh Thanks Julian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonEligh Thanks Jason - I hope we can make Kilo a seasonal tradition, just like It's a Wonderful Life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kilo is a festive gem. It's what your loved one is secretly hoping you will buy them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DariusBazargan @DGisSERIOUS Probably because you kept telling you boss to "check out the prison whites" while pointing at your trainers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGisSERIOUS @DariusBazargan The more prestigious the outlet, the less I see them report on victims. Among top podcasts, documentaries, magazines etc, I've seen countless pieces on miscarriages of justice (good - it's much needed). But can't recall a piece on people trying to by in a high crime neighborhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGisSERIOUS @DariusBazargan I think that's a class thing - I don't think a lot of reporters know how to go to places where these things happen and get people to talk. Also victims of crimes, especially in the poorest neighborhoods, are ignored way too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGisSERIOUS @DariusBazargan Agreed it's a good article, because it did speak with the men doing the crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goffmania @BenjaminFogel I know Bogota is eager to know the answer to this larger question too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DariusBazargan @DGisSERIOUS The media does a really bad job reporting on criminals. At least this article did speak to the people at the heart of the story and not just cops and social workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goffmania @BenjaminFogel But surely enough politicians know what went on in Florida this election to tell Biden...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminFogel I think that's right, but I'd say more as a success in war against FARC (always conveniently ignoring the huge role the death-squads played in that). But this election, his supporters were so obvious...who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminFogel They can’t have forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Six months from now, a lot of people are going to pretend they were saying/doing different things in this moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Narcomania A glut that itself could cause more use next year?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoahHurowitz Congrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@will__grant @clare_esme @HoZ_Books @juliagaliano That moment when the book becomes real. An unforgettable moment. Hope it does really well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kilo is the perfect Christmas present. What’s more festive than a journey to the heart of the cocaine industry? Please help me spread the word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erika_pineros But honestly none of these are hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erika_pineros The UN releases a huge report every year detailing drug production and consumption - their figures are there. The White House drug czar issues its own figures every year - both show record coca output under Duque. Here’s a summary of the latest figures  https://t.co/rznL1KDI6O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks everyone. Everyone who retweets get their name thrown in to the raffle for the books. I'll pull the names in time for Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A trailer for my book Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. I’m giving away 5 signed hardback copies. Kilo meets the drug-smugglers, their lovers, witches and the police trying to stop them. Kilo shows the madness of the drug war. Leave a comment below, retweet and I’ll pick 5 names.  https://t.co/x1Lhdk4qkN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlosM9B When it was approved in the US, it was never about the FARC or the ELN, only drugs. It was later changed to allow the FARC and ELN to be targeted. And it’s definitely news to both groups that they were defeated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erika_pineros Under Duque, cocaine production reached records never seen before, historic highs in output.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bogotá police capture four alleged armed-burglars. Their mug shots are something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump and his supporters want this to be a "country divided" over whether the elections were free and fair. It's not. The vast majority believe Biden won the elections fairly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look out at the world and I'm sure this book is only going to become more relevant. Looks to be a great read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South America has these wild, brazen bank robberies that make Heat look like a mugging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruedareport @BOG_ELDORADO A lot of fluent Israelis. If he had “I love Taganga” t-shirt on, case closed. Regardless, I hope some pissed off Avianca stewardess who was on 30th flight this week unloaded on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruedareport @BOG_ELDORADO Israeli. Whenever I saw someone wearing *those* trousers in South America, always Israelis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A US congressional report labels Plan Colombia - a multi-billion plan to destroy the cocaine industry - a failure, now there is more cocaine than ever before. Sure it failed against cocaine. But creating a steady flow of US funds to Colombia’s military? Total success!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobyStHill Coca towns like La Gabarra are a trip - they feel sketchy as hell but you feel an electric current, money changing hands at a fast pace. The sex and the partying, it hangs in the air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevensdudley @NPR Congrats! You're in good company there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Two Republican governors. Trump was always going to savage the Republicans on his way out. I wonder what those who believe in that party feel about the next four years and whether they can ever recover their party.  https://t.co/rygCQteEIP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Fox is: 1) encouraging a new surge in Covid-19 infections 2) wants such massive new funding for the NHS that it could handle such a deliberate surge whenever. So even without a surge, we would be still be funding the NHS to be ready to deal with one just in case. Brilliant<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MAranzazuRU This book is excellent. A good novel is Complot Para Matar el Diablo, about a gang in the slums of Cali.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only things I care about when big operations are announced: 1) were any government employees captured? 2) is anyone reporting cocaine scarcer than before the op? If the answers are no, it’s one more meaningless victory in the lost war on drugs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden could win more of these votes, says @Nate_Cohn "Biden's winning absentee ballots 78-21. The PA SOS says there are 1.4 million ballots left to count. If that's true, then Biden will net-800k votes, more than enough to over take the president" h/t @GutiCamilo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GutiCamilo Interesting hadn't seen that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going in to the election, polls showed Democrats twice as likely to vote by mail as Republicans. Does that still hold? Is Biden poised to take 66% of the outstanding votes? That could give him N. Carolina but still wouldn't be enough to take Pennsylvania  https://t.co/cuAwhKWGG8  https://t.co/nVPy3GGBTN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themilwaukeemob No one has. That’s the point: lots of mail-in votes to count so no one knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feels like nothing much more is going to change tonight. And if the vote-counters are going to sleep, maybe I should too #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nightmare scenario has always been  both candidates claiming victory and each accusing the other of stealing the election. And a total state-level dysfunction in failing to deliver a result quickly. We may be entering this stage #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenquintero At home drinking - like all sensible people on election night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianFitz_  https://t.co/zgYlRFnybO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astonishing to hear a state like #Georgia declare: “we’ve stopped counting votes for the night. We’ll count them in the morning.” Couldn’t swing some overtime? #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man the polls were just awful this year (again)  https://t.co/ykAu198DgU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Get ready for truly awful “Latino voters” stories to come these days. Just staggeringly bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fox just outlined the most likely path for #Biden to win - him winning 270 (even as he loses PA).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fox just called #arizona for #Biden and that’s huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schklick Agree 100% on PA. But can same be said of others? (Honest question)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exhibit A of why pundits keep getting elections wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember four years ago when the conversation at some point in the night turned to Clinton’s “possibilities of victory”. John King on CNN just used that same phrase for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is going to #Pennsylvania - and that will be days and lawsuits<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t even know what tweets like these mean anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGisSERIOUS Then they keep losing. You can’t be a challenger and let the president make you defend your record.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frederikwskov That makes sense about no notes being brought in. My point is that politicians should be able to bring in notes because it’s stupid to demand our politicians remember lists of facts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Four years ago, the FARC held its historic 10th Conference where the rebels voted for a peace deal with the Colombian state. It would be the dream of peace.

<|startoftext|>@davepell Now imagine how it’s going to feel when November rolls around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been on flights where the pilots would have tried to fly through all five of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleEnColombia Right, but I wasn't talking about the deal as a document.  Rather the peace deal as a historic event in its totality, an endeavor that failed and consequently caused much of this violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only this but I’d consider it embarrassing (and dull) if all my friends thought the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_wola @KyleEnColombia So the Santos' government omission and Duque's opposition, is in line with a lot of the population. The people of Toribio, Bojaya, Ituango, San Jose de Apartado and the countless other zones we all know deserve so better than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_wola @KyleEnColombia On the eve of the referendum, I thought: "Well, Yes will win the vote but No will win overall because they've politicized peace." There is no great demand from Colombians for peace, there is not that pressure that forces Uribe to shake hands with Timochenko.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleEnColombia Could violence have been avoided? Impossible to answer but there's no need to go so theoretical given how badly it was handled. Even Santos grew bored of the actual implementation. I read not one of the ETCR was 100% completed. Couldn't even do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleEnColombia 1) 100% the violence flows from poor implementation. These zones had a sort of peace under the FARC. It was supposed to be the handover from one group ruling to another (the state). The state never showed up. But many others did and now they're fighting for control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasaAmarilla A weird stubbornness to proudly do even the basics badly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleEnColombia When I talk of the peace deal I mean it’s intent and implementation. On paper it’s wonderful. But if it’s not implemented who cares? People in places like Ituango and Tumaco have told me they lived in greater safety in the state of war than in the peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The horrible truth is that it’s not a question of “despite” but rather “because” given how how badly the peace deal has been botched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memolitinho @edwardpoole1975 But was he possessed by an old Amazonian spirit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There’s a terrible conformity that bores. What was the last article that challenged your beliefs, changing the way you see the world? Can’t think of one myself. But I remember that it used to happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The fringe openly talks of violence. But hatred for the other side, blind rabid tribalism is already here and mainstreamed. I don’t know how we get beyond it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very cool review for Kilo, thought-provoking and picks up on a lot of what I was aiming for (few statistics, no experts, human stories from the front line of the drug war).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasaAmarilla 100% agreed. He takes these opportunities his enemies give him and has achieved phenomenal successes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasaAmarilla I don’t know, man. He has nothing to offer a Colombia in peace. We’ve seen that: he’s lost, irrelevant, barking at pigeons. So why do he bitterest enemies keep creating a space for him to thrive?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@litwicki @jennieerinsmith But since Uribe, there’s been a concerted effort in some parts of the press to downplay Colombia’s problems. Remember when it was the model for Afghanistan AND THEY NEVER MENTIONED THE ROLE OF THE PARAS in helping to defeat the rebels?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruedareport But how many of the stories on Medellin didn’t tell the whole story of that city, let alone Catatumbo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've certainly screwed up - I and others were swept up in the history of 2016 and promises of peace for Colombia. It was no such thing. It was a step in the right direction, but that wasn't the tone of our coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith And it is a great story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith To be clearer: there's a whole genre of stories we all know that are written declaring Medellin has overcome its problems, with no reference to combo control, disappearances, etc. That story is often written country-wide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith Jesus I hadn't heard this. That's a great story, one of those tales that really sum up the layers and layers to the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackBloomfield0 Agreed and there's a lot of political legwork to be done to push the issue to the front and center.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith I think tourism is different - I don't expect someone who travels to Cartagena for the beaches and parties to study up on Norte de Cauca. It's those who write about Colombia as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackBloomfield0 Colombia cannot do this unilaterally and the world should not expect the country to work alone to fix this global problem. Until the Americans and Europeans change their cowardly, unrealistic stance, nothing will change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UlfThoene Fantastic, very cool to hear. Tell the students to read it hard because I'll be testing them on it (just finished re-reading it myself for typos for paperback out next year).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackBloomfield0 Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I'm smart enough to report on what's not working, but not smart enough to have a good solution. But difficult to see peace with the drug war still going strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf Or even more blindly, reporting on Colombia the country after a weekend in EL Poblado.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't a Duque/Santos tweet - the seeds of this violence were planted in the last years of Santos' administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps a record amount of cocaine, a return to the era of massacres show the model we've been following isn't working out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A curious part of foreign coverage of Colombia is the overly optimistic stories. When incidents show how precarious Colombia remains, these voices go silent. They don't wrestle with it, explain it with a "yes, but", or reconsider. Silent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quien esta permitiendo estas masacres?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larratt_smith In the 2000's, it was always a good idea to ask: we may know who did it, but who let it happen? I don't see those questions yet being asked for this repeat of history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliGGriffin @ruedareport I think by 2018 they're both responsible. Santos seemed bored by the peace process at that point, with the country already sliding back to violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shows a huge spike in massacres and victims since new government - which is opposed to the peace process - took power in 2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicoAventurero Was definitely a civil war, as in two sides fighting for their respective ideologies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf I'm sure and I hope someone is getting those figures ready. But the lesson from the massacres of the 2000's was always: who let them happen? That's what I want to know about these massacres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf Coercion seems unlikely, no? If any bloc of the old AUC had truly threatened the military as a whole, I don't doubt the army would have crushed that bloc in weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf Massacres occurred for years with most denying the army's collusion save for Amnesty, HRW (who were called guerrillas for their work). As history looks to be repeating itself, why not start with these questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf I don't know...it took me years to understand that massacres weren't always a sign of chaos. Are we going to start asking about collusion in this bloodshed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a week of massacres across Colombia, it's back to the old question: Is the country out of control? Or are these massacres a sign of absolute control by some?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meganjanetsky Agreed...but then also "No one ever went broke underestimating the Colombian electorate" as HL might say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColombiaCalling Absolutely dominating Microsoft Office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible - after a horrifically violent week, Colombia's president doesn't announce new plans of action to stop the bloodshed. No, he compares his administration's massacre numbers (which are post-peace process) with the previous administration's (mostly full civil war).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CasaAmarilla Are there any real achievements of his presidency? Will these be 4 lost years?

<|startoftext|>@larratt_smith We weren't talking about Uribe, only how underworld would react to them. Another reminder how Mancuso was always a figurehead, the real power was in the hands of the narcos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A couple of years ago, I was speaking with a "retired" narco and asked what will happen when these warlords return to Colombia. Don Berna, he said, other narcos would step aside if he wanted the top spot. Mancuso? "They'll probably kill him."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goosekirk @PJAsmann @elespectador Ahhhhhh I read it too quickly. That makes a lot of sense. Still a steady supply of 100-200 kilos is pretty good (although I should stop fixating on that as police throw out these numbers and they rarely make sense).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJAsmann @elespectador But still any production of cocaine in Europe is an interesting evolutionary jump for the industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJAsmann @elespectador I couldn't see where the coca was coming from. If I'm remembering correctly, a hectare of coca will produce 1.5 kilos of paste. So we're talking about access to roughly 100 hectares of coca - per day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adam_wola I can't imagine them taking such a radical stance to invite judicial repercussions. I meant more they don't believe they've ever done anything wrong. That lack of introspection, self-criticism was meant to make them strong in the jungle. It's awful in civil society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't see the FARC as ready to reckon with their past crimes - child-soldiers and the mass kidnapping of civilians are two of the big ones (my sense is that forced recruitment of children wasn't the norm, but that it was done with any sort of frequency is criminal)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenquintero @Kokoweef @RealJeffTidwell @ItsKevinMangold @AndrewChesnut1 I understand the point about bureaucratic inertia - but I think this war is unwinnable at this point. If we can't lower demand for drugs, it's unwinnable (and we may be able to lower demand, I just don't know how).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get your copy of Kilo (six-month delay not normally included).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ioangrillo Thanks for reading and hope you dig it. I've often wondered about Latin America's postal service - does a package just sit in a corner for five months until someone decides the limbo has gone on long enough and they then deliver it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SergioGuzmanE Fuerza y animo, Sergio. Abrazos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TooSphexy That's what I'd think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gecorredor Y zero cliche. Son las vidas que no han sido reportados, mas bien olvidados por todos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gecorredor Kilo muestra como la guerra contra las drogas esta fracasando, mostrando las vidas de los que ganan en la guerra (los trafficantes) y los que pierden (raspachines, cocaleros).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombia si es preciosa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores Such considerable evidence, yet you can't provide any? There are no serious "hypothesis (sic) based on calculated assumptions" on whether the majority of American tourists consume cocaine or whether that is larger than the domestic market. You made it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores Not offended or obtuse. You stated something as if it were a fact. I repeatedly asked for evidence. Your last tweet said that the evidence could not exist to support what you asserted. Not much more to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores So if tourists don't report their activities and criminal groups don't disclose their finances, that would mean there would be no evidence to make those two assertions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores Genuinely interested. I looked around online but couldn't find statistics to back up that 1) majority of American tourists who visit Medellin consume cocaine and 2) that this "far eclipses the local market". So please share those stats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores Can you point me to those statistics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Texas doing more now than Washington, DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores The local market is much, much bigger than the niche market of servicing a few hostels in Poblado.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores They definitely consume, but that open-air drug market in the center...I didn't see any foreigners there when I went (autumn 2018)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores They're awful and have made Parque Lleras must-avoid, but Medellin was doing pretty good with microtraffic and prostitution before they arrived.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores I've been to Fahrenheit a couple of times. That place is a trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaimanValores I do. The infinite patience of dwarves in Colombia, the shit they have to put up with. Was there a Mangos in Bogota? There was somewhere in the north where the traquetos went (before they all got in to techno). Every few months, a trafficker would be gunned down in the place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CasaAmarilla @larratt_smith @jennieerinsmith @ruedareport Germany, and I don't have a single doubt. When I saw her trousers, there were only three options: English, Israeli or German. Two have been eliminated. She's German.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottawamerry I can imagine - I'm sympathetic to these cases. I know what to look for in a country I know well. If I'm visiting from abroad, I have no idea when I'm entering a bad neighborhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robin_Eveleigh Yeah back then, those bus rides were wild. There is a grim acceptance. You can still see it in the videos of the bus robberies in Medellin or Cali - these poor people know the thieves will shoot for any reason so can do little more than sigh and hand it over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Robin_Eveleigh Had the driver not videoed all the passengers before starting? As I travelled with laptop, camera, etc worried would one day get jacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stuff of nightmares. Tourists were driving across Colombia and the app Waze directed them through a notoriously dangerous war-zone of cocaine and rebels where they were kidnapped and held for 3 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big rewards. Will it lead to someone handing them over? Maybe, maybe not. But it can sow the seed of mistrust among the comrades.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here I speak to @chrstphr_woody about the release from prison of one of the last cocaine cowboys and all round lunatic Carlos Lehder    https://t.co/9nb9fkiEjJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one knows how much cocaine is out there. Another reporter reminded me today of when we traveled to a zone and saw a lot of coca. When he returned to Bogota, he consulted these drug maps and they had the region as coca-free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@profhrs @BellevueDoc Thanks for picking it up. Hope you enjoy it and look forward to hearing what you think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a good pairing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another leading Colombian politician calls to end the war on drugs. "End the war on drugs and have the state regulate all these substances."

<|startoftext|>@davepell Maybe there's a statue somewhere on the Pacific Coast in honor of the yellow submarine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had forgotten how weird Lehder's statue of a naked John Lennon was. Lesson from this: with unlimited money, power of life and death around all those around them, drives narcos to barking lunacy.  https://t.co/db6AdWgQY2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A huge narco in the '80s, Lehder was a lunatic - Nazi-sympathies. He called cocaine revolutionary, to bring down the US empire. He took over an island to traffic drugs. I visited his abandoned estate in Colombia's coffee region and his John Lennon statue was still standing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NanaMGNS @isisgiraldoa That's my feeling for all my time in Colombia (roughly, from 2000 on): many more families had suffered the industry, rather than been in it, especially if you include the conflict, which obviously should be included.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenquintero Yes, Central America is wild...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenquintero It's remarkable how many politicians have family members who are narcos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa You've said it more eloquently than I could put it. I've heard the same about Cali in the 1980s. But it feels like in past two decades, the normal Colombian family didn't have a narco in it, whereas a lot of rich families had people involved (especially in money-laundering).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so common of the elite one of Colombia's most important business leaders recently said: "Those who don't have a narco as a relative can cast the first stone." Ordinary Colombians were outraged, as their experiences of narcos is to suffer them, not be related to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is publishing people's university photos, now journalism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilmIntuition Dean Martin was always the coolest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicenquintero My thoughts too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith I think some may come to see it as such<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if this isn’t like environmental movement regretting the wording “global warming”, as it lead to decades of unfunny jokes by opponents every time it snowed somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most Old Parr story possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinxHodgson Me neither. I think Colombians just didn’t believe me when I told them that Old Parr wasn’t widely consumed in Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old Parr whiskey is so central to some parts of Colombia, it’s part of the burial rites of some indigenous funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will the cities with the biggest protests look like in 10 days time? Hoping facts they’re in open air and that almost everyone is wearing masks will limit the numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serenenadia Thank you! Hope you enjoy it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His message to his daughter: "We have to protect our community - this is for you...But I want you to understand, you have to stand up for what is right." This is what a responsible, empowered citizenry looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen variations of this, time and time again at these protests. Biggest mistake media making is treating them as monolithic - lots of internal debates going on inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanedelatorre Lo siento Vanessa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How peaceful were today’s protests? There’s an ice cream truck doing a roaring business next to demonstration. #DCProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expensively-dressed young white women in designer Malcolm X t-shirts taking selfies at these protests feels weird in ways I can’t put in to words #DCProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Protestors have been cleaning up streets here in DC all day. #DCProtests  https://t.co/CcvQo8OsHM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely feels like a decision to keep cops back, away from the protsteors’ face in DC. Haven’t had the helicopters or anything. And day has been all peaceful #DCProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s vibe in #DCPROTEST  https://t.co/pGr6D5J4vR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngelicaLozanoC Yo estaba en este protesta. No creían que era supremcista, sabían perfectamente que el tipo es de Black  Block, una especie de anarquistas. La mayoría está cansado de la pequeño grupo que destruyen las protestas con los disturbios.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avcanosa @IriartePhoto @elespectador A mi me también me parece peligroso por los compañeros en el campo. No se los detalles, entonces es posible que ellos no dijeron nada, pensando que ella entendía la política de ellos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IriartePhoto @elespectador Pero según las leyes colombianos, tampoco podrían mostrar la foto de la niña- no pueden mostrar ninos en situaciones de peligro. Quien decide que es irrelevante?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Algo para pensar del compañero Ramon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IriartePhoto @elespectador Lo que me parece curioso de este reportaje es nunca he visto los elenos mostrando sus caras? Y esta vez si?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IriartePhoto @elespectador Interesante pero no se si estoy de acuerdo. Con las leyes que citas, no podemos publicar la foto famosa de la niña de Vietnam corriendo después del ataque de napalm.

<|startoftext|>DC announces curfew for Monday and Tuesday to stop protests and disturbances #dcprotest #GeorgeFloydProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3km 17:32. 14:30 24 degrees. Good speed, now move up to 3.5km. Ate pasta last night and could feel the fuel today. #tobyrun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presence of black block and antifa seems tiny. A lot of people are tired of them - see this black-blocker getting stones ready to throw at police get grabbed and handed over to cops.   https://t.co/RON0Zsf8RA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>5) If coronavirus can be transmitted between people in case proximity, hard to see how there won't be a spike. Both the left and the right have now abandoned social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) In a meta way, many of the men and women are actively trying to be photographed or videoed in a way to make an iconic image. People themselves composing the image for journalists on the scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) As night stretches on, protests become more chaotic and criminal. There's been looting and vandalism. The men doing that never arrive with signs. Groups of young men spread out last night looking for stores to loot, intimidate drivers caught at stop lights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) These protests are not cohesive, or organized centrally. Just people outraged by latest death in police custody of a black man. They're energized and angry. I don't think these protests are going to die down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few observations after covering #dcprotests #GeorgeFloyd 1) the vast majority of protestors oppose unprovoked attacks on police. I saw groups shout down loners throwing rocks at police, attacking police cars. Majority want a forceful, peaceful protest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet was a literacy test for his followers. 53.5k failed (and counting)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SanhoTree All this as DC is now a national hotspot. As I say cretins. (our building says it won't even "ask" people to wear masks).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanhoTree Cretins in my building cram in to the lift without masks. The basics. The media finds it hard to report that a good percentage of people are simply put: shitheads. We all know it, but it's hard to put that in to news jargon on a front-page. But by ignoring it, we remove agency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanhoTree Then all is lost. DC people have seen what happened in China, in Italy, Spain, in NY - just 4 hours up the highway. And still act like it won't hit here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tinojaramillo @CasaAmarilla @SergioGuzmanE @ColombiaCalling @JuanitaGoe @PizarroMariaJo Fair question on whether she she should or not be appointed, but there is a huge difference between the AUC and M-19.

<|startoftext|>@Tinojaramillo @CasaAmarilla @SergioGuzmanE @ColombiaCalling @JuanitaGoe @PizarroMariaJo Agreed that the left shouldn’t own “reconicilation” but the truth is that parts of the right have fought against reconciliation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This type of work is urgently needed. Most interesting would be someone from a producing/transit country analyze the consuming countries (as so many consuming-country journalists have reported on production). Foreign eyes can sometimes see things natives miss.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf That company burned through all my good-will with their constant 300,000 pesos to change a ticket. And it’s never been as cool as Air Colombia  https://t.co/wdl8FQ5NDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf I get it. Millions of people favor one policy, monied interests favor another. The result is never even close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf Nuanced or not, it does go against popular will. Avianca went from world-class customer service to one of the most miserable in a question of a couple of years. I’d let it sink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t seen one Colombian express sorrow over this or any support for a bailout. Yet the government will send this foreign company money because that’s the way the world runs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks. Indications are that lockdown is hurting cocaine in Colombia, as the slowdown in legal international trade deprives it of hiding places. The knock-on effect is that prices look to be rising in consuming countries due to scarcity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great profile of a former FARC rebel. I met “Paola” in the war, a secret camp deep in the jungle as the FARC still fought. I’ve watched her over the years, the optimism of the peace process, then a cynicism about the “new Colombia” and a sometime nostalgia for the jungle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SergioGuzmanE Agreed. The one that blows my mind is that with all the misery, poverty and dysfunction in Venezuela, they don’t produce a gram of cocaine. The border area in Colombia is filled with coca and yet nothing just meters across the border. How do we explain that one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaredGoyette @Borderlands @TheDivisionGame  https://t.co/VO6Qm5RqLu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love to see these photos of the book in the wild.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure at least one government will be overthrown before this is over. Across developing world, hundreds of millions of people who work cash in hand have no income and there are few plans to help them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fbajak @PJAsmann That town’s story is different. In Berrio, it’s not just taking the bodies out of the river, it’s the adoption of the souls by the living that impresses me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JZulver @meganjanetsky @jennieerinsmith @PJAsmann @OliverKaplan @anamarjona @GwenBurnyeat Will check out their work. The kings and queens of resistance are the Nasa - to see them disarm a unit of FARC fighters peacefully and then dismantle an army base the next day, all to throw “armed actors” out of their territory is breath-taking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeparkdan @meganjanetsky @jennieerinsmith @PJAsmann Charging? I saw a shift in Colombia as to how press was treated. At first was almost reverential and a belief your report would rectify whatever was the injustice. In time, many lost hope that press would change things and more would charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meganjanetsky @jennieerinsmith @PJAsmann I heard so many reporters went there, the people involved were now charging for interviews and the lovely woman with the lottery (in my boo) stopped talking to the press entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meganjanetsky @jennieerinsmith @PJAsmann I told Tom about the place, as I was just back from filming for a documentary when he was here researching his book. Like San Jose peace community, it’s an important story we keep going back to because it does highlight the good amid the evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennieerinsmith @PJAsmann I’ll look out for it. It’s such an incredible story that explains so much about the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people of that community are so special - ordinary souls carrying out acts of charity in the face of evil. Thanks Parker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jim is one of Latin America’s top reporters - and much more talented than me - so read his work and trust his book recommendations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agreed. If your plan is for people to stay at home for months on end, while millions are unemployed and no hope of getting a job - you don’t have a plan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tune in to this - will be a live talk on the sex, murder and treachery of the cocaine trade. Lots of photos, videos and music from the underworld.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Publishers Weekly called it “beautifully written...This gripping account will linger in the mind of readers.”  Crimereads calls it one of March's best True Crime, “a staggering work of reportage and social analysis.”  USA Today named it as one of their “5 books not to miss.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just how quickly we’ve fallen from the optimism of 2016’s peace to mass slaughter of human rights leaders, narco-militias running parts of country and record amounts of cocaine has been tragic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombia had a record 212,000 hectares of coca in 2019, a new record (says US). Violence is rising as Colombia’s countryside slides further in to drug chaos. There is more #cocaine around the world than ever before.<|endoftext|>

You think he can pull off change in Venezuela? And how is Chaivismo responsible for Tumaco? Ituango? Buenaventura? Uraba?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf But imagine a functioning state that genuinely cared about fighting corruption.

<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf What was really striking was how that day last year hundreds of soldiers defected, thousands of civilians at the border waited hours in the sun for a plan, and Guaido spent the whole day in an air-conditioned office watching events unfold on tv.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alfredo82733335 @Uber_Col And who loses here? The Colombian consumer. A deal between govt and a gremio that deprived consumer of a much-wanted alternative. Always the Colombian consumer loses to the bigger interests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfredo82733335 @Uber_Col Uber provided a good service but I left in 2017, so maybe it got worse. But they can’t cheat as much as las muñecas in what 75% of Bogotá’s taxis? Every taxi that picks you up at the airport will cheat you - every single time I’ve had to argue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uber leaves Colombia, a result of deal between govt supporters and taxi union not to support protests. BUT Bogotá’s taxis are widely loathed (they cheat passengers, rude).

<|startoftext|>4km in 24:51. 12 degrees. Doesn’t feel like it’s getting easier. Slight neck ache, lower back ache - stretch more and better. Goal is 5km in 25:00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4km in 25:41. Never have I so wanted to give up but still pushed on. Goal is 5km in 25:00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4km in 24:50 8 degrees. Late rally of energy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This shows how historic these protests are - Colombia’s celebrities tend to be conformist and “non-political” which in reality usually translates to center-right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>23-min run 4.1 km. 7 degrees. New record. Goal 5km.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a lot of fun - an interesting talk on how the cocaine trade evolved to record production and how the FARC peace process was the largest upheaval in cocaine since death of Pablo Escobar (all covered in the book)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf I believe she rejected imprisonment but is allowing the case to advance   https://t.co/R9pigHbMm1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf Yes I pointed out the terrorism out when the first judge denied her imprisonment. But other charges include false documents, public obstruction, vandalism, so even if the ridiculous terrorism charge is discarded, she still faces legal jeopardy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gpbfinance I think there’s a hopelessness that traditional politics can bring about the changes Colombia needs. Some support march, others oppose it. But no one likes the way Duque has governed so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gpbfinance She’s managed to unify divided Colombia: everyone hates her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the latest entry of our dumb world: a Colombian social media star filmed herself smashing up a bus stop during protests. Damage was $400,000, says bus company. She now faces up to 8 years in prison if convicted - and how can she not be? She filmed herself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>22-min run 3.8 kms. Slow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes Yes, Duque is irreversibly wounded by this. But he won’t jump to the center, he will be pushed by the right-wing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGisSERIOUS The bigography of the intellectual godfather of Italian fascism Gabriele D’Annunzio is very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes Santos never lost La U. He took the broader-based party from Uribe. Do you think Duque could take CD (whose logo is Uribe) from the ex-President? I definitely don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes Trump has a lot more support than Duque and has a clear constituency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes Ok but in a same vein that Trump may have space to avoid congress impeachment articles by becoming a Democrat. It’s possible but it won’t happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes I see what you mean but I can’t see it happening. But it looks like things are moving quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A founding member of Colombia’s modern right-wing movement suggests president should temporarily step down and let his Vice President govern. Duque has never been loved by Colombia’s right-wing. #ParoNacional #Cacerolazo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes But all those compromises would alienate him from not just Uribe but everyone in his party. He’s trapped - he can’t demand a fair impartial investigation in to what killed #DilanCruz because his supporters have already publicly decided: it was an accident, move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The pots and pans protests in Colombia’s congress - I’ve never seen anything like this. The government must be worried   #Cacerolazo #ParoNacional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes And what would be the cost the middle would demand to SAVE his presidency? And will these protests be pacified by centrists? Doubtful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes It doesn’t look too powerful right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaissanceAlf @CarlosCortes But who will embrace him? Right now he’s a sinking weight. And his problem is that no one wants him - not enough Uribe for the right, too much Uribe for everyone else. Right now I’m focused on marches - it’s 50-50 if they can keep it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good summation of the reasons for Colombia’s protests #ParoNacionalColombia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColombiaCalling @SergioGuzmanE Don’t see many options for him. The protests demand less “mano firme”, Duque supporters want more “mano firme”. Protestors want less Uribe, the backing of Uribe is what keeps Duque in power. I don’t see how he squares this (except to wait and hope protests wither away)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombian politicians are expressing their “sadness” over police killing of a protestor. Protestors are screaming “murder”. Politicians do not understand the anger in these demonstrations #DilanCruz #ParoNacional25N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A young man injured by Colombia’s riot police just died. These protests just got a lot more difficult for the government #ParoNacionalColombia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If this is sustained, could be very bad for government and politics as usual there. Colombia’s political class is exhausted, no idea how to address the deep, cruel problems facing the country. Colombia is much more precarious than it seems. #ParoNacional21N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Friends - when reading about a new #book, what is it that convinces you to buy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matyoukee I wonder if that’s enough. We’ve lost a culture of people paying to be informed with accurate information (see collapse of local papers). Don’t know how to recover that. If we don’t, we’re doomed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brutal front page (Osborne is the paper’s editor and was fired from the cabinet by May when she took office).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gpbfinance I think this is right. It’s so financially precarious, smart people from working class and middle class (the bedrock of this profession) are skipping journalism, leaving it to the children of the wealthy. This explains why journalism is getting worse and is out of touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyjsburton Marry wealthy or work hard to be born in to money. That’s what journalists are doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being a journalist is now like becoming an actor - the odds are so overwhelmingly against any young person making a financially solvent career of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace @JSymmesCobb To clarify a point that wasn't clear to me: which territories are these that only have FARC in 2017-2? They must exist, but I'm struggling to name a former FARC zone that by 2017-2 doesn't have any incursion by Urabenos, ELN, EPL, Oficina, other cartels or dissidents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace But is anyone arguing a 1:1 causality? Surely it’s more the FARC laid down their weapons, this was a firing pistol for cartels, other guerrillas and paras to grab the ex-FARC coca-rich land across the country, and like all previous incursions they targeted social leaders first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>During Duque’s campaign, they pushed the message he will be his own man, independent of Uribe. Reminder: he is the candidate for a party that’s logo is literally Uribe in silhouette.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of talk about the new Colombian politics given the 9 million votes that went for Petro and Fajardo. But if anything the vote was for the past, with the return of Uribe to power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many who voted for Fajardo  mock the new outreach attempts by Petro supporters after they were criticized for being centrists in election campaign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald I wish you had started this saying that because would have saved us both a lot of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald so you don't want a peace deal. FARC will fight to the death before that deal. That's your position and accept it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald how would you know? You met FARC? threats? FARC are desperate to stop it happening but many fear it coming if they're in limbo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald Si campaign ran spectrum - from FARC sympathizers to those who suffered most but want a peace deal now. Not controversial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald again - I ask again. Because if you didn't hear that phrase castrochavismo I honestly doubt how many No voters you spoke to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald you think every member of No wants a peace deal? Not one wants unconditional surrender of FARC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald with high risk of FARC disintegrating and the coca regions descending in to chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald you know well that part of No is to disrupt peace talks &amp; accept no responsibility. Part of No doesn't want any realistic deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald you deny the gays and castrochavismo were part of the  No voters fears?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald Toribio and Bojaya are not rich as you well know. And no not all Colombians are victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald so if No leaders have no responsibility, they shouldn't have power. Simple as that. Skin in the game or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald but you were talking about the power of the No win. So in theory, govt can change a comma, so changing the deal and pass it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald so castrochavismo was a realistic fear? The gays? Where is that in the deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald this is sleight of hand - not everyone is a victim. Voters rejected the deal. Don't talk it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald why? That people accept responsibility for their vote? They did it and now live with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald @cubanahumana absolutely. But don't pretend No wasn't equally dirty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald some were tricked by gays and Castrochavismo. You get the vote and you're responsible for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald @cubanahumana that attitude is exactly what encourages unrealistic proposals from No, knowing won't be blamed. All responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald no one disputes that. But Ingrid's words (&amp; Bojaya &amp; Toribio) are powerful because they suffered so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald true. But many did forgive - including most hard hit towns, Bojaya and Toribio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald @cubanahumana no one honestly thinks a new peace deal will be easy, quick or even a certainty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald @cubanahumana obv I don't opine on whether should or not - but high profile cases largely do (obv not totally representative)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartOswald @cubanahumana fair enough. But does that mean if one person can't forgive the entire peace process should be ditched?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackAldwinckle @MissEllieMae just a coincidental surge of out of mainstream right-wing victories?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissEllieMae makes sense. But why social democracy decline? Too wedded to neoliberalism and globalization that hasn't worked for majority?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MissEllieMae there's something that connects Brexit, the Colombian vote and Trump. I can't quite put my finger on it. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't see any reason for No campaign to be flexible in talks w/ #FARC - they have momentum, any compromise will look weak to supporters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now political party delegates will meet with government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly can't see how these new talks don't drag on for years. Some in No want new peace deal, but others don't want any peace at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chaos of new negotiations has begun. Leading No political party will not meet with Colombian Prez. #colombia #FARC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa @MartinxHodgson @spaceforpeace That myth took a beating anoche. &amp; as paisa friend said: "We need to talk about Antioquia"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace @isisgiraldoa @MartinxHodgson take even something like the unified FARC - so different in Caguan from Choco, Cauca etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinxHodgson @spaceforpeace @isisgiraldoa Agreed. Patterns are replicated across country, but local dynamics are always paramount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace @isisgiraldoa agreed. but the focus I think should be more on the local than national. The real malevolence comes locally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace @isisgiraldoa no excuse - but how do you send civilian engineers in to build a highway if an armed group has said no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can only imagine the entire govt's negotiating team want to quit - 4 long years of talks are about to turn in to chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa @spaceforpeace but lack of infrastructure is not clear cut. Locals blamed FARC for lack of decent roads in Macarena<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceforpeace @isisgiraldoa &amp; parts where even soldiers don't go. Certainly Wayuu blame their own leaders more than state (in my experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa Absence of state was also justification for paras - when it turned out the paras never could have existed without state help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa Abandoned by the state is wrong way of looking at it. Not defending state, but money is sent, but most stolen by local elites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa Not necessarily abstention when Hurricane Matthew is passing through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa Yes, heard that too. But this is the curse of the Colombian - the apathetic cynicism. Big reason why Colombia is the way it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa I think an overwhelming sentiment was: "I haven't felt war recently. Makes no difference to me. Can't be bothered to vote."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some 360 video of daily life in a #FARC camp, filmed during group's historic 10th conference #colombia  https://t.co/wqwDPi9MDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isisgiraldoa True - but abstaining can also be a sign of just can't be bothered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These photos of supporters of the peace deal crying when they realize Colombia has rejected it are heart-breaking #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going on @bbcworldservice right now to talk about #colombia #FARC #ColombiaDecide - come listen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoBrvs Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoBrvs Right, but is a minority here who do oppose all talks, wanting to crush the FARC militarily - hasn't been possible for 50 years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to hear more, I'll be on @bbcworldservice Newsday talking #FARC #Colombia starting at midnight Colombian time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possible result of no vote: mid-range #FARC lose faith in process. Lots to tempt them back to the jungle (coca taxes, illegal gold mines)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No campaign almost certain to demand prison for #FARC. FARC won't accept - prison would be conceding their fight was illegal &amp; illegitimate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All voices, #FARC, govt, No voters, conciliatory tonight. Deceptive - masks the utter chaos the new negotiations are likely to be #colombia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paramilitaries were drug-traffickers before becoming paramilitaries.  https://t.co/2W4Haj2hC5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are basic facts wrong in this. Betancourt was kidnapped after the collapse of peace talks.  https://t.co/2W4Haj2hC5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing a lot of this tonight on twitter among Yes people "I feel ashamed to be Colombian. It's one of the stupidest societies I've known..."  https://t.co/A6076P9XEX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. accepting humiliating terms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. the military wing - which has been dominant for so long - will reject a deal. There are hardcore fighters in the #FARC who will not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. keep fighting if needs be. The FARC was clear - this was a peace deal between equals. If it changes in to surrender negotiations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. Miscalculations being made right now - those who think #FARC will accept anything for peace are wrong. Yes, FARC was battered, but it can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mfsa56 Many small farmers want peace, but the rural elites are some of the most radical voices against the deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some voices of those both supporting and opposing the peace deal in a great piece by @snolen #colombia  https://t.co/cexSYd5to4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Official statement from #FARC - pledge to continue peace process, acknowledges difficulty of challenge to be accepted by Colombian society  https://t.co/gs7LOnfpc0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear after Colombian Prez's speech - just like #brexit, there was no Plan B for a No victory. #ColombiaDecide #FARC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FARC rebels told me 10 days ago that they wanted to see Yes win by 70% so peace deal could have enough popular support #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>famous when a TV anchor called Colombia "a shitty country" after most famous comedian was murdered, Jaime Garzon.  https://t.co/4DNvD4nK2f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of bitterness tonight on twitter among those who supported peace deal. Seeing a lot the phrase "pais de mierda", this was made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#whatsapp was hugely important for No campaign. Everyone had that friend who forwarded msgs, often with distortions, opposing the deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astonishing that Sec. State Kerry, world leaders, were here a week ago to celebrate a peace deal that will probably now be renegotiated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>much more radical, want to see FARC crushed. Legacy of past battles in countryside when FARC held sway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting how split Colombian elites are: 1) urban elites want peace deal, consider war an impediment to more investment. 2) Rural elites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombian Prez. says the victory of "No" opens up a "new political reality", signaling will work with opposition in peace talks.  https://t.co/27Hk6arIwH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombian prez suggests will consult with opposition over peace talks. They'll insist on stiffer punishment for #FARC and rebels will reject<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Addressing the nation, Colombia Prez. says ceasefire with the FARC will continue. Some had feared this vote could see Colombia return to war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My neighborhood was solidly Yes - very quiet tonight as people digest result. Those who supported peace deal are heart-broken #ColombiaVota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cartels, political violence, re-integrating #FARC guerrillas etc. Vote shows Colombia is bitterly divided. #ColombiaVota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't emphasize enough how tough the peace deal was going to be to implement - needed a united Colombia to tackle paramilitaries, drug (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Video of those who voted No. They sing: "The dictatorship will fall" (only small % of Colombians would call president a "dictator")  https://t.co/SJkqy5EggJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The FARC keeps it desire for peace and repeats its readiness to use only its word as an arm of construction" "Timochenko", head of the FARC  https://t.co/7qAu4jD7lT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FARC guerrillas tell @CaracolRadio in private that they will continue with the peace deal. No official reaction yet #ColombiaVota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombia so polarized is awful - country has long history of political violence. Mafias already vowed to murder ex-rebels in certain parts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man said he feared #FARC would do well as a political party &amp; would turn Colombia socialist. In that case, he'd join illegal paramilitaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many similarities w/Trump, Brexit and #ColombiaVota. Many saw Yes win as a forgone conclusion. Voters gave them a surprise No #ColombiaVota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A week ago #Colombia was talking of reconciliation. Tonight voters said no to that - for the time being #ColombiaVota #FARC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombian president due to address the nation in 40 minutes. No one, save him, has a clue what he will say? #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For many city-dwellers, civil war is a memory as #FARC pushed out of cities. Many didn't see reason to appease the FARC #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to note - those places that suffered most in the war, voted yes to the peace deal (Toribio, Bojaya) #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President is one of most unpopular in the world, but this wasn't about him - most No voters really did just oppose the deal #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many feel FARC unrepentant - they started their apologies for atrocities too late. #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With an equal resources, i believe the "no" vote would have won by more than 60% #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FARC also reject prison as it would suggest their fight was illegitimate when even today they are proud of the "struggle" #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FARC's position is: no one ever negotiated themselves in to a prison cell #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many rebels will serve any prison time still unclear under peace accord, but bet is very, very few #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why No won - many want to see #FARC serve prison time. Also, didn't want to see them in Senate as per peace deal #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as many Colombians are desperate for a drink to get over the result or celebrate, selling booze suspended for the vote #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course president could ignore opposition demands. #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opposition openly declaring they will join in peace talks. Expect total chaos as those who hate #FARC try to negotiate with guerrillas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>50% of #Colombia is in shock. Other 50% celebrating like it won a football trophy. Perfectly polarized over #FARC #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_GeorgeRoberts agreed risky. But Petro, ex guerrilla, was able to become mayor of Bogotá. Not as bad as it once was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_GeorgeRoberts @DGisSERIOUS down from when paramilitaries boasted that they controlled 33%, but some still there, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_GeorgeRoberts @DGisSERIOUS yes big chance some will be killed. #FARC factor in some deaths - political violence is brutal here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilclevine ok - sorry for my pissy attitude. I read it wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Polls got this #FARC vote totally wrong. "Shy Tory" (people loath to admit what they believe to be unpopular opinions)? #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FARC have yet to comment but these results are disastrous for their hopes of re-entering Colombia society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilclevine was it: "I'm tweeting something blindingly obvious that doesn't really need to be said"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First reactions from Colombia presidency: emergency meeting with ministers to analyze the results #ColombiaDecide #FARC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opposition openly saying that they'll be negotiating with #FARC  https://t.co/66Jp1uLQx8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opponents of peace deal want FARC to serve prison time, No voters. This is out of the question for the FARC. Impasse #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "yes" campaign had massive institutional support. And was relying on a notoriously corrupt part of Colombia for votes #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peace deal signed a week ago with world leaders as witnesses. Does president turn his back on that or on the popular vote? #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those that suffered the worst of FARC violence voted in favour of peace talks #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/rUKrL2Ox6t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now people wait to see what president will do? Previously said was "unthinkable" to renegotiate the 4 years of talks #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilclevine is the sheesh meant to mean something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 Colombians have told me they feel "shame" for the No result. Very similar to Remain supporters the day after #Brexit  #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes supporters cry as they watch returns. This is gut-wrenching for the peace deal supporters #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/26RZO2Tdu2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far-reaching ramifications of this "no" vote. With such hostility to them, #FARC must be having 2nd thoughts on peace deal #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday, media confidently speculated Colombia would win Nobel Peace Prize for peace deal. Today voters rejected it #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even left-wing Bogotá could muster more than 56% for the Yes vote. #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/cZ30WhaPkT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombia is voting against a peace deal that would end 52-years of civil war. I've never seen anything like it #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No is pulling further ahead. Difficult to see Yes winning. No one knows what happens now #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/JUTrG0eq54<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These results are devastating for the government's peace process #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"No" is pulling ahead. #Brexit again? #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/WW6FYUYfEs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is less 1,000 votes difference in national plebiscite #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/4uwZon9RP5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Si"'s lead down to less than 0.05%  https://t.co/MI7LQyOTAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Context: previous polls had almost all suggested "si" would win by at least 60% #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus...."si" is winning by 11,000 votes.  https://t.co/mBr5OjktoI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rkrystalli could well be. And Colombia equally clueless about what to do if that's the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some provinces voting overwhelming for no #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/xP4Y0tzeJF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rkrystalli sure. But this is a shocker to everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Narrowed even more #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/3d9RqAsdvR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "yes's" lead is narrowing. Still early, but another #Brexit? #ColombiaDecide  https://t.co/7HXp6Y6nbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rkrystalli 5 minutes ago. I think even a win this small is a catastrophe for this process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First results coming for Colombian plebiscite and much, much closer than thought #ColombiaDecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andresmayr una muy buena actitud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andresmayr necesita que todos dejan de estigmatizar los ex-combatientes, darles trabajos, viviendas etc. Esto no pasara con 55%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andresmayr Estoy de acuerdo. Pero este proceso necesita un cambio completo en Colombia para que funcione. 55% seria muy mal resultado.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>approved with a small margin, ominous sign for its future. In private, FARC say they'd like to see at least 70% voting to approve. (3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombia change too. In order to tackle paramilitaries, cocaine industry and other rebels, a united country is needed. If the deal is (2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today Colombia votes on historic peace process. The deal needs a massive win, because to implement it requires both the FARC change and (1)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@longdrivesouth But Colombia is drawing a difference between tackling cartels and the old war with FARC 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@longdrivesouth agreed. And war on drugs has turned much of Americas in to bloody zones. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@longdrivesouth Colombia's violence will continue - as will Mexico's - but more as a judicial issue rather than a military issue.<|endoftext|>
