<|startoftext|>@NicolaSturgeon @theSNP Speaking as a Remainer, please explain to me the logic &amp; democracy in selling a New Deal to Leavers whilst fog-horning "Remain" to them, and expecting them to have any faith in the Deal, and in Remainer MPs carrying out the Deal if the PV results in leave again?

<|startoftext|>@LaboursBlackPLP @DawnButlerBrent Speaking as a Remainer, what would be the point of presenting a New Labour Deal to Leavers if you are going to try &amp; persuade them to Remain?

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn @johnmcdonnellMP Jeremy, May I suggest that you do a podcast and put to rest the nuanced smear from certain Labour MPs about your so-called "neutrality which, as a Remainer, I personally see as mature leadership on your part for both leavers &amp; remainers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljswalker Corbyn's so-called neutrality is leadership: he is giving a voice to both leavers &amp; remainers.

<|startoftext|>@jessphillips I am a passionate Labour Remainer. Corbyn's so-called "neutrality" is mature leadership: he is listening to the voices of both Leavers &amp; Remainers. If this drip drip attack on him continues, I will leave the Party. Stop it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlanVRK And btw, the "victory" was in response to a tweet you have since deleted comparing our chat to the Neil &amp; Boris interview - me being the "f-ing" latter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanVRK IThen let's take a pause on this, and come back to each other when either Channel debates again about Trump and Race, which undoubtedly will happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanVRK It's not a "no" but in the absence of providing you with specific examples, and your refusal it seems to check out the pattern I spoke about (it's nuanced so not headline grabbing on SM), then by all means claim this as a victory or whatever you choose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanVRK Because there is a pattern to these debates: whenever the issue of Trump's racism is discussed, the referee from CNN or the BBC will steer any allegation of extremism towards Trump's "associations" or excuse it as Trumpian "dog whistles". Self preservation probably. "Wow" indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanVRK Check out any future debates about Trump &amp; race related issues on any of their talking heads debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of that line by #YusufIslam: "Remember the days of the old school-yard"...It's baffling why #CNN &amp; our state-funded #BBC are at pains to insist that #Trump isn't a White Supremacist. Let's be clear: that steaming pile of shit in the White House is #KKK to the marrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why couldn't #BBC have waited until after #EHRC's Inquiry? #Panorama shed nothing new on the allegations.

<|startoftext|>After being rightly praised for his interrogation of #Johnson, #AndrewNeil is now leaking comments from sources close to the US/UK that anti-Brexit #Darroch had a personal axe to grind against #Trump.

<|startoftext|>Great TV, but pointless now that the horse has bolted. #Johnson's PR prepped him on the Gatt 24 thingy to make him look prime ministerial but he chose to wing it, bordering on self-parody, because "Boris is Boris", the vote has been cast, and it's shoe-in for #BBC's posterboy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Why muddy what you have achieved with this backstory based on hearsay?; hearsay,  which, like Oakeshott's "scoop", is not in the national interest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson After reading Guido's tweet also I looked at Mr Patel's account going back to 2017 when it ended &amp; his archives: there was a long thread from him in April 19 warning of the resurgance of the far right &amp; nazism/hitler being a path not 2b travelled again. What is his offence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie Thanks again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie I am grateful you stuck with me &amp; taught this technophobe about searchboxes. Please dont think otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie Now the tweet has appeared, the previous one you sent was about football.  Grateful, but a pity there's no thread as his tweets are long. I'll message him myself. Thanks &amp; good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie @ExInspectorBDS @Baddiel ok last tweet: are you able to share the thread of the offending tweet. If not, we'll leave it here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@budgie @ExInspectorBDS @Baddiel How did you come across the tweet dated 2015?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie @ExInspectorBDS @Baddiel You can read the April 19 tweets. I've scrolled to the end of his tweets looking for the one you &amp; Guido uploaded dated 2015, and Abdullah's page ends at 2017. Perhaps its my PC: could you upload the full thread from the guy's page containing the tweet you &amp; Guido have shared?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie @ExInspectorBDS @Baddiel I meant his tweets only go back to 2017. Have a read of his long tweet dated 6th April 2019 which might explain my curiousity about the source of Guido's tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgie @ExInspectorBDS @Baddiel His page ends at 2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes @AbdullahPatel94 Guido, For clarity, could you state the date of the above tweet from @AbdullahPatel94 so I can read it in full myself? I've checked his page; his tweets are long, for example  one dated 6th April 19 whch may be of interest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3/3 Not everyone is fooled by Johnson. Perhaps most aren't. But such is the Media's hatred of Corbyn, coupled with influences from within &amp; outside his Party bent on seeing him gone, the Collective Fatigue may, knowingly, favor the distraction, spin &amp; bullshit of his opponent...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/3 - cont'd And during the "BoJoMania" Johnson will as usual dispense with door knocking &amp; town hall meetings to debate policies - unless they're photo-ops with his base.

<|startoftext|>2/3 - cont'd Unlike his bus-buddy Farage,  who at least is out there conning the Many for the Few, Johnson is a parasite waiting for when the shit settles to feed off the Collective Meltdown of the Many,  and by-gone memories of a time that existed only in Gainsborough Pictures..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/3 - cont'd We must never underestimate the potential in the Cult of Johnson. His timing is perfect and he knows it.  The UK's appetite is growing for the Tories' usual scapegoats, and he will stir that Pot, sprinkling it with his brand of self-deprecation &amp; cynical buffoonery.,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tom_watson I read in the Guardian that you received 50 complaints this week of anti-semitism and you handed them to Corbyn for him to take a personal lead. Isn't there a process of investigation before the complaints reach your boss's desk, beginning with your personal lead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 @jeremycorbyn I am Labour, and a Remainer wanting a Final Say; but since I am not a Party Leader with the overview required for that post, what specific evidence (verifiable facts) do you have that Corbyn is aiming to harm the poorest and most vulnerable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian So, the Deputy Leader received 50 complaints this week, and landed them on his Boss's desk to take a personal lead. Is there not a process of investigation before the complaints reach that stage? : beginning with the Deputy Leader taking a personal lead himself?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet @theresa_may @HouseofCommons The stench of Murdoch is never far from May; here she is again, accusing Corbyn of preferring to negotiate with Hezbollah and The IRA.  For a start he wasn't Labour leader then. Thather's associations with fascist dictators is a mere blip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV Don't be put off by the twee title, this is a fantastic t and riveting tribute to the Unsung.  Worth repeated viewings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson A digger is appropriate for the hole you are digging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Given there are no facts to back up Buzzfeed's expose, which makes no sense for an experienced rag and borders on career kamikaze, the response from the Mueller's Team, to my mind,  is a nuanced one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo A fine speech and tribute to King; the "brown menace", not the bed sheet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV Great news. Hope you get the rights to The Vise series also produced by the Danziger Brothers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV This was a love affair between Lean and Venice. Ok, the two leads are great too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidDuguidMP @sff_uk And so the drama ended today with the two dead weights waiting for their leaders to fall: Watson  &amp;  Gove. So much hot air from both must have set back our clean air target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet @theresa_may @HouseofCommons Watching the debate now, and, considering her historic defeat yesterday, I find the PM's attitude today baffling and disturbing. Given that BoJo the clown has no chance, is not an excuse to be basking so publicly at least in the knowledge that her position is safe for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baddiel @Dannythefink @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I voted Remain. 2 years on, knowing so much more than I did back then, my decision has strengthened for the same principles that governed me.

<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine @Jamelia I should be appalled by Jamelia's comment, but I am not because there is a kernel of sense in what she says, though for the moment I cant put my finger on it. I'll let it evolve before I join the twitter mob rage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarryChammies @mermhart @BillieJeanKing @andy_murray Reading tweets from those who can't, yet judge, is like wading through an ocean of failures' sludge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dukeofhazards @maxpaul82 @AtheistRepublic @andy_murray Ben, his victim, forgave him 13 years ago, yet 13 years on the so-called Pastor chose to justify his abuse. This child abuser is contrite because his abuse is on social media, no other reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USArmy Cute kid, appalling propaganda bordering on abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfreewright Note to self; Stop watching this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV A few question marks aside, this is still a chilling atmospheric cult classic I'd gladly watch again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlokeInBath @SteveBarclay @DExEUgov Ditto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlokeInBath @SteveBarclay @DExEUgov My understanding of Brexit has evolved considerably since that binary decision to leave or remain.

<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV Inman's comic timing is masterful, and the chemistry between him &amp; Lenska works. Strange the series didn't catch on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMBofficial Will be buying this. One of my great regrets is that I gave all of my Miller vinyls - most of them originals- to a charity shop and replaced them with CDs. Nothing wrong with CDs,  but giving away my vinyls still hurts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Your politics is like your hair; all over the place, but there's no hiding the bald facts about your motives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV Love this series, love Frank, but his "learn to cook" advice delivered with such gravitas made me chuckle and cringe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2010LeeHurst Sorry to burst your Britannia bubble, Lee, but whatever you call it - Chequers, Cheggers, Chuckers - we'll still be in the EU post Brexit, and  BoJo's "flag waving picaninnies with water melon smiles" will be among those waiting to fill our WTO begging bowl.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo The best message i think that could be sent out by CNN is an appeal that this doesn't result in a tit-for-tat tragedy. And for the record, Trump is absolutely responsible for this, and his spineless mid-term mob in the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2010LeeHurst Be responsible, Lee. A People's vote is on the Deal, or please enlighten us on what a No Deal means.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@i_am_mill_i_am @TalkingPicsTV Its worth reading Cheever's short story to marvel how this film manages to remain faithful to its 12 pages whilst fleshing it out to over 90 minutes of riveting viewing. Lancaster is like a fallen god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephensackur A snippet of the Beeb's green and pleasant land for the few, not the many. I tuned in to HardTalk to  listen to @yanisvaroufakis , but as usual I was shouting throughout  for you to shut the f-up and let him speak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV - Enjoying your Channel very much. Hopefully one day you will find and show a little known British film from 1959 titled "The Child and The Killer" (also known as "Man In The Shadows") with Ryck Rydon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV I wonder if the reason why this gem bombed was because it depicted a woman who knew what she wanted and went for it. Munro achieved what few actors are able to, that is to be both unlikable and sympathetic that you are actually rooting for at her most selfish and manipulative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV A reminder that the glamorous Diana Dors was also a gifted, but alas underrated actress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkingPicsTV Brilliant cast,  superb script, and breathtaking photography. This version can never be bettered, imo.,<|endoftext|>
