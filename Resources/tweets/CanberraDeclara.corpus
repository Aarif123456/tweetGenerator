<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine No worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine Exactly, which is why God gave us free will. Many of us spirit filled Christians have seen the miracles and heard the still small voice of God, so he is very real to us. Comes from relationship with him, we choose to seek and serve him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine No. It's actually freedom, to be reconciled with our creator. Jesus is really into personal relationship, it's not religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine Wow! Deep questions. It's a way of connecting to him, but also he is worthy. Hard for us to really understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RitaPanahi Horrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine By want him, I mean seek him, search for him and once found, give our lives freely to him in service and worship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine No, they are two different things...our having free will is not taking power away from God. He wants us to want him, not be a pack of robots who have to want him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tily_ben @mirandadevine He has given us free will, and that unfortunately allows humans to do horrific things. I assure you he cares deeply, and those who cry out to him will be saved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightsLGBTI @LyleShelton @wendyjoyfrancis So, all of a sudden after many generations, believing that marriage between 1 man + 1 woman is normal, is now hate speech.  Can you seriously hear yourself? We all need to respect those who disagree with us without the name calling.<|endoftext|>
