<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley Oh! You're aiming that at me - it was quite hard to tell as I though you were describing yourself! That's another one for the ad hominem counter for the people keeping count<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley Zing! And that's another ad hominem (for the people at home). I forgot I had to use simple words. Would it be better to say that it doesn't exist ANYMORE as it does seem that a lot of the militia were arrested in the 1990s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley I think you're right as it does seem that all the members are in prison, or have been executed, for terrorist attacks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley I thought it was a figure of speak that would be better illustrated as an image  Can you answer this question: Apart from the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia are there any other Constitutional Militia thought of as a terrorist organisation?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley @realDonaldTrump I think you may be stuck in a loop unless that's your default position of mentioning facts without producing any<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley It is good, especially the bit where it mentions using violence to get their ideas across<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry that you feel that you need another ad hominem attack (is that now the 4th or 5th as I've lost count). Is that to make you feel better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley "Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law" English Bill of Rights 1698 - the document the #2A was based upon but, unfortunately, dropped the last 5 words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Itsgoin2Balrite @CONSMILITIA @stclairashley @realDonaldTrump They lost the argument quite a while ago by trying to shift the "Burden of Proof" (as well as dubious, or unrelated, sources)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley I agree, I've tried to make sense of your website and I just get a headache in the right wing of my brain! Also thanks for the 2nd (or 3rd I've lost count) Ad hominem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Itsgoin2Balrite @CONSMILITIA @stclairashley the 3rd citation is in regards to immigrants being taxed   https://t.co/4iwsR2zQMK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Itsgoin2Balrite @CONSMILITIA @stclairashley I have no idea but the 3rd citation seems to be trying to fit the words to match with their agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CONSMILITIA @Itsgoin2Balrite @stclairashley And the logical fallacies start. You can't pass the "Burden of truth" away as it's your job to prove your point otherwise I will have to accept that you have lost the argument<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Itsgoin2Balrite @CONSMILITIA @stclairashley I am in agreement with that interpretation as well. Only members of an "official state/commonwealth militia" should only be allowed to carry that sort of weapon (AR-15 etc).
