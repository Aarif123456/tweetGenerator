<|startoftext|>@unseen8 @A_Patriot45 @SuaveCl @RosnikRoberta @JoeySalads @JoeBiden The people are doing a great job! And right now, Trump is the leader of the people. Unseen8 please stop talking out both sides of your mouth! Your hypocrisy is showing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustTCB1 @DavidJHarrisJr I switched from Democrat to Republican during our primary. Let‚Äôs go #MAGA2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden #Whodis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler @maddow The Corrupt Fake News media and Democrats will lie to your face just to create news stories for their stations.  #AbsolutelyNoShame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS Great time to have the family clean up the backyard! Summer is just around the corner. üòé<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Oh why don‚Äôt you blow it out your ear Bung hole Biden! Your words are cheap and do nothing to help this country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Susan78English @EarlOfEnough @JoeBiden That‚Äôs funny, The Biden‚Äôs are on the oligarchs payroll not Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuffaloSheepish @NewsCorpse @JoeBiden I know, HA, that Biden is the worst!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdferron @CNN Like Obama did a great job with h1m1 virus in 2010 with 12,469 deaths in the USA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre doing a great job Mr. President!!! But I‚Äôm afraid to say that this was another time that exposed the corruption behind our fake news outlets. Keep your chin, and God Speed to you Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mashable If we decided to do this in the USA, it would cost about 147 billion dollars. If we decided to use the same money to light our freeways, we could illuminate our freeways every night 365 days a year, for 388 years. I don‚Äôt think the solar panels would last 50 years. Bad investment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjljunior @robreiner Planet Hollywood! robreiner is a self serving, Hollywood elitists, cultists, Democrat that knows people in a thriving economy won‚Äôt go to movies. Hollywood thrives only when the country is in depression. Truth be told, That is why they hate Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasReich10 @NYinLA2121 For Democrats it‚Äôs all a hoax! Until your manufacturing jobs go to Mexico and China, your wife almost gets killed by illegals driving a stolen car and thieves break into your home and you have to protect yourself. Then Trump makes sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYinLA2121 I like your thinking!!! Until an illegal, speeding in a stolen car, runs a red light and sends your wife to the hospital. Yup it happened to me and it can happen to you. Hope your family is just as lucky as mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Sorry to burst your bubble, but here are some hard statistics from the World Health Organisation. Unlike our News organizations, they don‚Äôt have a political agenda. Note: the infection rate is going down, not up!  https://t.co/hFpr1CM8LA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wedonopeneyes So the thriving economy is a hoax?! Lowest unemployment ever is a hoax?! So if not Trump? Then who? Biden? Sanders? Warren? Let‚Äôs go back to no jobs, high unemployment, hyper inflation, and believing everything negative that CNN puts out on a daily basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReesusP @realDonaldTrump Our Badass with helmet hair! You go Mr. Trump!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid-19 numbers going down! Statistics from the World Health Organisation proves it‚Äôs a hoax!Stupid Democrats, The President isn‚Äôt saying the virus is a hoax! The hype around it is a hoax. #hoax #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19  https://t.co/wNl7naQ0rU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump Not if the Democrats have anything to do about it! In California, they were about to use an abandoned psych building in a major metropolitan area of Los Angeles to quarantine people with corona virus. Seems like Democrats are planning on spreading the virus for political reasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TainoAraucan @dvillella @realDonaldTrump If a Arrogant, Rich, American offends you? Try a delusional, poor socialist. Maybe surrounding yourself with people lower than yourself will make you feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Bull sheet! The battery industry deal was a complete bust, and if you call creating solar jobs with huge subsidies to stay afloat a real job, you‚Äôre delusional. I had several of those jobs mediocre pay &amp; here today gone tomorrow. With Trump I‚Äôm making 3 times what I made w/Obama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden We have a President that‚Äôs unifying Americans! Unfortunately, Democrats want Americans to unify with illegal immigrants, criminals, terrorist moles &amp; gangs like MS13. Ask yourself why would Democrats support sanctuary cities? What benefit is there? Other than protecting criminals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Bolton suddenly remembering what Trump said last year Hmmmmmmm? Did some of the Ukrainian laundered money make it to Bolton‚Äôs pocket? Just wondering???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden The nerve of this guy wanting more money after discovering he was laundering US tax dollars through the Ukraine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lookinmirror1st @JoeBiden Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yes, imagine how much more money could go to the Ukraine and how many more of the Binden family could be employed, if elected for four years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifesafeast @MeghanMcCain Terrified because Democrats like yourself believe in a Country with no borders, you believe in censoring anyone who doesn‚Äôt side with your side, you believe in creating larger government to take care of everything(ie: healthcare, media, college, etc.)&amp; you believe in higher taxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden That‚Äôs funny! But the crazy, radical, unstable Trump was able do in three years what you weren‚Äôt able to do in 8 years with Obama.  Answer this: Why should we vote for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Got new name for magazine: Activism illustrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Thanks ‚ÄúQuid Pro Joe‚Äù for thinking about us!  Now, how about getting all of us some jobs ‚Äúthat we have absolutely no skills for‚Äù and still get pay millions for doing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Can you lower unemployment further than 3.5%???   If so, why didn‚Äôt you do it when you were Vice President?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enter for your chance to win four tickets and Burnout Zone passes to the NHRA Auto Club Finals   https://t.co/3t1aerCRHg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShepRose That‚Äôs what they want you to believe. Ask yourself, what have the Democrats done besides oppose Trump for 3 years? In regards to Ukraine: it‚Äôs has become much more offensive to ‚Äúask‚Äù what did Joe Biden do, than what Biden did. Now Pelosi &amp; Dems are Pro-war just to oppose Trump???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aworldofgoods @AmyMcGrathKY Who the hell is Amy Garth?! Another radical AOC? Or maybe another Pelosi? No thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet You can thank the Democrats that run the state. Millions of dollars paid to put homeless in hotels, sanctuary city status and the highest social services payouts in the country, attract the right people we need in this State.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Wow! Let‚Äôs start by firing you. Saving our government your $157,000 salary so we can pay 26 families $500/month. @KamalaHarris you idiot there are 76 million struggling families in the US. That would take $456 billion to achieve,That‚Äôs nearly what the US spends on defense each yr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>***Hey everybody I have a Great Idea! ***  Let‚Äôs bring in more undocumented people into the US and let them vote!  Maybe if we bring in enough Hispanics we‚Äôll have a Mexican President or if we bring enough Russians we can have a Russian President! #2020Census<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mathias_venita @OfficialJonZal Haa! Every time Trump sniffs a Democrat dies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders Spoken like a true commie! Let‚Äôs have more Dems in office tell us we are making too much money. And that we have to give more money away, on top of rising taxes to pay for more social services. HEY, Belligerent Bernie, there‚Äôs a reason why these jobs pay $11 They are not careers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Louis V. Apologizes to the World. Paying only the taxes I need to pay, unlike Anna Navarro. Honoring all Americans, unlike Anna. Protecting the USA, unlike Anna. Knowing the world is diverse, unlike Anna. Exposing fake Press, unlike Anna. Knowing correct punctuation, unlike Anna.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler While it‚Äôs in your mouth, honey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC 320 million people in the USA 156 million workers 52 million on welfare $604,000,000,000 / 604 billion dollars spent on welfare That‚Äôs means 2 workers have to support 1 blood sucker. And the Dems want to bring even more social services blood suckers. Enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strike4Earth @dorgal @AOC Nope! Not changing! My focus is on supporting Legal Americans, not non-taxpaying, unloyal, unpatriotic, social services blood suckers that have no plans of becoming legal. American benefits should be reserved for those who become Legal Americans, this way we have accountability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rascal2q @ColHogan @AOC There is no guarantee or safety net that they will become tax payers. It‚Äôs like renting your house to a Dreamer hoping they‚Äôll pay rent after years of living there. But after years of living in your home, they leave and pay nothing. Do you believe this is right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Soooo Stupid!  So you think electric cars run on electricity? More than 90% of our electric power comes from coal. So really electric cars run on coal. And Solar panels wouldn‚Äôt be cost efficient if they weren‚Äôt subsidized with millions of our tax dollars. Get informed idiots!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To @robreiner Besides being a lousy actor, and a ‚Äúhas been‚Äù that wont go away, your critique of #TheRealDonaldTrump who is trying to do something good for my beloved USA, is not needed.
