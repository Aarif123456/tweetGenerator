<|startoftext|>@Timcast  https://t.co/lYAhkLp4Ej lol so many of these YT  channels popped up after the election... and they all go on about the same thing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToBeMiro Just walk into Gamestop and ask them what day it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just trying to see what algorithm Twitter is using to claim things are fake lol... so "ballots" ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump pardon Assange and Snowden   https://t.co/8tmMbREkTI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/oueaR2kYVR @realDonaldTrump   Lol... I never use Twitter but I might need to start sharing @Timcast   #Veritas #Vote2020 #Trump #dontcensorme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/jhmJmBnkOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEBrayWyatt Just going to preemptedly say I'm sorry that you're not treated right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleTalk_TV Apparently she's pregnant, that's why she's vacating the belt. Seems like a waste of a mitb. They should have a tournament for the belt not just trade the mitb in for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PioneerDLs 5-0 with Esper Control  https://t.co/VnYtWROmLf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaberwocki currently 0-2 against you in Pioneer lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemeltzerWON That's going to be creepy. They should green screen an audience lol....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez I shut it off after Shayna v Kairi.. the pace of the match and cries of Asuka feels like they're trying to turn them back to faces?? Guess she'll need contenders after Mania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleTalk_TV Well...it protects Asuka a little before elimination chamber, even though it's obvious what the outcome will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wizards_magic Prediction: Dig Through Time and Treasure Cruise banned in Pioneer   Should ban Inverter of Truth and Underworld Breech banned in Pioneer, but from past ban logic they will just bandage the problem   Unban Splitter Twin in Modern.  Legacy is a "dead format" no changes lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez Because foreigners are "evil". Fans were booing Lynch and Flair at TLC... you'd think backstage would rethink it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm calling it now. Vega is going to turn on Andrade and side with Humberto in a double turn lol... @bryanalvarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez I felt that too... I thought "damn she's injured and is trying to tell Charlotte" and Charlotte kills her anyway. Should job her out for a year to teach her the importance of protecting your opponent...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RusevBUL Lol I'll one up you (646) 712-8115<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReidDuke You're probably the most honest Pro to play the game. Please don't back peddle on your beliefs to make others happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerogan please tell me you saw last nights South Park. It deals with trans athletes lol...Macho Man Randy Savage is the strongest woman alive lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WONF4W CM Punk confirmed lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez Agree... I want to know who watched his match with Balor and thought "this is missing red lights" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez It exposed Braun big time...also the finish kind of craps on WWE finishers being trash compared to Furys right punch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez what's the betting line on WWE repeating the Fork Lift finish in the Seth - Fiend match. My Brother and I talked about it on Friday and the used it on RAW...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemeltzerWON oh and Happy birthday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemeltzerWON the 24/7 title is WWE trying to take Ravens # of title reigns off the record imo, what do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerogan you've probably been asked this a million times.   GSP vs Khabib: Who would win?  #ufc #JRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaheenmtg I think Geist is the closest thing modern has to TNN also. What's really beating it with the proper sword equipped. Lingering Souls is iffy with Plague Engineers :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaheenmtg Nice article, I've been trying to figure out if UW is really the way. Personally Esper &gt; Jeskai. I feel Push is better than Bolt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeHarperWWE Waiting for them to reveal you as Romans attacker lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigDaddyHatch Sorry to hear about your news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wizards_magic I'll take Yuuyas spot in the MPL with 0 pay for the remainder of his year contract  #MTGArena #MagicTheGathering #VeeOhLa2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigDaddyHatch Ebay Auctions already up for the uncut sheets. Looking like 250 average with some sold around 200 already  https://t.co/V71DpcG3RD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigDaddyHatch Did you see WoTC is giving everyone who got their orders canceled a uncut foil sheet of the mythics and rares from war of the spark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wizards_magic I like how you put a limit of "2" on mythic edition war of the spark but this guy got 6 while you canceled my order that was well within the 12k mark  https://t.co/8C5TWTEkQm<|endoftext|>
