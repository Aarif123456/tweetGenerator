<|startoftext|>@vodkanopants I am very sorry to hear this.  Well, again, if you need anything dont hesitate.   I dont think they mean bad. It is, indeed, very poorly expressed.   Tell me what you really want and please allow me to have the honour of offering it to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vodkanopants No problem. So many haters hiding behind a laptop. I should have express myself a bit better to avoid any misunderstanding.   I am following your page regularly you seem like a good person and would really like to offer u something for Xmas.  💋💗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vodkanopants Parents are parents.😁. Was the same with mine.  God bless them. Some kids dont hav this chance.

<|startoftext|>@vodkanopants Was not meant to diss you.  I have also an quite old phone.  As long as it is working would not spend a dime on a new one.   So if you have the chance my opinion would be to spend the cash on something else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sybrant_ @Reuters  https://t.co/ur3lYBURuj  Not me saying.  I was reading lot of scientific review on this very topic + some great documentary.   In Israel and US some lab grow meat in lab. Still being tested but they have succeed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sybrant_ @Reuters Well based on the scientist studies.  It is even we change or we will eat crickets cause there will not be enough meet for everyone based on the booming demography<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealKidus1 @businessinsider Of course they will.  https://t.co/a12kO7aoNI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sybrant_ @Reuters I like vegan food.  I just dont understand why it has be close in taste to non vegan food.   I have found good Alternative to bacon in a parisian vegan restaurant.   But if I want bacon I go for bacon. If I want vegan food there is ton of great recep that taste amazing too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroOuCharlieMP Besoin d'être un peu seul avec moi même...  Loin de l'agitation et de la vie.  A force d'entendre les hurlements on finit par plus les ecouter. J'avais besoin d'apprendre a écouter de nouveau.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroOuCharlieMP Tu m'as manqué petit Caribou francais 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sybrant_ @Reuters I think you are an exception.  Cause vegan is not only the taste of the meat (that would be vegetarian). It is also diary products and eggs. So it is another level. But i would love to taste this soybacon. Always very curious when it comes to food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroOuCharlieMP Effectivement, mais l'essentiel reside dans la madeleine de Proust.  Cela a t'il été le cas ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sybrant_ @Reuters Fair enough. Is this the case for the majority of vegan? Just trying to understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroOuCharlieMP Vive leclerc 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dont get it.  If you are vegan. I assume you do not like the taste of meat.  Then why would you like you soy to taste like bacon??  Isn't this a bit psychotic??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cutupx2 You are 100% right. In europe it is the exact opposite. Nobody at this very stage is concerned by the economy.  1st they want to get rid of the virus ASAP. Then they will figure out how to work. But as you said all of this was not taken very seriously. Remember "it is just a flu"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@louiseamelia91 😄😅🤣 He is very cute.  Yeah sleeping on the head is kind of their things as well.

<|startoftext|>@louiseamelia91 🤣🤣 Hope this will be enough indeed.  But Victor Hugo said:  "hope is the greatest of our madness" So may be a little bit of sleeping in the same room would be required just to be safe 😅<|endoftext|>

Which is also a part of my job. Make people feel comfortable and understand and predict reactions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupaZombieGirly That sounds very interesting. So I supposed you have quite a large "range" of behaviour to study?  Or did you specialised yourself in a certain behaviour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legallyines Creepy 😁😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupaZombieGirly I guess indeed with the quarantine that meeting ur patient would not be recommended. So your job is ro help detective to understand the metal state of someone under in trial?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrinaFulk1 @Trina Oh thx. You are very sweet. Trying my best to entertain 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heyitsJudeD @1fragmentedmind Weirdly enough you never do face day...🤷‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh And watch this please. Just before. So you can have a mix feeling about the whole situation 😳🤣  https://t.co/JPK4Zrzewe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Listen to the song. "This night" by black lab. I think you with just love it.  Let me know if i'm right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Dont u know the band black lab?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh She was!!!! It was like watching a penguin dancing but yet at this very moment she was beautiful. Everything was wrong but yet perfectly wrong at this dedicate moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh But yet I stand there watch her dance all night till sun rise and it was the most amazing stuff and chat I had with a human being.  U cant do this when you are travelling with someone.  They will not understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Some partners just dont(mine doesnt). It is not against them. Nothing to do with fooling around.  I was lost in the middle on poland once  I end up "giging" with some gypsies in a bar and there were this dancer. She was the beautiful most ugliest and bad dancer I have ever seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Just underlying the obvious but welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh My girlfriend would love it but more a lonely traveller. I like the freedom of it and the distance you put between u and ur daily routine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh You look like a painting. The type of art yoywatch every day and always find out you have missed something yesterday.  So it is an endless stunning view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh I feel u. I never was a big photo fan. I'm more the writing type. Have the urge of travelling a lot. may be to find myself or to lose myself.  Did not figure it out yet.  Might sound stupid base on a the picture but I would have love to have co traveler like u.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh It is understandable but yet unfortunate. It is seems the old you could bring you the other side of the world just by looking in the your eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Why did you change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohsweetashh Love your style.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@APoeticWhisper well we are fools.  I personally love it.  Seeing things they will never see.  Feel things they will never feel.   :) to bad you don't allow DM I believe we could have placed Paris in germany and Moscow in Australia and dream about summer in winter :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mooshiepeach I dont complain abt my life. I just lack the space, the sound of silence, miss the time when a life was more than a mean, when u could speak randomly to people without them thinking you need something more that a chat, when the common sense was not a exception but a rule.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shelteringwind yeah french are really chill when it come to exchange with others (obvisouly depends on the location) but you often get invited to people houses after couple beer and interesting chit chat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shelteringwind Well the thing is, I don't really know the Nordic culture. so very hard for me to give my opinion on this.  I have never been to northern Europe and the part of the world will be my next travel destination for sure.  1st finland cause I want to go kick Santa Ass then the rest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shelteringwind are you sure they don't arrest only the ugly one? cause this doesn't make sense in my very French brain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hayliam2006 Well in this case not really. The unexpected connexion and the ephemeral of the whole thing is what making it special. If this is not of the equation it is according to me tasteless. You need for a second to doubt everything when looking in her eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckysphone1981 Well I see you had a rough day would it cheer you up if I say that someday I will buy it for u?<|endoftext|>
