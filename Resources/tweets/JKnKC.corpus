<|startoftext|>@ThePME @gfienberg17 @RapSheet @timanderson87 Is this the first time @timanderson87 has ever admitted to the curse being real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz @Ihartitz just dropping by like...  https://t.co/VuLrNk5zC6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCLD13 @peteroverzet Yeah I just couldnt pass up 6600 julio at his ownership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCLD13 @peteroverzet Beginning of the week I had him and Julio EVERYWHERE...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCLD13 @peteroverzet  https://t.co/TMDKO2oexD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet Oh what happened now?! I'm getting sick of all these flips! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelseyShaye  https://t.co/IkkIPWlRtO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #TomBrady was still the QB of the #Patriots Gunner Olszewski would have had 8 catches for 75 yards and a touchdown tonight. #ThursdayNightFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Its cause you're worried about Stephon Gilmore isnt it... this is a safe place you can be honest with us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitch  https://t.co/FhUINiBuMH  https://t.co/AQemHFtsfG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonylorino @bradygoodman @Twitch @SmallStreamersR @sme_rt @SupportStreamz @rtsmallstreams @TwitchSharing @TwitchOSF 🤔🤔 I don't see it 😂  https://t.co/tD9rYLvrCP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChacheGod @EASPORTS_MUT Obviously.. but the fact that the best QB in the world has the like 10th best MUT card seems ridiculous.. and the fact that were going to wait until January for Mahomes to have decent throw power is also crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teaching him all about @Twitch nice and early!  https://t.co/FhUINiT6bh #Gamer #GamerDad #boydad   @SmallStreamersR @sme_rt @SupportStreamz @rtsmallstreams @TwitchSharing @TwitchOSF  https://t.co/nB02Wfgk3i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz You spelled James RB1szn wrong...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EASPORTS_MUT The fact that Frank Clark has a higher card than Patrick Mahomes with the season they're having is egregious... #mut #awful #teamstandouts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 No I mean like what would anyone want to pay that for a pair of headphones.. #HowRich #AirPodsMax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993  https://t.co/P6owyR6Nd5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domonic_neal @Royals What makes you think that?  https://t.co/jGUZGqYDwU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timanderson87 Been waiting for you to bring the funny. And there it is. #NailedIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domonic_neal @Royals Aging former power hitter to play in one of the biggest parks in the league..  https://t.co/zxjvKz3kLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the most @Royals signings ever...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just found out there is a full podcast of #CustCorner and mu day just got better. I've never heard someone laugh so hard that they snorted, coughed, and literally slapped their knee until now and for that I thank you @ThePME #SkittleMeTimbers @timanderson87<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 😂😂😂  https://t.co/myo8SCwldN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switching up the streaming schedule this week. We'll be live playing some Warzone tonight and Wednesday at 4 PM CST!  https://t.co/FhUINiT6bh   #smallstreamer #SmallStreamerCommunity #TwitchStreamers @SmallStreamersR @rtsmallstreams @Streamboosts @SupportStreamz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison That's good right!? #Rough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly I'd feel better about how this game was going to end if we were down 6 and getting the ball rather than playing defense here... #PatrickMahomes #TheGoat #DENvsKC #SNF #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are Drew Lock and his coach really drawing up plays on his hand on the sideline? #DENvsKC #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confidence is literally the last thing that #DrewLock needs... #DENvsKC #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Chiefs offensive performance has just been brutal...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Chiefs are so good they're literally giving away points.. #SNF #DENvsKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomsegura You should get a tattoo of a cool scar to cover up that thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniferleechan 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm.. pulled lineups into lineup HQ... did a quick rerun of the lineups then update my main single entry lineup and then found out that Lineup HQ put a few of my single entries on different lineups... so that's cool.. @RotoGrinders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Definitely worried!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman  https://t.co/cwq7doIOgG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman Oh wait sorry.. he didn't even 2x.. your trying to victory lap a min price guy that didnt even 2x while getting a TD and 9 carries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman The 3 lineups you sent.. the runnings backs minimum point total was 70+ and that lineup had 2 RBs... not to mention you're trying to victory lap a RB that went for what 2x? And had the same amount of carries as Justice Hill who you said wouldnt get 5 carries...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman Every lineup you sent had running backs that had one of the best games of their season... RB doesnt have the same opportunity cost as a WR or TE..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman Yeah because 7 points is winning you anything in #DFS 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman Gus Edwards...  9 carries...  10 yards... easy on those victory laps 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonylorino But....  https://t.co/oVEqGzdjAb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePME I'm with @gfienberg17 on this one.. the #NFL is the league where if you're not finishing first you might as well be trying to finish last for draft capital. Also, they've clearly identified the hardest piece to get right (QB) and most likely losing their weakest link, their coach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm forgot to put a cup in the @Keurig and let a full brew go into the base, tired today. How's your Wednesday going? #Tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish we had Bilas.... #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordReebs @notJDaigle @beffjecker @EricCrain The question is can you also throw Montgomery in that stack? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man who needs coffee in the morning, just wear an @UnderArmour fleece! #Shocking #static<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattFtheOracle Lockett, sanders, raeger and seattle defense if that helps lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattFtheOracle Currently have the same lineup as 14 other people on a primetime slate.. 3 players and a defense left.. late swap or let it ride?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek I'm so confused! The defense was worried about the WR matchup!? Your bit has totally been flipped on its head!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePME He was a few years early on the Peterman prediction, but he did outscore Derek Carr this week..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EASPORTS_MUT @cheetah Mahomes and tyreek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/h0SY0b69CS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Uncle Lenny the worst running back inside the 10 yard line? #DFS #leonardfournette #BAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet Sure you dont have kids? #ThatDadJokeThough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get you want to be balanced and all but you have the best QB in the league against a great run defense.. #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: Tyreek Hill... #AlsoGood #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Mahomes... #Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Evan Engram finally starting to be treated like Evan Engram by his coaching staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in on this listener league while there are still spots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld The discoverability issues are insanely bad for people just starting out on @Twitch its rough for all of us little guys out here trying to grow our channels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet What kind of absolute 🤡 tapes a box like that!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bud_Dupree @peteroverzet @PFF Feels like most coaches and organizations in the league would disagree with this take while they use @PFF analytics but what do the geeks know 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all just witnessed the worst fake punt in the history of football... #NFL #WASvDal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Andy Dalton was a real Drew Lock "Uh-Oh" ball... #WASvDal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disneyplus Whatever they're eating in #BlackWidow RELEASE IT! #WeNeedMarvel #Marvel2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld  https://t.co/WscabrOnWx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Smaller loser DFS grinders: will there be a Thanksgiving #Gillcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everytime the @WashingtonNFL takes Antonio Gibson off the field I wonder if they're trying to win or not... #Thanksgiving #WASvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That awkward moment when Matt Stafford attempts to be Patrick Mahomes 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did Kerryon Johnson do to someone in this @Lions organization that hes not playing right now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/WbBWiPzDBh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played Johnson &amp; Johnson in @DraftKings today. I couldn't be more tilted by them getting their teams inside the 5 and getting yanked... #TILT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet Have Hock, can confirm slate not broken. #StillLosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FreeDukeJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Play Thanksgiving DFS they said..   It'll be fun they said...  News flash, it's not, it's NOT FUN!   #DFS #Draftkings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its official the @HoustonTexans hate Duke Johnson.. and because of that.. I hate them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet I was really hoping @2Hats1Mike popped back on the screen and said "Still here MFers!" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman The into along maybe 2/3 of the podcast 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp.. bad news, we only have 2 games on the slate for Thanksgiving. Good news you only have to listen to 2/3 of the podcast to get all the info you need for the slate! #DFS #Draftkings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFF_Zoltan @Ihartitz Better vision, Leonard Fournette or Knile Davis?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonylorino It'll work great for the first 3 quarters of the bottle...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you believe this guy @bradygoodman taking victory laps after his first win of the season.. 🙄 coming for you next week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz I know Lamar has just been so brutal this year. I keep trying to make him and Marquise Brown a thing in DFS, and as we all know, it's going poorly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz 🤔 Because Lamar isnt on the main slate and you're talking strictly DFS right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Mahomes is the doctor we need.. Derek Carr is the guy that stayed at a @HolidayInn Express last night. #SNFonNBC #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the difference between a great QB.. and the guy that plays a great QB on TV... #PatrickMahomes #derekcarr #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes 🐐 #EnoughSaid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MECOLE HARDMAN RAN A ROUTE! IT HAPPENED! #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Mecole Hardman having as many plays as Henry Ruggs has targets is wild, man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when people were saying how good the #Chiefs defense was.. that was a good couple weeks... #SNF #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek I was sitting on my couch playing all the passing options for the Chiefs including Mecole Hardman in primetime slates..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else just bust into the carlton going into this commercial break? No just me? Cool cool... #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 No Katie is THAT person.. if you think I decorate this house ever you're crazy! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son is 2 months old, and he is currently locked in on the #Chiefs game. He's throwing his hands in the air and cooing when good stuff happens to the Chiefs. #FatherOfTheYear #RaisingHimRight #ChiefsKingdom #SNFonNBC #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld when you play red redacted...  https://t.co/WzqfNnd3qq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Come on @Ihartitz it's the bird on the #fruitloops box obviously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You two realize anyone can update @Wikipedia ... that's why high school and college students aren't supposed to cite it on school papers... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out our podcast that was recorded before this weeks crazy turns. Want to know where I'm leaning before the main slate tomorrow. Stop by the stream! We'll be live playing @CallofDuty and answering DFS questions from 6-8 AM CST.  https://t.co/qaz3a9SyCT #draftkings #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eachosystem @peteroverzet *Bettor* you're welcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCarty ...here we go... 🚀🚀Taysom Hill week 🚀🚀  https://t.co/Ykech9FNLO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCarty @DraftKings This is one of those weeks I'm just going to close my eyes and follow the ways of #TheBlitz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCarty Again, great thread. But, uh, can we get a Taysom Hill thread and wht I should or shouldnt play him on @DraftKings dot com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can confirm this is the most tilted I've ever been more than 48 hours before a slate.. #DFS #DraftKings #taysomhill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sooo Taysom Hill's ownership percentage this week on @FanDuel is over/under 90% in cash?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld What do you think his ownership looks like on DK this week? And at what point do you think hes unplayable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter @diannaESPN Soooo... ummm ownership on this guy is going to be insane this week..  100% on #FanDuel at TE? #DFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Just said the same thing. That said completely ridiculous that Hopkins had 0 targets on the final drive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It feels like Larry Fitz has been targeted at least twice as much as DHop tonight... and that is a problem.. #Cardinals #TNF #ARZvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoever just told Kliff to challenge that just cost his team a timeout down the stretch... #AWFUL #TNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we didnt replay every #NFL injury I wouldn't hate it.. just hit me with a "hey this guy hurt his leg" I REALLY dont need to see it... #KThxBye #TNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just get a stop on 3rd down and you give up a taunting penalty!? What an idiot. #Cardinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anderswhanson Watch the game bud.. quit being completely bias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anderswhanson He could have easily made a play on the ball that was 3 yards behind the receiver instead he put his shoulder into a defenseless receivers shoulder/head... honestly can't believe anyone would try to defend that play in any way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a scumbag hit from Diggs right there... #TNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I miss something? Is this 2010 and Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best receivers in football again? #whatshappening #ARZvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man is Drake the new Derrick Henry? Starts to show up late in the year to go off? #DFS #ARZvsSEA #TNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the @TheHangover and with @kenjeong being literally everywhere right now. How is he not the leading spokesperson for @manscaped #randomthought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek WOW Davis! You joshin' WR/CB matchups to the people!? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang Poor kid never even got to try the "good" @Skittles with Lime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's gooooo! Check out the newest DFS Podcast on @Stitcher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @newsmax @OANN @FoxNews This just in, the three networks with the most bias towards @POTUS trying to spin the #FakeNews coming from him and his camp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCarty This was my favorite thread of the season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite part of a @DavisMattek bit.. is how much Davis enjoys his own bits #ThatMatchupThough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek  https://t.co/6rZoq9rGkJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCarty This feels like the most obvious thing you've tweeted and somehow people will find a reason to disagree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did it become okay for us to tell each other what time of day it is as a greeting? #Morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek @blenderhd If it was anything but joggers this would be the most old man taek I've ever seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 The way my season is going.. I doubt it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well on a high note.. I only need 9 more of those 6 yard out routes to Jefferson to beat @Ginja_Ninja1993 in our league this week #Vikings #fantasyfootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we're off to a great start for #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Is this real life? Or just a guess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So did the almost 1/4 of a million deaths while you act like this pandemic isn't a big deal... #COVID19 #potus 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordReebs You love to see guys do what they're good at! And Drew Lock is the king of the YOLO ball for an INT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BalesFootball I'm not sure I could do 500 pushups in 34 days...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek @NateNohling @SammyReidFI @SportsGrid You say it to start every week.. and I'm a little sorry about it, but it really is more enjoyable listening to other people get crushed in cash. Especially the rare weeks when I win and you guys don't. #Fish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinRothWx I'll take Mahomes.. and it's not close... but if I have to take one of those guys I'll take Murray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek  https://t.co/RIudsQE14z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This maybe the first time ever that I've gone into the late games not really winning but felt decent with where I'm at... probably bad for me.. #DraftKings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leonard Fournette... #TBvsCAR #Draftkings #DFS  https://t.co/fQdRPBzZti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp say goodbye to your lineups if you played Ronald Jones... #Fumble #TBvsCAR #DraftKings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump For once you're not wrong... if YOU rig the election.. you'll win..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a problem this week.. and its liking too many RBs in @DraftKings #DFS #HELP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Is he though? We sure he's going to get the same role he got last week with other guys possibly being called up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is your best chance to win a listener league on @DraftKings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last year @bradygoodman and I were playing #Radio.. this year we're bringing you the #DFS podcast you need! Give it a listen and join our listener league on @DraftKings  https://t.co/EV6DtapdZb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂  https://t.co/5TlrK9Htnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN Citing @OANN is like a college student citing @Wikipedia on their final paper... #Election2020 #TrumpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XboxSupport How can my Xbox One X have 4k, Dolby Vision, and HDR all turned on.. but my Xbox Series X I can't turn on any of those things? #Confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports @Xbox @XboxSupport  https://t.co/cCmj7aLgY4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Socrdave @DavisMattek Not gonna lie I'm a little surprised he's that much bigger than her...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/iPlksaaFKq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaycoolent @Xbox @XboxSupport I had it in my cart though.. so you'd think that would mean I have one put away for me for a little bit of time at least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm so I got the @Xbox in my cart, I go to pay for it and then get this message.. @XboxSupport care to help with this?  https://t.co/rdyfWbTpuD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Yeah I mean definitely not a franchise guy but I think hes good enough that the Broncos at least give him a 3rd year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Man I dont think the Broncos are ready to call it quits on Lock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you get an @Xbox series x in your cart.. and then try to buy it on your phone and your phone kicks you off the page.. you're gonna have a bad time.. #NoXboxForMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek @friscojosh Come on Davis! The Mini fridge is WAYYY better than the router. #XboxSeriesX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 After working for one of those companies myself.. I think this maybe the norm 😂  https://t.co/pW0e1S3qLc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is still spitting their gum in the urinal!? #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine being 0-8, having Adam Gase as your coach, and trying to screw yourself out of the #1 pick by beating the #Patriots this is the most #Jets thing I've ever seen.. #MNF #YouCantFixStupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Man after my @DraftKings day today.. I feel your pain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that time when we all rostered Alvin Kamara and Michael Thomas on @DraftKings and Emanuel Sanders, Trequan Smith and something called an Adam Troutman scored TD's? #ThatWasFun #SNF #Primetime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the best 10 yard punt return I've seen since Dante Hall #XFactor #snf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Troutman scoring sums this week up perfectly... #DFS #Draftkings #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would you ever challenge that? #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would JPP have caught that a few years ago? #SNF #NOvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SlantBoy ran an out route? Whaaaaat? #Saints #SNF #NOvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VenomousValek Got to take care of yourself first and foremost! Do what you got to do man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TonyPollard looks like the guy that should have gotten that big contract extension instead of #Zeke #Cowboys #PITvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone seen DeAndre Hopkins? Cause I know Kyler Murray hasn't! #FullTilt #Draftkings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we absolutely sure that the #Chargers trainer didn't have something to do with this #JustinJackson injury? #AskingForAFriend #Draftkings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Rus is BURNING the food... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman Zero reason to rush the field right there.. they got taken to double OT by a true freshman and they act like they beat Clemson with Trevor Lawrence at QB and they were an unranked team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number 4 football team in #CFB just won a home game, against a true freshman making his 2nd start, and their fans rushed the field.. during a pandemic... I'm embarrassed for you #NotreDameFootball #SMH #ForShame #ClemsonvsND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NotreDame is one play away from having a story they can tell forever.. that story - We beat a true freshman QB making his 2nd start of his career at home... #CollegeFootball #clemson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the only person less likely to take an L than the guys at the #Gilcast is @POTUS #DFS #Election2020  @DavisMattek @SammyReidFI @NateNohling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously... dude just held a press conference at a LANDSCAPING company because his campaign couldn't figure out it wasn't the Four Seasons hotel? #Election2020 #POTUS #Seriously #Pressconference #Trump  https://t.co/Os4jRDxjQK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which comes first... @EAMaddenNFL 22 or the @EASPORTS servers getting back online? @EASPORTS_MUT   Also, can we get some better matchmaking for #Squads whenever these servers come back online? I'm tired of playing top tier teams with my friend and my teams being 85 overall teams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld Me and my 5 average viewers beg to differ!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld If I could like this more than once, I would.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now it seems like all anyone wants to do is pick a side and divide. So if you're reading this, just know, I love you and I'm here for you. We need to come together for the betterment of everyone. #SpreadLoveNotHate #Election2020 #BetterTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robinmck64 @AndrewYang @POTUS Oh really? Please share with the class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny how @POTUS told all of his supporters not to vote by mail, then he whines about all the mail in ballots being for @JoeBiden #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld  https://t.co/UsAlp8uHQl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamlevitan Have we heard if he's had any negative tests yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They got counted... and you lost? 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to know who to play... or not play in @DraftKings this week? Check out our week 9 podcast! Guarantee at least 1 player mentioned will have a fire week! #DFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet @psufans2 Man Pete, look at you becoming a Faaaaaanduel fanboy over here. You rocking every piece of FD clothing you own all in one pic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang I hope you're right about a celebration. Unfortunately our current @POTUS has a bunch of followers that believe every word he's saying right now. I'm genuinely worried about this country right now if potus doesnt back off these accusations with no evidence backing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld Right I knew the hand meant nothing. Didnt know elbow = 2 feet though.. I thought he had the initial foot down and then the elbow was just his 2nd "foot"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld I thought the elbow just counted as the 2nd foot there?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison @610SportsKC @ArrowheadPride 3. With this how high powered this offense is most teams should be trailing and have to throw the ball to keep up, so I'm not too concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well no shit Sherlock...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlZeidenfeld Yo Alan! Cant believe that lineup you put together in the video this week. So gross! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did @POTUS just delete all of his crazy tweets over the last couple days? 🤔 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is what the #TerribleTwos is going to look like.. I'm concerned #boydad #newdad #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Who are any of the receivers meow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People really think that you're not allowed to count votes after the day of the election and that worries me. #Elections2020 #concerned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathanschellha1 @jakek34 @DavisMattek Why continue to let someone spread misinformation? Especially when he's spreading it to such a large audience? Not to mention what he's saying is only helping to divide the country more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathanschellha1 @jakek34 @DavisMattek The left has been censored too. Don't freak out on people because the guy you like is being censored for misinformation. It happens to a lot more people than you'd think on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathanschellha1 @jakek34 @DavisMattek It has nothing to do with something being offensive and everything to do with misinformation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathanschellha1 @jakek34 @DavisMattek The first amendment protects you against the government.. Twitter is a private platform so this has 0 to do with the first amendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched someone driving on the highway put on reading glasses to read and respond to a text... W.T.F? #DontTextAndDrive   This tweet was brought to your feed as a quick breath from all the  #Election2020 coverage #YoureWelcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xbox no one else seems to be willing to help with this issue so moving on to this account now... #Help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @EASPORTS_MUT or @XboxSupport can someone help me? I didnt receive my madden points from the 29th. Had to get them from the xbox store because I couldnt get them straight from madden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first 20 bomb win on #Warzone! Was I streaming it? Of course not.. Will I get another 20 bomb during my next stream tomorrow from 4-530 PM CST? Probably not.. but come check out the stream anyways! See you there!  https://t.co/FhUINiBuMH  https://t.co/Y1mYnBMiqV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright be honest.. who had Gallup for 4 screens tonight? #SNF #WhatsHappening<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman @iGrift @DraftKings Can't be out here playing head to head for my whole bankroll! Sheesh!  https://t.co/ZU8QYBcPD2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its week 8 of @DraftKings NFL action and @bradygoodman and I went over all our favorite picks for this week! Check out the podcast and join in on our listener league where one of us out score a certain website's optimal last week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who @Igrift is in @DraftKings but I can promise you I won't now or ever play you in a $20 head to head..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things I've learned during #TNF ... I HATE Troy Aikman's commentary... #Brutal #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kzombiez @VenomousValek Just happy I could contribute to keeping @Kzombiez on @CallofDuty a little while longer! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet As always love all the "bankroll" challenge content! Really appreciate you giving me your thoughts on my lineup too! Learning a ton about game theory and gpp lineup construction from the Friday streams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports Imagine being @mastergotch and @KelseyShaye and going to bed thinking you won the listener league and then not even cashing.. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is what not to do when you're down 2 possessions with time running out.. #cardinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey has anyone seen that really good WR on the #Cardinals lately? Just keep seeing #TheDrake running into his lineman.. #NukHopkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EASPORTS_MUT Who cares.. cant afford him and wont pull him from a pack... #MUT #PayToWin you need to bring out an overall based or salary cap squads setup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DK Metcalf.... 🤯🤯🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Phillip Lindsey is to Melvin Gordon as Ronald Jones is to Leonard Fournette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confusing things about the #NFL .. a player tests positive for marijuana and is suspended for multiple weeks.. #MelvinGordon gets a #DUI for driving intoxicated and speeding and is suspended for... you guessed it 0 games... #Wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out our #DumpsterFireSports podcast and hop in our listener league!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man.. wish I could have picked a punter as my captain in @DraftKings showdown. Those guys are killing it tonight! #TNF #DraftKings #NYGvPHI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet I mean how can you say no to helping feed this kid? 😂  https://t.co/S5soIsnbzK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet I've said it before, and I'll say it again after this week.. can't wait to see that lineup tonight!  https://t.co/uEMH3xnsbB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man Robert Woods coming around that edge just isnt the same as Deebo.. #SNF #LARvsSF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh boy. Sunday Night Football guys out here trying to get called out by another mom.. #SAMUELSloman #SNF #LARvsSF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteroverzet After today... 😂  https://t.co/1nSx98R8Ff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EASPORTS_MUT can we get a salary cap on MUT Squards? Or maybe just a way to have teams have similar overalls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my favorite thing I've seen on the internet today. #KingHenry #Titans #FreshPrince  https://t.co/p88LNanQsx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 Drew Brees = 2015 Peyton Manning #NFL #MNF #Dust #washed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't think #DrewBrees is dust.. explain the #Saints only throw beyond 15 yards they brought in #TAYSOMHILL to make the throw.. #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hulu_support It is a vizio tv and all live channels are currently doing the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hulu looks great tonight! Should be a good game. #MNF #LACvsNO  https://t.co/5mRYndkHDi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesy_Walrus_ This week it was Evan Engram and then the Giants go throw to a tackle. Last week was my #Chiefs throwing to Eric Fisher 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two weeks in a row I've been BEGGING for points for a player on a team and that team throws to a tackle... #WTF #FantasyFootball #DFS #Draftkings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evan Engram is clearly the best athlete that is still healthy on the #Giants right? You think they'd run a play or two for him... #Justme? #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dak Prescott injury update... Right ankle... #NSS #YourNotHelping #News #Injury #HealQuickly #DAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number of time Evan Engram is blocking on passing down is disturbing.. #FreakAthlete #Giants #DFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the odds.. I just opened 2 of the 50 Fantasy Packs on @EASPORTS_MUT my BEST card from BOTH packs was an 82 overall Brett Farve... 240k coins for 2 Brett Farve cards.. #Madden21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is probably the easiest listener league on @DraftKings come by and take our money! 😂 #DumpsterFireSports<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe some of the clock management happening in this game right now... #TNF #BucsVBears<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sprint @TMobile so this is fun... thought we were getting a bigger better network. I'm just roaming more often and now this... #cool  https://t.co/f7wmFqntR7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Packers backfield is out here looking like a peewee football team.. Everyone gets to run the ball.. #FreeAaronJones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek The answer is no.. no he's not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz 🤯😳 I'll take the over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Remember that time when he tried to be Patrick Mahomes... #Escapablity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Raiders just said onside kick or loss.. taking that timeout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewickett No one likes a #Hater Mike even when it's true and just an observation...  #KU #RockChalk #Rough<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@looloolauren We haven't started it but quite a few people have recommended it to us l. Well have to give it a shot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @EASPORTS_MUT you know what's really fun!? Playing your first game in a few weeks with an 84 overall team in the amateur H2H division and playing against a team with mostly high 80's and 90's... #SuperFun #GarbageGame #PayToWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This new @ATT 5G commerical annoys me.. the guy clearly says "you should consider making a big deal about it"  @MintMilana says, "bigger?" Guy says, "I said bigger!"   No you didn't.. #thelittlethings #annoyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went on a walk with the little family tonight and @Katie_Dearing1 pointed out this "twig" that came down in the storm... #what #treedown  https://t.co/6pe4GpqEtk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's weird that @NetflixIsAJoke doesn't have the comedians lead into their own set.. #radio #programming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons to late swap.. 1. Because you're stupid 2. Because you hate money 3. Because you're a fish #KingOfTheFish #DraftKings #allthemoney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek I swapped off Mahomes, Kelce for Jackson, Andrews...  and its currently costing me $400 in the primetime slate... #FullTilt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will NEVER late swap again... #DFS #Draftkings #allthemoney #fish #LamarJackson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Chiefs to Lamar Jackson right now. #KCvsBAL #MNF #Chiefskingdom  https://t.co/dgyJGkuHfs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they don't blow the play dead when they're supposed to and Patrick Mahomes takes a hit he shouldnt have.. but anytime we have it blocked we dont get a free play? #what #chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is making Lamar Jackson go 75 yards a worse thing than giving a world class sprinter the ball at the 10 yard line with space? #Chiefs #kickoff #KCvsBAL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattFtheOracle At what ownership percentage do you start to think about fading someone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSURAM88 A LOT bigger bankroll than the one I'm sitting on 😂 #howrich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drew Brees arm is feeling so good he's thrown the ball to a receiver twice.. and they were both under 10 yards down the field.. #GBvNO #SNF #Oldman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drew Brees trying to tell everyone he feels good.. then hasn't thrown a ball to a receiver or anyone more than 5 yards down the field...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelseyShaye @DumpsterSports Todd Gurley... still  https://t.co/8vA6b9wtEz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodeffer9 Yeah that's true.. he also threw a few that probably should have been picked though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodeffer9 Still man.. hes not out here doing anything remarkable.. the Falcons are blowing the game.. completing around 50% of his passes.. not impressed 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a #Trubisky guy by any means.. but man does #Foles really give them a better chance to win? #Bears #Brutal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisMattek Bro! Those air yards though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports @KelseyShaye Todd Gurley...  https://t.co/FOb9K17AjK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports Do I have to pick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need help with your week 3 lineups on @DraftKings Weve got you covered! @bradygoodman and I go through a few of our favorite games and go position by position in this weeks podcast! Check it out below!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just drove by a truck advertising for a local @MazdaUSA dealership.. the truck was a @Toyota .. um what? If you won't drive your car why would I? #advertising #doingitwrong #badbusiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 @bradygoodman @DumpsterSports @NFLFantasy Honestly if you're that upset about it I'll trade back and have the receiver that's not injured with a qb that's not toast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 @bradygoodman @DumpsterSports @NFLFantasy As commissioner you shouldn't do anything unless you can prove there is collusion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 @bradygoodman @DumpsterSports @NFLFantasy First of all.. my team has nothing to do with the trade.. 2nd Michael thomas is/was injured.. what do you want me to do? #DraftBetter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 @bradygoodman @DumpsterSports @NFLFantasy Mike davis was the move.. and I thank you guys for letting me have him for my bench for the next 4 weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman @Ginja_Ninja1993 @DumpsterSports @NFLFantasy Who isnt droppable there 😂 other than Mahones... also you missed waivers now.. thanks for letting me pick up some guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I drive by you and you have a giant smile on your face. I'm glad you're happy but, just know I'm a little creeped out.. #HappyYoureHappy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman @Ginja_Ninja1993 @DumpsterSports On what? I'm not denying I faded my own advice.. I'm just asking what the advice was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradygoodman @Ginja_Ninja1993 @DumpsterSports I'm still waiting to hear what advice I gave that I faded? Kirk? Cause I definitely played him.. didn't play him in cash but I played him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports Wait a minute? What advice did I fade? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chargers punt? Okay thanks! Hold this L #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chiefs offensive line:  1st half: Go ahead hit my QB  2nd half: Oh Mahomes made a great pass/run better hold someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginja_Ninja1993 @DumpsterSports I'm so.confused by this tweet 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why Daniel Sorenson is ever man up on someone is beyond me... #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Btdrnks @DumpsterSports @bradygoodman Conner went down with an ankle injury last week but he practiced in full this week. I only said @bradygoodman could still play him because hed be SUPER low owned and if Conner aggravated the injury he would be in a spot to smash value. People loved him early week for a reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤯🤯🤯Patrick F. Mahomes 🤯🤯🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Live look at the #Chiefs offensive line..  https://t.co/Fs8sW6aCWM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports Wow.. super contrarian line I see.. sheesh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eric Fischer is getting beat worse than the #cowboys in the first quarter... #Chiefs #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The numbers say you should go for it quite often on 4th down.. I dont think the numbers account for your punter throwing passes and your coverage team lead blocking #cowboys #horriblecall #ATLvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhhh.. back to back Tony Pollard carries? Did I miss something? #FreeZeke #dfs #draftkings #problems<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz You like Terry Mclaurin this week? Do you think Pat Pete shadows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ihartitz Favorite WR under 4.5k on DK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports @Btdrnks @bradygoodman Its definitely risky though.. he could easily go for 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumpsterSports @Btdrnks @bradygoodman What are stonks and why do you have Benny Snell in them? Also you could still play benny with Conner being so injury prone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else's dog mock their newborn? Yesterday Skye pretended to have the hiccups.. today she's whining when he does... #what #dogs #boydad #parenting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Things I know about teachers: They're underpaid, underappreciated and everyday you send your children to be taught, cared for, and protected by them.

<|startoftext|>@raford3 I know shields said he might sign an extension here? but is there really any chance for that? #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison I agree that that is all possible but right now today is he really a top 5 player? The draft is all about potential<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Deadspin shouldn't be making it known until the family hears about it and the police confirm... #Horrible #Reporting101<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to stop following @Deadspin because of their complete disrespect for the family of the #Chiefs player, the FAMILY hasn't been notified<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone that is putting a name on this chiefs player situation is incredibly disrespectful to the family.. how horrible of all of you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just sad.. #Chiefs  http://t.co/yR36rMrt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins @cdotharrison what do you guys think of the #Chiefs picking up Rolando McClain to play next to DJ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is TOO FUNNY!!!!  http://t.co/ZPwbLfKs wish @cdotharrison or @DannyParkins would lose a bet and have to do this song accoustically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn I thought Dantoni was supposed to make the Lakers score more ... #40Points #2AndAHalfQuarters #Ouch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan Thanks for the remind on how cheap are owner is #RoyalsFans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LD2k if you want my players do it like EA with the players being built up with online matches by doing certain milestones so u can't b a 99<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crew needs to be brought back without my players so no one can use any glitches to screw up the game! it's sad that this hasn't happened yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LD2k yeah public team up games.. i don't often have 5 people.. and we don't get to pick our positions.. i'd rather be playing 3v3's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LD2k what is going to be on the patch? there needs to be a way to play team up games with my friends against other people with normal teams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison 28-0.... ouch! To early to concede defeat? #NYJvNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison @_RAY44 One of the guys on that team dropped 70 on 34-44 shooting #JustSayin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when new parents ask who the baby looks like. It was born 15 minutes ago, it looks like a potato.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_OS the more impressive game was a guy on the other team! Dropped 70... shot 34-44... Taylor put up 108 shots man #Jackin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison a guy on Faith Baptist Bible College had 70 points against Grinnell on 34-44 shooting... #Amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison if I'm Tyler Self.. I shave the rest of my face #NotAGoodLook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Willis just truck sticked an offensive guard before tackling Forte with basically 1 hand #Beast #MNF #WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey @cdotharrison don't lump us all in with the few idiots that send you stupid messages back like that dude #KUfans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins I'm glad the game hasn't been the story at all this year #BadStory #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chiefs fans wanted today to be a blackout..most fans thought they meant not have the game on tv.. there are easily 10's of people there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison what system are you standing in line for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2KSports you guys need to come out with another college basketball game!!! I'm dying for a college basketball game!!!! #StepUP #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone surprised by that INT hasn't watched the Chiefs this year! #EveryThrowToBowe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pioli on the phone trying to get his new job with the president. #TeachingThePatriotWay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That awkward moment when a 5'6" rookie is your 2nd receiver when you have a guy you're paying 5 million dollars on the bench #OnlyTheChiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the chiefs have fallen back to reality... #Chiefs #MNF #ChangePlease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins had to take the over.. he's already been shown 3 times at least<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins sadly i'd take him over cassel...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talked about @johnnydare today in my mass media and society class in college #ironic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LD2k Why can't I talk to my friend in game chat in a team up game.. we're on the same team.. it doesn't make sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friends started noticing the change during the fourth week of putting Raspberry Ketone diet to work  http://t.co/K78hliOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stuntman1429 got his swagger back #Chiefs!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as much as i hate Cassel as our starting QB got to love the mans effort #Chiefs #KCvSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to bad cassel still hasn't figured out that all of his receivers aren't 6'2 with 40 inch verticals...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe Never mind he's just an idiot #Cassel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe might just be on run plays #GiveAway #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chiefs #InTheFACE!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CHIEFSLUCK... #CHIEFSSUCK Really wish this wasn't on local tv tonight. so i'd have an excuse not to watch this national embarassment #KCvSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Norv Turner looks like he's about to die #KC #SD #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are Raspberry Ketone?  http://t.co/WSHyVzOG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins @cdotharrison this is just pathetic! a horrible and pathetic stat  http://t.co/hstXyeyZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Happy Birthday @DannyParkins have a good one man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily we brought back the regular refs so we wouldn't have any other horrible calls.. oh... then there's that call #NEvNYJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison @DannyParkins I just heard that even though its the chiefs bye week.. we still lost 7-0.. tough week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Safe to say Geno isn't the heisman anymore? RGIII didn't lose like this... #Twice @cdotharrison @DannyParkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LD2k You guys need to bring back Crew but have it with only regular teams no my players so we don't have to go through #GameBattles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ronnie2K you guys need to bring back #Crew but with all regular teams so people don't have to go through game battles or quick matches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison Have you watched "good will hunting" yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's hilarious same thing that happens to cassel happens to quinn.. at least quinn wasn't a back shoulder on accident throw #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins #DUMBBITCH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan our fellow fans whether they were right or wrong cheering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan doesn't stick up for our fandom and doesnt attempt to provide context its tough to not crush him were trying to stick up for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan youre completely right about we shouldn't cheer the injury but when the national media that has or does live in kc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison should appreciate this being a video game junkie like myself  https://t.co/z9cqTFkd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison that has to be fake or set up.. i mean how pissed off do you have to be to try and shove a controller up your ass #AintRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison I'm a KU fan and even that doesn't make me feel better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"oh yeah he's got it he's good" on the one angle that shows NO possible way of marking the spot #Chiefs #Ravens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>game #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we bring back the replacement refs? #Chiefs #OnlyHope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it'd be nice to have that 3rd timeout back #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RAC is like that girl standing at our table Friday night @DannyParkins @cdotharrison #StupidBitch!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is too funny. Is this real life? #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins @cdotharrison should have gone to the 2010 offense.. run til we're inside the 10.. then throw a fade or slant to bowe/baldwin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison @DannyParkins that's not a good contest... who ever drafts routt automatically wins every week #ChiefsFree1stDowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey RAC we don't call timeouts when we're getting loud in KC thats the offensives job #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stanford Routt gets beat all day! #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems like KU is playing harder for Cummings then Crist.. and that close up of Weis looked like he went scarface during halftime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>damnit @cdotharrison no more talking about moral victories in the first half!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boring night til @DannyParkins and @cdotharrison showed up calling girls stupid bitches too funny<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getnickwright completely disagree with that foul on pierce and lebron has a guy with 5 fouls guarding him why doesn't he go to the bucket?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Lebron gets in the 4th quarter he becomes the biggest idiot alive.. paul pierce is on you with 5 fouls.. go at him! #Dumbass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ribzz93 yes.. easily.. only because of his offense, but yes he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_mari31 i think you just have to go to their profile and then there is an option in the top right corner to block them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins mu left KU so we dont need to play them.. not to mention athletically it isn't much of a game mu beats us in cfb we win in cbb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getnickwright hey man just wanted to say love your show and wish you all the best in Houston but hoping you can make your way back here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenna_Marbles I wish i was playing with your boobies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Monday morning I'll be expecting a #GONE from @cdotharrison and @DannyParkins for Brandon Albert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyparkins @getnickwright what do you think of McShay and Mayock saying we're gonna pick barron? the safety from bama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyparkins what do u think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins i would rather get hightower than the bc lb cuz i want a great player from a great d rather than a great player from a bad 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@jnewmancurtis: #WAR what is it could for? Absolutely nothing!! Sang it again... War,huh, good god y'all #Royals #7" sad and true<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ronnie2K Please explain to me why the most recent roster isn't the same as the online leagues.. a bunch of players ratings are off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ronnie2k hey do you know when the opening day rosters are going to come out for #MLB2K12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are you gonna jump on a grown man's back and then look around like you didn't do anything #KUbball #GTFO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL THE KU FANS AT THE GAME! GET LOUD! I WANNA HEAR YOU!!!!!! COME ON!!! #KUBBALL #LETSGOOOOOOOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man Bert is really pissing me off! #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianneCurry you should show some love for Kansas basketball tonight against kentucky and show off your #KUboobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KUbball #IBelieveThatWeWillWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianneCurry you are the one and only reason i have and will ever watch americas next top model and the surreal life #Gorgeous #TooSexy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_2releFOUR @Trobinson0 @elijahjohnson15 @_tee_y @Jeffwithey Starting lineup done by a 5 year old  http://t.co/YyVpxhtl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KUboobs might be the greatest thing ever but why only do it on game day #KeepThemComing #GoingToNewOrleans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow who u got in the KU v. UNC game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_tee_y loved the video! now lets go out and get you 4 more wins! #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_tee_y no matter what you'll always be a Jayhawk! &amp; Jayhawk nation will always love and respect you for what you did for our team #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeAndMike in college you get a helmet sticker for a good play, could be a big hit that injures someone #bountysystem? #NoDifference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericwinston loved the interview today with @610SportsKC can't wait to watch you play!! #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @getnickwright curse tried to jump up and bite 3 teams this weekend #KU #Cuse #mu but only got 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raford3 what are your expectations for moose and gio from the plate this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>last thing i'm trying to do is lump you in with all of the mu fans because you're very unbiased on the radio @cdotharrison i'm just asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison i know that hasn't come from you.. it comes from every other mu fan, so I thought i would ask a mu fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison i'm just wondering why as soon as mu's season is done the only thing i ever hear about is how much KU sucks or who we lost to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison dude we can't control who we play. why are you hating on us? just cuz mu got the boot doesn't mean you have to talk shit on KU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins why would we even want to bring in cotchery, we really want to take plays away from a developing receiver or mccluster #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecarm yeah not having samuels is a killer today against this zone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecarm if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow Henriquez misses more shots in the paint that anyone #KSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow losing samuels in this game is really tough for #ksu, gibson doesn't really have that outside shot or 15 footer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison the sad thing is all mu fans care more about KU's basketball team than your own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright @DannyParkins hey if you guys lose today you can at least say no Number 1 has ever lost in round 1 #Cuse #Technicality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well looks like i might be wrong for the first time of many this year #Davidson #Louisville #MarchMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCarr39 Hey man just wanted to say thanks for all the great years and congrats on the contract you deserve it #Chief4Life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@610SportsKC whats up with the bracket on your site? i can only pick the 1st round?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raford3 how has myers been doing in the big league camp? #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarchSwagness If I had a dollar for everytime bob knight said Elijah was coming off the bench in the last few games #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PICTURE!?!?!?!?!? #ESPN2 #FIXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone please explain to me why Teahan is ALWAYS on the other teams best scorer #KUbball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teahan just got called Treyhan.. lol guess the name fits #KUbball #NewNicknames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time that @DannyParkins makes a bet and calls it a lock.. it always seems to at least start out badly #JustSayin #KSU #Baylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"it's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice to everyone" Jordan Juenemann #KUbball #SeniorNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"it's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice to everyone" Jordan Juenemann<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB2K12 are you guys going to release the player ratings before the game comes out!? #MLB2K12 #CantWaitTilTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@operationsports any clue when you guys are going to get and release the player ratings for #MLB2K12?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ronnie2K when are the player ratings going to come out for #MLB2k12 normally they're out by now.. I'm to excited to wait until Tuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Officially lost all respect for mu bball fans.. its senior night with your best senior class in at least 10 years and you cant fill the gym<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright @thecarm 's next song should be about Kevin Young's ja ja ja joker face #GreatBadSongs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuiceMayo32 no doubt @mchalmers15 has got this one on lock!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DwyaneWade @KingJames who you got tonight in the 3 point contest!?!? #AllStarSaturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow should just flop when richmond starts backing down.. like steve moore #CelebrityGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow just did his best @mchalmers15 impersonation in the #CelebrityGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mchalmers15 is gonna show Lin what's up tonight! #RockChalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshselby2 should be in the nba dunk contest.. at least someone in it would have some flair then #NBADunkContest #Joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow and @JayBilas need to be the color commentators more often.. #CantStandTheRest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>guaranteed MSU win just saw pigs fly! #MSUBBALL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCarr39 Hey man just want to wish you all the best with wherever life takes you #ChiefsLoveAlways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still hoping that somehow someway the chiefs can keep @BCarr39 but what ever he gets he deserves #LovedWatchinUOnSundays #AllTheBest #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawkNewz I'm a die hard ku fan.. but i can't follow you anymore because that could be the stupidest tweet ive ever seen #CongratsUrADouche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else notice that creepy joker smile kevin young is rocking? #KUBBall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshklingler No sun spots #WorstReasonsEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GameBattles it says my team got locked on game battles but we can make a game and we have 0 disputes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @DannyParkins you didn't know John Madden started doing CBB now!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins i texted the show this morning and said you had a great pick by taking KU tonight and there's always room on the bus #kubball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianneCurry I have one thing to say about that pic... #DAMNNNNNNNNNN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS And now he might be refereed to as Donavon McNabb #Crumbling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Budlight #HereWeGo commercial by far the best one yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleDBeadle no one cares you're GORGEOUS! #YourTheOnlyReasonSoManyPeopleWatchSN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>best part of this halftime show is by far the drum line #WheresNickCannon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who told #Madonna and #LMFAO that the 300 look was a good idea.. but.. not the best idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Madonna with the first halftime show ever that NO one sings #SuperBowl #Halftime #HORRIBLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>new favorite commercial is that etrade commercial.. and that new g.i.joe movie looked kinda badass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brandon Jacob's chip blocks harder than he runs #SuperBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrible Movie Previews #ThingsThatShouldntBeASuperbowlCommerical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Ross came to hit today #Damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that was a flat out perfect pass #ManningsMiracles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW #YouCantDoThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright that 4-2 game is looking better and better! haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicks is going to TORCH this secondary #SB46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCarr39 i think i speak for everyone in KC.. you have to come back to us next year! we need 2 shut down corners! #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefmorris Especially this year #WhoCaresAboutTheGame #Garbage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Dictator... guessing they spent more on that commercial than they did on the movie #trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW maybe the worst call i've seen this year.. at LEAST a 5 point foul call.. if not 6 point #KUbball #TRASH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MU keeping it classy throwing stuff on the floor #kubball<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wilmyers after that comment i can't be a fan for the next 2 hours #KUbball #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GottliebShow Only reason there is even a decent atmosphere there is because of KU #ROCKCHALK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright haha how'd that go? did you call him mediocre?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianneCurry it doesn't matter what you wear, everywhere you go every guys jaw is gonna hit the floor #GORGEOUS #SEXY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2KSports played the demo for your game this year.. and it was HORRIBLE!!!! that along with the worst servers on xbox. not touching the gm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshklingler any word on why darrian miller hasn't been in the game today???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@610SportsKC why isn't darrian miller playing today??? or at least getting any touches?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS hey shan... what's your prediction for the chiefs this year? how many wins you think we'll get and what do you think about wk 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins i'd rather watch the #LLWS than watch the same sports center on 15 ESPN's every night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins why is Breaston thrown into the slot roll even when Baldwin isn't healthy? Urban isn't a 2nd receiver period #Chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins it's part of earning there stripes.. baldwin needs to be a man.. you can't take a little hazing it's your own problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins EVERYONE has been through the hazing in the nfl.. you really can't take a little hazing to get payed millions to play football<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TealBunB i've heard everything from mid september to october<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flacco thinks he's Tyrod Taylor! tried to pull the same move Tyrod did against stanford last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright @DannyParkins Tyson Jackson has set his own personal record with being noticed twice for something good in a quarter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing against the guys but.. Studebaker and McGraw need to see the field as little as possible.. mostly just special teams.. in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins that guy is RIDICULOUS!!!! Pryor was part of the 5 guys that got to play in the bowl game to sit out 5 games this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright when do you think our rookies on defense will see some PT i'd like to see them against some decent O-linemen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Freeman has ALL DAY to throw #Chiefs #LookingHORRIBLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins does mccluster really have good reason to be on this team? not a good offensive weapon to me... and no more kickoff returns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW ANOTHER FUMBLE! #Chiefs #WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins they did say hudson on tv... idk if you know for sure he wasn't in.. but thats who they said on tv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins hey no worries... we cant get a good snap off so cassel won't get hit.. not that he's a great qb anyways but yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins @getnickwright what's up with Jamaal getting split out wide 2 plays in a row with McCluster running????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright as long as they don't go to Carman again!!! he NEVER appreciates the seats!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannyparkins the guy that you don't think will ever be anything but a #9 hitter is having an AMAZING at bat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyparkins you know how much money the chiefs still have to spend? & any thoughts about what other moves we'll b making before the season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright how much money does kc have left that they have to spend before they get to the minimum?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins Damn good question... have to go Berry though #ChiefsLove #RoyalsBlow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright i think thats the new planet of the apes movie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins OSU's QB will not be drafted that high if at all.. the guy is like 27 or 28<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalWilliams2011 Hey is there a reason that Teal hasn't been playing lately?? is he hurt? or is he just not playing well enough<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS if selby goes to the heat... i think i might give up on the NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CANT believe that Cory Joseph just got picked before Josh Selby... what a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bomani_jones you think he's really that much better than selby? i think selby was a lot better choice right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@take1_4theteam hey man love watching you ball.. but how long you think this lockout is gonna last? and you sticking with toronto?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe yes this year... cuz the draft is garbage... other than that no.. every other year the lottery is expected to help right away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe no one yet.. still on the board.. got to wait til 28 or 30... he'll go to chitown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess he didn't think to much of the pick? RT @carmeloanthony : Goodnight. I'm out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison i already said this to @getnickwright but i'm thinking selby is going to chicago to play with DRose in the backcourt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bomani_jones lmao so does marcus...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright  so far you're looking good with the predictions. i don't think selby is going as late as you though.. 28 or 30 to chitown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe sad when the 6th starter ends up being the 2nd best... #Royals #Future!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need a Cleveland Indians loss tonight!!!! #GOAngels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins happy about the attendance??? or upset cuz we didn't pull off atleast 31k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS Bynum equals &gt; mav's post D #ToEasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins they literally just announced Jaime Garcia's perfect game/ no hit bid... walked a guy and gave up a hit #Jinx!!!???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One word and one word only comes to mind when i watched Derrick Rose tonight.... #DAMN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alwayssunnyincp yes hosmer is making his debut tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins Thats a VERY strong statement... and i just think taylor in that pick brings you more intangibles and more athleticism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyTaylor5 Congratulations!! LOVED watching you at VT can't wait to see you give Flacco a run for his money!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins I don't have a problem with them taking a qb there.. just question the one they picked.. feel like tyrod is much better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins what'd you think about the stanzi pick??? i thought tyrod taylor would have been a MUCH better pick... thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright alright never mind tyrod just went 180, still felt like he was a better pick than stanzi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright what did you think about the stanzi pick??? I was a person wanting us to wait til 199 for tyrod taylor vt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright wtf??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright Bowers, Ayers and Reed all there at 27... who you taking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins i'm loving that trade... if we get akeem ayers with that pick and use 70 for a wide receiver... trade will be perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe get more value for akeem ayers and pick up a wide receiver with that high 3rd round pick.. #Chiefs #LoveTheMove<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bucs go with Smith from Colorado<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshklingler agree w/ take Prince but i don't think arenas is good enough to play the nickel and carr isn't quick enough to guard a slot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshklingler so what are you doing with carr then???? you playing him at the nickel and making arenas the dime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright The #WhatsWrightJinx is in FULL affect tonight.. EVERY player nick has talked about has been taken minutes after #WellDoneSir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright @DannyParkins 2 top 15 talents at Corner and javier arenas didn't really show me much at nickel.. see us taking 1? or no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright pats go luiget here... watch it happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe not at all i would LOVE IT!!! at this point i would much rather have that happen... no big need with good value for us<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS Hopefully you can make it through next week. that game was great but the Mavs still don't have the killer instinct #DirksNoKobe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope that search didn't go on long... #Split #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS i know you got one of the best defensive SS in the league... but just wait to see Escobar.. he's a BEAST #ThankYouZack #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CANT WAIT to see my favorite basketball player @joshselby32 playing in the league next year!!! Good Luck and don't let these haters get 2 u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes in life... you just have to piss into the wind and say " this rain tastes funny."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getnickwright Alex Gordon still a bust and not doing anything this year? or have you turned your thoughts around yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else hear about Jamaal Charles, Chris Johnson, Adrian Peterson, and Desean Jackson going to the texas relays? can u say #WOWTheSpeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright Uconn won "Best in show" at the dog show with all those little ugly dogs that might as well be walking backwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdotharrison Where did that Jeremy Lamb comment come from? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be the first time in my life i'm more excited about the womens basketball game.. #ItsBeenTHATUgly @bobfescoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rckchkhwk Lol they're just happy they can still watch the tournament on TV every year at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS It's hilarious that MU is now spending 1.5 million to continue losing to KU every year and be the cellar dweller n the big 12?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright GOOD as much as I hate MU.. At this point I hate the NCAA and what they do to these athletes just as much. #Good4MU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT'S OFFICIAL!!!! Frank Haith is the coach of the missouri tigers @NewSchoolSS #WhoseReallyHiding LOL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe The Royals are 3-1, and Matt Treanor hit the game winning walk-off Homerun, where's Al Michaels? #DoYouBelieveInMiracles!!!!!????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins it was looking great until he ran on contact there...you run on the throw to 1st if at all.. what was he thinking!? #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moustakas and Hosmer will be up #BeforeTheRoyalsScore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GREAT game from Alex Gordon today can't wait to listen to @getnickwright to hear what he messed up and or why he'll never be good tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still looking for a walk-off from Alex Gordon today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revive85KC That's him.. i'm still wondering how he pulled off those seats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>walk off!!!! walk? anyone?? #Royals!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright I'm thinking other then the rookie's and soria so do we<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright @bobfescoe can someone please explain to me how brady morningstar got those tickets right behind home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Royals Amazing how both people in the bullpen that come in not named soria or that isn't a rookie CHOKE today #WeStillSuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Royals ??? what was that about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when Alex Gordon doesn't try to pull the ball down the line and doesn't try to hit a home run every time he's a great hitter #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright Alex is having another solid game today i think he has to bat in the 3 hole. realistically no one else is hitting well enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyParkins have to go with the Tourny run because of all the big teams they faced.. but regular season means more 99% of the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Royals Someone needs to tell Alex Gordon to loosen up and have fun.. and not try to hit a homerun everytime and he'll be the guy we thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Royals Bold Prediction of the day... end the day 3-1 at the end of the day and alex gordon goes 2-4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where on matt howards lower body did he just reach for his mouth piece? #ThatAintRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it bad that I'd rather watch "Transformers" on #abc then watch the final four?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright good call about Gordon today... having another rough one... but realistically everyone 3-6 is too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kila WALKOFF!!! Game over Royals 1-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright sounds good i think he'll have another decent game.. yesterday was an off day.. and other then that 1 HR Francis looked good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright yesterday alex sucked you killed him today tonight he's done pretty well so far #WhatsWright?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe Someone is criticizing a QB that they're about to pay MILLIONS! Are you serious!? #MustBeARacist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO a bunt single and 2 errors... Way to go #Royals ... #HeresToTheLosers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2KSports wow... got home from work today expecting to get on and see my teams opening day roster.. then again.. #YouAlwaysDisapoint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think the Royals v.s. Angels game would be in Cali this weekend.. but its not... #WTFWereTheyThinking #ItsColdAsHell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to @NewSchoolSS ... the only thing i have to say is... you aren't going home.. so you better be getting paid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to @getnickwright for appearing on ESPN tonight... never noticed the lisp on radio but it really comes out on TV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If what you see is what you get.. Why can't you judge a book by its cover? #MakesSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wanna wish @showtimeselby32 a happy birthday, really hoping he stays at kansas for a better birthday present next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont know if its the tape job on the nose or not.. but Marcin Gortat has a HUGE nose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how #BillSelf gets called out for a choke job.. but #CoachCal gets the best recruits every year, cheats, and still NEVER wins the ship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS @Zach_The_Five_O Atleast KU makes it past the first round and wins more than 25 games EVERY year #PussyCatsWereGoneFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS We lost because they were hot from 3, we didn't shoot worth anything and we kept giving open shots.. #NoOnesHiding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@showtimeselby32 @KansasTwin22 @Kansastwin21 1 MORE YEAR!!! 1 MORE YEAR!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS  Well KU's season is over... Royals season starts on thursday... Heres to yet another 100 Loss Season #HeresToTheLosers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS yeah thats what MU/KSU fans do.. they're team gets bounced to early for anyone to notice so when its march they talk KU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait for all the mu fans to talk there bs about this game even though they had nothing to do with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOME ONE OTHER THAN THE MORRIS' and TYSHAWN HAVE TO SHOW SOME HEART!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG VCU Threw the ball out of bounds and it wasn't a foul #YouSureRef?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally a cheap foul gets called on #VCU! #kubball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame on @bobfescoe for saying opening day was on thursday during a KU GAME!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#kubball .. Here we come!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggdoyelcbs VCU unravling PERIOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GAMETIME SHAKA!!!! LETS GO #kubball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS Same way it always happens... we run into a team that can't miss from 3 and we have an off night on O.. and get bounced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillSelf i'm ready for a #PatSummit sighting at halftime.. you better get up there asses and get that energy up NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG #VCU MISSED 2 IN A ROW!!!!! :O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright #kubball give me a BIG run until halftime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow... they're really about to DOUBLE our score<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're getting out worked CONSTANTLY #kubball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW!!! #SameShitDifferentDay always run into the lower seeded team and then they can't miss all the sudden #kubball LETS GO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAMN I LOVE MARCH!!! KU gets talked about twice as much... MU fans can't seem to talk about anything but KU!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS Shaka's the guy! Got as far as Mike Anderson did w/ MU and they'll get blown out by ku sunday, MU fans will be right at home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well Missouri looks like #Shaka is your guy, took you as far as Mike Anderson with less talent, and his teams getting blown out by KU sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@showtimeselby32 Great game today! but you GOT to come back next year.. all of us KU fans are DYING to see you playing at 100% all season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright come on nick... you got to be coaching your team up... not handing the next team a win before you get there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright ... as some of the annoying announcers out there like to say... #not so fast my friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad for whoever wins the #VCU/FSU game... they'll make it to the elite 8 which is nice.. but then they'll get blown out of the water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS I'm a KU fan but I got to think if VCU wins tonight and puts up a fight against us sunday... Shaka's GOT to be the guy right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright .. right now that prediction isn't looking to bold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My boy #JoshSelby came out looking GOOD!!! if he were 100%  he'd be dropping 15 a night easy... if he comes back WATCH OUT NATION!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone saying that Kansas has a "cakewalk" to the final four... your an idiot.. jay bilas said we have the toughest matchup next game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS ... i'm a KU fan... couldn't disagree more... that 10, 11 and 12, took out the 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.. obviously there for a reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS you're asking about the nerves to early shan if its still close with 5 minutes left i'll start to worry.. til then 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bracket is officially so messed up... GO UNDERDOGS!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have been like @NewSchoolSS and just said screw filling out the bracket this year... my bracket was pronounced dead at 10:30 p.m.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe You really got to stop lumping all ku fans in with you... ALL of my friends are THRILLED K-State lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@showtimeselby32 Every kansas fan loves you! no matter what! don't worry about it just keep going out there and playing hard for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KU had NO business winning that game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>glad the #miamiheat have 3 superstars and the miami fans still can't get to a game in the first quarter what a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PCharltonJr31 The 2k servers always suck... whats new... they might be taking some of the power away to set up the baseball servers though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kansas wins at least a share of there 7th straight big 12 regular season title tonight! and Brady Morningstar has been her for EVERY one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>someone needs to look up the stats for 1st & 2nd down passes.. and then look up how many 3 step drops we took compared to normal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobfescoe i thought dexter pitman went to the nba not to ucla.... oh he did you say?? then whose this fat ass on ucla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright no he definitely hasn't don't have a clue why we let him transfer here.. if he wasn't 7 feet tall he would be at a d3 school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS got to give them a little credit... they gave a few chants a try.. the AKRON hates you.. and scottie pippen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if jeff withey wasn't 7 feet tall he would be at east toe nail state as Bob Fescoe would say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>really kansas... we're gonna let UCLA stay in this game for this long... i need a blow out so i can watch the queen some more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad lebron is all about having fun... going and laughing with boobie gibson and giving up in the playoffs.. he'll NEVER be close to jordan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>everything is back to normal in cleveland the QUEEN has returned and he can't make a jump shot or a layup.. he'll clank a free throw next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewSchoolSS yeah shan maybe a little but luckily for cavs fans since its a "playoff atmosphere" lebron will quit in 4th<|endoftext|>
