<|startoftext|>To all F1 who are excited for Russel in Ham’s absence, please don’t troll/downgrade Lewis with “it’s the car” phrase at the time he needs everyone’s love to recover from this deadly virus. Spare a thought for the Champion lads. Wish you a speedy recover mate @LewisHamilton<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>King should get his head straight on..no clarity on his game nowadays  #AUSvIND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we going for a 10 wicket win? #AUSvIND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ashwin should be back in all formats #AUSvIND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Harsha needs to put on the schedule of his air time so that I can unmute the TV on time #AUSvsIND<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your manager could never<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still remember Geoffrey was so confident in the mid innings show that @KP24 would score on that turner although all the indian counter parts didn’t gave England a chance.  Happy birthday KP, you are one of a kind 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupidity at its best..since he had played under one player that player is a better captain..shambolic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Champions Trophy final, 2017. It was really hard to take :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an atmosphere, crowd going wild🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it isn’t out, as simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great footwork for a 7 year old..Her offside game is exceptional, should continue the same for onside game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 I would choose the best batsman to be my no.4 rather an all rounder considering Mathews at 6...and yes all other batsman are capable but there is a difference between being a potential one and the one who actually done it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 Also to call someone greatest, one has to score runs all over the world..Lara’s greatness is his ability to score against greatest attacks in home/away..just look at his average against each opponents he has faced..you will admire him more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 I disagree on Kallis &gt; Lara but each has diff opinions so I will leave it there..since u already have Dravid &amp; Chanderpaul to hold things in case of a collapse, u would need an counter attacking batsman in the middle order and there is no one better than Lara in counter attacking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 Fair enough..although I insist you to have a second thought on leaving Lara out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 *Kallis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 You have Kellis already in your team as fast bowling all rounder and leaving Lara is harsh in test tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImVS8 Captain? and why Mathews?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Column 3 and 4 so difficult to pick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Inspired from Parkour legends Michael, Dwight and Nard-dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just horrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could have been the greatest series of all time if D&amp;D didn’t screwed up the last season☹️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Chin up skipper @imVkohli we are proud of the fight you have shown 🇮🇳 #ENGvsIND  https://t.co/hDxTjxtl7D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravimaestri @NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 my point here is, it requires far superior skill set to succeed in Test than to hit a last ball six though it may be different skill sets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravimaestri @NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 Because I believe in hitting a ball that doesn’t “deviate” is no equal to controlling your natural instinct to leave a ball which is deviating either side as hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravimaestri + @NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravimaestri Playing dot balls and leaving balls around off stump needs far superior mental strength and concentration I guess...because it is more difficult to control your natural instinct that is to hit the ball.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 There is possibility that he can play county cricket and the test match if he wills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 No one is asking him not to play county cricket....if he wants preparation he can also stop playing ipl and go to England  for practice. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 Ederson not Emerson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaguRaj26378444 @ImVS8 When Emerson asked Pep that he wants to take the next penalty strike for Man City, pep replied that he won’t allow his goal keeper to take penalty strike because he respects the opposition. Likewise Kohli should play the test match for the sake of respect.<|endoftext|>
