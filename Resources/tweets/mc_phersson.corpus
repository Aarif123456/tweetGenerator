<|startoftext|>@daveylittle Was there 2 years ago. It still hadn't recovered unfortunately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtyHans My point is you made global claims no one can reasonably know (about politicisation being a factor). It’s your original point that is being lost now not mine.Misrepresentation of Swedens actions was an example of this not a specific point per se. Thanks anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtyHans “Are” paying the price or have “already paid it” in spring? The historical numbers are locked in but say nothing about current trends which are a different stat. How up to date are you on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtyHans Ironically Sweden has not politicized this much so you are undermining your own point. All I'm saying is be careful of making claims about the rest of the world you can impossibly know. How updated are you on Sweden’s situation now e.g. ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtyHans I have read plenty of online reports by 'International corresondents' about Sweden and know how skewed and misrepresentative they can be.Suspect same applies elsewhere. Raw data by itself says nothing about 'politicization'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ka8895 @ScotNational You can holler 'gold standard' all you want however 'statistics' is merely the collation and presentation of 'raw data'. If the raw data is full of estimates the value decreases. The 'statistics' can be gold standard if if the raw data is not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeagerKaide @Alliance4Unity @SugarspotAnnie @ClassicLibScot @NicolaMcKay18 @bill_dewar @sandmandoha @JimMcMenamin8 @SaphiraBrendan @Serfboy @Real_IanFraser So the 50 years of Tory Westminster rule get off “scot free” so as to speak but a decade of limited SNP rule is the problem... and the solution is to concentrate power 400 miles further away where they really do care for the northern isles.

<|startoftext|>@MaleHumanPerso1 @MartinMcD1980 @Alliance4Unity Scotland voted against self determination. Denial of a new vote rather proves that point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndigoFast @alibali_bazz The herd immunity claim has been rolled back a little when they discovered a flaw in the stats.

<|startoftext|>@ciarafaithdoyle @LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @Junosmum1 @holymacmoses It may seem like days in these lockdown times for you guys - it’s not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciarafaithdoyle @LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @Junosmum1 @holymacmoses Merely curious  in the context of your claim about how your brain works. If it is just an ironic coincidence then fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a Swedish word I can't find English equivalent for-'härskarteknik'.Literally means”ruler techniques”.Techniques utelising position of authority to suppress criticism or challenge.Gaslighting would come under that.More useful than 'fika' and Danish 'hygge' while I'm at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciarafaithdoyle @LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @Junosmum1 @holymacmoses Then I'm curious about the 'faith' in your twitter handle but that is for another day. Anyway in that case are you still alluding to the crowdfunding being fraudulent? Do you have evidence and facts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciarafaithdoyle @LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @Junosmum1 @holymacmoses I find it fascinating -the willingness to uncritically accept the claims you like over those you don't and dismiss opposing views as 'conspiracy,facebook or keyboard warriors'. Those claiming the moral high ground 'just because journo' or whatever should be challenged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesleyRiddoch @GeorgeFoulkes @NicolaSturgeon In @GeorgeFoulkes world “hard to answer” questions are restricted to political interview “gotcha” questions. In the science world there are many “hard to answer” questions and best left to scientists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @ciarafaithdoyle @Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses Your correct it has absolutely nothing to do with that case. The court will decide on that. It has however everything to do with whether we should uncritically believe journo's over anyone else just because they are journo's. There is is no moral high ground for you here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses @ciarafaithdoyle All irrelevant as to whether journalist should be uncritically believed above bloggers.Your profession has received enormous criticism in recent years leading to levenson inquiry for extremely unethical/immoral behavior. 'Journalist' is not a claim for the moral high ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciarafaithdoyle @LeaskyHT @Junosmum1 @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @holymacmoses Are you alleging fraudulent intent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses @ciarafaithdoyle “Qualified journalists are trained to know the law” again an appeal to authority. I don't uncritically believe someone just because they are a journalist nor should anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Junosmum1 @Southsidegrrrl @LadyJinty @holymacmoses @ciarafaithdoyle You have a stat on it being 'unusual'? Or is that based on gut feeling? Regardless is it immoral if it is unusual.? Or are you alleging some fraudulent purpose with the crowdfunding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses @ciarafaithdoyle Opinions need to be evidence based -not  “I’m a qualified journalist” based. The courts will decide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses @ciarafaithdoyle Your second sentence is prime example of appeal to authority.  The court will decide on the seriousness of the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Southsidegrrrl @LeaskyHT @ciarafaithdoyle @holymacmoses @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 Are saying that only publically appointed defence should be used in all criminal cases? That’s radical and worthy of debate. But in the current situation people are allowed and try get best defence. It  would be immoral to restrict that to the wealthy in our society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @ciarafaithdoyle @holymacmoses @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 ... or are you claiming more expensive representation should only be available to the rich of this world? Now that is immoral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @Southsidegrrrl @ciarafaithdoyle @holymacmoses @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 Is seeking to maximize your defence moral in a civil case but not in a criminal case? Series consequences in both cases. Or are you claiming he is asking for the money fraudulently as others are alluding to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Southsidegrrrl @ciarafaithdoyle @holymacmoses @LeaskyHT @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 I suspect the biggest difference is how you personally perceive the parties involved. Both defending themselves in cases where consequences are serious. Both seeking support. Criminal or civil does not make one moral and the other immoral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Southsidegrrrl @ciarafaithdoyle @holymacmoses @LeaskyHT @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 So people on charges may only use legal aid and anything else is immoral 🤔. Tell me you don't seriously think that. Was the Green Party MSP Andy Whightman immoral using crowdfunding in his recent case?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Southsidegrrrl @holymacmoses @LeaskyHT @ciarafaithdoyle @CraigMurrayOrg @DaniGaravelli1 Journalist write rubbish,  bloggers write good stuff  - and vice versa. 'Appeal to authority' doesn’t add weight to an argument either way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 Yes being on Twitter, going away and doing something then going back to Twitter - difficult concept I realize but perhaps more common than you think 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 Very edifying. Thanks for your time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By who? Apologies by current generations for previous generations'  ills achieves what exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 My point is that your claim that my reference is out of date is ironic given your references both point to a single and older source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 It doesn't. Ask yourself- why would catholic maths or catholic physics could be superior to non denomination maths and physics. It doen't add up - whatever religious maths you use😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 Interestingly that article uses as support for its claims the report you referenced earlier - the one which is 5 years old( and based on data 5-7 years old).The wheels turn slowly in these matters. 😉.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 That opinion piece says nothing about them outperforforming. Even at that it is also still older than the article I linked to.I admire your tenacity to find supportive material though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 Your own article is five years old 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 I'm anti any state funded faith schooling. Two years is not out of date for these things. How fast do you think things change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieAdam1969 @Paradise709 That is genuinely interesting. Not sure what it shows but interesting. I can only recall one RI teacher and very briefly. Don't remember getting much RI at all. He was a bit of an arrogant clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJoh60210099 @SovereignAnnie @magnusllewellin In what way were they null and void?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paradise709 @DavieAdam1969 Sorry for having a life outside of Twitter  https://t.co/pF39NlxI6l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SovereignAnnie @JohnJoh60210099 @magnusllewellin I seriously doubt that happens now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenzie_mick Not “blame” but certainly part of the mix in Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenzie_mick Those countries don't have problems - you said it. As an aside there no other state run religious schools in Scotland. This idea separate schooling along with the OO isn't part of the mix doesn't match my experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenzie_mick I don't think any of those countries have state run religious schools so you could be on to something there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruth was conflicted "On the one hand 'Brexit' and on the other 'me, my job' "<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieAdam1969 So yet again what makes it a catholic school then?  They do not out perform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieAdam1969 That they consistently perform better is a myth that has been debunked. The church has a say in who can be teacher. Why?What does catholic maths and physics look like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJoh60210099 @SovereignAnnie @magnusllewellin They have an entrenched siege mentality and label any critics as bigots.Unfortunately they are not alone in that however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieAdam1969 Sure but if these schools are not really catholic anyway which is the modern claim  why do we need them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieAdam1969 So it wouldn't matter if the state stopped supporting them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJoh60210099 @SovereignAnnie @magnusllewellin The OO think it is only bigots who want to ban their marches. They stand by that too I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJoh60210099 @SovereignAnnie @magnusllewellin You wrote"it is only bigots who want to end catholic schools in Scotland". Blatently untrue and includes me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJoh60210099 @SovereignAnnie @magnusllewellin You just called me bigot which is blatantly untrue.Many people want to end it as they see it as an unnecessary division.Religions will still be free to stand or fall on their own merits in their own churches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous to suggest that this would "end division"or that the problem is'resurgent'.However it is equally wrong to claim separate schooling has no part to play in this problem in Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SovereignAnnie Yes but you wouldn't advocate race based schools to tackle racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinMBond @magnusllewellin Yes catholic maths and physics are the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SovereignAnnie @JohnJoh60210099 @magnusllewellin Regardless of the historical accuracy of your claim it is actually the catholic church which has say in who can be a teacher in catholic schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigdoob @magnusllewellin Or both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>only if they command  2/3's backing for this proposal presumably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker 'This is faiing' is a not a substantive argument. I sense this being dragged down to personal attacks now so I'll leave it there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker No deal brexit is a hard right project. Look who supports it - UKIP, DUP, Rees-mogg etc.He can hold those views if he wants and even make them public but don't cry foul if others react. Like Brewdog he should suck up any reaction he gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker If you don't think the ukip/ farage inspired brexit is a hard right project I don't know what you've been seeing. Anti immigration being the driving force. Cameron’s fear of the right got us the referendum. Nothing to with any personal opinion I have so no I'm not failing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker His hard line No-deal Brexit puts him in that camp I believe.But yes much like woke it can be used as a pejorative term. You think he's not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker The big difference is Martin is much more vocal and much more ideological. In the one case you criticize the board but on the other you criticise the public.A contradictory stance.What you wrote about BD at the time applies much more to WS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker And a final point. The term ‘woke’ might be solely used to describe lefties but hardline right wingers like Martin have their own form of ‘wokeness' with or without a label.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker ... so maybe not the woke lefties you imagine. Martin however is a very public hard no deal brexiter who does this stuff come what may(and now blames everyone else). It is ideological for him. I can't see why you defend him given what you said about BrewDog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker My point is you attacked BrewDog for similar things you now defend Martin for. I.e public politically view points. BrewDog are run by two young guys who use 'edgy' 'gimmicky' marketing to sell beer. They had one called 'trashy blonde'with slogan ‘you know shouldn't' ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker A reminder in case it’s been forgotten.  https://t.co/W9gcRcibVf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker Isn't this entirely what you predicted for BrewDog? “Woke and broke” was how you put it in that case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurStramash Yes and that’s before we even talk about overall quality of life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurStramash A double edged argument from a Scottish perspective though since the neighbors are also self governing(one of them has to be best/worst at any one time).Suffice to say most of those countries are outperforming UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurStramash Industry not economy but still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thoughtland “Do people think we're stupid” Yes. Yes they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPlaskett @RichardDawkins That's just the electricty across your neurons talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very telling from the replies that it is almost exclusively right wing hard brexiters who are A Neil's biggest fans. I'm sure it's just because they're the ones who like impartial interviewing most - or some other reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker He's spot on about the cult/religion aspect of  Brexit.'Will of the people' has replaced'Will of God'. Peoples vote etc are blasphemous terms against said 'Will of the people"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker Revealing language used by the author of the article-"road to unbelieving...lapsed from agnosticism to atheism".His personal starting point and perspective probably explains reluctant praise of Dawkins.For others there's no journey just choosing the credible over the incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker The comparison is stupid but the concern is not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@k_t_12345_67890 @GSpellchecker A no deal brexit as supported by Tim Martin would be a hard-line brexit in most peoples' view I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_t_12345_67890 @GSpellchecker Empirical evidence for what will happen in the future? You'll need to wait I'm afraid. Should BrewDog turn out to be “woke and broke” you're welcome to come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker @k_t_12345_67890 You mean opined. And in the same way I opine that that demographic,should it exist,will probably have little effect on BrewDog. Has wetherspoons hard brexit stance affected them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_t_12345_67890 @GSpellchecker 17 m leave voters - but the number of those who are Boris Johnson supporting hard line brexiteer snowflakes will be minimal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_t_12345_67890 @GSpellchecker They export to over 60 countries. The loss of a few snowflake brexiteers won't have any effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_t_12345_67890 @GSpellchecker They are a very successful co. This type of image as well as good beer is what made them that. Other bland beers are available to those who prefer that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker My comment was general not directed at you personally. But they are a global company who are well established in Europe. So they are not unaffected by what is happening. They might take a hit in the 'woke' wetherspoons pub chain though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSpellchecker They sell all over Europe. Have pubs all over (2 in Stockholm) . I don't think the loss of brexit ultras and far right tories would be much of hit to their target groups.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liambhoy1967 @hannahhrebekka You miss the point totally. A 15 year old boy has been charged. Are you claiming he has a misses , other-half or whatever you want to call her and she is pregnant?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkBarry67 @stephenac91 @NeilMackay But just to finish off-it strikes me as odd that Neil thinks some plonker calling him a “yoon plant” will “destroy” the yes movement more than him re-tweeting it to thousands and having it picked up by opponents. Not like we don't all know there are idiots out there on all sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkBarry67 @stephenac91 @NeilMackay Fair point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkBarry67 @stephenac91 @NeilMackay He more accurately fits the bill of 'troll' I.e someone who deliberately sets out to bait people without actually directing abuse at anyone in particular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkBarry67 @stephenac91 @NeilMackay You make it too easy for them mark. Individual examples may exist and these will be held up as “look we are fair and balanced”. My impression is that in general you are right and the accusations are mostly in one direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenac91 @MarkBarry67 @NeilMackay Anyway you move the goal posts - trolls and online abuse are not the same thing even if one may use the other.take wings e.g. who is often the focus of discussion in the Indy context. You may consider him abusive but I don't think you can label him a troll.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stephenac91 @MarkBarry67 @NeilMackay On line abuse is rife everywhere regardless of subject matter - politic, sport, religion, you name it and regardless of which side of the argument you're on. Yes I think self righteous fits the bill for some in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkBarry67 @stephenac91 @NeilMackay On line abuse was utilised by the no side as a solely yes-side phenomenom. A view also swallowed by the more self righteous on the yes side. Online abuse is much more widespread and complex than that simplistic and frankly ridiculous view.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk @SRRingP1 Problemet är att de kan avfärda begäran utan förklaring(om de gjorde i mitt fall). Man har bara en chans och kan inte begära igen. Helt värdelös med andra ord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk @SRRingP1 Jag kan också pass på att nämna papperstigern som går under namnet "Ny förvaltningslag 1 juli 2018". Enligt detta har man rätt att begära att en myndighet avgöra ett fall om de har haft det i mer en 6 månader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk @SRRingP1 till slut får jag svaret - "det finns inget system att ta reda på vilken plats någon har" !   så där har vid det - det finns ingen 'kö' .  Ett lotteri precis som många upplever det.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk @SRRingP1 Jag frågar vidare - " vilken plats har jag i 'kön' ?"  Standard svar-'olika fall ta olika långtid beroende på komplexitet' Jag frågar vidare " jag vill inte vet varför och hur - bara vilken plats jag har ?"<|endoftext|>

Did she not even sayin court he wasn't a homophobe?if she’d originally said'foul mouthed'we could've agreed but she went all in for max political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdoleman @WingsScotland I see why that would personally make you want him to lose.I think he's foul mouthed and can be a right prick.I've said he’s a Frankie Boyle wannabe.However Dugdale was using this politically and got it wrong.Whether we like him or not doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdoleman @WingsScotIand But the judge also ruled her remarks were defamatory?The contradiction is clear even if wrapped up in legalese.I'm also thinking back to the hibs fans who got 100 days in jail.Judges like anyone else subject to personal bias,public pressure or even whim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For clarity for those(from both sides) jumping on this slightly'dog whistle' tweet-the charges against Assange have not been dropped.He's never been charged!He was subject to an investigation which was shelved and may be restarted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stoneysnapper @ayrshirespeaker Now your discussing the detail and whether it was well drafted or not. None of that makes it a 'photo op' or provides an alternative. Just leaves us at square one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stoneysnapper @ayrshirespeaker It's both or none, your choice. The difference is one tries to do something(even if you suspect some sub-motive) and the other is about doing nothing  ( also with suspected sub-motive)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stoneysnapper @ayrshirespeaker May well have been badly done but baby was thrown out with bathwater for mere political gain.using it to snipe at the messenger is doing the same you accuse him of.

<|startoftext|>@Stoneysnapper @ayrshirespeaker So when someone actually decides to do something it gets derided as a photo op and then for purely political gain it gets binned without replacement and the hey ho big surprise here we are at square 1 again. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Used to work in #utrecht back and forward for a while. Great little university town. Whether it's right wing fascism or religious fascism it makes no odds - they have one thing in common - easily led minds manipulated by sociopaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin Yes , if you're adamant he acted consciously then we should leave it there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin It took about one second. I'm sure you've been angry yourself at some point and know it doesn't flip off like a switch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin And my final point - is it really so hard to understand that cracking an egg on someones head from behind illicits an angry instinctive response? (Regardless of how reprehensible that person is even without provocation)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin The mistake your making is assuming'weighing up' is a conscious decision. It can be subconscious(instinctive).The human brain is an amazing thing and we are more chemically driven than we like to think.  https://t.co/N1HUroOi1t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin No we don't know that. I refer to my previous answer. Instinct also weighs up the situation. It's not a conscious decision any more than a heartbeat or breathing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin Eh, he doesn't have time. At the moment that egg cracks on his head it’s instinctive -that is my whole point. If he went back half an hour later that would be different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveylittle @gordon_tony @Oldfirmfacts1 It's a good job he told us otherwise nobody would have known😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdoleman That’s definitely a “gotcha” and you didn’t have to go very far back on the timeline either.👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zizzyballord @timminchin No not what I'm  https://t.co/MitPyxWjmR wasn't a girl so I don't know. Instinctive response dependent on type of attacker.”flight or fight response”. All I'm saying is condemn all his other stuff where he has no excuses not how he instinctively reacts to getting egged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisappointedDi1 @timminchin True, but was it actually an analogy ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfinley1966 @timminchin I watched the video - about 1 sec from egging to punch. All animals instinctively gauge attacker’s before responding. There’s far more mileage condemning him for what he does unprovoked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like the picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_I_Bruce @timminchin And I'll give you the benefit of the doubt in assuming that reply was chemically driven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coder4hire @timminchin I'm not defending this guy as a person but I can see how instinct takes over in such situations. All animals weigh up their attackers instinctively. How long does it take before rational thought kicks in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin I don't think so. Just think there’s enough ammo to denounce him without having to deny that on some occasions  basic human/animal instinct takes over from rational thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blamblas @timminchin Not for anger it's not. We are all animals driven by chemicals more than we care to admit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin “He chose” - that’s ignoring the chemistry and instincts. milliseconds after being egged people do not go through a rational process of “ how old, how big what sex ?”- it’s all instinct like most animals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Anning  may be the worst person in the world and we may feel he deserved it but it's silly to ignore the chemistry behind anger and indulge in whataboutery. It wasn't an 8 or 15 year old or a girl. The choking is a different matter though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours I grew up in west of scotland and know the Swedish system.The Scottish system clearly fails in this respect. No one has ever answered me about what makes them catholic if they're so open and mixed- google certainly won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours If they are so open what is the fear of having only non denominational schools then? What actually makes them catholic? (Which is where I started)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours I haven’t said schools are teaching it. But the division enhances it. The current system clearly doesn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours England has it's own but different problem of bigotry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours The situation in England is nothing like the one in Glasgow. Much smaller percentage. Glasgow area  highest concentration and biggest problem. It's not the cause but it can be a factor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours Absolutely - but maybe could by countered by having truly non-denominational schools? One things for sure the status quo isn't fixing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours Unsurprisingly the more concentrated the division the worse the problem - culminating in the Glasgow area where we are repeatedly told the problem is worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebigbhuna @celticrumours Why would you want to do that? The state should provide good schools open to all and free from religion. The churches and can set up their own if they want to. I would ban or severely restrict OO walks though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk Ni har nyligen tagit bort all information om "fall som inte behöver utredas" från  https://t.co/RenaaNbk6w om en EU medborgare,32 år i sverige (klanderfritt) inte räknas som "inte behöver utredas"-vilka fall er det som inte behöver utredas?Svårt att se hur ni kan förklara och det<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk Ni har flera kör?Om vi tar exemplet av någon som har varit bosatt i Sverige 32 år, levt ett klanderfritt liv på alla sätt, kommer från ett EU land (UK-lätt att inhämta all information ifrån)- ni kan ändå välja att lägga det i långtidskön och gör inget med det i minst 2 år?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Migrationsverk Det betyder att"27 månaders väntetid" är helt meningslös. Innebär också att ni har inget 'kö system' - utan en slumpartat plockande av ärenden. Eller vilka kriterier används för att plocka upp ett ärende som är yngre and nuvarande  27 månaders väntetid ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@owldom @Telegraph "EU veto" of Scotland is posturing by British nationalists. EU would have no reason to block and independent Scotland. Certainly not to appease an Eu hostile England. Spain has UK where it wants it regarding Gib. now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thoughtland Not sure your position consistent.if Scotland is to have defence it either buys from likes of raytheon or gets them to produce in Scotland. Either way public money goes to them. Buying military equipment but saying we won't get involved in non military would be odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thoughtland Is position now that Indy Scotland should not only be nuclear free but a totally disarmed pacifist state? Sadly most multi nationals need incentivised to locate anywhere.

<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @daveylittle The SNP said they would negotiate to remove the weapons during the first session of an independent Scottish parliament - no lengthy transition at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @daveylittle Article states based on purely practical considerations weapons could stay for 20 yrs- no where to put them. But you suggest due to brexit economics these practical considerations will melt away and the weapons might move earlier - if there's a no vote 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaskyHT @daveylittle Correct, you were not making a clever point, it was completely illogical. If brexit means getting rid of the weapons earlier why can't that happen with a yes vote as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeanFind @Labour_Celts @ConorCheyne @dunkeIdbridge Then it makes no sense to talk about “The catholic church teaches...”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeanFind @Labour_Celts @ConorCheyne @dunkeIdbridge I think that's your interpretation. But the cardinals' interpretations were also clear on the aforementioned issue. Unequivocally so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeanFind @Labour_Celts @ConorCheyne @dunkeIdbridge Except for the Eucharist and all the other bits it takes literally. I think cardinals Winning and K o B were clear on their views on homosexuality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymonsnr @daveylittle @Labour_Celts Fine, but I still have no answer as to what catholic education really is. Your own choice suggests the 'catholic' part whatever it is has no added value for you. So why keep it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymonsnr @daveylittle @Labour_Celts No, yes. Why indeed. The church can choose to set up if they want to. Why allow the church influence in state schooling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymonsnr @daveylittle @Labour_Celts Yes Scotland and NI do have problems. That's the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymonsnr @daveylittle @Labour_Celts So we could happily get rid of them and there would be no difference? What makes the catholic then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeanFind @Labour_Celts @ConorCheyne @dunkeIdbridge Do they just skip those bits in the Bible then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Labour_Celts Would we say those religions are anti-lgbt? Yes I think we would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymonsnr @daveylittle @Labour_Celts What exactly is catholic education? Is there catholic maths, catholic chemistry for example? What is the catholic bit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dave_1297 The fact he said fifa instead of UEFA would merely compound his ignorance. This is someone opining on a national stadium to the BBC. If you're going to do that you need to know your stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_1297 No such list exists for the last 20 years or so. You'll find some sites with old lists.They still include Råsunda- demolished about 5 years ago! Even if UEFA did update ibrox wouldn't be on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kennywyatt78 tussle for ball is fine but when the attacker is ahead and the defender starts 'pawing' and tugging just to stop them.

<|startoftext|>@OfficialBartin @ScottSthlm Sweden doesn't have it  because they have high alcohol prices. 🤔If you don't know the root cause how do you this doesn't tackle it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@incognito1955 Highly likely in my experience .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@incognito1955 It might stop others becoming #addicts though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @ChrisGPackham ok  https://t.co/4w4T4mavLv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @YoloBirder you said there was no such thing as seagulls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow SNP this , SNP that but you don't do party politics - Aye right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA then why did you bring party allegiance into it? why did you say labour supported devolving duty when they don't ? Why did you resort to calling the SNP a cult? You brought up parties. The discussion is minimum pricing - keep on topic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA It was after indyref to discuss new powers.labour opposed, therefore alcohol duty is not an option  for scots gov. Your party politics are getting in the way of policy which could save lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA In the post Indy ref smith commission labour opposed devolving excise duty. The only 'fact' you presented turns out not to be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA No they didn't. Then as now they opposed in knee jerk fashion irrespective of the cause. If you think pricing helps get behind it, if not oppose with facts not party politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA You want a political squabble rather than a solution to Scotland's alcohol problems.Some people will adapt by drinking less. Doing nothing never solved a problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA Scottish labour did nothing about alcohol problems in 10 years in scots gov(or uk gov). But at least you seem to accept price will have an effect if you think raising tax would be better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anasdotscot @AlcoholFocus @AlisonDouglas18 And let's not forget how moderate drinkers will be deterred from going on to become hard drinkers. The discussion seems to assume these groups are fixed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA I've nothing against raising taxes either, but I don't think Scottish gov have power to raise alcohol duty in Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sensiblestu @EdinburghUP @scotgov As a point of balance I'm not at all convinced your laissez fairer attitude will achieve very much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA @SNSDglasgow It was a direct reply to specific tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA There is no tax angle- the point is to reduce sales. The fallacy is yours - a straw man fallacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNSDglasgow @RevPaulCA Tesco's tax avoidance, if there is any, would be something the UK gov should look at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA @SNSDglasgow Yes because free would clearly be below minimum price. Quite simple really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA "The extra money" ,assuming there is any, will go to the industry ( production, point of sale etc). It's not a tax. The industry opposed the change so I suppose they don't think there will be "extra money"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA No. And if the alcohol industry thought it would profit them they wouldn't have opposed it for 5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA It goes to the people selling - it is not a tax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something lost in the discussion - Yes,people who are already severe addicts may not be helped but many more might be stopped before they reach that level. Some of today's normal drinkers become tomorrow's alcoholics. #minimumpricing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevPaulCA It's not a tax. Alcoholism is vey taxing on society though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjsnowdon What a muddled up article.Citing  stats for Eng&amp;wal that don't have min pricing to somehow prove min pricing doesn't work? Genius<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OorJoe @amimmortal @HomeMckee @EKDon1983 @Jeggit @Ross_Greer @scotgp @patrickharvie Because they serve no educational purpose and are divisive creating differences between children where none exist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redrichie @ScottishLit Unless of course he is in the right. Smeer tactics are not unheard of in politics.if he's in the wrong he'll lose. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes To summarise you're saying RFC complied with tax law,did nothing unlawful and yet lost an appeal in SC, maybe due to "changes in law"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes Sometimes!So the law does not always explicitly state 'lawful' or 'unlawful'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking of starting a picture book Twitter for all those who struggle with words and think they look smart replying with  readymade gifs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes But I press you on one point. Does law specifically talk in terms of unlawful or lawful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes You yourself said you thought they would "win appeal but law has changed". You thought case was about compliance with law -no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes ... Am I right in saying the law doesn't actually talk in terms of 'lawful','unlawful'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes not complying with tax law can be lawful?That is a logical contradiction that makes a mockery of language...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @rangerstaxcase Ok, but it is law, not a 'good behaviour code'. It's the contorted euphemisms I don't get.Calling it unlawful is not bollox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @rangerstaxcase Surely the case was heard on the law as it stood at the time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes So e.g if I park somewhere thinking it's ok but I am wrong that is called 'illegal parking' is it not? Not  'bad behaviour'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes Are saying it is lawful? If not then it surely can be described as unlawful regardless of any penalties.This is a language issue not the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @_effes Was what they did lawful? If not what would you call it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @RadioJammor @AyrshireBog no it hasn't. That claim was totally debunked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog if your happy with your lot then fine. But others may have more ambition and vision beyond Barnett.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @RadioJammor @AyrshireBog yeah history of the world in 140 chars. The information is out there. As we started - inform yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog well pull the covers over you. you're in for a rough ride in Brexit if you choose not to react.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @RadioJammor @AyrshireBog no guarantees,not at all.But no change is rarely a solution to problems.I see what similar countries do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog if it's as bad as you say why wouldn't you want to change something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog but why do you think your country is uniquely incompetent in these matters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog you need ambition and control to deal with those. alternatively do nothing and get the bowl out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @RadioJammor @AyrshireBog nobody ever knows the future. she warned and was proved right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioJammor @nowayjomo @AyrshireBog exactly, it's only scaremongering if it's not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog and that looks increasingly like a change to the Barnett bowl as uk right is emboldened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog except now a no vote is not for status quo. it is for a precarious future in isolated UK with no chance to influence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog you want a full 'white paper' from me, but somehow changing nothing will fix the problems?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog I think if independent you could change and thrive like surrounding countries. Changing nothing changes nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @RadioJammor @AyrshireBog it said 'out of the EU' obviously wd have rights if still in EU.As warned  no meant dragged out of EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog You might lose the Barnett formula anyway. what then if your begging bowl is empty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog 'probably'! No one knows-there was no 'white paper',nothing! vague promises on TV thats's it.The reality of Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog are you really saying that SNP are the anti-immigration party. baseless. That's Tories ukip and lab .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog that's in the union is it not? And now your out of Europe uk situation will get worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog so voting no was directly detrimental to EU nationals through Brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog that's a fact is it not. That's what is happening  not due to indyref but due to Brexit madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog 'old chestnut'? Why would scots not succeed?where does  unique incompetence of your country come from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog in which way has the no vote benefited EU nationals- by leading to BRexit? Makes no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog How did they scare EU nationals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog No reason why Scotland couldn't succeed like surrounding small nations. Indy Ref. Is not a vote for SNP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog they had a position you had another. That's allowed EU ref discussed nothing and now you know nothing about impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog all those were discussed on all sides. EU was 'immigration,take back control' now no one has a clue what will happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog an isolated uk wouldn't be sensible choice IMO. But level of discussion was chalk and cheese compared to EU ref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowayjomo @AyrshireBog so you were informed and made your choice! Thats what FM said. Brexit was side of a bus decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney GERS is an estimate and data is not SG data. Your claim was debunked. That's your QED moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney Yes,GERS say the stat sources are HM treasury and GERS numbers are estimates.QED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney simply put it's not Scottish 'data'.It's chunks of uk data apportioned by pop. I.e. estimates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney "and" therefore 'data' not gathered by SG statisticians and economists as you claimed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney so you are claiming SG collect data?And ONS is SG body?.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney large chunks apportioned by population without really knowing where benifit is derived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney just did. HM Treasury first and foremost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney the data is actually CRA  data from HM Treasury according to GERS pages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney *you're<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney your saying SG gather the data on things such as defence spending?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SH_IpsosMORI @RichardJMurphy @MrMcEnaney they are not data. Which was the point. How good are they? Who knows,which again was the point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bigronni3 @Barcabhoy1 yes and it happened last night again in gross fashion, and everyone saw it.Barca fans can't pretend otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigronni3 @Barcabhoy1 only if people shrug their shoulders and accept it. What level of cheating becomes unacceptable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 @Con_Shaunnery i saw him on tv last night but found this too.  https://t.co/LduP98hut5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 @Con_Shaunnery your timeline suggests otherwise. Lars Lagerbäck was raging last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 yes, all the time. Even my son's team. No amount of what about covers up for Suarez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 Suarez already booked for sim. tries his luck again. Goes down holding throat! Not exactly appealing for a corner is it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 @RJMcL @cardiffbhoy last night's diving was persistent and systematic. Can't disentangle it from the comeback<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TumshiePam @cartujakds 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TumshiePam @cartujakds yes I agree it is stupid. I think I'm being consistent here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam the 'rebuke' was aimed at all who followed. pam herself toned it down a bit. it's sweeping generalisations I dislike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam that statement premised on him actually being cult leader which seems based on personal animosity rather than fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam 'your cult leader' is clearly addressed at a member of a cult not at the leader even if that was not the intention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam not sure I get it.the block list is stupid but what 'suspicions' should I gleen from that? Genuine question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam the full quote was actually 'your cult leader' Anyway we reached some sort of agreement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TumshiePam @cartujakds fair do's and to be clear I do find him crude and very base. A bit of Frankie Boyle wannabe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam but cult is not a reference to him but those who dare to read him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam confirmation bias is exactly why people shouldn't Block.The guy is both popular and reviled.Maybe both are cults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam no it doesn't.Block &amp; unfollow all and sundry if you want to live in an echo chamber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam his character does not preclude me from using him as source.Has no impact on my character nor does it alter facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam two wrong as and all that.He's a mixture of foul and fact.It is possible to look without being in 'cult'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cartujakds @TumshiePam probably true but accusations of 'cult' are childish and very damaging too. Challenge or ignore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySalmond is no. 2) the ”soil" part of nationalism? How your words can be construed against you eh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WingsScotland surely you're smart enough to know that would get twisted into 'homophobia' regardless of intention.Distracts from argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer it was foul but the hate is you reading between the lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer so you can chose the good from the bad even from the same book? Or is anyone of that faith enabling homophobia - compare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer you're a Christian Ross maybe you should re-examine the homophobic bible before getting on your high horse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer @caorach his last tweet was bad not because it was homophobic but because it foul and can so easily be portrayed as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer @caorach some of his tweets are foul some are factually good.Who legitimised that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer @caorach "anyone sharing his tweets is enabling bigotry"? That's just shutting down discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross_Greer @caorach shut down anyone sharing any of his tweets whatever they are? that's certainly not a good look.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenSaund nor do 99.9999% of people which is kind of the point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenSaund Sweden is calm and borderline boring. Of course things happen. The PM got murdered in open Street 30 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund what defensiveness?  Calling Trumps lies for what they are is a straightforward position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund you seem.to want there to be 'big problems' Doesn't make it so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund it was a lie. what other lies might he tell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund 'big problem' -your opinion formed by statements like Trump and others who want it to be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund what bigger lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund both sides of what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund again you trivialise this particular lie for some reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund and how are people to decide if statement is unchallenged?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund not challenging lies is a very strange position to adopt.would only help him more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund people taking a look now are us/UK right wingers. Immigration has always been discussed in Sweden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund "issues Re immigration"?  of which you are informed by the known liar Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund he lied - at the very least that needs mocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund so you are now informed about issues in Sweden? Thanks to Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund what he's claimed about Sweden should not be dismissed as 'a little thing' Blatant lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSaund you seem to be suggesting he shouldn't be called out for his lies lest it helps him with his own supporters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WingsScotland @SovereignAnnie it's a lie on two counts.No queue and she is not '"EU commission"any more than afneil is the BBC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michael14burke @MeIodyMac @FraserWhyte81 oil has doubled in price this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke at the time of independence! So unknown figures from the future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke so which set of gers figures is the starting point? At time of white paper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @wordpressdotcom I'm am countering your categorical assertions in the same way you counter  Cherrie's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @wordpressdotcom they do not 'state' that. Would make no sense to estimate and then state estimate is wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @wordpressdotcom... So let's not start shouting liar straight off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @wordpressdotcom if you accuse others of inaccuracy you have to be accurate yourself. she was question in EU context...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @michael14burke @FraserWhyte81 it was you who referenced it. So you accept it's validity or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac  @wordpressdotcom he has taken disparate figures and merged on assumptions.Even ESS site says shd "interpret with due care"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @michael14burke @FraserWhyte81 not confused, just want to be sure you accept white paper as good reference material?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeIodyMac @michael14burke @FraserWhyte81 yes, but what point are you making?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michael14burke @FraserWhyte81 at least we have public display of character of the blogger. Less serious than blog makes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidInFlalala @johanknorberg the numbers show an enormous disparity in wealth however you cut it and it's not just down to 'hard work'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke footnote 3. Ending this as you are resorting to abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke just to be clear you are using white paper figures as reference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke... large chunks based on estimates and pro-rata distribution by population. Not a budget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke your graphs exclude oil. A fact hidden in a footnote...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke it not a start it's guesstimate of intake and what's spent by and on behalf of Scotland in current setup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke and gers do not represent budget of an independent Scotland, which is kind of the point I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke yes your graphs exclude oil and that was the blog and original source says stats are uncertain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidInFlalala @johanknorberg probably true but not sure if you're arguing for or against me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserWhyte81 @michael14burke note 3 in the blog specifically says that excludes oil.Are you wrong now or then?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ian_mclaughlin looking back i see you were indeed  talking about infant mortality. That is the mistake you made<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ian_mclaughlin One way to check would be trial it somewhere else other than Finland I suppose.  Hmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian_mclaughlin that's child mortality  which of course has gone down every where. SID is almost double in UK compared to Finland  https://t.co/pjOgg8HY0R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian_mclaughlin which i returned  to show shortcomings of your objection.Even if you don't like it, it is evidence but not absolute proof.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shangmortal @prodiver02 @terencecallacha @MrMalky yes all of UK has huge debt so no one part subsidises the other.That makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shangmortal @prodiver02 @terencecallacha @MrMalky so England's not subsidising Scotland then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shangmortal @prodiver02 @terencecallacha @MrMalky so who's paying? Can't be England subsidising Scotland since England's got big debt!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cartujakds ..are few 'catholic names' amongst them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daveylittle mine not long finished at Enskede.Started that house stuff when they were half way through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveylittle which one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 that point I accept. Izzy was kippered but I won't blame him for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 it's referees who are naive imo. Seem to fall for it so easily. Not like Suarez is unknown quantity in things like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 harsh to blame someone at the same time as  praising the cheat for being clever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 that's where we differ- it's been allowed to creep into the game. Referees really should be aware of this stuff too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 it's Andy Walkers fault.😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 'clever' 'takes advantage'- just euphemisms for cheating. acc to rules should be free-kick to Celtic for Saurez  holding- No?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic would love to thump Malmö in the qualifiers next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 watch again - he traps izzy's arm. Why is he allowed to do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 if you watch the replay Suarez clearly jams izzys arm between his arm and body and pulls Izzy on to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 sorry that's a bit waffly. A bit like 'felt contact and went down'. It's cheating and he conned the ref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 what exactly is the foul? Pushing, holding or tripping? Can't see any of those<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 'latched on until he was down'. Do the rules allow you to 'latch on'? How was Izzy supposed to get away if he was 'latched'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmcardle1 that feed you watched wasn't very clear was it? Cheating pure  and simple by Suarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dab24156 @Sevcoholic ok no offence intended or taken.👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic yep home game against BMG was only real disappointment and even then it was 2 gifts they scored from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dab24156 @Sevcoholic if you want out you  just have to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 ...and press high up the pitch.Huge step forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 ok, my first reaction was 'dive' -it was Suarez after all.Impressed that we dared to play out of tight situations...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 same here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 not sure I understand you. Looks a penalty a mile away but he cheated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 throws his arms forward as he 'falls'.Completely unnatural and total giveaway.Somehow doubt we would have got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dab24156 @Sevcoholic we'd be wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevcoholic @dab24156 it was Suarez who jammed izzy's arm between his own arm and body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dab24156 nothing rash about it.Suarez totally conned the ref.Him an Neymar, quality but no class.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton once had a similar type of discussion with Owen - he just called me 'thick' after about 4 tweets. Thanks for your time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton and I agree entirely that attempts to relativise these two horrific events is absurd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton it's assigning it to some Jews but omission gives impression was assigning to Jews as a group which is clearly AS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton yes, asking what was meant by 'many' is a valid point.just thought omitting was a bit lets say cheeky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton I agree wider context of greater importance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton the claim stands or falls on the facts. 'Chief' doesn't really make a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton @DavidDPaxton surely you see difference between saying "x were" and 'many x were". It puts a different slant on things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton ...with 'many' then will depend on veracity of claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton the omission of 'many' is as much a meaning changer as the omission of 'too'. W/o 'many' definitely anti-Semitic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton ... similar to the point made about 'too'. Anyway a good read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton difference is implying"responsible for" as opposed to "involved in".No idea of truth but omission of 'many' raises the stakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDPaxton good article with one  https://t.co/0FpZdj5EWl rightly pt out of the omission of"too" but you yourself omit "many"(were financiers).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill that's probably true as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill still true even if you don't like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill it's true no matter what.Silly to deny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill hope to live longer than that.Which club will be the next plaything. Only room for 4 or 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill you got lucky enjoy it while lasts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill i've nothing against city but some clubs make history others try to buy it. Think Chelsea and city,think oil money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill but it's our team, not some rich oil sheiks. You'll end up with tourists for fans ( swedes for example)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill like winning the lottery eh! Imagine Celtic in that league. Might just attract a sheik or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @paul_bovill that's what leads to library atmosphere. Teams like Celtic important for football. Don't knock it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill disinterest is already starting. Won't be much fun when the richest sheik is what determines who wins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill you are . How much affinity had they for city before they bought. Just happened to be available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill ...preferred city as they were. This will kill football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill ... and more "Citys" once Chinese start buying clubs as playthings. Just not a sustainable model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill relatively speaking city have been CL flops considering oil sheik money pumped in. there will be more...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvantiBlues @TunesCfc @paul_bovill sky and oil sheik money will get you players but world class atmosphere is much harder to come by<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TunesCfc @paul_bovill @AvantiBlues nobody remembers city for the atmosphere.Celtic's praised worldwide.Some things oil sheiks can't buy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timpailthorpe @Tim_McNulty @Nightingale_P @KrustyAllslopp @DuncanWeldon I haven't. Tidal forces related to volume too,hence cube not square<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_McNulty @Nightingale_P @KrustyAllslopp @DuncanWeldon Ah! see now you spotted it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_McNulty @Nightingale_P @KrustyAllslopp @DuncanWeldon that states - "The actual tidal influence then is then 44% of that of the Moon."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_McNulty @Nightingale_P @KrustyAllslopp @DuncanWeldon suns tidal force ~40% of moon.Carswell was Rs over elbow but nightingale wrong too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joergneulist @Tim_McNulty not true sun does have significant  tidal effect .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_McNulty @Nightingale_P @KrustyAllslopp @DuncanWeldon inverse square is for gravity - it's inverse cube for tidal forces.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity asked you a question. Are you a financial expert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindawhitson1 @Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity why, because you come from the less well off UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity that's not the unionist propaganda but it doesn't say what you hope either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity yes the true story of Norway is to be found in a unionist blog 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity that's how saving in funds  work. As opposed UK  borrowing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity straw man klaxon. Never said I was a financial expert. Are you claiming to be one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity did you read it? Fund will still grow more than they use. Piggy bank getting bigger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity that's not selling assets. That's using savings.Selling the Royal Mail is selling assets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity yes speaking the language and having been there several times is no substitute for reading unionist propaganda 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scanditwitchen origin of feeling "queasy"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kallemet86 @Atheist_Deity behave yourself, Norway is not selling assets.Norway borrows much less than England.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity whatever but  $27.67 is still the lesser number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity now now we were talking about since January. Nice try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond  27.67&lt;28.94 if you can't accept that then I bid you good bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity that price is lower than the one you quoted so your price is not lowest QED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity I'll make it easy "The price of Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel at one point,"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity yes and that is wrong did you not read the article? 1st line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @Kallemet86 @2351onthelist @Haitch7 paranoia - about what? if your going to be pendatic you need to get it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond lowest price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Aye 2 different economies -that's thepoint. UK debt per gdp one of highest in world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity eh - it shows you were wrong with your price claim. You were the pedantic one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond but you were wrong - bummer eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @Kallemet86 @2351onthelist @Haitch7 Who said that?make up your own untruth and shoot it down - strawman argument.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity UK debt around 90% of GDP norway around 30%.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity brent was lower than that and was over $51 recently so your wrong too, #pedantic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @thebestbond @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity you prefer to gorge on subsidies rather than dip into savings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Doubt they will just sit back and suggest living of subsidies though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @thebestbond @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Scotland is less bad than you claim. Still well behind Sweden Norway though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity I'd need evidence of that.Your lofty claims do not match your output.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Nonensense - Norway still made billions last year. Oil price has doubled since Jan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity one of these is scotland the other is norway  https://t.co/Xj4ig94mqC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @thebestbond @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity the oil isn't i Oslo. investing resources not squandering on tax cuts was key<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity if you do things the uk way -but that's the point, doing it differently rather than subsidy culture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity no they're not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity You pay to see GP in Sweden too.If that's your main concern then SNP would be your safest bet for now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity There are many levels below nirvana which are better than subsidy dependency that you seem to accept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Edinburghchap @Atheist_Deity wanting a modern European state is no romantic image.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity tories are 🔨 benefits. So why will they continue to subsidies you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcPeeps @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity  yeah that gifs being doing the rounds.was mildly amusing 1st time. 1000th time not so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Edinburghchap @Atheist_Deity i see what can be achieved.subsidy culture of unionist is a depressing vision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @thebestbond @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity they give and you take. What's your way out of that.l?More of the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity silly can be fun but not really a vision is it? Dependency and subsidy as a vision is less funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @thebestbond @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity you say you  can only survive with London hand outs. If not a subsidy then what? A loan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity they have proved to be very competent. And that is what irks unionists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity listed powers introduced in 2016 with huge spendings not devolved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity so you either want to cut that and lose union benefit or continue with subsidy? Which?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity in the same way my kids had total control of their pocket money? UK spends huge sums on Scotland behalf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebestbond @Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity 300 years of union should have achieved better than the subsidy nation you describe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity education and health are performing worse in England wales.its all out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atheist_Deity @Haitch7 unionist problem is they want to say everything is great in union but somehow everything is a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @thebestbond @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity but you want free NHS and continued benefits hand outs from westminster?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity fully devolved but with limited power.Westminster hands out  a block grant to play with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity so do you want Scotgov to increase?Or are the tories the free spenders not SNP.? You seem contradictory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity aren't the hospitals in Westminster run NHS in a far worse state?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity you're the one asking to keep benefits from London! Freeloading on subsidy.SNP want to end that no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity and Westminster are doing something about it are they?perpetual subsidy is a terrible vision to have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity you like free doctor visits. Sounds like you're more Holyrood than Westminster than you think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity standard of life far higher,it really is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity it's about future vision as opposed to some Victorian style past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity it's really just a tribal anti SNP thing. Unionism for the sake of it but no real ambition stated.No vision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity get to Norway and you'll see what might have been achieved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @2351onthelist @Atheist_Deity I 'm there often. What do you have in mind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Westminster in control. Holy rood much more limited. That's what you're fighting to keep is it not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity how long have they benefited from oil and how wisely have they used. Like Norway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2351onthelist @Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity I discuss substantive points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity so it's an SNP thing? If there was another party in power independnce would work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity you get a block hand out from London.Recently got to keep 30% of taxes though. Westminster has your purse string<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity Westminister is in charge is it  not. That's the status quo you want is it not?Westminster and subsidy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haitch7 hanging on to your benefits. Even the Baltic states don't do that.  https://t.co/SGq27RWzTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkinMr @jikdmmen @JamesMelville so UK is a one party state now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity you said you got benefits and didn't want to lose them. Maybe not sponging but sounds like subsidy to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity I'm Scottish why wouldn't it.So what if England cuts your benefits?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity happy to live off others wd be terrible state of affairs.What if England cuts your benefits ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity aye you're pulling and they're sharing. But you're ok with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity are you not subsidised by England?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haitch7 @Atheist_Deity you guys are subsidy junkies, but that's how you want it I hear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamieRoss7 10 o' clock and that's happened already - what's left to live for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham obviously, but not my point at all. "Do x then y". X and y different in both cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham still think it is linguistic contortion to avoid the term best suited.This is linguistics not points of law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham isn't that the same even for murder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham you can reverse the logic to the same effect.surely tax law says either 'do' or 'don't do'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham if tax law says don't do 'x' then 'x' is ??? Can't see how you get round that.Pedantic maybe but Lawyers don't own language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham just an opinion,but that is the sort of lengths you have to go to just to avoid using 'unlawful'.Not really a technical term<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham i only ask b'cos saying not 'illegal' or 'unlawful' gives some impression it is somehow merely 'naughty'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham understand but what is correct technical term? "Doesn't work" strangely enough doesn't work as a term.C.f" illegal parking"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham yes. But surely that's ok?  Simpler than euphemisms such as "didn't work" ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdoleman That was jo maugham that claimed that. Preferred to use tax euphemism- "didn't work".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jpak1888 @sane_opinion that was me.!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jpak1888 @sane_opinion yep that's why I wrote 'crime' and not crime, cos I knew it wasn't a crime.And I know it's because and not cos too😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jpak1888 @sane_opinion by elevating from rule breaking to 'crime'? How wd that be trivialising?Anyway as I said it was  twitter limitation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jpak1888 @sane_opinion I know.I never said it was banned - she took it openly for 10 yrs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scotzine @gordon_tony @Riddrie @shogg89 have same opinion about Mo but strangely he is highly rated here.Maybe Scotland's the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotzine @shogg89 from anyone.That's the thing,with very few exceptions, you never how it will work out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Riddrie @scotzine @shogg89 so you know he will always have injuries? Tell us your secret?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotzine @shogg89 nobody can see the future.Many examples of players who blossomed after a move. Can't understand the need to snipe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotzine @shogg89 but declared with certainty.If it was easy to predict football would be boring.I wish him luck no matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotzine @shogg89 yep - do we still think people can never develop beyond the age of 23?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shogg89 @scotzine 'one trick pony' is a cliche.Who knows how he might blossom in another environment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman English are lovely,why do you want to live off them ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr  even if true that's as part of the Union! Your solution is the begging  https://t.co/9QfsuObPpf long will rUK put up with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman if your bankrupt your living off others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman a thick white paper or a wafer thin vow.Still bankrupt and useless in your opinion.Look at other small countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman bankrupt,subsidised but hey let's not change anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman you're saying Scotland is bankrupt but is bailed out by rUK and that is the only future you see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman your saying live off others or go bankrupt.A uniquely depressing view of a country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman why wd anyone be proud to be a subsidy junky dependent on others.And uniquely so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman so we could end the bankruptcy by changing the council tax?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman your saying it is a subsidy junkie but your happy with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman Scotland is not separate. Are you saying it is not bankrupt now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman I'm curious as to why anyone wd think being bankrupt is a reason for not changing anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastry_mr @jamesdoleman you claim Scotland is bankrupt. How did the union let it get to that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke Your arguments were complimentary to not counter to his suggestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke someone saying " suggests" doesn't imply "and nothing else".That was your add-on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke if he didn't say "nothing else" then I really don't see what your bone of contention is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke the evidence so far suggests it is not he case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke well that's the point. And it is more than just a 'curiosity'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke "nothing else". His words or yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke it dents her image. But maybe that's all is - image. Her books and fame are irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke you don't want to believe she is capable of trolling and following the worst sort of troll but she does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke given her anti Indy stance I don't think we need search around for more obscure reasons for her following 'him'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke more realistic is JK thinks it's ok because of who he targets and is indifferent as to how he does it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke which in no way negates the mysogonistic tweets. So no I don't your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke your point was lost in whataboutery. he is reprehensible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graemekaney @simon_brooke the notion that his behaviour is worse than just misogyny is hardly an endorsement to follow him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamesdoleman @STVGrant @drobb980 totally aware but to call it 'clutching' is pejorative in the opposite direction was my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STVGrant @jamesdoleman @drobb980 calling it  'clutching' before judges even speak is equally strange position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McNabbScot @StFilansDream @RuthDavidsonMSP I particularly like how she discusses " a fake Rev" with a fake QC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StFilansDream, @RuthDavidsonMSP is a follower of said Spanner. Shd maybe include her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden yes but in the meantime Spanners tweets are unchallenged and he is still followed. Anyway thanks for discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden yes but that was my point.When you find out do you go after the messenger or distance yourself from them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden can understand that in general terms but not the case here. JK has many interactions with Spanner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden ... And JK follows him. Not just exchanging a 'few' tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden slur is your term.original point abt   support of Spanner not w/o merit. He appears to be disgusting to women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If alive today he'd use Twitter like other authors. "When Nietzsche went mad in 1889,he sent short,nonsensical letters to his friends"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLauraMarcus yes deference to celebrity is a good thing that we all learnt from the BBC 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeeFiarse BBC was full of globally loved rich people who could do no wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonMoyet @ScotsInSweden you wd just explain that when you found out then? Or wd you escalate immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin like I say more than 'a couple of nice tweets' and actually follows him.Anyway nice having a friendly debate. Getting late here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin just tell me you're not voting for Trump or Carson for that matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin if you call Ben Carson smart I will bring up creationism! But maybe we agree on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin Is it not you how is pinning everything on the one word 'defend'. Subsequent tweets explained clearly to JK what she meant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin yes and she was right to point that out.I won't vilify her for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin there is a sub-plot of Scottish politics here that you may not be aware of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin she could just have said that. She chose to attack the messenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin but takes the time to call him brilliant and a good man. I know whose position I find most reprehensible in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin that wasn't the claim.Claim was supporting him.now if she's called him up on this fine.But haven't seen anything to suggest yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin She was accused of being supportive of a mysogonistic troll. not specifically his mysogony.  https://t.co/no0y5zJDM0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin She actually follows the person in question. Not proof but I think she knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling him brilliant in a non-supportive way of course #JKRowling  https://t.co/JM1RbWAvqN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the face of it this seems pretty supportive by J K Rowling.  https://t.co/aJqJHvcXxW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin nobody said it does but there are many more friendly interactions than that. Not just one tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin good advice. May or may not apply to you. I make no claims either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin your entitled to think he is not misogynist if you like but I think his tweets were vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin the claim was not the jk was supportive of misogyny. She was supportive of misogynist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin so that's claim one established. She wrote supportive tweets about him. Only claim 2 left to consider now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin you think I'm assuming things abt you? Is that an assumption?Haven't made any claims about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mteresin but she did indeed write supportive tweets of said person. Don't be in awe  of celebrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweden hasn't said it will deport 80k #bbctw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialAnasSCO @ITVTonight I don't if anyone is but the Sweden thing is an internet myth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialAnasSCO @ITVTonight the idea might be good but Sweden is not leading the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenThackerey you may be right that a bubble is about to burst again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenThackerey Economy is of course affected by but not dependent on.If that was the case then something very wrong with UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenThackerey why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamSpiers " 'We' acknowledge every member...is fully committed". Who are 'we' and what basis do they have for making the counter claim?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DS_dieci @Boab10 @bellacaledonia in what way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DS_dieci @Boab10 @bellacaledonia figure probably includes season ticket holders even if not there.Rangers do this as well.Maybe others<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd @alcampian why wd I not get to Scotland?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steadfast163rd @rapwest @Logic_Flawed @alcampian your happy with your lot. I think there a brighter alternatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd @alcampian you think things can't get better.I do.I've seen what's possible first hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd @alcampian it's all about ambition rather than defeatist "we can't do that".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd @alcampian none of that says anything abt Scotland's viability whither true or false<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd @alcampian 'sleaze and mess' is just generalised tabloid smearing.Anything specific?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian No it doesn't and I do. You think Scotland lives off hand-outs and are happy with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian not difficult, not relevant. You say scotland is an economic basket case(huge deficit)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian it's you who's saying you live of English hand-outs not me.I think Scotland can do fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian but that company depends on an economy subsidised by England so you say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian are you living off english hand-outs as you claim or do you aspire to more?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian no reason at all that Scotland couldn't be as successful as the Scandinavian countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian Yep looking for something more than  being happy to live off hand-outs - imagine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian again, my words to describe YOUR viewpoint.You're the one parading anti-scottish views<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rapwest @Logic_Flawed @Steadfast163rd @alcampian leading by living of handouts? A nation of spongers according to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Flawed @rapwest @Steadfast163rd  @alcampian why are you scots so useless at running your own country compared to say Scandinavians?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern ' Nat group think' ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern No but yours is that Scotland can never succeed.Which is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern if true then why is union good for Scotland? union clearly failing Scotland then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern "spew", "you lot". - why the need to be so unpleasant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern wasn't actually a majority of scots, but that was the democratic process chosen unlike EU referendum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern Scotland wd not be bankrupt as you try to paint it.However position now is as part of union.No ducking that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern who knows what 'policies' Indy Scotland wd have? Indy means being able to change accordingly.That's the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMacEachern @AdamDLondon yes no reason at all that Scotland couldn't be a successful as the Scandinavian countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern why would you exclude oil from Scotland's tax contribution for last 30 years?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern so how do others small countries do it. What is the unique Scottish problem that is never solved in the union?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern again ... If nothing changes. I.e. If union problems not tackled.Indy but staying the same is not the idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern ... So you need to research and that doesn't meant heading mail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @IndyForEvil @PoliticsScot @scottishlabour going by your figures the union holds Scotland back compared to similar countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @IndyForEvil @johnmcternan @PoliticsScot @scottishlabour indulging you that your figures are correct, that is now in the union!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern you're describing the economics of the union.Small Independent countries do well.Why not Scotland?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern those are your figures within the union.that's the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern you don't understand a referendum vs election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern YES didn't pledge any such thing.YES was not a political party with a manifesto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cuddlesandkafka @BuzzFeedNews extra cheese? Can the white male explain that to me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern No one can say that for certain. Situation is dire now you say. Why did a NO not prevent that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamDLondon @JamesMacEachern thats with a NO and no change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @Mattr1873 of rangers' liquidation ? Or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @GilmertonLoyal @Mattr1873 exactly - no difference. Just a vehicle to deny the unpalatable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @GilmertonLoyal @Mattr1873 inescapable convoluted narritive of your own making<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @GilmertonLoyal @Mattr1873 one and the same in fact<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Don't like the silly personal stuff but if it's a battle of wits you've come half-armed .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @Green20William @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky We agreed on something. Let's finish on a positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @Green20William @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky Well at least we're all agreed that the club was fined for entering insolvency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Can't see anything in there that says rangers didn't enter liquidation. sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 as opposed to  'dissolved' - big difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Club fined for insolvency - you said it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 That club has never entered admin or liquidation. Annoying isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 That's a set of ground regulations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 club fined for entering admin.Thing that enters admin goes into liquidation,ergo club in liquidation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67 @Weerthepeople @Kilky43 yes they tie themselves in knots over this. Too many stories that have to be maintained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67 Exactly - none of this 'company'  re-writing of history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Thanks - enjoyed that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67 @Weerthepeople @Kilky43 yes and teddy agreed. He accepts his 1st club went insolvent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 in process of liquidation - it is a matter of when not if. Can't avoid it I'm afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 club fined for insolvency - you said it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 not officialy yet. A pendantic point of little comfort I fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 you basically admitted they're a  new club .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Aye lessons learnt eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 so club insolvent(let's call it admin) and thing that went into admin got liquidated ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 About the SFA fine. I can see why you would chose to retreat now. You know where we're heading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 the club were fined for entering insolvency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheClumpany SFA statement "Rangers' lawyer, in contrast, specifically asked for the club (sic) to be fined".   https://t.co/JJWxCwoJwt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 so what about that fine for 50k from the SFA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43  https://t.co/JJWxCwoJwt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 Because the SFA fine was for the old club? Many agree with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 wrong fine I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 you don't count this then.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43  what were the club fined for then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 @Kilky43 maybe he means Hearts. Not sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67 There is a claim by  @Kilky43 that some club was fined for going into administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67 I want to hear from @Kilky43  which clubs were fined for going into administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67 wait till you see where I'm going with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weerthepeople @McGinleyBhoy67  Ask  @Kilky43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kilky43 @McGinleyBhoy67 Are you saying Rangers are the only club fined for going in to administration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaHaggerty @fourmenterian but if addressing inequality is hindered by lack of independance what then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGinleyBhoy67  I'm curious as to which club  @Kilky43 thinks was fined for going into administration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kilky43 have any ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kilky43 or shouldd Bolton go into victim mode and blame everyone else for their own misdemenours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tara_Hewitt @kilarahrh right or wrong that is a personal opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tara_Hewitt @kilarahrh that wd've removed entire front row.Anyway who wd decide.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andybearz don't be silly. You seem think they've won a claim. They haven't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybearz @STVGrant so what bearing does  that have on ' going on to sue' for 1st 2 instalments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybearz @STVGrant ruling only says evidence didn't convince judge they might go bust.Nothing to do with validity of bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybearz @STVGrant they haven't won the 3rd instalment back you know!Just not ring fenced. Still a debt,albeit disputed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @BraidenHT @chrismccork and any alcohol bought split 8 ways.proves the point really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraidenHT @Gri64 @chrismccork yes that's basically my view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @BraidenHT @chrismccork you want to stop ppl spiralling into alcohol abuse.Increased price has moderate effect on moderate drinkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @BraidenHT @chrismccork of course price affects consumption.That's how markets work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @BraidenHT @chrismccork they're only concerned about sales/profit.That's why they oppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JournoStephen and any misery and depravation heaped onto family/children  is just collateral damage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @BraidenHT @chrismccork if price wasn't an issue why do drinks companies fight it so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gri64 @RabDickson @BraidenHT @chrismccork the culture is cheap booze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraidenHT @Gri64 @chrismccork point is it stops ppl becoming bottom rung.Those already there need other help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJH_EK @Mopgaw I know. Annoying isn't it. He gets to keep his history though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJH_EK @Mopgaw or is it the company that owns him that went bust? #owngoal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Midwifesupastar it's living off benefits and benefits can be cut you. Better to be self sufficient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Midwifesupastar better get the wages and standard of living up first.but you live of subsidies from London you say so how can that happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperDooker all scotchmen are effectively living off benefits and subsidies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Midwifesupastar but content to accept your lot as a failed region and live off London hand outs? That's sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Midwifesupastar when the oil runs will Scotland be like a benefits claimant?Living of London handouts.Depressing vision for your country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingTweets23 you like a debate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardDawkins @RJDownard if talking abt'median'. Probably even more below 'mean' unfortunately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RateofKnots @NorwayStats @scotzine McInnes and mind games- an oxymoron ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RateofKnots @NorwayStats @scotzine club's fine it's the team that's bad and there's a reason for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL anything to do with Malmö is not on christmas list! To be fair Zlatan said good things abt Celtic and celtic park<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WingsScotland @BBCNews the old tax cliché. High taxes with high wages better than low/low. Disposable income is what matters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL @Barcabhoy1 originally yes but I added 'getting to final'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL @Barcabhoy1 Malmö got to final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL @Barcabhoy1 zlatan has played  for 6 clubs that got to final but he never has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL @Barcabhoy1 no I have😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJMcL @Barcabhoy1 he's never won the champions league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox @chookin1 why does the pressure  of the atmosphere not overwhelm the vacuum of his head.Some dense matter perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsakSkogstad vad är det bilden visar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson same time as Sweden increases culture budget by 350M kr.No wonder Sweden has thriving music industry  https://t.co/6ndLKarVZ3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeG3223 So you talk about Celtic but they are obsessed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WiseScot didn't the majority of scotch people vote for them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abigdoob @squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball yes religion has long been used as a control mechanism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball so many things have changed, women's ,gay rights etc. This one just keeps bumbling along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball in what way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball just to be clear, schools aren't the direct source no, but they help keep it going in Scotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball yes but we can all go back in history,just a question of how far. Solve new problems not old ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball proportionally much smaller.if there we're no catholic schools wd it harm Catholicism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots it's the 'that's it's function' bit we're objecting to. That's the churches function not schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball England:fewer cath.schools fewer problems.Sweden even fewer and even fewer problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball having priority access to a place of education based on your faith? Why should that be supported?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecularScots @squirrelknutz @tommy_ball ...it's more like indoctrination into the fold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecularScots @squirrelknutz @tommy_ball only in a narrow sense. But driving force is not discrimination against others as such...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball what aspect of eng,wal are referring too? I' m in a position to contrast with Sweden as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecularScots @squirrelknutz @tommy_ball @FairAdmissions ... Was very lukewarm even in my time. At least at my school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecularScots @squirrelknutz @tommy_ball @FairAdmissions I'm agree there. It was the 'protestant' aspect of non dom schools I wondered about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squirrelknutz @SecularScots @tommy_ball Scotland really would benefit from toning down so called religious differences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecularScots @squirrelknutz @tommy_ball surely that's no longer true.Was scarcely true in my time-a long time ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommy_ball @SecularScots no they're not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommy_ball @SecularScots If you're being historical, Catholics were once rabidly anti-atheist. Catholics are not some persecuted minority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommy_ball @SecularScots what purpose to Catholic schools serve that isn't served by the Catholic Church ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did plain 'nonsense' morph into 'a nonsense'? Is 'a water' nonsense or a nonsense? #pethates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotlandTonight a completely retrograde step.Should go the other war and remove state funding from religious schools completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellacaledonia @WingsScotland @MeadeTweet @chockeyboy @ScotlandTonight yes but saying it is irrelevant is also tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltersboy_ @scotzine your support for Celtic in Europe was no doubt appreciated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Slimshady1961 @Frog_Whelk nothing wrong with abnormal loads unless your implying unsafe loads which the bridge cannot handle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Slimshady1961 yeah they shd have closed the bridge as soon as they realised extent of problem! Except that's exactly what they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily @RichardDawkins was on hand. That Bach argument nearly had me convinced.  #skavlan<|endoftext|>
