<|startoftext|>@AndreJo89945597 @Johnrashton47 Where is the wolf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How come EU president #UrsulavonderLeyen can deliver #Brexit negotiation press statements without resorting to glib slogans, cliches, and waffle? What a contrast to #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow #Johnson’s lightweight appointment as Education Minister #Wilkinson is self appointed #Covid expert on transmission in London Borough of Greenwich schools. Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesherring3 @SamCoatesSky Come on Les, you must have realised #Johnson couldn’t tell the truth if his life depended on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky Sorry, #Johnson doesn’t impress on any level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_oxford @tshep42 Because “the government” are #Brexit #Johnson’s appointees and are therefore political lightweights unable to manage their way out of a wet paper bag. They cannot deal with #Covid either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelReevesMP @tshep42 #Johnson said “f*** business” and he is making an excellent job of doing just that. Of all the promises he chooses to keep it’s that one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh great. And I bet it’ll keep on costing us over the next fifty years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SagittaVeritat1 I presume thats feigned surprise, given that we all know he’s a slob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojos55 It never existed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are we relying on ultra-lightweight #Raab to steer us out of anything even vaguely serious like security?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slightly above “get yourself a better barrel to scrape”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 Which is why #Brexit is a flawed proposition. Larger markets always do better than smaller ones in trade negotiations. Why? Because.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ljkbennett #DildoHarding’s job is secure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirRogerGale As long as it isn’t any of his cabinet that succeed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson backed #Leave as a move to become PM. He is now PM. He tells so many lies, no-one will give a **** if he scraps #Brexit entirely and we can all be better off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English From a man who is second only to #Johnson as fibber of the decade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BestForBritain Not to mention dropping our AAA credit rating. So when interest rates rise we’ll be paying more to service the colossal debt the UK now has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EUflagmafia @solange_lebourg Quelle surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think the compensation to #Windrush generation, invited here, not given papers, and their records destroyed by the state, should be much higher? #PritiPatel still bullying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Esterson #Johnson only talks in slogans and cliches. Poorly chosen usually, though I believe he thinks they are very clever. Someone with his level of education should be expected to be more eloquent, diplomatic, and coherent. But then he did go to Eton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kate_degerdon Yeah and every country in the world gets to yank our chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YvonneBurdett3 A country that can enter into agreements with other countries one day, then renege on them the next. A country who takes zero notice of other countries courts and judicial systems. A small minded country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dum_as_hek The fishing grounds are always better stocked in other countries territorial waters, or so it seems.  It was ever thus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line is we don’t eat the fish caught in our waters regardless of who caught them. The lucrative market is fresh to the EU, any sort of calamitous #Brexit stops that and at a stroke defeats the object of the whole ill thought out and flawed exercise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know the price of everything but the value of nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_stirling @RussInCheshire #Brexit is/was a bad idea and the product of small minded individuals playing to an audience with limited horizons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benevans_ATAC @RussInCheshire Most if not all #Johnson’s plans are terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think his watch stopped at 20 to 8?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cabinet office would if it could, but as there aren’t any they would have to make them up. Job for #Johnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson’s solution to most things is “write a cheque”.  #Covid write a cheque. #Brexit write a cheque. #ClimateChange write a cheque. This from the Conservatives who told us for years there isn’t a magic money tree. There isn’t, we’ll have one hell of a bill to pay any day soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 They were never going to. They don’t mind if we pay more for their cars and they’ll set up subsidiaries in the EU to make the parts we do in order to keep costs down and maintain JIT supply chains.  Reality will bite soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Angelolz87 @robcarr1964 @Chavistastic @Urban_Pictures @livelovethinkex @StandUpX2 No, because he doesn’t want irresponsible unmasked virus spreaders where-ever he lives. Seems reasonable all things considered, though he might have said “please”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBenita Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was just 37% of a limited franchise. We need to make sure any #Brexit shit, and there will be plenty, is stuck on those who started it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebDance Yeah, but its #Johnson who headed up leave and started the systematic lying, deceit, and telling of untruths. Without trust, democracy dies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rest assured we the people won’t see any payoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK Pity our new aircraft carriers are flying French jets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither does #Johnson and he fronted the Leave campaign. Mind you he was really only interested in being PM. Now he is PM he’s lost interest in #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy He should be whipped naked through the streets, tarred, and feathered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey Don’t blame your memory Ed. There has never been a more incompetent, lying, or deceitful Prime Minister as “the failure of statescraft” that is #Johnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@omair_manzoor @EmmaKennedy I was going to say, whatever tablets you’re taking perhaps you should lessen the dose. #Brexit will probably scupper the import of them anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBowie_MP What you’re saying is the SNP, a minority party in Westminster, not party to the UK government strategy, not in the negotiating team, not even in the room, have somehow holed you below the waterline? #Brexit is a flawed proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Really depends how big a donation they make to the Conservative party. I’m not saying the government are a bunch of crooks but......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryRiddell #Johnson designed the cards and dealt his hand. #Brexit is his and his alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenMangan No. Probably were deluded enough to believe their own deceits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimRobe06404293 @BickhamEdward I’d thought our EU membership was an inspired way to avoid the ignominy of post empire obscurity. We’ll soon see if I was right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No we don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its a wonder his nose doesn’t have some-ones eye out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @scarlettpeach I suspect most of our PPE is imported so no deal #Brexit will help that, not. But at least with no FoM there’ll be fewer EU nurses needing PPE, another shot in the foot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh Hmm an even more inappropriate historical comparison.  You clearly find it difficult to understand how working together the countries of the EU enrich themselves and make a brighter future for all. Apart we all lose and we’ll lose most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieKay22 Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 If only it would.  Imagine how much PPE could  be supplied to the NHS if #Johnson forswore dressing up every time he made an insincere grandstand appearance at a factory/building site/laboratory/bridge/hospital?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKdemocrat @tshep42 #Johnson has at least kept his word on one thing. He is “the failure of statesmanship” he promised he would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan I thought #Johnson’s public school bluff and bluster would bomb with the EU. He is the “failure of statesmanship” he promised he would be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imranahmadkhan I think you seem to be under the mistaken belief it’s the 19th century. Please check where reality is and reboot, preferably out of office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imranahmadkhan Excuse me? I suspect that you would be insulted if some-one trying to do a deal with you tried to circumvent the negotiating team you had appointed. Also the inflammatory language in your tweet is far far far from being diplomatic. Do you want a deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinRemains @guse_guse #Johnson is the “failure of statesmanship” he promised he would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden It’s have your cake, eat your cake, put a cake in the freezer, and buy all your neighbours cakes.  But then that’s how the empire worked and if you didn’t like it we took your cake anyway. Sadly #Johnson’s vision of being PM is 150 years out of date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey Dear Ed, “a good deal” in the #Brexit sense is an oxymoron.  The U.K. is throwing away a platinum service deal (membership) in favour of a bronze service, and looks increasingly like refusing even that because it might not like the menu in 5 years time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simon_Nixon @pmdfoster Trouble is #Merkel may have had enough of #Johnson and think no deal will hammer the message home more effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Rejoinder Shit.  If #Johnson is only just realising #Brexit is a flawed proposition that cannot deliver any of the promises made in 2016 then he truly is the “failure of statesmanship” he warned us he would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesTannock I beg to differ, that accolade surely has to go to #DominicRaab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 #Johnson is “the failure of statesmanship” he promised he would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennyflower #Johnson is so out of his depth he believes from scratch he can get a better deal. Despite the “deals” #Truss has being all slightly worse versions of EU deals those countries have. Even Australia is trying to get an EU deal.  We had the best and #Johnson tricked us out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Take back control of our money” is like resenting how your golf club spends the money you paid for your subscription and green fees, while ignoring in the EU we could influence how our subscriptions were used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because a) he has no real clue how bad the impact of no deal will be. b) he doesn’t really care, #Brexit got him into no 10 so he’s a happy bunny. and c) Crispin Odey has promised to bung #Johnson a fat wad of lucre if we no deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Statesman would agree to keep free trade with our nearest neighbours especially as the statesman says he wants all our environment and employment protections as is. He wouldn’t risk tariffs on a might be. #Johnson is not a statesman, he is “the failure of statesmanship”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andycorneys Essentially #Brexit is/was a flawed proposition that cannot deliver any of the promises made in 2016. The slogan “take back control of our borders, laws, and money” is complete tosh as we never lost control of any of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Saczak Despite being a driving force in establishing the single market #Johnson and his numpty #Brexit squad failed to do elementary research on its success.  Epic fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PranMan @ldrscke I think somehow, #Johnson and his cabal have forgotten that we are no longer at war in Europe, the empire has passed, and new used to have a reputation for fair play. No taxation without representation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another big #Brexit anti-bonus. Soon we won’t be able to afford to leave our little island what with visas, health insurance, green cards, vets bills, roaming charges, and and and....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia deal (no deal), is what you have with a country as far away from you as it is possible to get, who because of the geographical distance doesn’t do much trade with you anyway. #Johnson isn’t up to the job, but then we knew that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Puzzled why your tweet conveys surprise?  #Johnson is a liar, full stop. Gone are the days when ministers resigned over a single lie. We now have a cabinet full of incompetents, liars, and bullies. We must push back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU The British people will be 100% experiencing no deal every day.  I very much wish I could put it behind me, but suspect that will only happen when we elect a statesman into no 10 who has ambition to restore our economy, reputation, honesty and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt On no account let #Johnson deflect the blame. He led the #Leave campaign and lied the most, then and since.  He will have done more damage to the U.K. economy than Trump will have done to America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come next year if we have no deal the average person will very much understand the ramifications. It is however most important that we on no account allow #Johnson to deflect the blame. He led the #Leave campaign, he told the most lies, then and now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the Conservative party used to be “the party of business”. It is now the party of lies, deceit, untruth, dodgy dealing, barriers to trade, insularity, and a general trashing of our once respected reputation for the rule of law and fair play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reddkatt @Anna_Soubry Bully for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’ve worked out that no deal will wreck the U.K. car industry leaving foreign imports the only cars that can be bought in the U.K.  UK’s choice to #Brexit so they assume we’re happy to pay the tariffs on their motors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox As you know, #Brexit is a flawed proposition that cannot deliver any of what was promised.  It’s the modern day equivalent of alchemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go easy on #Raab .Of all the cabinet he is the one who has been promoted furthest above his level of competence. Still doesn’t excuse outright dishonesty and lying though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Editorial tweak to your last post.  In last sentence should surely be “mismanaging two”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You made the schoolboy/girl error of, if only for a moment, considering that anything #Johnson says contains an element of truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reddkatt @Anna_Soubry How’s your job going?  Is it dependent on a deal or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is the idiot on #Newsnight? The logic of #Brexit? There is none. There is no sense to #Brexit. Of course there is not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpanishDan1 @stroppypanda Go easy on @JamesCleverly he has been chosen for supporting #Brexit and for thinking #Johnson is best man to be PM. Ergo, promoted way way beyond his competence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only #TimMartin would take the hint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who looks more “in control”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson’s grasp of London as a global financial centre extends only as far having an annual nosh up at the Mansion House as Mayor of London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it’s wrong. Under no deal Erasmus stops after current academic year and whilst U.K. citizens resident abroad will continue to enjoy healthcare, visitors will not. #Gove is an arse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHARodMcKenzie @RHANews It is hardly going to solve anything. If a driver is stuck in a queue so is his lorry. If he’s in a lorry park queuing he’s not driving. Giving the driver more hours won’t alter anything other than making the roads less safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin He’s not an advert for British tailoring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExasperatedTory Far more than warranted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What exactly is #PritiPatel afraid of? Or is she just flying her true colours as a #bully who wants to shut us up, because she can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like the officer of the watch who steered into the iceberg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahchantrey It’s not his fault we don’t know what was cool at Eton forty tears ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kica333 Did you vote for #Brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says #IDS after he supported a bill to break an international treaty with the EU entered into with his support less than 12 months ago. Also the EU is trusting that we know what we are doing even though it is blatantly bonkers.  They just don’t want it to pull them down too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spoiler alert, #Brexit from start to finish has already been a devastating failure of politics, government and statecraft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy #Gove just says the first thing that comes into his head. In this case NI has huge advantage being in the Single Market, in which case why don’t we too. I suppose the loss of sovereignty doesn’t apply to NI as England stole that centuries ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wonder where they keep the disciplinary panel so they are so, so, out of touch with the modern world and common understanding of what is right and fair. I bet if a Costa Barrista tried this defence they’d be so sacked even St Peter couldn’t get their job back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life was dreadful we were in the second term of a Conservative government without the easing influence of #Clegg’s LibDems. Austerity and cuts, cuts, cuts.

<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews Odds are he’ll make a mess of that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidGHFrost @BorisJohnson @vonderleyen Is that because a) you can’t negotiate? Or b) because #Brexit is a flawed proposition? Or c) because you ate the cake rather than keep it? Or d) all of the above?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were in the same club as the French and we benefitted hugely from its rules and single market.  We were conned into leaving and have decided to stupidly leave the single market.  This is not France’s fault in any way. #Brexit is a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterSalesman In the current climate, Spanish so I could blag myself an EU passport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which explains why #Johnson is so incapable of pulling it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChalfontStGiles @michaelgove My challenge to you is to let me know when #Gove has ever told the Truth? The only exam0le I’m aware of is in 2016 when he said “#Johnson is unsuited to be PM” which has been proven to be absolutely so correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy You clearly haven’t been paying attention?  Your Cayman Islands account will stay tax free!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Johnson has already failed his statesmanship in letting this drag on as long as it has. Four long years of dither because there is no possible successful #Brexit plan. #Brexit can only fail the U.K. and it’s people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MPIainDS But Iain, in the referendum campaign we were promised that we would remain in the Single Market? I don’t see you keeping that promise.  You seem to be very selective and also blinkered to the way the modern world works.  I’m sorry to say you are a fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also requires an admission of all the lies, deceits, and untruths told in the Brexit campaign and since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it’ll only get worse after Jan 1st without a deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elrington1952 Irrelevant as we are not Australia either in size, population, location, economy, or wealth. NB Australia doesn’t have a deal with the EU.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 I think he means Turkish inventors in German lab, with US backing, made in Belgium, injected by a Filipino. I.e. truly international collaborative process. All we did was buy it. A nation of shopkeepers after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No deal would be an abject failure of statecraft but we are not all responsible. Those responsible are they who lied, dissembled and deceived during the 2016 Leave campaign, and then spent four years failing to plan for what they supposedly wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We shouldn’t be surprised that #Johnson even deceives himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s been on the cusp of failing since the 24th June 2016. #Brexit is a flawed proposition that can only deliver the complete opposite of what was promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thousand apologies, and commiserations. It won’t happen again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief, is he lying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RestoreHope_20 Never give up never surrender. I’m up for the challenge, come the revolution.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All responsible? No #Johnson, you headed up Leave, yours was the naked ambition to be PM, you told the biggest porkies, you failed to prepare, you carried on lying, you are the divisive failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood #JohnRedwood you still don’t get it that most of the fish we catch we sell into the EU, fresh, at a premium. #Brexit whacks high tariffs and border delays onto that trade and destroys it. #Brexitsucks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelenTBracken Lots. And it won’t wash with me trying to blame those who voted Leave in 2016. They were monumentally and cynically deceived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet your life the rules and regs that #Johnson wants to ditch are those most precious to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which means we have to pay an extra £7.5billion to buy exactly the same stuff as before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll soon learn we can’t afford principles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the Australians don’t think much of an Australia style deal (no deal).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Precisely what #Johnson is and has always banked on. It only succeeds because our FPTP voting system is inadequate. #Farage #Patel #Francois #Johnson #Raab #Cleverley #Sharma and many others deny their heritage.

<|startoftext|>#Davis is so out of touch only the Sun will print his thoughts. I say thoughts, but really it’s just unsubstantiated playground rankings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I very much doubt if the country will be in the mood for reconciliation after everything #Brexit has taken away, and the size of the recovery bill.  Neither is likely that we’ll get any truth from #Johnson #Gove #Cleverly #IDS #Redwood #Farage #Eustice #Raab #Patel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does #GeorgeEustice know?  “A load of additional demands” sounds a bit vague, woolly, and aggressive.  Far more like #Johnson’s style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JamesCleverly a one man #Brexit oxymoron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndrewBridgen on @BBCr4today “it’s almost as though the EU don’t trust us” says the man heading to Westminster to vote for a bill trashing the Withdrawal Agreement #Johnson agreed with the EU only a year ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmporersNewC @tshep42 #Johnson has read your tweet and has asked me to enquire what you mean by “honourable”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s all very well having all the cards when you end up rolling dice to determine whether everyone loses or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poet_yorkshire Never give up never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdocs Yep, about sums up this government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andycorneys Never give up never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My take would be #Johnson #Gove et al who campaigned so enthusiastically and dishonestly for #Brexit should have bothered to know what it was, what it meant for the economy, and the impact on jobs.  If they are seriously ducking the result they are even more contemptible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redhistorian And that one man only makes decisions based on what’s best for him personally rather than the nation as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#McCluskey must be some kind of idiot if he thinks #Johnson will be the saviour of U.K. jobs, especially those of his members.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 “Someone” would have to be extremely optimistic to think “anyone” would erect such a statue when the queue of “people” ready to topple it and throw it into the river already stretches from London to Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds and Sunderland.  The challenge will be which river?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprising. The qualities (?) required for selection into the cabinet were a) support for #Brexit and b) thinking #Johnson best man for PM. Ergo those chosen lack analytical skills and judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood All countries are self governing John. It’s just sometimes they realise that there are greater benefits from working together.  Since collaboration is a concept alien to you I don’t expect you to grasp what I am saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Reading your tweets on #Brexit I conclude you know nothing of trade, are insular, narrow minded and dense. In the 4 years since the referendum you have done nothing to improve your knowledge and made zero contribution towards realising any benefits. I conclude there are none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood I think they’ll be happy for us to pay tariffs on their exports, after all they’ll probably say it’s what you voted for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI @Redwood we had tariff free trade within the EU and beyond, a seat at the table determining the rules of the market and the court adjudicating compliance, vetos, rebates, and opt outs. #Brexit threw all that away so stop moaning. You should have looked before you leapt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It now becomes clear why #Johnson wanted to increase the defence budget. To ensure that essential goods such as medicines, fresh food, car parts, chemicals, radioactive isotopes, wine, water, dairy products etc etc can still reach the U.K. after his port clogging no EUtrade deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When politicians say “fish” most people see cod.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, #Johnson seems to be stuck on a principle that history shows we cannot afford. An inability to negotiate and compromise to your own advantage is a severe handicap for a national leader. But then Johnson isn’t a leader, he’s a puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even back then a snappy meaningless slogan beat reasoned argument. It appears we’ve been conducting our politics by tabloid headline for longer than we imagined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Esterson FYI a #Johnson promise is another #Brexit oxymoron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took our eye off the ball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU BJ: But you have to respect our sovereignty. UvdL: We do. Respect our ability to renege on agreements. What? Respect our ability to undercut, and lower standards. We can’t let you do that. And we’ll arbitrate our compliance. No deal. Thank you, I accept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how inferior #Johnson feels speaking for 60 million souls, talking to #UrsulavonderLeyen speaking for 450 million? He obviously worked out the he wouldn’t be up to the top EU job back in 2016 hence why he put so much effort into making his pond smaller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially when what #Johnson means is free to renege on any agreement or treaty, free to bend the rules, and to be the sole arbiter of our compliance. With the track record he has I don’t see there being a happy outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndrewBridgen and other Conservative MPs never bothered to learn how the EU works despite us being members for 40 years, despite us engaging at senior levels with the commission, and the Council of Ministers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis @augusta_giulia Depends how many slogans he has and how many repetitions he’s allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rejoin.  We will anyway, in time. Easier to do it quickly (tomorrow) with half a chance we can retain some of our privileges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoffwilton2 The ERG is one of the top three #Brexit oxymorons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is unadulterated failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is grossly ill-equipped for the challenges facing the country including #Brexit which he fronted in 2016. Four years fiddling whilst homes burned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The expression “do not touch it with a bargepole” springs to mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people feel the negative effects they will round on the salesmen and women. An economy crippled by #Covid and four years of #Brexit stagnation will be unable to spend its way out of the dumps. Its up to us to mend our political system and vote in some grown ups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he brings the unbalanced view to the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All international trade is founded on the rule of law and trust. #Johnson’s government and by extension the Conservative party have a track record of neither. They used to, but the last four years have seen them so comprehensively trashed as to be almost be irrecoverable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only exposure #Bone has to the real world is his meetings in the cafe at Waitrose Rushden. Even then he surrounds himself with acolytes who hang on his every word and nod constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would anyone train to be a customs officer or freight forwarder when the demand will vanish when we rejoin the SM and CU as we inevitably will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well except eventually they will when we agree to indemnify them against the cost of delay, handsomely, in €, added to the bill, paid in advance, plus VAT. Another #Brexit win for someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why won’t the EU understand that “sovereignty” means to #Johnson the right to renege on international treaties, the right to undercut, the right to exploit, and the exclusive right to determine compliance. Our government is so very much ill equipped to negotiate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate blame will lie with us voters for swallowing the relentless lies, disinformation, and absurd promises of the #Brexit campaign led by #Johnson #Gove #IDS #Fox #Grayling #Sharma #Williamson #Truss #Jenrick #Eustace etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the days that #Brexiters hark back to the world was compliant to British wishes because if you weren’t, warships bristling with guns would land an invasion force and just take what they wanted. Those days are long gone and the world has moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cut him some slack please. His usual meeting point of the cafe in Waitrose Rushden has been closed since March. Holding court on zoom won’t be the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Kim Jong Il has seen his ratings rise relative to #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elementary research on 3rd country access to the EU would quickly inform Brexiters inc #PeterBone that #Brexit will severely hamper the hauliers ability to get into Europe and our government isn’t helping. #Johnson doesn’t do research. Research is for experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doubt very much if she’s going to be won over by his unkempt hair, breezy bluster, and old Etonian chummery. She might also challenge his idea of what sovereignty really is. Stateswoman v Schoolboy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis #Johnson is not a leader. He is not collaborative. He has no honesty, honour, or integrity. It is unlikely to end well. It will however give us a challenge digging ourselves out of the hole he’s dug us into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For my money it’s #Johnson who threw his then considerable political weight behind Leave solely to elevate himself towards the position of Prime Minister. After the referendum he has been nothing but disruptive and obstructive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About the 16th January 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattprescott Deceit, arrogance, bullying in public office, and self delusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg is insisting that MPs can’t speak in a debate unless they are physically there. So put your life at risk in a global pandemic or stifle the voice of your constituents. Just which century is he in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson’s definition of sovereignty is retaining the right to renege on international agreements and to be the absolute arbiter of compliance. He doesn’t have a track record that gives anyone else any confidence that he can be trusted. It won’t end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be interesting to see if #Johnson is really prepared to cut the nations nose by not getting a deal to spite its face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An advisory referendum has no rules no spending limits no obligation to be fully inclusiv. Mandatory referenda have rules has spending limits. But our constitution doesn’t cover politicians pledging to respect advisory referenda, effectively a mandatory referendum with no rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnandi @WestNitaFBPE @EUMarauder @jonlis1 The 2016 referendum was a fraud manipulated and seized on by crooks for their own sordid ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is every point in rebuilding our country and repairing relations with the countries closest to us is top of that list. Joining the EU has a certain inevitability about it.  Even so we will be behind and below where we might have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>90 days? Is #Truss for real or just woefully out of touch with the country she is attempting to serve so poorly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is any justice it will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #Johnson talks of respecting our sovereignty, he means respect our right to piss on our neighbours, renege on agreements with them, and cut off our nose to spite our face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they lack honour, honesty, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much of a negotiator are you Sir if its taken you a year to get nowhere? Shouting hasn’t done you any favours has it? Still, can’t accuse you of overplaying your hand can we? You didn’t have any cards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson #Gove et al are not businessmen so didn’t experience the huge fillip to the economy from the Single market and customs union. You would expect them to research it, but they can’t be arsed. I say “sack the lying buggers”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is/was always a flawed proposition that can only deliver the complete opposite of what the Leave proponents promised in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An oxymoron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gcw09 @StevePeers I laughed out loud at that one. Side-splittingly hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A leader requires certain attributes, honesty, honour, integrity, and vision. #Johnson has none of these. Ergo, he is very far from being a leader of anything other than a slide to the bottom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox Change channels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In June 2016 we went to the polls and found our democratic processes and systems sadly wanting. We will soon have to rebuild them.  At that time we will require politicians of honesty, honour, and integrity at the helm, which pretty much rules out #Johnson’s Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today I’ve finally worked out what #AlokSharma means by “Independent Sovereign Nation”. #Johnson wants to agree things whilst being free to do whatever he likes. Sadly no commitment = no deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing with tax cuts is they help most those that pay most tax. Not those without jobs or those who’ve just lost their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But in reality much more if we include those who weren’t tested but whose death certificate mentioned Covid and those who died of Covid over 28 days after their test. Pretty dismal record. Truly atrocious government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s excluding those not tested but where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate and those who died of covidv ore the 28 days after their test.  The true tragedy is therefore much higher.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Won’t work. We’ve seen through this dishonest, dishonourable shower.

<|startoftext|>#Bully #PritiPatel has been remarkably quiet of late. No apology for #bullying, no contrition, no resignation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI when the “facts don’t get a look in” that’s long hand for lying. You’re probably correct to call them desperate, they’re just a few weeks away from being exposed as catastrophically incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whaaat? Why would anyone hate the GFA? Oh I forgot #Gove is an analysis free zone, someone who doesn’t listen to experts, someone without honesty, honour, integrity, or any clue whatsoever. What is ge doing in our parliament? If there was an entrance exam he’d surely fail it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven’t you twigged yet? This government is clueless, careless, and monumentally inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But very much not a better government by a long long way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden It seems to be about £12,500 to the Conservative party. Is this just more chumocracy? What happened to “we’re all in this together”? So these big knobs become superspreaders w.t.f. is this government up to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bbmorg How can we have such an ignorant man as education secretary. And he’s another cabinet member who is absolutely shameless. Not even the grace to apologise. #GavinWilliamson should go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood I’m only surprised you haven’t made more of the UK moon landing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Come the revolution, can we co-opt you into the government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course the really smart governments kept the virus at bay, and restricted its progress with actually world class track and trace systems. So obvs not the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy And he’s got the education brief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The selection process is quite rigorous. Anyone of talent is weeded out early on, or in current circumstances sacked from the parliamentary party and/of deselected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy Yet recover from them we must and we will. As part of this recovery there will be casualties of course, but Sharma, Shapps, Rees-Mogg, Truss, Hancock, Eustace, Coffey, Jenrick, Braverman, Sunak and others won’t be missed. At all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pollypreston Their PM is too idle to learn detail and has a track record for making things up. MPs are aping his style and hoping we will similarly be too idle to check and research the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrommUlrich A lazy man wanted to be PM and saw Brexit as a route to raise his profile.  He accidentally won Brexit with absolutely no clue how to implement it and no skill on how to organise it. He appointed a cabinet of yes men Brexiters. QED<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You’d think a country that was exiting the largest single market on the planet with no trade deals might want to be a little reticent about gratuitously slagging off other countries? Clearly, despite evidence to the contrary, #Brexiters still believe we hold all the cards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexistentialC @JohnShirleyLtd Bit like Nightingale hospitals, great infrastructure- not enough staff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MRSM1TH888 @EmmaKennedy As long as its the cabinet that goes without food first I can live with tightening my belt a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct Mark, a food shortage in the UK will push prices up to the point where it covers all the costs of queuing. And some.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scarlettpeach Because “our waters” is snappier as a slogan than “our doors and windows”.  We are being swayed by snappy and meaningless slogans rather than logic, or reasoned argument. #Johnson doesn’t bother with the detail, he just parrots the slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our great national sadness is we’ve fallen for snappy meaningless slogans instead of doing the hard work to understand historical and economic realities. Our politicians are a reflection of this #Farage #Gove #Johnson #Patel #Raab #Eustace et al<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Nigel, the ECHR is naff all to do with the EU. It’s something the U.K. championed at the end of WW2. You probably know this but true to form you choose to ignore history when it suits your warped sense of current affairs. #Brexitsucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember #Johnson is the child who dreamt of being world King. Kings rule by whim and fancy without check or balance.  Tough for him that being In charge isn’t going to plan, tougher still that the U.K. has executed the odd monarch or two who fell out of favour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crikey @johnredwood are you going rogue?  On the same theme, can you give one single advantage from #Brexit (a government fixation) as it looks like being an unmitigated disaster with industry sector after industry sector being put to the sword?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatharineHoey Dear Kate, we don’t eat the fish we catch. We sell it fresh to EU at top prices.  With no deal the fish won’t get to the market fresh so will have to be sold for less frozen. But add the high tariffs and even that market dries up. #Brexit is pointless .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU Just a small point neither were facts. A fact is an indisputable fact, as in there are 36 inches in one yard. The £350m to the EU and subsequently to the NHS were both untruths, or in common parlance lies, put nicely deceits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeftieCat By a country mile. All the rest have cared about the prosperity of the citizens and behaved with honesty, honour, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight I wish #Johnson wouldn’t  “dress up” every time he goes to visit a factory or front line setting. He always looks and acts like he doesn’t care and its a big joke.  I suppose as he is “a big joke” its alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimEdwardsZero4 Financially ruined does it for me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If #MichaelCaine pontificated about the film industry, I might listen attentively.  However the views of someone so disconnected with the British economy, finance, manufacturing, welfare, health, agriculture and so forth, are of no interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s been recalled for installation of a software upgrade.  The paperwork went astray initially but the delay now is because he refuses to have a CE approved modification. They may have to remove his compliance chip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not bothering with the UK medicines agency then? So are we really taking back control by duplicating regulatory control or becoming a vassal state surrendering our sovereignty by accepting some-one else’s approval!  We should be told exactly how pointless and damaging #Brexit is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The so called “party of business” is crippling our #FinanceSector by not negotiating EU equivalence; hampering #manufacturing with tariffs and border checks; killing #farming by cutting off the labour supply; stifling #chemicals with differential standards. #Brexitsucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth are they doing? Dismembering Finance by not getting equivalence rules, destroying manufacturing by introducing tariffs and bureaucracy, killing farming by cutting off the labour supply? I just do not understand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote against it #Starmer there will be no votes in it for you. Get off the fence and be in favour of close cooperation and trade with our nearest neighbours. #Brexit is a flawed proposition, a lie, a fraud, a gross deceit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy Snappy meaningless slogans rule the airwaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like some-one being pushed from pillar to post by events outside his control, and by an event (#Brexit) he staked his reputation on but now realises isn’t going to end well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes breaking from EU is taking back control (downwards) and stopping Scottish independence is keeping control (upwards).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #PritiPatel still a #bully? We should not let our short attention span deflect us from holding her and #Johnson to account for supporting a practice that is roundly condemned in any other work setting, like ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Dear John, whilst building the Nightingale hospitals was brilliant, there is sadly a finite number of NHS staff who can’t be in two places at once. Of course if #Brexit hadn’t cut off the supply of EU nurses and made immigration harder we might have been OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical #Johnson, appoint  https://t.co/UgJ04ciy4Z because they a) support #Brexit b) worship #Johnson and c) have zero track record or skill relating to the task in hand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Brexit has served #Johnson well.  He got to be PM.  May not be PM in the way he dreamt of it or for as long as he may have wished but he still did it. By hanging his hat on a whole load of meaningless snappy slogans, pity they wrecked the country but so it goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was all in favour of harsh tier allocation until I heard #Gove supported it. As he has never been known to tell the truth (except when he declared #Johnson unfit to be PM back in 2016) I now think tiers suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyALee @JolyonMaugham Meaningless snappy slogans are all we’re getting from #Johnson and his cabinet of cronies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if they didn’t see that coming......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“A #Johnson manifesto commitment” the latest in a long year of oxymorons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any manifesto commitment from #Johnson isn’t because he is an inveterate liar, and cannot be trusted.  His track record is testament to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK behaviour towards people it had invited here to help us has been treacherous in the extreme. Especially after 100’s of years exploitation through slavery, and domination through empire. To top it all we’re cutting the overseas aid budget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK @DeborahMeaden There is no real experience of the real world there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assumes a) NI border issues miraculously vanish, which they won’t b) EU trade continues as before, it won’t c) there isn’t a third disaster in the next five years, I wouldn’t bet against it. And d) this government doesn’t fall over of its own making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @BorisJohnson Because #Johnson can’t connect the dots and has a poor grasp of international co-operation. I suspect his education majored on the rights of the elite rather than the ethic of hard work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Prime Minister fails to appreciate that he sets the tone for the country. His line is a) dishonesty is OK b) bullying is OK c) rules and guidance can be ignored d) lying is OK e) the law can be ignored. I don’t recognise my country any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gone are the days when politicians had honour and integrity and when found in breach of the #MinisterialCode would resign. If #Johnson and #Patel were batsmen in a game of cricket they would never be out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The right saw the 2008 Financial crisis was insufficient to break the UK public sector. #Brexit, #Covid and #Johnson combined wreck the economy so badly that the post war social contract will be at risk.

<|startoftext|>Actually was the only honest thing he said during PMQ.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Johnson is unable to learn any lessons at all, his ego forbids him acknowledging mistakes. Hence why #Brexit will be worse than forecast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson chose economy wrecking #Brexit as his route to be PM because the snappy meaningless slogans where easier to learn than the complex and compelling arguments to remain. We are now paying for that ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson lacks any insight as to how #bullying in the workplace is viewed in the country.  This is because a) #Johnson’s school Eton specialises in ritualised #bullying b) #Johnson’s experience of a workplace is limited and c) he has zero insight on anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that #Brexit supporters should pay for this by subscription. I want no part of the Festival of narrow-minded, little island, dishonesty, and untrustworthiness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matthew82069336 @BorisJohnson #Johnson sticks by #bully #PritiPatel because having read his #MinisterialCode if he sacked her he’d have to sack the rest of the cabinet too, including himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie You do know #Johnson and his gang, sorry cabinet, are untrustworthy liars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie It’s a double cut. GDP set to fall 10% so #InternationalAid based on 0.7% GDP would also fall. Equivalent to .63% of pre-Covid  GDP. #Sunak is cutting still further to 0.5% which is equivalent to 0.45% of preCovid GDP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It isn’t. This government doesn’t do smart. If it did we wouldn’t be doing #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson keeps bleating on about #Brexit enabling us to become an international player again (we never stopped in fact). However when it comes to #foreignaid all we ever hear is he wants to cut ours to be the same as other countries. Baaa baaa baaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know why government ministers are worried about the size of our #foreignaid budget?  When #Brexit knocks 6% off our GDP the amount of our foreign aid will also go down. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s nearly 6pm on Monday 23rd November 2020.  The question of the day is..... Is #PritiPatel still a #bully ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A civilised nation does not take its citizens lives, end of. The justice system is not infallible and we can’t resurrect the dead.  #PritiPatel is not civilised, she’s a #bully.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In poor taste, but then #bullying is which is why society has been set on rooting it out. #Johnson and #PritiPatel are throwbacks. And boy don’t we wish we could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’re not. Some of us know what is being casually discarded and how hard won it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t. #Brexit is/was a flawed proposition that can only deliver the complete opposite of everything its proponents promised in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By having a political system that favours liars, deceivers and the tellers of untruths, and a voting population who through poor guidance and a propagandist media are ill equipped to deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweets about #bully #PritiPatel are thinning out. This Tweeter will keep going because on our behalf there was an independent inquiry that judged her guilty of breaking the #MinisterialCode therefore she must resign or be sacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes where is it? Is it with the #RussiaReport we haven’t seen yet? Or the #PritiPatel bullying report you’ve ignored?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both together “Will you do everything I say?” “Yes I will”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is a flawed proposition that delivers the exact opposite of what was promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During which time this government has appointed three chums to high paid public positions and gifted five multimillion £ contracts to start-ups of Conservative Party donors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will be officially known as “The Snout in the Trough” Parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically #Jenrick is supporting #Johnson supporting #PritiPatel because if she goes for breaking the #MinisterialCode he’ll have to go too for his corrupt planning intervention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryNL @acgrayling #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’ll drop even lower after 1st January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annietrev your performance on @BBCr4today defending @PritiPatel was pitiable.. Trying to spin #bullying as determined by an independent inquiry as “robustness” beggars belief and calls into question your own position in this countries legislature. Perhaps you should also resign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not. Maybe they’ve decided to ditch any pretence at standards in preparation for playing in the lower leagues post #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bully telling all those who grassed her up to the inquiry that she has powerful friends and she will make their life hell in revenge. Removes any doubt #PritiPatel is a #bully and #Johnson is incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t been bullied by #PriitiPatel doesn’t mean she doesn’t #bully others. Allegedly she works hard, doesn’t mean she isn’t a bully. May not be intentional but bullying is bullying and if she can’t tell she’s doing it she needs moving on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In short #Johnson is not up to the job either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladbrokes are offering 5/2 #PritiPatel will be gone by Thursday. I just hope she doesn’t feel bullied out of office?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to think more carefully before condoning #bullying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In supporting them all #Johnson too has broken his own #MinisterialCode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claireepsom @MPIainDS @pritipatel Insert after promoted and before beyond the words “way, way, way”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Johnson sacked everyone in his cabinet who broke the #Ministerialcode he’d have to sack the lot including himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real reason #Johnson hasn’t summararily sacked #PritiPatel is that reading the #MinisterialCode he’d have to sack his entire cabinet including himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says a lot that she was promoted to one of the major positions of state when she has such a reputation. Reflects badly (again) on #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If she “needed telling” then yet further evidence that #PritiPatel is way, way, way out of her depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexverycalm @MPIainDS @pritipatel To be fair in my experience I worked harder and went the extra mile for inspiring and motivational leaders. Aside from the appaling policies of this government #PritiPatel does not inspire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would your employer condone bullying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all your years you still haven’t learnt that you don’t get the best results by shouting at people and bullying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen John, its not a good look to display all over social media your jealousy and resentment at never getting to be PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MinisterialCode should be revised to tar with the same brush all those who effusively support ministers found to have contravened it. #Johnsonfirst<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In sticking by bully #PritiPatel #Johnson demonstrates he hasn’t learnt the lesson from #May s time in No10. There is an inexhaustible supplier of MPs wanting ministerial positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the foreword was written by twice sacked ex journalist #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Big_Headers More disappointed that people who made false promises in 2016 on the back of lies, deceits, and untruths haven’t the honesty, honour, and integrity to admit #Brexit is a flawed proposition and they’ve sat on their arses for the last 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m puzzled by the MPs springing to defend #PritiPatel on @BBCr4today excusing her bullying on “getting results”? Windrush, snails pace. Immigration, where is the new seasonal worker plan? Grenfell, way behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK lets get this straight.  The chap who investigated #PritiPatel for bullying and found she’d broken the #MinisterialCode was bullied by #Johnson to change his report and was then over-ruled when he didn’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoMontague91 Because if look at the ministerial code, sack #Patel and #Johnson would have to sack his entire cabinet. Including himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennyflower On a sincerity scale of 1 to 10, about 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It never works to grandstand supporting a lame duck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, more police because your previous administration stupidly cut them. Immigration, she can’t sort out Windrush compensation which should be a slam dunk. She should resign. #endofPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markjohnstonld #Johnson weak because he doesn’t do detail or put in the hard work necessary to be on top of the brief. You don’t earn respect by being outflanked by #EdMilliband<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He could distance himself from this corrupt administration by resigning his position?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That minister (unnamed) needs to realise that bus has gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieCatLady Toughest request received today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha. Empty words, another case of #Johnson thinking if he says what we want to hear we won’t notice him doing the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A one man living, breathing, oxymoron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its about time we all pulled together to get #Johnson out don’t you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sime0nStylites Speeding? Adultery? Shoplifting? Arson? Tax evasion? Espionage? Treason?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always. As #IsaacAsimov wrote “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For goodness sake @bbclaurak if they all followed the code every man jack of them #Johnson included would have to go. We’d be rudderless! No difference there then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Either fine with me, but obvs not as good s also contributing at the top table. Mind you not that #Johnson s cabinet knows how to contribute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Cleverly a one man oxymoron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unintentional? Limited? Specific? Mark my words, they’re probably working up a whitewash they can publish at 5am on 1st Jan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes well, on the basis of that foreword the whole cabinet should be resigning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardJMurphy Oh catch up. Only by terminally ruining the economy will #Johnson et al be able to deconstruct the post-war social settlement and the NHS, returning us all to the 1930s if not earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesserspottedH Yeah well we won’t, but on the other hand there’ll be an uptick in smuggling, trafficking and thefts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LennieMerrick1 I’m not, but I am sorry that the bully so lacks honour and integrity that she hadn’t resigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wesstreeting @guse_guse And in a strictly limited way presumably?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @LeShuttle Oh come now Deborah, don’t you remember when pets had to be quarantined for 6 months on return to U.K. and caged during transit? #Johnson s #Brexit returns us to the past. Good news for kennels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest news from #Westminster #PMQs to be renamed PMEs Prime Ministers Evasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One remembers fondly the age when politicians acted with honesty, honour, and integrity.  How refreshing it would be if those times returned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t get fired for committing a crime unintentionally, that only breaks the law in a technical and strictly limited manner.  You should know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We add to the list of excuses (breaking the law in a technical and limited way) with “unintentional”. What you get with a government lacking honesty, honour, and integrity. @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possible #Johnson responses to #Patel bullying. a) Priti said she’d deport me if I sacked her. b) if I sacked Priti for being incompetent, I’d have to sack all the others too. c) I have a world beating cabinet phwah phwah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem then is we’d have a president and to be honest our record isn’t very good #Hume #Wilson #Heath #Callaghan #Thatcher #Major #Blair #Brown #Cameron #May #Johnson long live the Queen/King<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 And for the hundredth time #Brexit probably keeps your funds in tax havens out of the tax mans grasp!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Eustace is clearly an “expert” on all things agricultural. So do a #Gove  Is what you get with liars, deceivers and disemblers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C’mon #Johnson surprise us. Show a glimpse of statesmanship.  I know its a stretch for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark my words the Conservative party is being scarred every day this drags on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in high rise buildings with flammable cladding need to remember a) #Jenrick doesn’t really care b) #Johnson announces big but insufficient funding hoping you win’t notice c) statistics on progress aim to flatter the government rather than be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s all the fuss about #Johnson ‘s £16billion defence spending? There must be loads of new start ups with links to Conservative party donors and no trading history who can get stuck into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just underscores how out of touch #ReesMogg is. The #Windrush generation are fighting the Home Office for their freedom to remain in the country that invited them to stay then shredded the evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the response you get from a government of extreme mediocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is so mediocre he can’t out argue #EdMilliband<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson wants to be the PM he always imagined all those years ago. He doesn’t have the fleet of thought to catch up with where we are so is dragging the country back to his past. #Brexit is all part of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, #Johnson ‘s idea of being PM is glad handing foreign leaders, and imposing on other countries with a battleship. He is 150 years too late.  We need someone slightly brighter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyJayne101 If he was honest and showed both honour and integrity I could live with it. However the perpetual lies, and failure to answer any questions with a straight answer is just debilitating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd To be fair, when the economy crashes next year under the weight of #Brexit and debt, our foreign aid at 0.7% of GDP will crash too. Military spending will be unaffordable, anyway who really wants to live off selling arms to other countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear @RishiSunak just by adding “record” and “world leader” in front of things just sounds very “playground” and looks like you’re aping #Johnson rather than being a grown-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not so much how small a component of our economy fishing is but how incredibly significant the EU market is to the prosperity of U.K. fishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the qualities you look for in a cabinet minister are a) supports #Brexit, and b) supports #Johnson as best PM. Then don’t be surprised if you get people (#Truss) with no judgement and rubbish analytical skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson “end the era of retreat”? You really are almost as out of touch with where this planet is as #ReesMogg  #Brexit is the biggest retreat from reality as any government has imposed on its people, and you sir will carry the can for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU Snappy meaningless slogans 1: Reasoned arguments 0. #Johnson couldn’t be arsed so picked the easier brief to learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennyfurfuls No, our planet just two hundred years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Eustace is err #Useless he was picked by incompetent #Johnson for being pro Brexit and obvs thinks Johnson best man to be PM. Ergo, devoid of analytical skills and spectacularly poor judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbin always voted against the whip anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have thought recommendation by a Conservative associated with this government would have been de facto grounds for eliminating a company from consideration for a PPE contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHeadViews Yes fossil sums him up nicely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In context the £4billion #greeninvestment compares to £18billion for Crossrail, a projected £80billion for HS2, and alleged £12billion for Test, Track and Trace. So pretty much small potatoes. Let’s hope it has more success than the above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands #Johnson couldn’t lead his way out of a wet paper bag. A man who craved being PM but who is so woefully unfit for the task.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 That’s an easy one. This Government has no F***ing idea what Brexit requires despite having had 4 years to make something up, and having campaigned for it.  ( to be fair they campaigned for something completely different to what we’re likely to get)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harriepw No but it seems most Labour voters do, bit like Lib Dem voters who after a taste of power knifed their MPs in the back by voting Conservative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBowie_MP Nah not really. It’s you and your Brexit pals that are doing the “ripping apart”. If Scotland goes solo and rejoins the EU I’ll move to Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ReesMogg is just out of touch with the common man and pleased that he is. The common man will have to cope with price rises and job losses from Brexit whilst Jacob continues to not pay U.K. tax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst thing is the arrogance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, #Johnson about to learn that everyone else isn’t going to bow down and worship him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD this government is attrocious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 They didn’t use to be, however this lot are absolutely bereft of honesty, honour, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Draw your own conclusions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is their deceit will be rumbled come January and they’ll have nowhere to hide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson unsuited to the role he had craved all his life because he failed to spot it required honesty, honour, integrity, hard work, discretion and attention to detail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Requires a statesman of honesty, honour, and integrity to pull that off. Oh, that’s where it all falls down of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like Brexit it will deliver the complete opposite of what it promises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennyfurfuls Only a product of his upbringing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susiesioux1 @jude5456 It’s the shameless deceit I can’t stand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Alok, you do know the U.K. population is less than 70million?  Presume you’re assuming because of the short shelf life and your government doing the roll-out most of that 350million will be wasted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crikey, Lord Frost really is a sharp one. Predicting that the trading partner ten times the size of the U.K. would have the advantage in negotiations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Going back to”? They never left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obvious typo, should have read “Heartless Conservatives”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One can only conclude that many Brexiters are so ridiculously myopic that they didn’t see the danger of the cliff edge until they were six weeks away from dropping off it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Very wrong to leave. Like leaving a really good party because you didn’t like a record one of the other party goers asked to be played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyJSisk Disagree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieCatLady Yes, their history education doesn’t equip their students for the modern world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They did, back in the day when Britain had an empire won by superior Naval and military strength at the point of a sword. That’s the PM #Johnson imagined he’d be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps what we ought to do is follow Australias lead and join our local pan national single market?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonypatt2000 I hope you’re not implying they are excelling as cabinet ministers? Difficult to know what profession requires untruth and lying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only one of them is lying! Shock horror!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is only doing it in a blokey half hearted sort of way to avoid the brick-bats he got over #Cummings crass trip to Durham during the first lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Brexiter think-tank? This may be the oxymoron of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU To be fair Cameron and May were both tarred with the same brush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Of course, its social politeness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magnus919 Slightly old chap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 The Captain picked this complete rabble, and courtesy our broken FPtP voting system, we picked the Captain. But only 37% of us chose the course after being sold a crock of shit as a pot of gold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy #Brexit the flawed proposition that now looks certain to deliver exactly the opposite of every promise its proponents made in 2016. But those with money in tax havens will skip paying any tax of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry #Johnson sending the wrong message  “I’m fit and healthy and am only isolating because I got loads of flack when #Cummings got caught going to Durham.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @livelovethinkex That happened in 2016. Covid is a killer largely because those in power now are incompetent arseholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet #Moderna are now wishing they’d donated £12k to the Conservative Party. #sellingvaccines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gone are the days when a minister telling a lie was a) newsworthy and b) resulted in him clearing his desk.  Now it’s more than commonplace, the lies are bigger, and the perpetrators are completely shameless. I long for yesteryear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can’t #Johnson be this measured and reserved rather than everything being “fantastic” and “world beating” when it isn’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckettUnite @Mickster_1 Dunno, complicated.  Check where your pension fund is invested; lobby your MP to rejoin EU; lobby Johnson not to throw NHS to the wolves when tax income shrinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOVUK Indeed are you ready @govuk ? You told us in 2016 there was no way we’d leave single market and customs union. Everything you’ve promised has been untrue. You should #Resign and #RejoinEU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevillefarmer @Peston @guse_guse There’s an element of surprise in the original tweet. After 4 years of #Johnson our experience is that he is lying, deceiving or peddling untruths whenever he opens his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @guse_guse You were “lied to”.  When will reporters and journalists finally click that this Conservative government will say anything that makes them look good at the time regardless of veracity. Truth is alien to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that #TonyAbbott has been shipped over here to help us #Brexit from the EU single market whilst back home in Australia they’ve joined the humongous Asia-Pacific single market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear “The UK said it was committed to engage in good faith” I presume that reneging on a treaty entered into in January and tabling a bill that breaks International Law won’t help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we’d stop seeing amazingly ignorant tweets from him about #Brexit I’m puzzled how anyone can consider him a useful asset in parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickStevenson63 Yes, I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question is, will a U.K. rejoin of the EU be signalled before these industries are damaged beyond repair?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneRackham2 @jude5456 To be fair #Marr probably knows less than #Eustace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToddDavidForem1 @jude5456 Didn’t spot any smidgen of truth whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You clearly are not thinking big enough in the “these idiots are fools” department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His family obvs wanted shot of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is none of these politicians have any experience of manufacturing, supply chains, logistics, tariffs, regulatory regimes. They all talk out of their arses. #brexit will hurt jobs, salaries, working conditions and the economy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jennyflower #DominicCummings, #BorisJohnson, #MichaelGove, #JacobReesMogg, #IDS, #PrittiPatel, #GavinWilliamson, #RobertJenrick #DominicRaab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icgardens Yes but they are unable to tell me why other that parrot the slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BBCr4today #Johnson isolating is not a “setback” and will not “hamper” his work. It is just normal for most of us who just get on with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear @johnredwood , so your judgement is severely impaired too? Maybe time to step off the gravy train and retire don’t you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while you’re at it, why @johnredwood did you recommend to your clients they move their money out of the U.K. before Brexit? Is that because you voted for something that will damage our economy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical of this country. Build something good. Underfund it. Knock it down and sell off the bits for peanuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood John, you come across as one of those people who go to Spain, expect everyone there to speak English, go to an English themed pub serving burger and chips, and generally act like a yob. Most of the EU rules were ours originally so what are you moaning about. You’re a little man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardly surprising given #Johnson ‘s success with bridge projects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gross IQ of the demonstrators is just into double figures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy @LBC Proved what everyone thought.  He lives underground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KickBrainTumors Yes of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFoxLD Seen it in the U.K. with black bin bags and an attendant security guard.  Lehman Brothers employees used boxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me that thinks, when #Johnson gushes about “the green agenda”, that its another project he doesn’t understand, doesn’t care about really, but says the slogans in the hope it’ll do him some good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is not up to the challenge and has been found wanting. Very wanting. Best all round if #Brexit is scrapped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time is running out for this government who’ve had four and a half years to think up a Brexit deal, but haven’t. #Johnson can save everybody by revoking A50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#johnson doesn’t have a difficult decision. All he needs to do is commit to remain in the EU single market and customs union or better revoke A50. This will provide an enormous boost to the UK economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove has stabbed #Johnson in the back before. He’s got form. He’s also completely useless, and you can see the strings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieCatLady Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love the NHS says @MattHancock just not quite enough to give them the same pay rise that me and my mates gave ourselves. #dipstick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Dear John, the single market and customs union are two of the greatest elements of the EU and Thatcher was 100% behind them because she knew what was good for the U.K.  but then she was a chemist and you’re an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheryllynmartin No I don’t either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbtoast A train set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWest_JAWS @guse_guse Because #Gove was unavailable?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seductive slogans 1: reasoned arguments 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenTBracken Because he’s a builder not a destroyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Follow the money. The fish we catch is sold next day fresh in the EU for top whack. No deal means it will have tariffs and border checks meaning its dead and costly. Your choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very rubbish proposition. But #Johnson #Gove #Patel #Raab #Williamson et al have never made anything other than a mess so have zero understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Stafford You clearly have a poor grasp of economics, trade, contemporary international politics, and democracy. I guess you’ll be dipping into your own savings to compensate your constituents who lose their job thru #Brexit ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grazers72 @sturdyAlex If you are “Prime Minister” you can’t dodge responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieCatLady Don’t limit your aspiration to just #MichaelGove leaving parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not give nurses the same sort of pay rise that MPs voted for themselves then? Fine words butter no parsnips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would anyone think anything #Cummings says is the truth when he’s only ever spun a pack of lies so far?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What intrigues me is whether he actually believes the complete twaddle he spouts? Seriously, how could anyone deliver that speech with a straight face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He suddenly realised that none of his relatives had won any PPE contracts at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course what did anyone expect? If you choose the slow lane, you fall behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the cabinet is full of #Brexit supporters who think #Johnson best man to be PM. Ergo they have poor analytical skills and even worse judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy Apparently already gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dom didn’t have a plan.  Just a grubby little anarchist kicking everything over for greater intellects than his to rebuild.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rats leaving a sinking ship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’ll be another pro #Brexit pro #Johnson placeman. Ergo weak analytical skills and poor judgement. Wow what a cabinet of incompetents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read somewhere about removing the mote from your own eye before complaining about the splinter is your opponents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno why we listen to #Gove. He was #Johnson’s campaign manager but knifed him in the back in 2016 because Johnson unfit to be PM. Then he joins his cabinet. Liar and incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like usury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, let’s join!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #Gove is a deluded lying political lightweight with the analytical prowess of a slug and judgement of a paperweight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes please, it is disgraceful behaviour, and with our money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan clearly a) arrogant b) glib c) uncaring d) another demonstration that many of our MPs are ill suited to the positions they hold. Why do we vote for such incompetents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about trade? Didn’t you talk about that? And how about the GFA? Did that crop up at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson nightmare. He can’t wing this gig, he has to read the briefings but probably can’t be arsed.  It’s not turning out at all how he expected, #Brexit will be shit but he hasn’t the balls to back out and #Covid is a killer that won’t go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson struggling to take his party with him, into international opprobrium, away from the top tables, and into obscurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood John, why does your prime minister agree a treaty, champion it, call it the best ever, and sign it, all without reading it? It just makes you all look like deceitful, incompetent liars.  But then that’s what you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson despite his elite education has learnt nothing from British history. He couldn’t build a bridge if his life depended on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A man of honour and integrity would resign. Not knowing #KarmalaHariss ‘s name is not an excuse but an admission of your idleness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By “they” I presume you mean our inept government led by wholly unsuitable to be PM #Johnson and his cabinet of incompetents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Archive footage of #MarkFrancois is all you’ll see of him these days. Pity he doesn’t resign and let someone with integrity take his place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trailer on Channel 5 “how Britain won WW2”? Working with allies from around the world especially the USA to liberate our European allies from the grip of fascism. And now we’re the ones tearing up treaties and breaking international law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoguerrera Despite #Johnson ‘s elite education, he has failed to learn any of the lessons from our history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoguerrera A good constituency MP. An honest man with integrity. Toppled by backbenchers in his own party lacking both those attributes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Redwood and #DuncanSmith two towers of self delusion rooted in a history neither of them understand and a future neither of them is equipped to achieve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews #Johnson we’ve already made the biggest mistake. We voted you in as PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not keen on such blunt language, but you have to admit this government is chock full of incompetents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfit to govern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No insight have you #Johnson exactly none at all, zilch, zero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it bl**** isn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson in his first language and Eton education bumbles and faffs garbling any message, whereas #UrsulavonderLeyen in her second language is clear, concise, and compelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And not doing that very well either. His swing is absolutely terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring it on. The Eton boy and the ERG need a history refresher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Johnson can’t work out that trashing a treaty you agreed, signed, championed and flaunted less than a year later makes you look incompetent, then he isn’t fit for the job. Which he isn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson in his native tongue and with his first rate education (?) is as garbled as mud whereas #UrsulavonderLeyen in her second language is clear, concise, and compelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can be as high tech as you like but the enforcement will be by a law officer with a badge, a marked car and a hut with a sign on it where he has his/her lunch break. aka “a border”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU #JohnRedwood demonstrates with every tweet how unsuitable he is to be in the British Parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattChorley @mikegalsworthy @TimesRadio So did my cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, #Ursula can deliver a coherent, direct speech in her second language, whereas #Johnson can only ramble incoherently in his native tongue despite elite (supposed) education. We can do better surely? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whaaaaaaat!!! #LizTruss lying, decieving, dissembling over trade deals? Come on how are you surprised? Incompetent #Johnson appointed a cabinet of Brexiteers who think he’s the best man to be PM. It self selected inadequacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Pity the clip finished before the clown pushed the 8 foot custard pie in his face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Dear @JohnRedwood have you ever studied history? I only ask because you singularly seem to have not understood or appreciated any of its lessons. If you don’t want to be part of the future, have the decency to retire gracefully. Soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironic to think that Boris the bridge dreamer, has become Boris the bridge demolisher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Statesman. Even George W Bush can work it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 And so has #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan No, we don’t lie, deceive, and disemble. We work hard and pay our taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @DominicRaab Completely unfair of #Marr to ask #Raab tricky questions like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham But doesn’t idiot #Johnson believe in “taking back control”. He’s about to realise how futile that is in reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Note to Biden, count the spoons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Johnson speaks just like Trump only with longer words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 #Johnson ‘s lying, dishonesty and lack of integrity will be what really weakens the bond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer Sounds like you’ve already sold it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer Keep taking the tablets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler Always supposing he doesn’t welch on the promise later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor @A50Challenge #Raab is particularly ill equipped for his role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MimiJ9 @stroppypanda Hopefully the conundrum will send him insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradburyMaureen Ken Clarke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Probably referring to Farage who bet and lost on a Trump victory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU #Raab is not a statesman. He thinks #Brexit is a good idea, and #Johnson best person to be PM. Ergo his analytical skills are severely limited and his judgement impaired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Hurrah! Progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 @Conservatives They needed to be staggeringly incompetent to make it into the #Johnson cabinet to start with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer Do you not think that if there really was that much money sloshing around they would have bought your vote for a few dollars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor So you didn’t buy in to the “God. Guns. Lives” pitch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer Were there 4million zombies? Thought not. Embrace defeat, it’ll be character building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy @JoeBiden @NicolaSturgeon @Keir_Starmer @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson Cummings hasn’t written it for him yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SagittaVeritat1 If Farage said it, its probably utter bollocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardHesketh1 A few cheap paperbacks. With large print and short words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A50Challenge I hope #Brexit is a dead project soon to be revoked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Hurrah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guse_guse #Johnson ‘s underwhelming congratulatory tweet. As in most things he can’t be bothered to put in hard work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer John, your postman is opening your mail in collusion with your dustman who’s going through your rubbish. They’re both reporting to the taxman and security services.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnlewismealer @kirstiealley @livelovethinkex “Count fraud” what is that when it’s at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 @Mickster_1 If you think Johnson is a) handling Covid pandemic in the best way possible; b) has been honest with us over Brexit, c) has appointed the best into his cabinet? Then I’ve no idea where you’ve been since 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @livelovethinkex Highest ever turn out. Covid pandemic raised mailed out ballots. Democrats more worried by Covid and used mailed out option more. States started counting mailed outs late. Want to make sure they get it right first time. Patience my friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDG1122 I remember the time when fraudsters like her would resign when found out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatewaypundit @briseida35 My cat wrote that software and is now contacting lawyers to bring a legal action against you for libel. Obvs will have to wait til the courts are free of the pointless Trump fraud actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Spoiler alert 253 is the new name of Farage #Brexit party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @guse_guse @LBC God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform. Goodbye Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump I believe the #Biden vote was boosted by running against a deceitful, lying, dishonest, tax evading, orange coated, small minded, divisive, Covid spreading, disaster of a sitting president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danbloom1 @SloughForEU But not surprising. Only 37% of a limited franchise voted for Johnson’s signature catastrophe, #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @SloughForEU They were, there is nothing right about Brexit other than the safety of money in tax havens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands Not difficult. My cat cares more for the people of this country than #Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Will the conspiracy to murder charge be made to stick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 I’d be happier if he built his folly with his own money and then sank into obscurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahchantrey @JMPSimor Fingers in ears ladidadidadida not listening not listening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Minnows amongst steamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU Looking like some-one with more money than sense.  But we knew he has no sense, scruples, honesty, honour, or integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Don’t worry, the fat lady is warming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonFraser00 @13sarahmurphy Lets face it, #Johnson ‘s government isn’t a compatible partner for our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 @A50Challenge #Johnson pretty toxic in UK for being an idle, lying, dishonest, uncaring, rudderless buffoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Well he lied to win in 2016 so nothing new there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahchantrey Probably just one of the many criminally insane propositions he’s espoused. Should be locked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlucky. Better luck next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Sadly he can’t think of a snappy-meaningless slogan to cover his inadequacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 Why doesn’t #Johnson just build a Folly on a hill with his own money like rich nobs used to do before disappearing into the obscurity of bankruptcy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajmpolite What they mean is, Trump doesn’t think before opening his mouth and saying absolute bollocks, and that’s what they like about him.  He talks like they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy What the f use is a tunnel between Scotland and NI? Other than to sink £200billion we haven’t got, into a hole in the ground built by migrant labour, that’ll be little if any use?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahchantrey Misread that as “disembowelled” thought that was a bit harsh, if deserved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elrington1952 @SagittaVeritat1 Harding can’t be traced eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Hopefully not here. Scotland must be bricking it he doesn’t move back to his roots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson @DominicRaab You do know #Raab is in lockdown boning up on where America is, and #Johnson is weeping into his beer that his role model has had his comeuppance and trying to think up a pithy meaningless quip to cover it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lordbonkers Anyone who listens to #Johnson grandstanding or dodging answering PMQs knows that he can’t give an informed, measured, complete, honest answer to anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmakze @livelovethinkex It’s finished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor And your comment on #Johnson as a comparison would be....?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 #Trump isn’t worth the time it took to tweet this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trouble is that if your PM is a serial and habitual liar, after a very short while no-one believes a word he says and he effectively loses any remnant of control. All he has left are stale meaningless slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU There are some spectacularly unprincipled people in high level jobs. Last time I buy anything from Next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KSchafheutle @acgrayling Three words is the most that Johnson can repeat without making something up or going a million miles off script.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theanondavid Have you only just realised that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNAH4PV @dem_cath @ShaileshVara @ShaileshVara supported Remain and Cameron; then #Gove and Brexit; then #May and Brexit; now Johnson and Brexit, despite as you point out, stewarding the GFA as junior minister for NI. Has no ideas of his own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_gosden Doesn’t need to have been on the lash or to have long Covid to be in “barely functioning mode”. If it doesn’t have a meaningless slogan or quip to parrot he’s like a beached whale, only less use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem_cath @SNAH4PV Trouble is #Johnson can’t be arsed to get an understanding of the issues around NI and doesn’t comprehend how sweet the GFA was in defusing the tinderbox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands The third word has a surplus “o” in it doesn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan I’d hate him to turn up here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is/was a flawed proposition won by lies upon deceits upon untruths. Snappy slogans of opportunists beat reasoned arguments of statesmen. We will live to regret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Wow, I had no idea my “remain” position had such influence on everything, even extending across to America! I almost feel sorry for #Brexiters. (No I don’t)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan Not really? The country doesn’t lie all the time, the country makes things, trades things, and sells things. All the Conservatives do is print money storing up humongous problems for later, and oh yes create barriers to trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilgraysnp @maggie_colledge @GradySNP Graceless? Typical of Eton in #Johnson ‘s time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodness! #Gove apologises for Golf misinformation @BBCr4today ?  If he apologises for all the misinformation he’s given out over his career we won’t see him again until 2025!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those #Ineos cleanser product ads on TV? Is that #JimRatcliffe ‘s Ineos? The guy that campaigned for #Brexit then pissed off to Monaco? Another turd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@homemoneyexpert But we don’t all want to live in a phonebox!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Let’s face it, #Johnson is not up to the job of being PM in a crisis. Ironic when one of the crises (#Brexit) is the very one he chose to catapult him into number 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Wow! And is #SirDesmondSwain a Brexit supporter? Perhaps he should swing to remaining in the EU, that would mitigate the damage to the economy from Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor “Quite as inane and brain dead” sums up #NigelFarage perfectly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 EU membership gave us an out for all those embarrassing legacy issues from that Imperial past, particularly NI and Gibraltar.  It also gave great weight to our international voice. All gone on the naked ambition of one unsuitable man to be PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Microsoft Or having a mate in government who can fast track you a contract at way over the going rate without having to bid for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clazdana @janej05 @spaceangel1964 Bugger. Wore my blue socks today, so that’s a whole week hiding under the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I notice all the new #Covid restrictions are going to be underpinned by law.  Is thar the sort of law that can be broken in specific and limited ways? @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting. #DuncanSmith doesn’t think we should “give in to science”.  I notice he’s given in to gravity and hair loss though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clazdana @janej05 @spaceangel1964 Is that true? Does it matter which leg? Does it have to be on a Thursday, whilst clapping?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaphParkin @MickCoffey2 @spaceangel1964 But Tim Martin gave us so much and was a big #Brexit voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickCoffey2 @spaceangel1964 Interested as to what “bad” common sense looks like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know why #Johnson says he won’t apologise for calling a second lockdown? He has never apologised, not even for the horrendous fibs and lies he told/tells over #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands Yes, Brexit was/is a flawed proposition.  It cannot deliver any of the promises made in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidnash101 @ChalfontStGiles Absolutely, the man’s an ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @guse_guse Be fair, how can Raab steer a course? Not knowing the significance of Dover, where many Continental adventures start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnRedwood proclaiming on @BBCr4today about Covid lockdown and the balance that needs to be made with the economy. The same #Brexiteer who advised his clients to move their funds abroad. I don’t value his opinion on my health.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davemacladd It’s OK, he has no idea what it means. Probably thinks its a suburb of Dover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 Missing presumed a) inept b) womanising c) lying somewhere d) are we bothered? We can probably do better without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andycorneys It doesn’t serve the right to have an educated proletariate. That way social revolution comes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Can you clarify is #PeterBone a tool or a fool?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK The “terrible choice” is whoever gives loud mouth Hartley-Brewer access to the airwaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Your party in government got rid of 21,000 experienced officers and are slowly replacing them with rookies. It isn’t really growth is it? But then you’re a born liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 @ldrscke @MattHancock You don’t expect Hancock and co to remember what they said/did last week do you? I thought #Brexiters like #Gove etc made a big deal of backtracking on promises. Like not leaving the single market!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Mind you is that before Corbyn and McClusky went on their suicide mission?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor #Gove should remove the log of deceit, lies, and dishonesty from his own eye before chasing anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 A huge distraction, should have ignored him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lee_b65 @ldrscke In newspeak should that be “down tick”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn @Mickster_1 Where’s your eye patch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock You cut funding to NHS for ten years. You are cutting off the biggest source of nurses by exiting the EU. You retired 21,000 police officers creating the hole you now need to fill. Your administration is a joke sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sammythedog1989 @SagittaVeritat1 Not sure why you thought this government wouldn’t be lying. Its the default setting sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Don’t worry, this UK government would refuse any such invitation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK What is her claim to fame exactly? Is it just being gobby?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU Oops indeed. Typo in your last line, should read “whatever this week’s lie is....” Red faces all round I think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 What about “take back control of our laws, money and borders” that’s pretty damn meaningless as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin #BorisJohnson aims at foot and lets off both barrels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 If it’s any consolation, businesses that blame their customers don’t thrive. For business read government, for customers read voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Yes. Why? How come you didn’t know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Welcome to the world where we “took back control” not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s tricky, #PritiPatel saying on #ITVNews “I’ll crack down on callous criminals exploiting vulnerable migrants”.  Perhaps she should resign?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 That’s a b***** big bump in the road Govey.  Four years notice and still no plan. Priceless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 Johnson will be asking them for a road map to their constituencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galiniche @GraceMurphy2 Yes, yes, yes and yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveWismayer @GraceMurphy2 If she does she’s even more spectacularly inept than first thought. She’s invalidated the “not enough hours in the day” excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Every time I listen to this I see the U.K. drifting backwards. Any stellar successes we do have, like ARM, will be poached by overseas interests because we seem unable to hang on to them. We will be a championship side grooming players for premiership teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 In the same way Johnson’s Brexit has destroyed the Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 There is no roll for tax havens any more, not when we’re “all in this together” and “levelling up” The penny will drop eventually, and so hard even #Johnson might notice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've just donated to Macmillan Cancer Support, donate and be part of #teammacmillan.  https://t.co/wHcSBpXdXu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government won’t do that because you suggested it. They would rather cut their own noses off and swim in a sewer than follow good advice from the opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU I think over the centuries Britain has fought in more countries and against more countries than most others. We forged an empire by bullying, colonising, raping, exploiting, and suppressing indigenous peoples. Nothing to be proud of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andycorneys So #Johnson won’t do that. Same as he won’t U turn over school meals because it was #Starmers idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BestForBritain Remember #Gove said #Johnson was unfit to be PM as he knifed him in the back in 2017 leadership contest. Then he did an about face and joined his cabinet in 2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Might be worth asking Ladbroke what the odds are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BestForBritain I think we’ve pretty well pissed on our aviation and airline industry with Brexit.  Thank god it’s in decline anyway thanks to Covid and climate change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unlit_uplands But, #Johnson gets to be PM swanning about making shit up and trying to look like the statesman he isn’t. Britain gives up the ability to influence the biggest single market, that it had a hand in creating, in exchange for being bullied by all and sundry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK It will only help them to realise how badly shafted they’ve been by Brexit, and how in order to compete internationally #ReesMogg wants them to be paid Indian wages, and to give up on the NHS because he doesn’t want to contribute to their health care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 Yeah, we know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guse_guse Mystified why anyone would admit to be married to such a psycho as #DCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SloughForEU Important to add: Without competitive tender.  Paying above market rates.  With no quality guarantees. Firms with no trading pedigree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Any campaign #Gove gets behind these days is doomed to failure. His only fan is #Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when this government fails us, which they will, we’ll have to step in and rebuild what they’ve trashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor “Lawyered up” on #BBCR4today ? An indication this government is on the slippery slope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCR4today “Lawyered up”? Is this what those coming before a court or up against the power of the state used to call their “right to representation”? We used to pride ourselves on upholding the rule of law. Seems it’s not just international law on the slippery slope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump campaigning on @itv news “Oil, guns, and God” ? God says “Oil? Are you trying to trash my creation? Guns? Didn’t I tell you , Thou shalt not kill? And another thing, stop lying.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrandonLewis on @itvnews looking very well fed, thank you very much. Still not budging on food for children in need though. Yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood It worries me that you have such a poor grasp of trade, international affairs, law, borders, and common sense, yet you sit in our parliament? Perhaps time for you to retire, you are pastbyour sell by date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are all cabinet ministers forced to appear on TV and radio to front the absurd government positions on #Covid, #Brexit, and #Schoolmeals in order to bind them ever closer to inept #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate logic of #NickyDameMorgan on @BBCRadio4 is that free school meals should be scrapped entirely. She really does need to have a word with whoever asked her to front up this government’s untenable position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course the face masks the government bought from their fake mates companies are about 50% over-priced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is our tragedy that we have a population so poorly educated they are dim to reason, or that we have a government so dishonourable, dishonest and so lacking in integrity no-one believes them any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst I agree FPTP is well over due for replacement with PR, I’m not sure when we had a far left government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StephenBarclay on @itvnews Really? You were happy to spend hundreds of £millions on eat out, feeding kids in holidays will cost a fraction of that. You are a disgrace Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd Because the U.K. has never got over WW2. Some believe we won, ignoring the help of the USA, USSR, India, Australia, Canada, France, Poland, etc etc. Like #Johnson they imagine we can boss the world like we once did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemainNoGain Yes because instead of statesmen, forged during the middle of the 20th century, the Conservative party now contains, dishonest, spivs, chancers and wide-boys lacking an ounce of honour and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling @neweuropean #Gove hasn’t a clue about business, trade or commerce. Actually Gove is clueless. Gove can’t even remember all the big promises he made in 2016 about never leaving the single market or customs union.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden A hungry child doesn’t learn, a fed child does. A child that learns, achieves. Achievers get better jobs. Those with better jobs avoid dependency for life. #KitMalthouse needs to learn this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickynoo007 @sarahchantrey You ask “has anyone thought”? #Johnson thought (?) the 2016 #Brexit campaign would give him the profile to tilt at the PMs job.  Four years later he is PM. Sadly ill equipped for either #Brexit or a #Covid pandemic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gordon_riches @Iamlistening666 @BBradley_Mans Have you tried writing to your MP? Mine just trots out the government line without hesitation. He is the ultimate “placeman”.  A scarecrow could do as good a job for less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans Learning works best on a full stomach. Learning equips children for the future. An educated child achieves more. Achievers are less dependent.  It makes good sense @BBradley_Mans you know it does really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavePage999 With the #Brexit campaign a close second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemainNoGain #Johnson and #Gove haven’t a single business credential between them.  Therefore ill-suited to manage a project like #Brexit that deconstructs our relationship with our largest trading partner and introduces barriers and obstacles to trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Where were the handcuffs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 Your tweet contains an error. #Johnson very much does want the job, always has.  He just can’t cope with either Covid or Brexit that require statesmanlike attention to detail and gravitas ill suited to his gladhanding and grandstanding bonhomie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Nope.  Even the slogans are becoming tired, somewhat more meaningless, and delivered with less conviction.  Mind you I don’t think #Raab, #Jenrick, and half the others have any idea what they’re doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liberumorator @sarahwillers @DeborahMeaden @BorisJohnson The problem as I see it Frank is if you are exporting to the EU it very much will be under their law. Therefore any documentation needs to comply with whatever our government agrees. No detail= impossible to know what form to complete. #obvs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahchantrey Obvious snag with your suggestion.  We do not have a decent democracy at present.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Jones01 #DominicGrieve #AnnaSoubry #KenClarke #MichaelHesseltine ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Yes they can be anticipated to be wrong and incur delays and confusion.  Face it this shower of a cabinet have zero industrial or manufacturing experience.  If they did they wouldn’t be supporting economy crushing #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertshrimsley @ldrscke To avoid collisions hold both arms in front of you and shout “unclean” “unclean”.  Magically the pavement clears ahead of you.  Watch out for lampposts though, they appear to be deaf!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt @guse_guse Good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @BorisJohnson There is no detail.  #Johnson doesn’t do detail. #Johnson doesn’t do business.  #Johnson fucks business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy #Johnson was intent on screwing Manchester the same way he screwed Liverpool. The obscene profit from just one of his fraudulent mates rates PPE deals would have covered the cost fivefold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @BorisJohnson He was intent on levelling Manchester down to the same miserly deal he gave Liverpool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #Johnson says “build back better” are we entitled to ask what has he ever built?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreeves9876 It isn’t #Johnson who’ll have to rebuild the economy, do any of the “levelling up”, or suffer any of the belt tightening.  He’ll be feathering his nest and giving our money to his mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCr4today so #Johnson was stingy with Liverpool and Lancashire and now wants to screw #Manchester too. All so he can shower £millions on his friends. #wakeupBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCr4today dear Metropolitan Police, last time I checked, we don’t have such a thing as an #identitycard or a need to carry identification. Or has that changed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimesRadio @AasmahMir @StigAbell @nadhimzahawi Exactly how unconvincing was @nadhimzahawi on @TimesRadio ? Just another minister promoted because he is pro Brexit and thinks #Johnson best man for PM. Ergo inept and out of his depth. Would flounder in a puddle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NadhimZahawi @BBCr4today a well fed child concentrates at school. A child that concentrates learns more. A child that learns more can achieve more. Higher achievers cost less and contribute more.  It makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor @LegatumInst Elevated presumably because she is pro-Brexit and thinks #Johnson best man for PM? Ergo, poor judgement, weak analytical skills and therefore unfit for the HoL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier @michaelgove Goodness Robert, you write as though you believed #Gove! No-one else does. He’s so dishonest there isn’t a suitable world beating expletive that adequately encapsulates what a gold-plated turd he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cliodiaspora @Alex_Stafford Yeah we raped, exploited, suppressed, and colonised our way round the world from Navy warships. I doubt commonwealth countries would volunteer for a second round. Learn your history.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dinga1957 @Peston Really?  Would you give a health critical service to Serco?  The government knows its wrong which is why they keep badging it NHS in the hope the magic will rub off on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 @nickreeves9876 Because #Johnson and co are numerically illiterate and don’t understand disease spread. Neither do they want to be the bearers of bad news like “shut down again, no more cash”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex He dreamt of being a PM glad handing an adoring public, entertaining foreign heads of state, and generally being Mr Bountiful.

<|startoftext|>Yeah sure makes a mess of everything he touches.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@globalhlthtwit @nickreeves9876 Herd immunity isn’t a Covid19 policy or strategy, it’s what happens eventually if everyone sits on their hands and sticks their heads up their own arses. Is promoted by people who can’t be bothered, and should be roundly rejected by people who care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve just realised, when #Gove said of Brexit negotiations “we’ll hold all the cards” he meant, an Enter Kent permit, a lorry park reservation, customs paperwork, passport, tunnel ticket, motorway queue food voucher, Covid19 test result, EU travel pass......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Churchill had far more behind him than #Johnson and his clueless cabinet of talentless lightweights and a book full of snappy slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove is either shamelessly duplicitous or woefully ignorant.  Either way he is #unfitforoffice , any office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creating a new medicines agency a pale shadow of the EU one we used to host that is now in Amsterdam and which all our pharma companies will still have to register their products with. #Madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Economist on @BBCNewsnight says “we will be paying for all this support of business if the government don’t get this right.” I don’t want to be a nay sayer but we’ll be paying for it if they get it right too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pauline, if #Gove is awake he’s lying for sure. As to your accusation of “thinking” there is no evidence whatsoever that Gove is capable of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Either shameless duplicity or woeful ignorance? Either way not fit for office. #Govetogo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply reveals either a) his shameless duplicity, or b) his woeful ignorance Neither bodes well for the future of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Raab considering not recognising the inauguration of the Mayor of Lowestoft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove on @BBCNews “Labour lost the election so you’re stuck with us and our complete incompetence across every aspect of government and particularly Brexit where we haven’t a clue what we’re doing 4 years after the referendum.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your flagship policy (#Brexit ) requires building huge lorry parks; recruiting 50,000 customs officers; instigating special passes to enter Kent; breaking international treaties you agreed in January; and risking peace in NI, then perhaps your policy is shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RishiSunak cancels #autumnbudget it would have revealed the complete basket case our economy has become ahead of the disaster this inept government are making of Brexit. @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, an inept shower of clueless lightweights chose to a) implement Brexit at a headlong rush without planning. b) ignore the chance to extend deadlines c) undertake zero negotiations to retain tariff free access to the single market d) put pointless slogans before our welfare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no, no there will be 20,000 extra policemen and 50,000 extra border guards to man the bridges over the Medway!  More to the point will I be able to visit my cousin in Walmer without my passport?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beyond inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More likely Kent will apply to stay in the EU like Northern Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn’t matter what #Gove says. It will be either:- a) lies b) untruths c) deceits d) evasion e) obfuscation f) twaddle g) crap h) a d and f i) b e and g j) all of the above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson and his cabinet of clueless lightweights only have one talent.  To tell lies upon deceits upon untruths.  We need to call this out before their mismanagement of. #Covid and #Brexit damage the economy beyond repair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove has had four years to get this sorted. Assuming he hadn’t done anything prior to 2016, which he clearly hadn’t despite campaigning on the basis that everything would be fine. He really is a clueless lightweight. If he had an ounce of integrity he’d #resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they are clueless lightweights without any talent whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I lost my car keys down the back of the sofa I wouldn’t ask any of this cabinet of talentless lightweights to help find them. #Johnsonout #Goveout etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no problem that this cabal of talentless lightweights can’t make into a pig’s breakfast. You’ve had four long years and this is the best you can come up with? Either extend transition or cancel pointless #Brexit you idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why #Starmer should prop up failed #Johnson.  Best serves us by seeing off this government of talentless lightweights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting bearing in mind UK/Britain had a hand in destabilising Iraq Iran Afghanistan Syria Libya Lebanon Palestine both way back in history and over the last 70 years. We need to take our share obvs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give credit where it’s due. U.K. gov has done it bit sending Raab to speak for us and undermining international law and tearing up treaties at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #PrimeMinister #Johnson the battle against Covid should be all about “what” you do and “how” you do it. Not “where” and “when”. But then you’ve been hell bent on wrecking the country haven’t you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought WE were taking back control?  Seems more like we’re jumping to others tunes now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The important thing is “what” we do and “how” we do it, not “where” and “when”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’d all do a lot better if #Gove stopped work and stayed at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s “what” we do and “how” we do it that needs to change.  Not “where” and “when”. This government completely at sea, as they are with international law, trade and, dare I say it, Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Work is good where-ever you do it. Some people mostly in cities need movement of people to provide their customers. Our service economy, the performing arts, leisure and sport all need us. If we stay at home they starve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnaJerzewska @JMPSimor Your reply should be. “Yes I am ready to design and implement a workaround to keep the border open once you tell me what the framework/agreement for trade will actually be.  Have you the slightest idea yet? It’s only been four years.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate (?) to point out the bleeding obvious but we were in the best position as members of the EU.  Difficult to work with the Leave proponents as they lack honesty and integrity and have zero grasp of the issues. All they have is meaningless slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone with half a brain.  So probably not many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hesitate to correct your tweet but how about- “I know this cabinet is the worst. They avoid responsibility on Covid and Brexit by being ambiguous but take credit when others have worked out the right thing to do.” (Obvs no “right thing” for Brexit.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ms #Harding so completely encapsulates this government’s sense of entitlement by a privileged mediocrity. #Johnson thinks a snappy catchphrase like “moonshot” will swing it. It won’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The key thing is “what” you do and “how” you do it not “where” and “when”.  But then this is a government of Brexiteers, and if you want a definition of dumb, Brexit encapsulates it completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m hoping the Red Cross still do food parcels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I am baffled by anyone who still thinks Brexit is a good idea for anyone other than hedge fund managers and people with a stash in a tax haven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But sadly par for the course for this government of underachieving lightweights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What staggers me is how you can live as long as he has without picking up simple concepts like virus transmission without symptoms. Then to accept the ministerial health brief whilst possessing such gaping holes in your knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, Brexit was a flawed proposition from the get go, that can only deliver the opposite of what was promised. 2016 Referendum won by lies upon deceits upon untruths. Reality will be worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You spoilt it with the typo.  Should be “when he was lying about bendy bananas”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.  Pandemics are species wide problems that only get eradicated when everyone is free of infection.  It is exploitative to pretend that daily testing of a few is in any way useful rather than just feathering the nest of the selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upholding the rule of law and complying with international treaties is pretty much core UN stuff Dominic. Or are you playing your joker on that round?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh don’t be too harsh.  You haven’t seen what a complete pigs breakfast they’re going to make of #Brexit yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people that use the phrase are labouring under the misconception that we will be living in a “shackle free” world. In fact there will be layer upon layer of extra shackles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit of honesty, honour, and integrity. Bit of a change there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Please please please can you say “increase” when reporting on a growing trend in Covid19 occurrences rather than the affection “uptick” which is meaningless and unhelpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sheffield here we come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s more worrying than a #Covid19 second wave is the fear that #Raab syndrome is catching. As Raab’s protection officer leaves gun on plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews #Johnson can see a second Covid19 wave coming. Where from? #Durham? He’s probably shaken hands with it already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to think there are any number of competent people out there who could have done that job possibly for less money.  OK having to marry a Conservative MP might have put a few off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And £789million spent to no advantage over what we had before.  Spectacular maladministration. Reference again to “opportunities” all of which existed as an EU member and could have probably been pursued at less cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, actually is highly embarrassed by his god awful haystack hair cut. If he isn’t he should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is a complete and utter liability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that “no ships” #Grayling ?  Could be worse could’ve been “where’s Dover” #Raab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many of the Brexit proponents clearly have baggage associated with the countries of their birth #Stuart or their upbringing #Johnson or their ancestry #Farage #Francois #Raab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its what we’re good at. Inventing something. Making it world class and the envy of the world. Then either sell it off at rockbottom prices or smash it to pieces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s all too believable, over 120 years ago you’d have got nineteen to the dozen of privileged nobs just like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn’t want to see either of them strip tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awarded? Implies some sort of competition or process. “Gifted” might more accurately hit the bulls eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK civil war? Done that. Revolution on the other hand, we’re owed one of those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ReesMogg would be far happier if we did what we were told, like the working classes used to do 100 years ago.  He is so out of touch, bit like #Johnsons moonshot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry, he singularly failed to land any trade deals as International Trade Secretary so is unlikely to have any impact whatsoever at the WTO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have the lightest of lightweight cabinets comprising ill informed, talentless, nodding dogs, whose only claim to fame is they think (?) Brexit is a good idea but can’t say why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roblem is Johnson already thinks he has a right to food, your wife, make up anything he wants, and to be PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Johnson rants at PMQ’s to incisive questions calmly delivered. #Johnson is the one who looks stupid, ill informed and unfit for office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically he went for Brexit because he rightly guessed public wouldn’t look beyond the catchy slogans. Doesn’t care what a shithole the country becomes as long as he’s PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially when food will be stuck in lorry queue at the border come 1st January. Hurrah for #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, everyone secures their home market first, then the countries nearest, then those furthest away.  The nearer countries are the springboard, lose them at your peril.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or was #Patel’s response meaningless drivel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest #TestandTrace rumour is you can only get a test if you can prove you actually have Covid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could put my cat in charge and she’d make a better fist of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s face it they are incompetent. Capacity does not equal a test. In the post does not equal a test. A sample taken does not equal a test if the lab can’t handle it. Used to be a time when they would resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ReesMogg knows his history.  He knows in the First World War the officer class ordered the squaddies over the top regardless of the loss of life. #ReesMogg would like to return to that state of affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’d be even happier if Devon and Cornwall went too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg isn’t in the real world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crikey #DidoHarding of Trace and Test didn’t anticipate an increase (uptick) in demand for Covid19 tests as schools go back. She’s a quality appointment, whose wife is she?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good old “man of the people” #JacobReesMogg piling in to support Trace a Test failure Dido Harding by telling us not to ask for a test until we’re sure we’ve got #Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to read of a foreign secretary #Raab needing “better luck” rather than having strength of argument, political acumen, and statesmanship on his side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Misread that as “Peter Thief”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difference between statesmanship and playground bluster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair they only had four years to be totally unprepared for the Brexit debacle everyone saw coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It may be free at the point of use for traders but every man Jack of us are funding this through taxation. Paying for completely pointless #Brexit related bureaucracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our Prime Minister incoherent, muddled, ambiguous, vague, just what we need with #Covid19, #Brexit and #ClimateChange to deal with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there not an offence of “conspiracy to.......”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson @BBCNews Murder is a crime, so is conspiracy to murder. Breaking international law is a crime, is conspiracy to.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that the sort of U.K. that sells off its tech Crown Jewels ARM to Japan? EU red tape? You wait til our government gets going on red tape and as for corruption it’s already started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson racking up powers for a rainy day that (faux wringing of hands) he doesn’t want to use. Simple answer, don’t do it. Put your effort into getting the deal which your insulting language has made harder.language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some-one should tell #PritIPatel because that doesn’t sound like “increasing numbers of tests every day”. Ref her interview on @BBCr4today mind you could just be more untruths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t worry, the replies I get from mine are all very “party line”.  He’s incapable of independent thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To a lower quality, with fewer consumer protections, higher CO2 emissions and pollution, poorer worker wages and employment conditions, lower health and safety requirements. Plus also true of things made in UK so what little manufacturing will vanish  as will agriculture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be more of a surprise if #Patel said anything coherent or sensible.  Truly someone promoted beyond her level of incompetence.  Bit like #Johnson and #Raab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whereas you #ReesMogg are siding with lawbreakers, and the cabinet full of those lacking honesty, honour, and integrity. Your use of language puts you firmly in the early part of the last century.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government system was developed at pace (I.e. rushed) probably by some mate of #Cummings. If #Raab had anything to do with it it’s a miracle you’re directed to anywhere in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating to hear the complete tosh Brexiteer MPs come out with vis a vis the Withdrawal agreement. It was negotiated by, agreed by, championed by, and signed by #Johnson if it has faults lay them at his door please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t see The #GoodFridayAgreement surviving Brexit if Johnson reneges on the only sensible compromise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some-one should pay more attention. You just voted your PM as incompetent if you really think the treaty he negotiated, agreed, championed and signed was in fact so fatally flawed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This lot give crooks a bad name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All trade deals involve converging standards. #Brexit is unique because #Johnson says he wants to diverge standards. This is why he’s having trouble with it. Flawed proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used to be a time when incompetent ministers left “to spend more time with their family”. Trouble is this lot are so awful their families don’t want them back. #WithdrawalAgreementBill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but it was Johnson who negotiated, agreed, championed and signed the WA which he is now describing as rubbish. If he had any honour he should resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reality is the Irish want shot of the British from their island. The only reason it didn’t happen in its entirety in 1917 is because Britain had “settled” the north after its conquest. How about we right that wrong in a specific and limited way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity we didn’t get #Brexit on #Visa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or c) completely incompetent, out of their depth, lacking in honesty, honour, and integrity, bereft of any substance beyond a handful of jingoistic slogans.   Time to go methinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He probably managed to, he only had to walk through a door, didn’t even have to make his mark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit was/is a flawed proposition won (?) by lies upon deceits upon untruths. After 4 years the Leave protagonists are finding it impossible to deliver the slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after that, Cambridgeshire will opt to leave, especially after May’s government failed to hang onto ARM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PeterLilley on #Newsnight this bill might not actually break the law, but it certainly fits the description of “conspiracy to do so”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot the flaws. “Boris Johnson has negotiated a great new deal”. If he had any honesty, honour, or integrity he would resign rather than trash our international reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I don’t know Daniel. Our PM #Johnson negotiated, agreed, championed, and signed the Withdrawal Agreement. Did he read it? Did he understand it? Put the blame where it belongs, No 10.  https://t.co/dhcP7GXAsw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson’s the one who’s lied, deceived, and spread falsehoods concerning UK prospects as an EU “third country”. Johnson is discovering he has no cards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully she’ll just say “no”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly electoral reform and Proportional Representation  requires support of a government elected by First Past The Post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s #Johnson’s deal, negotiated, agreed, signed. If it has faults, they are his faults, no-one else’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndreaLeadsom holding her head up high as the Johnson government ship starts to sink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I missing something but if the Withdrawal Agreement allows the EU to dictate food arrangements in NI, why did #Johnson negotiate, agree, and sign it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varindersingh24 Boris Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But only in a specific and limited way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson was in Brussels and doesn’t give a shit about “troubles”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#resign please or do you indeed lack all honesty, honour, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dickhead, you seem to forget your #Johnson negotiated, agreed, championed and signed it. International view is this UK government is there to be walked all over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Johnson bit rich you lecturing others on “negotiating in good faith” when you don’t.  You even try to rewrite deals you negotiated, agreed, championed and signed. Leave Afghanistan alone, they have enough problems without your help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove on @BBCr4today re Covid “there are very specific rules about what you can and cannot do” and yet he can’t spot the parallel with International Law. #Godhelpus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EUTradedeal of course if the U.K. sets itself to break international law; Russia will say annexing Crimea, China will say reneging on Hong Kong, Spain will seize Gibraltar, Argentina will seize Falklands, are all specific and limited breaks of international law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does “We must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives.” Mean that you’ll a) sack Cummings for flouting guidance and b) fine yourself and your 50 colleagues for breaching distancing guidance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He seemed well suited for the role. Thick and pugnacious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re lucky, mine was in Durham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is full of shit.  If we meet in groups of more than six we will be breaking the law, but his adviser broke it, Johnson broke it and now wants to break international law. The man is an ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t do London to Durham without a break eh? Don’t take your family for a drive if you can’t see properly. Lesson for government there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the PM lying? Because he can’t do anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On our recent Community Speedwatch we caught a few drivers breaking the law in a “limited and specific way”. i.e. exceeding the speed limit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he is utterly ridiculous. Like a child being admonished by an adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 8 year old cat would make a more stable government than this shower.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indeed, none of our ex colonies would sign up for another round of domination and exploitation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Changing the captain without changing course achieves less than nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. The people they are extolling to “get back to work” have mostly been working from home much to the joy of their employers. This Gov is well out of its depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well if “no deal” with the EU is brilliant then logically “no deal” with anyone else is also “brilliant”.  #Johnson obviously intent on completely wrecking the economy rather than just severely damaging it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought the top team couldn’t get any worse? “Where’s Dover” Raab. “Back stabber” Gove. And “pull the ladder up” Patel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you need to know.  If the change is as targeted as he suggests it should be a breeze to agree it bilaterally.  It isn’t so it isn’t. The lies just keep on coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With intellects like yours in the House of Commons we’re going to need all the luck we can get. Any EU deal is good for Britain, except “no deal” which will be catastrophic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson appointed both of these inept lightweights. Where does Gove rank?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Gavin Williamson hasn’t offered to resign he should be sacked by Johnson.  If he truly offered his resignation Johnson should have accepted it. Since Johnson has no honour, honesty, or integrity, inept  #Williamson survives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was something on the radio about how in large organisations such as government people will rise to their level of incompetence. Take your pick Dido, Hancock, Williamson, Johnson...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But actually extra U.K. students will fill vacancies left by overseas students. And if the A level results hadn’t been handled so badly Unis would have picked the best of the best first time round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven’t you figured it out yet? Johnson and his government are all about getting powers back from Brussells, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Stormont, and County Councils. So his inept bunch of lightweights can screw everything up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish we had the Scottish government instead of Johnson’s inept pack of Brexit loving lightweights. #BrexitUturn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brexit is, was, and continues to be a flawed proposition that St Peter himself wouldn’t be able to make a success of. That we’ve picked a PM and a cabinet singularly incapable of any competence piles on the tragedy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This government would rather bring in the “brightest and best” from the world and keep menial jobs such as fruit picking and caring for our own children. #johnson is lazy, without honesty, honour and integrity. He should go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be a far far better investment than subsidising my lunch today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This government comprises illadvised lightweights selected because they think Brexit is a good idea. Which it isn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets face it this cohort are going to have an uphill battle with a wrecked economy and limited horizons through Brexit. A one year little grade inflation is immaterial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn’t #Williamson sacked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Minister is lying, as usual. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to tackle #Covid19 we’re assembling a team of scientists and medics to support the cabinet. Presume Gove isn’t involved because he’s had enough of experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because we’ve become inured to inept government. At some point the lack of honesty integrity and honour will come home to roost (I hope).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Third option, the Revolution we’ve never had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson announces that migrants have been deceived by people smugglers that the U.K. under his premiership is a land of milk and honey. We all know the reality. Under his premiership we’re cast adrift, rudderless, and soon to be broke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Except we aren’t.  A whole stack of people have money hidden away in tax havens where it can’t be taxed to help pay for the NHS and compensation for those who’ve lost their livelihood because of #Corvid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there’s any justice he won’t be PM for much longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather than clapping on a #Thursday, it would have been more use if Conservative governments had fully funded the NHS over the last ten years. And how about taxing the money squirrelled away in tax havens by British subjects who happily use the NHS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s a thought.  If we brought U.K. money in tax havens into the tax net, then the government might be able to give more support to those who will be devastated by the #Coronavirus shut down. They could also go after the tax exiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take the survey: Supporters' survey  https://t.co/ePtQlcDRGl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There would have been 20,000 more doing an incredible job, but you retired them early to save a few bob George. Now we’re hiring new raw recruits to replace all that experience. The least you could do George is say sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve just signed to support the UN call for a global ceasefire in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic.  Please join me.  https://t.co/lDrH5Q8dc0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All at one with this government’s misguided belief that positive guff and waffle will “see us through”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#@BBCr4today #Johnson on #Coronavirus response from public “there really is such a thing as society” is at odds with his efforts to protect those who use tax havens to avoid tax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today #Gove amongst others, demonising China for sucking in #coronavirus testing kits might make a fetching sound bite, but is spectacularly shortsighted if you want/need a new trade deal bearing in mind how much we import from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson @BBCr4today “we’ll all get through this (#covid19 ) together” rings a bit hollow all the while this government protects those who shield their fortune from tax in tax havens. #ReesMogg #Leadsom amongst them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit knocks a further 3-5% off GDP.  Like all your Christmades go up in smoke all at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ian Duncan-Smith needs to check on where his phone, radio, and many other domestic items were made. Talk about biting the hand that supplies you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably a simpler explanation. What was Gtechs position on Brexit and how much do they contribute to the Conservative party?  Not sure why they don’t make them anyway, I anticipate a ready market somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19 A good way of showing “we’re all in this together” would be to bring money in tax havens into the tax net.  That way #Leadsom and #ReesMogg could also be putting their shoulder to the wheel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the basket of “all pulling together” I’d like to see “taxing money in tax havens” then I’d be impressed. #Corvid19 #Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth is out @BBCNewsnight . IDS is moonlighting as a Belisha Beacon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcr4news Is it just me or are Johnson’s answers verging on complete bollocks?  Isn’t it the case that the time to act is always the earliest, not some possible later point that will prove to be too late?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Corvid19 Confused. Gove said we’d heard too much from experts, but Johnson is playing the “guided by science” card for all its worth. No place for Gove on strategy team surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope and pray people won’t make that mistake twice.  Johnson and co refer to us staying at home to save “our NHS”, when they have starved it over ten years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sacking is too good for him. (Insert your own alternative).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don’t fuel the sense of importance this incompetent shower have of themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn’t the government requisition them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be no more than we deserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life already is with this pack of lazy, lying sycophants at the wheel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We may not need it, but we’ve got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God smirky Patel isn’t on view though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep didn’t address the issue of saddling firms with debt, and trots out his usual patter about “bouncing back”.  It’ll be a long slog and won’t happen until Johnson is long out of Downing Street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear Tim. Now you know how we feel about your insane support for Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man’s a twerp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews Johnson “the economy will bounce back”. This man is seriously deluded and he needs to know that his optimistic brand is well and truly busted. The Brexit lies broke it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Johnson needs to man up and order venues to close. They can then claim on their insurance. Government can then stand behind insurers. Hope he’s planning for rationing, can see it coming to ensure redundant workers get food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Is there any chance we can swap Johnson for David Milliband? Decisive leadership and action at earliest opportunity is what we need. Helps if that leader is believable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where did they get thevtwelve stooges from?  How do they keep a straight Face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t be anything to do with that stupid #Brexit project could it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public enemy number 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seem to be saying our government is inept. This would normally be sedition but today is merely accurate reportage.#corvid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The airline industry is saying its in dire need of support.  Air travel major contribution to climate change, Heathrow 3rd runway a controversial costly project. Bin those two and it’s a win win for the planet. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knowledge is power, ignorance is bliss.  Just about sums up this inept administration, hand picked by a lazy, lying, ignorant, oaf.  Certainly not the team you’d want in charge during a crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The instruction is buy what you need, don’t go to public places unless you have to.  The background is our government introducing barriers to trade.  The logical conclusion is buy 3 or more weeks of food. Don’t blame them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We deserve it certainly, but we very haven’t got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mortgage rates at all time lows?  Only one way they can go then. Up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only danger to this country is the Daily Telegraph. Peddling the lie that our government is competent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear #Trump spent ages in meeting with Corvid19 infected Brazillian. He is in the wrong demographic. Over 70 with an underlying health condition of “stupid”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson gives demonstration of hand washing by hiding behind his medical advisers rather than making the tough decisions. Our PM happy to throw the weak and the old on the scrapheap. No soul, no empathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NicolaSturgeon has it right. Don’t hold events that take emergency resources away from Corvid19 fight.  Evidence is early measures have more effect than waiting til its too late. Our government is hopeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be more impressed if #Johnson actually showed any care over our health. His party cut health over ten years. Any large gathering provides opportunities for spread so stop them. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite frankly if Johnson gets Corvid19 he should do the honourable thing and resign. Oh I forgot he has no honour, honesty, or integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Johnson had put the national interest first we wouldn’t be leaving the EU at all. Johnson is a political lightweight devoid of honesty, integrity and honour.  Not the man to be at the helm as we tackle Brexit, Corvid19, and Climate Change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to google what E3 was. Gutted it’s been cancelled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe its an “untrade” deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s really not someone who should ever ever be put in charge of the cake tin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose if we want to be really secure we could have a U.K. 5G solution.  There is plenty of string and tin cans available after all. #IDS and #Fox are so out of touch it’s frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief! We can have China building nuclear power stations for us but not a few bits of broadband kit? I bet everyone’s kit has parts made in China, my Iphone is. #IDS and #Fox are so out of touch it’s scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet our government allows flights in from locked down northern Italy with zero health checks.  One asks who is tak8ng this seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson is clearly way way way out of his depth.  Should do the honourable thing and resign. Oh, I forgot, he has no honour or integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a numpty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our government seems determined to make Brexit into the worst and heaviest handicap to business. That’s the businesses you work for, the businesses your pension is invested in, and the businesses whose taxes support vital public services like the NHS that you rely on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cabinet.  A bunch of lightweights promoted beyond their level of incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should’ve asked which public events he’s attending next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh crap, another idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we get the Russia report while we’re at it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too right. Never give up never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to Johnson when he lived in Brussels to make him so vindictive. We deserve to know. It’s his problem, not mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know what? I’d consider it adding insult to injury to be visited by Johnson any time after I’d been flooded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable, and a completely unnecessary falsehood.  Pretty soon we won’t be able to believe the Highway Code!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can they release the Russia report too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps we can include truth, honour and integrity at the same time.  That should shut the cabinet of lightweights up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey don’t blame all of us for acting irresponsibly. There are people who campaigned for Brexit, who lied, fibbed, and lack honour and integrity. That’s why rationing will return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Jacob, honesty, integrity and honour are the bedrock of democracy.  But then you wouldn’t know that would you Jacob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do you think they’re panic buying, it’s in case of a bad Brexit.  No other Brexit available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is, was and forever shall be a flawed proposition that will deliver the precise opposite of what was promised in 2016.  The dishonest lightweights who promoted it have no plan and are singularly ill equipped to resolve the resulting chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear LBC, perhaps it’s time for Ferrari to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the train is still running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson was born 200 years too late, I suppose he didn’t pay attention in his history lessons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Johnson was lying again?  This is hardly news, and what I assume as a given.  If Johnson says it it isn’t true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes she clearly relishes the attention. Anyone else would be somber and restrained not smirking. Verdict: Guilty as charged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, at last a silver lining.  Months on end when we can get on with life without a lying, lazy, inattentive, boorish, waffler of a PM sticking his nose in things he doesn’t understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially when we won’t be able to afford it. Johnson is so dim it’s embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number 10 is just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry they incinerated all the specimens and equipment/clothing in case he’d contaminated it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One can but hope.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Lucky” that he appointed some-one as talentless as Patel as Home Secretary?  “Lucky” that he pays no attention to detail? “Lucky” that he is a puppet to Cummings/Putin or anyone else with a longer attention span.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a bit of it.  History shows that PMs who stubbornly stick up for ministers after we’ve seen they are duds, suffer a dent in their popularity too.  So Johnson, keep sticking up for Patel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He really is Trump using slightly longer words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair London probably better off planning #corvid19 response without the “help” of the idiots in the cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit will Leave you short staffed, overpriced, and facing shed loads more paperwork, so good lunch with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, the meeting will probably be more productive without some-one who ignores experts, can’t help lying about things, and has an appalling record on delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t the #ECHR the one we founded after WW2?  That really is throwing the baby out with the bath water.  And then throwing the bath after them.  But hey isn’t that what Brexit’s all about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we really fourth from bottom?  If only Brexit wasn’t driving so many of our entrepreneurs away to the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it will destroy this inept government. Sadly not before damaging the economy; the NHS; social care; businesses; pensions; the UKs international reputation; and our national cohesion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to tackle #Covid19 we’re assembling a team of scientists and medics to support the cabinet. Presume Gove isn’t involved because he’s had enough of experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which bit of “trade deal” don’t you understand Andrea?  Creating barriers to trade through checks and bureaucracy doesn’t help anybody. Shortening the negotiation timescales is silly childish petulance. 37% of the electorate is no mandate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, goodbye NHS, goodbye social care, goodbye welfare, goodbye state pension. Far far far easier to destroy than build. Don’t swallow the Johnson and Gove lies, fight to keep what you value because they won’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be frank though we do not need a lying, grandstanding, lazy, petulant, disinterested oaf of a PM getting in the way of sorting this crisis out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not freedom if you knock the economy back twenty years and strangle opportunities for collaboration and prosperity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you pick strawberries or stack shelves “remotely”? Perhaps robots could do it? Then what do we do?  Economy still based on people earning money isn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently we seem to have forgotten how we helped Poles to help us in the struggle against Fascism. Also we forget how the Polish work ethic has helped get us to fifth largest economy.  A tag we are losing by the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reduced tax revenues puts the NHS, social care, public services, and pensions at risk.  WAKE UP this is all about the very rich leaving you to sort yourselves out without lifting a finger to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s an ass. Doesn’t understand or even listen to the people that make the country go round. Doesn’t appreciate that business pays the taxes that fund the NHS, we work for businesses, and have our pensions and savings invested in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah like the Brexit he campaigned for, remaining in the SM and CU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah like the Brexit he campaigned for, remaining in the SM and CU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humph, his stables have power sockets paid for by us, so all’s we’ll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course Gove is correct. Brexit will invigorate the EU economies as many of our businesses and jobs migrate to the EU to avoid the senseless disaster at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be fair, his horse would probably make a better fist of being an MP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on! If you were that useless, unreliable, untruthful and embarrassing wouldn’t you stay at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government minister demonstrating that government not comprised of adults but petulant 5 year olds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Gove really that naive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s that all about? Another broken promise? This is throwing the both bath and the baby out with the bath water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So no playing two teams at the same time? Pity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@banktoyer Knew she was awful, but interview shows she is absolutely dreadful. And whoever appointed her must be equally inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson only thinking of us by imposing a self managed quarantine on himself.  Long may it continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson inept shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson lying shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except that is what you agreed to. Must have been on page 3 of the agreement, which he couldn’t be arsed to read. What a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah except his deal does have customs checks in the Irish Sea, and he campaigned in 2016 for a Brexit that kept us in the Single Market and Customs Union. You cannot deal with someone whose word is worth nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hadn’t realised exactly how truly awful she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest benefit is of course avoiding Brexit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rules for an advisory referendum are lax. The rules for a mandatory referendum are strict.  Cameron committed to implementing the result.  Was it advisory or mandatory, discuss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nation of masochists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, and keeping our own population doing all yhe low level jobs. Is that what people voted for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Errr, we’ve had ten years of Conservative governments. QED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’d think these idiots would realise that in the digital media world of today there is no corner to hide in, and your every word will come back to bite you. Hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over that looks like the Conservatives are rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit was a colossal “shooting ourselves in the foot” exercise. Why should music, music venues and budding bands avoid this disaster?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next cycling on the pavement; shopping after curfew; breathing out CO2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wot no bridge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More to the point who’s going to buy “frozen” prawns and how much for, instead of fresh ones tariff and barrier free in the EU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s met real incredulity and ridicule is that anyone would appoint Priti Patel as home secretary other than as an April Fool prank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because of big majority and near to useless media he’ll think he can walk on water. He can’t, and even our media will notice when he drowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd, considering over half of them were ours to start with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And most of the fish we catch goes to? Go on have a guess.  Yep, the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But to be fair he wouldn’t bring anything to the party.  If he turned up morale would slump and emergency workers would throw themselves into the raging torrent just to get away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flat earthier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry, they will fall. Hard to know who’ll go first, but whoever it is will blame and undermine the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On @BBCr4today some government spokesman said of course there were plenty of Brits available to replace migrant labour as there are “8 million economically inactive people in the U.K.”. Does that include the government or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Kwateng doesn’t identify as “a person of colour”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scuppers any ideas he might have had about being a world leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, maybe Cummings hasn’t told him what to say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have read the small print.  Oh, and it won’t get any better until we lose this government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risk is he’ll borrow to achieve any of it and it’ll be future generations that are saddled with the repayments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“In his time” it’s not history, it’s like last week! “Going forward” what other option was there? “I am honoured” not yet you’re not.  That comes after you’re booted out and need to be pensioned off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Admitting a Russian oligarch has you in his pocket might not have played so well with the great British Public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They might not care today, but they will find out next year, and I bet they will care then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can hardly call it a cabinet of the talents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn.  How annoying to discover #Javid had some principles after all.  Silver lining is that it confirms #Johnson is a megalomaniac intent on dictatorship.  His fall will be all the harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still like the music of The Who.  Roger is still a turnip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Raab has only a vague appreciation of the importance of Dover in our export trade, we are entitled discount whatever else he says as either a) wrong b) flawed c) a bare-faced lie or d) a, b, and c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most leave people haven’t worked out that a prosperous economy is what pays for their social care, NHS, and pensions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where to? The USA where he was born, or Turkey where his family come from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d be interested to know what Rees-Mogg has ever imported or exported personally across any border anywhere? Thought not. Talking out his arse as per usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply.  Higher prices and less choice. Ooh that won’t fly will it, how about “take back control”?  Yep, complete tosh but sounds better than “worse off, losers”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear. Obviously don’t know their countrymen very well, do they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except that’s what we enjoy in the single market and EU customs union.  Odd that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was on “Remain” leaflets, websites and social media. Gove said it was “Project Fear”.  Turns out it was project “hit the nail on the head” after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes indeed, immigration of the brightest and the best, and our own children get to do the menial jobs!  This Conservative Government is truly #shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a whole load of extra cost and red tape.  I thought governments were supposed to make things easier and less bureaucratic?  This Conservative Government is #shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The garden bridge was £15million per half mile not built.  The Irish Sea Bridge will be nearly a £billion at the same rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that a project to help the north (HS2) starts at Euston (London), gets to Crewe and then is reviewed to see how it can be done cheaper. Doing something because it’s ready to go, doesn’t mean value for money, or doesn’t always buy votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical British behaviour sell-off or break up anything that looks like success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well yes but everyone else is aiming to converge standards. Our avowed policy seems to be diverge even if there is no earthly reason why we would. #madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TransportStrategy Johnson pledges £5bn for HS2 replacement bus services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope springs eternal, but as they say in Galaxy Quest, never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really news though is it? Brexit has been a flawed proposition from the start. Johnson was, is, and always will be a buffoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gove doesn’t guve a shit. He has a job and doesn’t export anything anywhere. He isn’t very honest or bright either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Johnson and Gove campaigned for frictionless trade? Another lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t that be “unprincipled”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m upset that so many of my fellow countrymen were seduced by a handful of catchy but empty slogans propping up a flawed proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people have lived here most of their life then they deserve to stay. Exactly how mean spirited are we as a country? Just cos Johnson got rejected by Belgium and the USA no need for revenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“A rose by any other name would smell as sweet” or in this case a turd is a turd is a turd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, he wasn’t an asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you work on the basis that the referendum result gave 37% in favour of Leave and the GE gave less than that in favour of Johnson. We are suffering acute “tail wagging dog” syndrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And none of them will be as good as the EU ones. Size matters in trade talks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson doesn’t answer because he’s forgotten who gave him his job and who pays his salary.  He’s also forgotten to publish the Russia report on electoral interference. All too soon we’ll forget he was ever PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical British government approach to handling successful U.K. enterprises.  Flog it off to foreign owners or smash it up. They know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big plus one for recycling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit is a flawed proposition. When it fails Johnson will drop taxes, slash spending, reluctantly start charging for healthcare, because his priority is to keep safe money in tax havens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Producers employ consumers. Consumers invest in producers. Producers make stuff and create value.  Pretty important to look after producers because if they fail we’re all stuffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blurble flurble spurble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not inclined to take any advice from someone who can’t control his own hair. #Johnsonflop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes where is the RussiaReport? Forgive me for not believing the PMs assurances on this matter. Most of what he says turns out to be false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry it will go higher as Johnson buys votes in the North, and lowers taxes for his mates. But hey it’ll be our kids who have to settle up so chill out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gove wouldn’t commit to which way “up” is unless he’d been there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never trust a man who doesn’t know what a comb is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They might be ashamed of their products but we’re not.  Anyway we’ll be able to tell by the spelling mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to see an unrelated version of the report into Russian interference in our electoral process. You have assured us there is nothing to worry about, but to be frank your word is less than reliable. #peoplesPMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical British behaviour sell-off or break up anything that looks like success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical British behaviour sell-off or break up anything that looks like success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but enough people fell for it last time.  Why change a winning formula.  I’m guessing they’ll stick with this shit until the economy is gone to pot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Foreign Secretary Dominic #Raab advises Britons to avoid travelling to Blackgang Chine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Destroy the state, deregulation, low taxes.  Brexit is the car crash that enables all of these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And none of his mates spot the error despite Richard being a famous actor, and dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The odd mis-speak is forgivable, but Raab delivers one every time he opens his mouth.  And let’s face it some of them are absolute howlers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My goodness he does speak some tripe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I start with the premise that anything promised by Raab, Gove, Johnson et al is a lie. That way I am yet to be disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely correct, he doesn’t think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would give frictionless trade to our biggest market, plus a strong input to the market rules. Outside looks like incurring huge administrative costs left right and centre.  More red tape not less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you mean “know it’s a mistake”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this extra bureaucracy, cost, and aggravation.  Where is the up side? Please explain without using any of these terms: Taking back control. Will of the people. Global outlook/opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that the government you need to support PR will be elected by FPTP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Newspaper owners have wealth in tax havens and the people are gullible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the current lot had been in power in 1939 they’d have sat on their arses and not saved europe from fascism. They are a monumental disgrace to this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’ll come back to bite him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m embarrassed every time Francois appears on Radio or TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe #TidalPower will be the most important renewable energy for the UK in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He won’t.  But he’ll put every effort into finding some-one to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn’t even achieve very little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the lines of “in my hand I have a piece of paper....” poor old Johnson what an epithet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to come down to Catworth Village Hall for our open day 10-4 today. See what we bring to your party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be perfectly frank if there was a Cakeist Party I’d vote for them.  As long as I could carry on voting for my regular party as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we can all do is believe. As they say faith can move mountains.  But frankly Brexit flies in the face of all analysis, historical trends, and economic sense. We can only hope our economy survives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something happened to Johnson when he lived in Brussels, and if we only knew what it was, we might understand his peculiar attitude towards European cooperation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You cannot believe a word he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The man’s a born liar. We know this. We should therefore treat anything he says as false untilproven otherwise. (Note this has yet to happen)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that’s who Julia Hartley-Brewer is. I don’t know who came across as being most ill informed, her or “monthly benefits cheques” IDS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You really should have seen that coming and got your client to take the necessary steps to secure your continued employment.  On the other hand think of all the opportunities Brexit hasn’t opened up for you in China, the US, Russia and elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three and a half years later and no-one has any idea at all how to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.  Brexit is one ugly sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be happy for the bell to toll funerealy in remembrance of everything we’ve lost. (Should be “thrown away”)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The world was our oyster when we had a navy and no-one else did, and we were able to bully and exploit where-ever we landed.  The phrase once bitten twice shy best describes the world view of us now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand if they tolled a bell as they do at funerals........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were setting the rules in case you hadn’t noticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will hardly make any sense.  We must rely on a leak.  So much for open government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously. If you sell barrier free to a market of 450 million and more through free trade deals, you are likely to want to preserve that rather than risk it staying put and trusting in blind faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are tolling the bell to mark our self inflicted wrecking of our economy (lost £200bn since June 2016) then fine.  But I see absolutely nothing to celebrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we’re not in, we’ll have no input to that reform, which is a shame.  And we’ll pay for it later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was only 37% of those eligible to vote which excluded many of those most affected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you mean hospitals or nurses or policemen or potholes. Instead it was pooled with our neighbours to create and sustain the largest single market free trade, free movement area which benefits every corner of our country manyfold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit will collapse under the weight of its inherent contradictions. Either that or we’ll become a vassal state of the US without a shot being fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignorance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry didn’t realise you are a physiotherapist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll all lose because of Brexit unless you have funds in tax havens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit is all part of the plan, reduced tax receipts mean less money to spend. Then faux wringing of hands what choice do we have, we’ll have to pay for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will have no sympathy for you when you next struggle to book a physiotherapy appointment or can’t get to see your GP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Raab is such a lightweight he has to have steel inserts in his shoes to stop him just floating away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh? So that’s good, is it? Brexit will be the final death throes of empire that I thought our membership of the EU had skilfully avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sustain Brexit this government will always require a minority to blame. Immigrants, foreigners and communities identified by the way they live are easy targets. Don’t sit back, you could be next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The countries we bullied and exploited during empire won’t fall for that a second time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn’t have anything of substance to say on anything. A bit of an intellectual strategy vacuum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But all credit to her for cycling all the way to Australia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like “take back control of our borders, laws and money.” None of which we ever lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About his appearance? Or about our economy, jobs, NHS, pensions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings is a grubby little anarchist. Completely unable to build anything positive, or argue the merits of a case without resorting to deceit and deception. Only good for slogan writing. Must be a reason he isn’t in advertising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Governments pass poorly worded acts of Parliament that the courts then have to interpret and enact. The courts save government from itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit was driven by our collective guilty conscience for winning two world wars. We will soon learn what it’s like to be a loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to point out Goves “we’ve had enough from experts” denigrates us all as we are each an expert in something. Plumbing, painting, driving, nursing........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is #Johnson ‘s obsession with bridges? Could the Stranraer one be abridge too far for him?  He hardly has a good track record on bridges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because to get PR requires government support and governments are voted in on FPTP! Catch 22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Laura needs to understand that democracy does not require all views to be subjugated to those of the government otherwise we would have no need of her majesties opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither of them give a toss about our higher animal welfare standards, or drivingour chicken readers out of business, or torching our largest export market for goods and services. #barmyBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The “I was only obeying orders” defence never works. And won’t work this time either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Mark Francois really the best we can do? Are our politicians those that can’t do, those that can’t teach, can’t doctor, can’t act, can’t think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complacency lost the Brexit referendum. Brexit will prove to be a disaster it’s just a question of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scrap the back ground music and the waffle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just need to wait a year for Johnson’s Brexit to be revealed for the economy denting, job-losing, NHS wrecking joke it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PR relies on the party of government to push it through. The party of government is elected by FPTP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Err most of those leaving are either retiring or going to another hospital/nursing role. How old do you expect nurses to work to Matt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly there is no test or examination to determine whether MP’s /ministers are competent or have any notion of common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He should know. It was a cardinal error to invade Iraq 12 years after the right time, based on lies and deceits. Brexit likewise will be the undoing of those who had their fingerprints all over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Build more fjords?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender. I’m not sure why on earth I should roll over and submit to a measure (Brexit) that will take away my rights, impoverish me, and the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buried amongst renationalisation and reducing rail season tickets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly the gullible people believe Brexit is a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not when you say the average family will save £6,000 a year, relying on two annual rail season ticket holders plus two kids under 5!  Doesn’t sound right, and isn’t. Over-egged or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK but without it, it doesn’t happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like saying if you don’t do the deal that we demand you’ll lose a finger.  Whilst we would lose a leg. #barmyBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably true. GB stands for Gullible Bigots. GBD isn’t get Brexit done but Gullible Bigots Duped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A weak one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First rule of negotiation. Don’t box yourself into a corner. #barmyBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost track of what you want to get free from? Boris, Brexit the U.K. or the EU? Not sure where your lambs going by the way? #barmyBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we’ll be desperate by then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s if there’s anything left of it after Johnson has made further cuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And bearing in mind Leave got 52% in 2016 but only managed 47% yesterday it seems the enthusiasm for leave is waning.  I plan to wait until the Leavers discover for themselves that Brexit is a crock of shit. Then there will be a reckoning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear oh dear, you still don’t get it? He’s an inveterate liar.  That report will be eaten by his dog, that’s what it was there for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or alternatively just keep their nose clean and wait.  Brexit is still a flawed proposition, as Johnson will inevitably find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst it is in parties general self interest to have a PR system, to enact the legislation requires the support of a government elected by FPTP. So don’t wait up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t happen to nicer people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or even let’s kick Johnson off the pitch. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Piers really doesn’t like is amateur political opinionists making a better fist of it and proving more popular than he is! #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither do we know what regulations #Johnson has in mind tontear up.  Bet you a penny to a £ it’ll be our hard won workers rights, sick pay, maternity pay etc. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The depths this lightweight will go to! Getting his dog to vote in place of his girlfriend. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farage has that same smirk #Johnson has when he just answers a question with an unsubstantiated slur against Labour or LibDem candidates. Neither Farage or Johnson add anything to our political climate  #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is vindictive. He doesn’t do detail. He can’t take criticism. He’s a habitual liar. He has an appalling record with women. He has an arrogance towards racism. He is a snob of the first order unable to feel the lot of the common man. #binJohnson not PM material.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, about the sum of it. But it’s not that things won’t get any better for fifty years, it’ll get worse first. #Brexit is a monumental mistake. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And during that fifty years he and his clients will be keeping their money safe in a tax haven.  You can’t do that. You’ll have to work harder and pay more to compensate. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man’s a dick. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastMidRailway disgraceful three trainloads of passengers crammed like sardines into one train Leicester Kettering.  My wife sat in corridor, no seats! Should br more than money back compensation! #comebackEMT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course we are. Cheats never prosper and #Johnson is head liar of a team without honesty, honour, or integrity. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastMidRailway stranding passengers for Kettering at Leicester. 45 minutes waiting for a service in foul weather while fast trains fly by! No way to run a service! Bring back #EMT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’re all descended from immigrants, some like #Johnson Javid and Patel, more recently than others. We have always welcomed people to this country, Johnson’s comment is an assault on our values. Is he truly British? #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually the flaw at the heart of the referendum is that Brexit is logically inconsistent and a false proposition. Its support fuelled by resentment at austerity, and some brilliant but totally meaningless slogans. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson s party starved the NHS. Johnson deceived everyone over Brexit. Just look at his record, he doesn’t care about us and he is responsible for the last 18 months paralysis. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t vote for #Johnson, it’ll cost you your job, pension, healthcare and freedom to move freely in your neighbouring countries. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson doesn’t want his rich chums to chip in to provide healthcare. His party have starved the NHS over 9 years, and his #Brexit has lost thousands of young taxpaying health workers from the EU. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or to paraphrase “This man is dangerous” #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Brexit Done @BBCr4today overlooks that Brexit is a flawed proposition, the referendum won on deceits. A weaker economy cannot sustain the wild spending pledges to fix things broken by the Conservatives. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender! #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then don’t vote Conservative. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No honesty, honour or integrity. Come Thursday don’t care who you vote for but please #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone in this country is descended from an immigrant. There is no such thing as a native Briton. Just degrees of settlement. It is disgusting that #Johnson takes this line, does it include Patel, Javid, and Cleverly? #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The man is a nincompoop. We need fruit pickers, nurses, doctors, builders, care workers, we’ve enough first violinists and prima ballerinas.  He’s a complete twonk! #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse, over their 9 years they have reduced funding to the NHS. Not in real terms but by making any increase far far less than the service requires to meet demand.  A cynic would say deliberately underfunded. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 37% of those entitled to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be far more helpful to do that immediately. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you please delete any of my data before you send to Amazon. Until they pay their way tax-wise I’ll not have anything to do with them. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And everyone agrees #Johnson that any kind of #Brexit will dent the economy and weaken tax receipts so you are talking “bollocks” again. If only funds in tax havens were taxed eh? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Gove EU nationals who’ve made their home here, paid taxes here for years, have married Brits and may well work in the NHS don’t get a vote? #votefixer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since it’s always nett migration that’s quoted, its almost certain to go down if #Johnson gets in. Increased numbers fleeing the mess he’ll create. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Party that gave us ten years of austerity wants us to believe they’ll invest in public services whilst pursuing #Brexit that they’ve lied about from the off which will shrink the economy and reduce the taxes needed to pay for police and nurses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can choose to vote for some-one who will unseat him and his mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You clearly are stuck in the 1940’s seeing other european countries as enemies rather than the friends and neighbours we have more in common with than Russia, China, or the USA. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. The biggest lie was that the EU was responsible for all the failings of our own Westminster government; insufficient housebuilding; poor Social Care; austerity and public sector cuts; underfunding the NHS. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove on @BBCr4today a string of absolute falsehoods and contradictions. One would like to think that your audience has sufficient knowledge and wisdom to see through this garbage. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove on @bbcr4today so exactly how long do you have to live here; how much in taxes do you need to pay; how many homes; how many wives/husbands? In order to be entitled to vote? #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#gove on @BBCr4today can’t believe that he’s trying to lie that Conservatives are the custodians of the NHS. His government has mercilessly squeezed funding, is cutting off the supply of EU staff! #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Djanogly “I feel it necessary to take a stand against the lies and deceit which have begun to pervade our political discourse, such underhanded tactics drastically reduce the common ground on which reasoned, factual debates can take place” yet he supports #Johnson?  https://t.co/cXZczp9bgk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These arrogant tossers brag about re-opening May’s trade deal when others said it couldn’t be done.  You reopened it by making it a U.K. dividing turd of a deal.  That wasn’t clever, it was stupid. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Javid apparently unaware Conservatives have been at the helm since 2010. Also unable to work out whether one number is higher than another. Unfit to be Chancellor. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson campaigning in own seat more likely to remind voters what a complete liability he is. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apart from exactly where he’s going to find all these professionals, any kind of Brexit will shrink the tax revenue and render them unaffordable. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s just get rid of this liar on the 12th December. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#binJohnson #binBrexit only way to get beyond the last three years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good speech, well delivered, but he’s too up the arses of the rich tax evading right wing press not to see the irony that economic unity is just as important as military unity. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still more lies from #Johnson and No10. Why are we surprised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I externalise the problem by laying the faults at the door of the party that has been in government for the last 10 years, and whose wealthy backers don’t care about this country. If they did they wouldn’t avoid paying taxes. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People of Dudley, voting leave will increase the need for food banks, will reduce the funds and staff available for the NHS, and won’t enable the government to deliver any of its promises. You can change your mind about the “Leave” thing. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just donated to the @LibDems general election fund to stop an economy wrecking Brexit - can you too? Give here:  https://t.co/mAeonaOsQU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Get Brexit done” @BBCr4today is akin to telling the man on the bridge that you just want to get it over with so jump. It ignores that we can talk him down and nurture him to live, rather than the police incident, inquest, funeral, grieving, loss. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure I trust a party #Javid on @BBCr4today that wants to put more resources into health and more policemen, when they are the ones who starved the NHS and culled the police service. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What #Javid and his cronies miss @BBCr4today is that most trade deals are forged based on moving closer together. This shower are negotiating a deal based on moving further apart. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcr4today #Javid completely contentless drivel. Most trade deals forged on bringing standards closer together, not what the Conservatives are trying to do which is move them apart. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No they won’t because a smaller post-Brexit economy mired in years of endless negotiations and with lower tax receipts won’t be able to afford any of the wild promises made by #Johnson. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, wouldn’t that make living in Manhattan, London, Amsterdam, Rome, Venice, Shanghai, Stockholm and many other coastal cities a little difficult?  Wouldn’t millions of people, 10 s of millions be affected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson unable to string a coherent sentence together. Any Brexit dents the economy and shrinks tax revenue making all his promises unaffordable. NHS wouldn’t need so much if he hadn’t starved it over ten years. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson reveals himself to be woefully out of touch with life as lived in this country, adrift with respect to the aspirations of women, and wrong on just about everything else. Where he scores hands down is on deceit, dissembling, and dodging the question. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has a Prime Minister ever been more out of touch with the people? #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock! #johnson an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson doesn’t do detail, or logic, or common sense.  What he does is deceit, dissembling, and question dodging. Vote the bugger out next week. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s #Johnson well and truly stuffed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Could have been a breach of the law”?   Is a breach of the law. What’s the penalty for receiving stolen goods? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry. Any sort of #Brexit will dent the economy so badly there won’t be any money to spend on all or any of these wild promises. #Johnson knows this, he wants more austerity, cuts, and tax breaks for the rich. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both equally bad for our economy and our NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’ll just say we chose Brexit in June 2016 and he’s just doing what we asked. Johnson will always deceive, dissemble and dodge. Totally without honesty, honour or integrity. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson will dissemble, deceive and dodge the question right to the end. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing you can be sure of, Johnson will deceive, dissemble and dodge the question. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remain. Never give up never surrender. Vote tactically to #binJohnson and #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please give this lightweight chancer the boot next Thursday. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All Johnson is good at is deceives, dissembles and dodges the question. #binJohnson #bibBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch! It’s all Johnson is good at. Deceive, dissemble and dodge the question. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Content free, evidence free, glib, slogan based froth and candy floss. This man could deliver a good speech, but so far has only delivered waffle. His judgement is flawed and he’s too happy to deceive, dissemble and dodge. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking opponents never plays well. Campaign on the strengths of your own arguments, this will always show up the frailty of your opponents position. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trouble is #Johnson has lied about every other aspect of #Brexit and we don’t believe anything his cabal says. Plus #Hunt has form for promoting a private funded NHS. #bibBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many good politicians were crowding him out of top jobs and to be frank it’s not such a good slogan. So the fact free, detail absent, deceitful #Johnson has used his oratory talent to trash the country in order to get into No 10. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what is the carbon footprint of this vehicle? Would seem to be the responsible pitch surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where statesman #ChrisPatten s arguement fails is that #Johnson s government is proven not to be sensible, or thinking about the future. ( at least not in any grounded logical way) #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only marred by the tattoos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good memory is a handicap to responsible government it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson’s video is entirely free of fact, detail, or specifics and makes sweeping groundless assertions.  This man is unsuitable for any office, never mind high office. Passion is about it’s only positive once you’ve got rid of the froth and candy-floss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aha so basically #Raab will not stand by anything he wrote or said earlier, and/or is unable to explain adequately any transition from his early ideas to his current position. Verdict? #untrustworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn’t need to buy the NHS, to increase the cost of drugs, or to sell us compulsory health insurance when our government pleads poverty and inability to fund NHS from smaller post-Brexit economy. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hunt on @BBCr4today oh the irony 2. Asserts loss of jobs under Corbyn’s stewardship would adversely affect the tax base putting the NHS at risk. Brexit does exactly that and also cuts off supply of staff. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hunt on @BBCr4today oh the irony. Suggested the UK’s role in NATO is to tie Europe and the US together and act as a bridge, and Corbyn anti US. Yet Johnson’s Brexit unties us from Europe! #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very best of luck to get shot of IDS. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it me or has Rees-Mogg changed the Conservative royal blue to a more Brexit company limited light blue?  Rees-Mogg remembers the stones being planted and wants to condemn us to living standards last enjoyed 3 millennia ago. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today The man (Johnson) at the NATO anniversary appealing for unity, is the same one taking a wrecking ball to our relationship with our closest neighbours. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>General consensus is post-Brexit economy will be smaller, therefore unable to afford all these wild promises. Need to #binBrexit as a first step.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I note he very smugly fails to spell it himself.  Denies us an educative moment he feels able to deliver.  Remains resolute in maintaining what he sees as a cultural gulf between the Pinocchio spellers and the rest. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ice sculpture told far fewer lies than either Johnson, Johnson or Gove. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>700 million would seem eminently achievable on that basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh well that’s all right then. The Conservative candidate for PM isn’t a serial liar after all, he’s just an error prone, mistake strewn, liability. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The very sad thing is that he thinks it’s funny rather than demonstrating how wildly out of touch he is. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I estimate we could probably supply 10% of them from the sycamore seedlings that proliferate from our neighbours tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very strange that he’s complaining about being replaced with an ice sculpture. Presumably the ice wasn’t such a good liar. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear. Let’s hope through the ballot box we can serve a lesson to these smug, privileged, elitist, snobs. They really don’t care one jot about the common man. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All power to your elbow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must be gutting for you, but if you recall you knifed Boris in the back first time round, then lost this year.  So you aren’t “leader”. And if your leader (Johnson) can’t be arsed to prioritise the climate then you’ve lost my vote. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony is of course that without #Brexit there would be no need for government to intervene to support business as it (business) would be able to trade freely within the single market and customs union. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New original drama HEROD #StLeonardsCatworth PE28 0PA tonight and tomorrow. Doors open 7.30pm £6.50  Critic says- “Impressed with the play, which really held my attention, especially in the second half.   Your audiences should get good value!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is Priti, the brightest and best aren’t in the Conservative party.  And they’ll run a mile before coming to such an insular and small minded little island. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The look says “you have absolutely no idea what we do, do you? I think you’re as out of touch as you can get. Can’t imagine why you bothered to tuck your tie in.” #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh tricky. Remaining. Brexit renders any otherambition unaffordable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democracy gives equal weight to one man’s ignorance and prejudice as the next man’s knowledge and wisdom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s because the chances of lying their way to a second Leave vote are vanishingly small.  But the threshold for power in an election is only 30 odd percent.  #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointed Govey and Rees-Mogg don’t make the cut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please God don’t enable Raab.  Everything he touches turns to dust. Most of what he says is wrong. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes dreadful. Not sure how you deduce “democracy hating” and hardly on a par with the damage your party has inflicted on us over 9 long years of austerity. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#johnson was lying again. Haven’t you cottonned on yet? He couldn’t tell the truth if his life depended on it. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson lying, hardly a headline is it? If you assume that anything a Conservative candidate says is a lie you’ll rarely make a mistake. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might also shout “Johnson, you are deceitful, dishonest, and lack any integrity” or “Johnson, which Russian’s pocket are you in?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fine if we give everyone an identity card like most other countries have. Making voting contingent on having a passport (non-compulsory) or a driving license (optional) is just wrong. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK @bbcr4today you get a Conservative Minister who has achieved little, totally lacks integrity or honesty #Gove to comment on the views of a high achieving statesman of great stature. #Hesseltine Get a grip BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that decides it then. If Johson doesn’t realise the depth of the climate crisis we are facing he isn’t the right man for PM. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re trade deal with the EU, yes, we are starting from alignment. But #Johnson wants to diverge. Every other country is trying to converge, I think we’ll not get a better deal than the one we enjoy now, warts and all. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2016 referendum was a vote against something and a vote for nothing. The campaign was bestrewn with lies and deceits peddled by an ex resident of Brussels with a grudge and a grubby little anarchist seeking to destroy our country. There is no mandate for this. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the Conservatives won’t have any statesmen left after this election. They are political minnows who can only survive by deceit and duplicity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a government can’t campaign on it’s own record, then it doesn’t deserve to stay in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should Not be destroyed. A fifty pence piece is a fifty pence piece. If the text on it embarrasses the Conservative Party and #AlexanderJohnson then they should buy them up and destroy them at their expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But they are petty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson is frit he’ll make gaffs if he’s in front of the cameras!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are looking up.  It appears that a country’s leader (Netanyahu) who presides over three years of paralysis can be indicted for breach of trust. Is it our turn next? #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the only thing they failed miserably at. They don’t deserve another go, they deserve to go, and as far away as possible. Please. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also why should I fund some-ones social care in full if they have wealth, some of which they could use towards it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What does CCHQ stand for please?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What does CCHQ stand for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @BBCNewsnight LibDem revoke A50 stance is not cutting out 50% of the electorate.  The 2016 referendum Leave vote was 37% of the electorate. Get it right please. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t give a toss about #DominicRaab or the nonsense that #Johnson says about #Brexit stopping him as PM investing in the NHS. His party have had 9 years starving the NHS. I don’t trust him with it. #binJohnson #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unseating Johnson, Raab, Gove, and returning a pro #binBrexit parliament would be best early Christmas present ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would politely enquire what sort of “divergence” Mr #Johnson has in mind. Weakening workers rights? Reducing safety standards? Ditching environmental regulations? Stopping climate change measures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that #DominicRaab is just parroting a load of drivel. The consensus is that Brexit makes the economy smaller. Therefore tax revenues down. Therefore promises all unaffordable. #Idonttrusthim @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven’t the powers that be realised that we have to do everything we can to replace fossil fuels with renewables?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you saying that you are being critical of deceit?  If so, well done, keep it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you vote yourself a serial liar as leader it becomes open season for deceit. Our response should be to take our votes away until they can be trusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit renders all the other extravagant promises unaffordable. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you do not want Brexit, do not vote for Brexit parties.  All the promises made for future expenditure will be unaffordable with a smaller economy from Brexit. Never give up never surrender. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Corbyn didn’t win it either. Looks like Swindon’s call to stay out of it was a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised anyone is trusting a party led by a serial liar unable to tell the truth. Years of austerity have weakened public services. The general consensus is the economy will be dented by Brexit. All their promises are works of fiction. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If our Prime Minister is telling bare-faced lies (which he is) there is no trust in British politics and the BBC needs to be calling him out. Failure to do so undermines trust in the BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very strange when Brexit itself will deliver a smaller economy less able to support the NHS, schools, social care, pensions, transport etc etc etc...#binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? After this Brexit fiasco I doubt there’ll be much of our reputation left to decimate. Oh and well done #Hunt for trashing the NHS for us. #binBrexit #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The city #Johnson ran was so broken he had to open food banks.  Be interesting to know how much he personally donates to food banks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given #Johnson’s track record of unfamiliarity with the truth, he must realise no-one will believe him until the report is published. #binJohnson #binBrexit @SNAH4PV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m quite keen on voting thank you Ruth. Oh and leaving the EU is the dumbest strategy ever devised and if the Conservative party haven’t noticed the damage Brexit has done since 2016 then they don’t deserve our votes. #binBrexit @SNAH4PV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No-one respects some-one in authority who can’t be arsed to comb his own hair, and has yet to speak a true word. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some-one should tell him: it’s rude to point; 17.4 is not the lion’s share of 65; quoting a serial liar doesn’t strengthen an argument; MP’s vote as they see fit, not slavishly follow our mad ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me a pedant but all 65million were lied to. #binJohnson and #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for him. Didn’t he promise to lie in front of the bulldozers to stop Heathrow third runway? Well, he got the “lie” bit right. #binBrexit and #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The larger party always calls the shots and sets the tone in trade talks. That’s why we benefit so enormously from our EU membership. It’s the largest single market that everyone wants to trade with. Except Johnson apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new second verse goes something like: The lies on the bus go on and on, On and on, on and on. The lies on the bus go on and on  And were told by you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson takes troops away from helping with floods. If he’d lain down as part of the flood barrier then that would have been useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny, I thought Dinosaurs had more teeth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May had a majority but gambled it away. She then got a deal that Johnson and ERG blocked for months causing paralysis. Record NHS funding only because record cuts. 20,000 new police to replace 21,000 experienced ones sacked. #binJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using #Johnson’s logic, rather than seek remedy for our ailments later in life we should just get dying done and cut out any delay and prevarication. His underfunding of the NHS should make this easier. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today bit rich #Gove accusing a potential Corbyn government of further paralysis, when Gove and Johnson have imposed nearly four years of paralysis all on their own. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really can’t take #MichaelGove seriously on @BBCr4today when he extols the virtues of #Johnson the man he skilfully knifed in the back in 2017. The deal secured is worse than the one May had, in turn worse than membership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today continues to allow Brexit oxymorons to go unchallenged. Just now heard “credible Brexit” last week was “workable Brexit”. Brexit is an economy shrinking, job destroying, influence sapping nonsense. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit is easily by far worse than Jeremy Corbyn.  If for no other reason than JC is for one term. Getting back into the EU will be necessary and time consuming. Meanwhile our economy suffers. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These idiots have no idea what they are agreeing to, no sense of business, no sense of what benefits to trade the single market brings. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem with Conservatives is they fail to value jobs with lower social cache. There are few ”truly unskilled” jobs.  It requires great skill and concentration to perform repetitive unrewarding tasks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so open to challenge surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah I’d like the same deal NI has please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put a paintbrush in his hand and he’ll get that wall painted in no time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit is more like something forked by a prick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What #Johnson negotiated was a worse deal than #May. Takes skill to do something so stupid. Throwing the U.K. on the bonfire of an economy denting Brexit.  #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trouble with #Johnson is Brexit would have been done years ago if his ERG chums hadn’t kept voting down May’s deal. If we’re looking for dither and delay look no further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only three?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What #MattHancock and Johnson can’t explain is how a £70bn smaller economy can afford any of the amazing spending they’re announcing. Oh apparently we can only afford it with a strong economy. Spot the problem anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today #MattHancock “many people said it was impossible to get a new deal from the EU”.  Johnson succeeded in getting a worse deal than May. A new definition of success. The best deal is the one we already have, EU membership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone still believing a word that Goveynor Johnson and their government say is seriously out of touch. #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But only if you #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll pay for it next year if we return this hopelessly inept shower. Vote wisely, vote to evict this government, vote to #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is absolutely why we must #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You make avfundamental error if you trust Johnson or his government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote out the conservatives to #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MattHancock really doesn’t inspire confidence. Best wat to save the NHS is to #ditchBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who bodged the refurb and clad the building in flammable material; those who stopped the fire service inspecting buildings, both get free passes. Fire service castigated for not guessing the best strategy in a completely new situation. Shameful verdict.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He can’t use industry because he said “f*** Business” and most business knows that EU membership makes sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He’s a liar, full stop. A news story would be Johnson telling the truth. Don’t wait up. Problem is everyone knows you can’t trust him, so the chances of this fraud getting any advantageous trade deals is zero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Straight from the Brexit Party ltd MEP handbook.  These people aren’t fit to sit in parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t believe it #IDS on @BBCr4today justified his position with the words “the honest truth”.  If we’ve learnt one thing in the last three and a half years it’s that Brexit promoters wouldn’t know the truth if it dropped on them from a great height.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the reason is the LibDem, Labour and SNP MEPs are busy in Brussels whereas the Brexit Party Ltd MEPs do sweet Fanny Adams for their salary and spend most of their time at home,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our unwritten constitution worked when the people using it were honest, honourable, and had integrity. Our current government has none of those hence why we are struggling. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wasn’t what we wanted. That is one of the many lies of Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line, Johnson doesn’t give a shit if it’s more complicated and costly for us to live, trade or work in the EU. He’s never going to be able to. His qualification isn’t recognised. He’s a lying turd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biggest flaw at the root of #Brexit is that a country can pootle along without treaties, and if does actually have to have one it can completely dictate the terms. #fantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In summary, some might, but an awful lot will definitely be more costly. Wow #Brexit, another broken promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #JuliaHartleyBrewer clinically thick or just incredibly dense? We are in a sovereign democracy where our politicians are accountable to us and at the same time a member of the EU. A situation that powered us to the 5th largest world economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is actually very depressing and drives a coach and horses through the insurance business, business planning, and treasury forecasts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only conclusion to draw from tonight’s #QuestionTime audience is if the general population has the same level of ignorance then we’re probably doomed. Same applies to #HartleyBrewer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoops John. There aren’t that many voters.  Explain how we’re being swindled?  Since the referendum vote in 2016 our economy has been faring badly which suggests its Brexit that needs to be avoided. Wise up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Universal credit, making a simpler process for claiming benefits and bringing them together seems like a good idea. What needs fixing is make payments weekly and reduce delay to just one week. How difficult is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure only 37% of those eligible to vote get to dump on the other 63%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don’t know why we’re pandering to just 37% of the electorate.  Especially when the outcome is bad for the economy, jobs, and the £.

<|startoftext|>Challenging the highest court in the land by asserting they’re wrong is not acceptable, and by a Prime Minister is inexcusable. Whatever happened to the law against sedition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the saying goes “sticks and stones may break my bones but words shall never harm me” Except when Johnson is inflaming leavers to pick up sticks. Should resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How to spell it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liberal_Leigh Makes me very cross indeed that Johnson, Rees-Mogg, Leadsom and Daily Mail think it is OK to impugn a unanimous decision of our highest court. And seemingly get away with it. Whatever happened to sedition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jacob Rees-Mogg by impugning the integrity of the Supreme Court and their unanimous ruling that endorsed the primacy of parliament is committing sedition. Such behaviour is very very bizarre for the Leader of the House. He should resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impugning the Supreme Court for unanimously ruling on the supremacy of the sovereign parliament probably counts as sedition. Johnson, Gove, Leadsom, Raab and Rees-Mogg must not escape justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To impugn the members of the Supreme Court for unanimously ruling that Parliament is Sovereign is a hairs breadth away from sedition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To impugn the members of the Supreme Court for unanimously adjudicating that Parliament is sovereign is a hairs breadth away from sedition.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Can we do that? How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today if I were you #Gove I wouldn’t bet too strongly on the honesty of the Prime Minister.  I seem to remember it wasn’t that long ago that you stabbed Johnson squarely in the back as unsuitable to be Prime Minister, or are you a liar too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gove on @BBCr4today interestingly once the highest court rules, the opinions and views of the lower courts and others are of nought. Gove’s continuing innuendo regarding the #SupremeCourt decision is shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting coup #JacobReesMogg that reinforces the primacy of parliament. Please respect the #SupremeCourt, your quibbling about it undermines the judiciary which is inexcusable especially for some-one in your position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson’s lack of respect for the court, exemplified by his statement “I don’t agree with them” is shameful for a Prime Minister.  Such comments undermine the judiciary.  Johnson’s view does not beat 11 #SupremeCourt Judges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClaireFox read the Supreme Court judgement, I think you’ll find they reinforced the primacy of parliament.  This is not a “power grab” by the judiciary. Your lack of respect to the court is shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this guy going on about?  It sounds like grade A drivel of the first order. Pure gold bunkum and waffle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our parliamentary system was broken when our politicians Johnson and Gove amongst others waved goodbye to honesty, honour, and integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suggest you read the judgement. The Supreme Court has reinforced the cornerstone of our parliamentary system; the Sovereignty of Parliament that Johnson was hacking away at wiyh a pickaxe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For a Government always banging on about getting rid of red tape, Brexit is a monumental own goal.  All this extra faff and palaver will add cost onto everything and take money and resources from productive jobs. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Johnson, Gove, Rees-Mogg, Davis, IDS, Redwood, Raab, Javid, Leadsom, Patel, are political minnows. Devoid of honesty, honour, and integrity they want to trash 40 years hard graft for their own personal gain. At our expense. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because Brexit is a flawed proposition which is why most countries want to be in the EU. Out of the EU we will be at a 45 year disadvantage to all those who have always been out and know how out works.

<|startoftext|>You couldn’t make it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight when politicians abandon honesty, honour, and integrity then our system of government suffers accordingly. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once politicians discard honesty, honour, and integrity our whole political structure risks catastrophic failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris (aka Alexander) Johnson is a serial liar.  If anyone has footage of him telling the truth now that would be news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson made promises in 2016 about Brexit, they were all shit.  Brexit reduces the economy and tax revenue.  Where is extra money coming from?  There is no Brexit dividend.  Johnson+Javid plan to borrow it, increases UK debt that our children/grandchildren will have to repay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock for Tim here, remainers and the elite wouldn’t be seen dead in a Weatherspoons. They wouldn’t want to put a penny in his pocket. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today you need a robust Speaker of the House of Commons when the government lacks honesty, integrity, and honour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst element of Brexit is that it’s revealed how wilfully ignorant a significant chunk of our population is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably find the votes from yhosecwho didn’t bother to vote ladt time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martin Daubney is a disgrace if he incites people to question the judgement of judges. To do so is a direct challenge to our assertion that the rule of law is important to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best place to go. Thoroughly recommend all of their therapists are top notch. First port of call after injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn’t he “doc” Emmett Brown in Back to the future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure which I trust less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Drab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will thank him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is that gesture supposed to mean? It looks as though he’s 3 sandwiches shortbof a picnic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two seperate things true. But to be frank Brexit is a catastrophe in all its incarnations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh @MattHancock “shaped by those within it”?  Sounds good but worth nothing if it means 37% of the country get to csll the shots baded on deceit, lies, fraud and foreign interference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sack IDS who is threatening to steal 9 years of pension entitlement from each and every one of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest self induced crisis and you face it without parliament. A more serious PM would have scrapped the conferences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to summarise, we think you’re mad to leave with a deal, and insane to leave without one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson (aka Alexander) has tabled a Government motion to rearrange the letters of United Kingdom to Untied Kingdom in anticipation of Brexit, the subsequent independence of Scotland and the reunification of Ireland. @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t care what colour my EU passport is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been at #BurghleyHorseTrials all day. Who’s resigned/quit/been sacked from the cabinet/conservative party today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great speech. But when the £ rises as the government loses a vote on Brexit tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, Conservative MP’s are sacked and quit the whip daily, you have to score it as E for epic fail. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndreaLeadsom the one whose brother runs an overseas investment fund in a tax haven, didn’t her husband work for him? #Brexit will ensure her family continue to avoid tax. The tax that funds your healthcare. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Boris, if you went down the pub with them they wouldn’t laugh at your Latin quips but would giggle at your schoolboy humour and cheer your letterbox racism.  The rest of us say REVOKE and RESIGN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Referendum was a huge protest vote on years of austerity. Has been hijacked by right wing who want to roll back postwar settlement; NHS, welfare; public spending; state pensions. They don’t want to help you. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might it actually be because the book was panned by the critics? Why not send a lounging cardboard cut out?  Anyone daft enough to have bought a ticket won’t notice the stand in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinesia tape. K-Laser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tells you all you need to know about Johnson’s unsuitability for his current role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democracy treats the ignorance and prejudice of one man as equal to another’s knowledge and wisdom. (Sadly). The system only works if politicians act with honesty, honour and integrity. It is this last point that has been our undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You choose to rabble rouse for the 37% and falling who think Leave is a good idea.  Don’t be surprised if you meet resistance from the 63% and growing who don’t like being lied too and deceived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be frank I’m surprised you we’re asked on the first time. Your contribution to the debate was zero.  “Referendum every day”?  My cat has more sense than you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree, the people voted in 2016 and now need the opportunity to change their minds or be fully complicit in a job destroying, economy shrivelling, national catastrophe. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson it is a disgrace that he has wilfully failed to apologise for comparing Muslim women to letterboxes - Sign the Petition!  https://t.co/jFz7lIVnpq via @UKChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ReesMogg should resign.  He is unfit for the office he has been overpromoted into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One couldn’t help but notice that #Johnson still couldn’t apologise.  I hope those many cabinet colleagues of his from ethnic backgrounds lean on him more than a little. Having a Muslim grandfather doesn’t excuse his racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Summarised as “Johnson is a loser”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg must do better in your apology to respected NHS consultant @djnicholl a full retraction is appropriate.  It is cowardly to use parliamentary privilege in this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, what he meant was “no-one he knows will die” He doesn’t give a stuff about anyone else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s the money coming from if post Brexit economy is weaker?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s a word for it isn’t there, when you treat someone badly and then expect to be loved when you give back a fraction of what you withheld.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He wouldn’t know the truth if it stripped naked and ran round the no10 garden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s putting the country first, you aren’t.  Suddenly compared to you he looks statesmanlike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair he is the third choice for the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Johnson isn’t in charge after all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a bit of a hostage to fortune when you have a rock solid reputation for lying and deceit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pick on the little guy and girl who can’t fight back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stuff of nightmares!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn’t impress me at any time.  The smirk doesn’t help either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope there is a lot more “badly” heading Johnson’s way because he is a liar, purveyor of untruths, and lacks any integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason is blindingly obvious. Mr Gove does not listen to experts. It’s a wonder he’s lived as long as he has “mind the gap” “watch your step” “that’s hot” “give way” “poisonous”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a programme I’d be happy to miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson sacked the MPs who voted against a no deal Brexit.  In all likelihood the voters will sack those that voted for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t know the first thing about leadership.  All you know about is quitting and running away.  And seeing what a crap strategy that is, we want none of it. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leader of the House? I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet there’s no longer a Brexit majority in the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So your predecessor got rid of 20,000 experienced officers and you have to recruit a whole load of rookies to replace them.  That doesn’t sound very bright?  Oh I forgot, you aren’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does £54 million buy?  100 new homes? 200 new homes? 300 new homes?  A drop in the ocean anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most insincere smile of 2019 (so far)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right so before Brexit damages the economy they’re going on a spending spree on the credit card? What was the point of austerity then? Hey who cares, it’s our kids will have to pay it back! #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just chipped into the European Movement's anti-Brexit campaign. If you want to help stop Brexit too, donate at:  https://t.co/J50izIrS0W #ImEuropean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, rather destroyed any “street cred” he gained earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this is the man who wants to move the retirement age up to 75.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope your constituency party follow the lead of Runnymede and Weybridge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, scoring points off Dominic “where’s Dover” Raab isn’t hard. The man is a fraud and disembler who is hell bent on deceiving the public. His only positive is he is an improvement as Foreign Secretary over his predecessor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for her, she negotiated a deal with the EU that the tossers in the ERG voted against not once, not twice, but three times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ReesMogg treating this most serious debate as beneath him. Wise up boys and girls he is not on your side.  Not unless you too have millions in tax havens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The level of disrespect in that pose should have seen him jettisoned from the House, removed from office, and deselected as an M P.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson banking on doing a deal with Brexit Party. Others need to ensure they don’t gift seats to Conservative leavers by all standing against each other.  Is why a referendum preferable to a GE. #binBrexit first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise. #ReesMogg ‘s arrogance will be his downfall, #Johnson is a substance free zone.  You cannot be resilient without mastery of detail. Johnson is no such Master.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Realise that #ReesMogg cares not one jot for the working man and sees Brexit as the opportunity to dismantle the postwar settlement that created the NHS, welfare, pensions, and social care. He doesn’t want to help with your healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I very much hope their constituency parties follow Runnymede and Weybridge and endorse their MP to stand again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaker should have chucked #ReesMogg out for disrespecting his position and parliament. People need to wake up that this privileged arrogant individual is very not on the side of the working man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Point of order @itvnews parliament split 52% against no deal, 48% for liar PM Johnson. 2016 referendum 37% for Leave so Parliament vote consistent. Not even the same Brexit either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line is, if you fold on this you are effectively saying you are no longer your own man. Just a pawn of a PM who lies, bluffs, and blusters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really Prime Ministerial material is he? Remind me, who voted for this bluffer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will people realise that #ReesMogg and others want to roll back our welfare state, pensions, social care, the NHS, and keep their money in tax havens safe. They see Brexit as the excuse to do that. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicRaab on @BBCr4today Uncharacteristically hit the nail on the head. It’s all about keeping promises. The list of broken promises from Gove, Johnson, Raab, Davis, Fox, over Brexit is so long it’s already into Volume 2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The EU will hugely benefit from the fire sale of U.K. businesses and look on sadly as we wreck our country. There is no incentive to give Johnson a deal beyond what already negotiated. Brexit is a flawed proposition that won’t deliver what was promised. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Destroy Johnson’s negotiating position?  If you call this a position:- “If you don’t remove the backstop that protects your single market, I’ll leave with no deal crashing my economy and gifting you all our trade within the EU”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillCash on @bbcr4today insists the referendum, the A50 legislation and 2017 election gives a firm mandate for Brexit.  A bit like buying a car looking at Ferrari brochures, being told these are affordable deciding to go ahead and then being forced at gunpoint to buy a Trabant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will #Welby and others realise that you do not have to “fall in line with” or “get behind” government agendas that are based on falsehoods, deceits, and which will have a damaging impact on your circumstances. #binBrexit it’s a crock of shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zero, ever since the backstabbing, the bare-faced lying, and the ignorant “we’ve heard enough from experts” comment. If I could score lower, I would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Artefacts should be loaned, or gifted, never “taken”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want a clue, Ladbrokes aren’t taking bets on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No-one except us by voting out this appalling administration (not that we voted them in!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Summarising #SajidJavid @BBCr4today interview.  I have no principles, no integrity, and no honour, I owe my job to Mr Johnson and abase myself before him. Any opinion I held before, I have renounced, and now do what I am told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s been “respected” for over 3 years.  Brexit turns out to be a crock of shit.  The proponents of it have been revealed as lacking integrity, honour, or honesty.  The people have pretty much changed their minds because the Brexit promised in 2016 cannot be delivered. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve always been intrigued by the call to “get behind Brexit”.  I’m retired, not sure what I can do to replace 40 years of trade deals and international treaties. I don’t intend to work ‘til I’m 75. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry, all that’s needed is a disruption to create an environment for inflation to flourish, like err Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be fair, when Jakey says not a single person, he means within his tight social network.  He isn’t a “man of the people”. He will/has made a mint from the fall in the £ and with Brexit his fortune in tax havens will continue to evade the taxman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much spot on, no integrity, and no honour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Principle gets rushed to A&amp;E and is operated on by a Spanish surgeon assisted by an Italian nurse and a Greek anaesthetist. Of course post Brexit Priciple might not be so lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if he realises that handmovements and gestures are lost on a radio audience?   I also wonder if he’s aware that prorogation doesn’t happen all the time, and that Leave argued for the sovereignty of Parliament, not shabby  coups by unelected Etonians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Her Majesty the Queen is listening to @bbcr4today I wonder if she’s thinking that #JacobReesMogg is a supercilious, arrogant, condescending, jerk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prorogation is extradinary and does not happen most years.  Parliament May recess, but that is very not the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t get it do you Peter? If you allow prorogation for two weeks, next time it could be ten years.  We Brits can smell a fascist a mile away. Or in your case on the Isle of Wight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t the speaker convene parliament whenever and wherever he sees fit? Parliament like a church is the people in it isn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you allow prorogation for two weeks, next time it could be ten years! Parliament must sit!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A situation that reveals the shortcomings of our system of government. Proroguing Parliament is essentially unconstitutional. If you do it for two weeks what’s to stop it being done for ten years? Time to kick out the rogues who perpetrated this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you believe in parliamentary democracy the this petition is for you: Do not prorogue Parliament  https://t.co/vNvYHhTuuN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely depressing but in some ways only to be expected if you ban schools from discussing current affairs, allow the media to peddle falsehoods, and generally ensure your population is ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven’t you twigged yet?  If Johnson says it, it’ll be wrong or incorrect, or in other words a falsehood or lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farage fails to appreciate we’re on the same planet, we face global warming together, we own the problem collectively and will solve it collaboratively. Brexit and Trump are the last flush of Us and Them politics. Burning our country will ensure it is so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An election a few weeks after Brexit there will be no landslide.  The Brexit voters will not think kindly when it turns out how hard they will be hit.  All the bluster about “whatever it takes” won’t survive job losses and inflation. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such is the brainwashing that sensible rules that we agreed with or would have introduced anyway are castigated just because they have an EU tag. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Johnson uses the same “disinterested, smirking” body language as he did with Merkel and Macron then he’s bound to be marginalised.  Only Trump will cosy up to him, and play him for the gullible tosser he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I’d read the briefing, I’m sure there was something in it about how to stand when your host is delivering his address.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some numpty in Westminster is making up petty rules that make it unpleasant and demeaning for people to settle here. We will be the losers. Brexit is a nasty little project by the far right to keep their money safe from the taxman. We will be the losers. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It has escaped your notice we have the best deal with Germany and 26 states where we can pull them behind our progressive ideas by strength of argument and veto mad ideas. We also have frictionless trade, and movement of workers. Pls do yr research!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This cannot be regarded as surprising.  Perhaps some-one should explain to Johnson, Farage, Gove et al that the reality for British business is that the pickings will be leaner outside the EU after all. We do not hold all the cards. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only safe preparation for a no deal Brexit is to revoke A50.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The whole point of the back stop is it’s the default if the alternative arrangements don’t materialise or don’t work.  If Johnson believes they will then the back stop is irrelevant.  The fact he is frit of the backstop proves the alternatives won’t work<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy I read that the National Grid went all awry hours after #SajidJavid visited them and put on the obligatory branded hard hat and hi-viz vest.  Surprised he didn’t tell the Grid to “believe”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Jeremy, we do indeed need an opposition who can fight back immediately, not days later.  If you can’t do it hand over to someone who xan. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saiid knows if he stares really hard without blinking he might distract us from the rubbish he’s spouting. Then he wastes time arguing over whether he had enough time to answer. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rees-Mogg is only interested in the dismantling of the post war settlement that created the welfare state and the NHS.  He is on record as not wanting to contribute to the nation’s health. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimMartin on @BBCr4today thinks we’ll be in trouble if we leave the Euro!  Brilliantly well informed. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter’s character limit insufficient to list everything that @JamesCleverly has done wrong, every incorrect statement that he has made, and all the flaws, shortcomings and inconsistencies in his #Brexit arguments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Political spin is one thing.  Choosing which facts to quote is part of the game.  Picking ones base point to your own advantage is Westminster hustle.  We seem now to be peddling bare-faced lies and untruths. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He’s an idiot as well then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr Brexit Party where do you think your ancestors came from matey? Probably europe, and before that Africa.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Corbyn ensuring Labour becomes irrelevant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That compromise would be staying in the single market and customs union then?  Now that would be a compromise that would avoid the Irish backstop and border kerfuffles at our ports, job losses, and the worst of the downfall no deal threatens. Johnson will not take that compromise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The words “good faith” sound hollow coming from the mouth of Michael “back stabber” Gove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So six years of absolute horror including rationing; ten years of slow recovery still including rationing; fifteen more years including being the sick man of Europe; and then rescue through joining our closest neighbours in joint endeavour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In one tweet @darrengrimes_  reveals a spectacular level of ignorance of history and current affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put your tongue in Govey.  It makes you look stupider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s Gove and Johnson out then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry he’ll stab Johnson in the back before the end of October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell you what Cummings, three year old votes are past their use by date, and certainly can’t be used to push for the complete opposite of the campaign thst won them. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Maggie was the appropriate diminutive. Never trust anyone who doesn’t use his given name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saddest thing about Brexit is realising how ignorant 1 in 3 of my countrymen are about economics, trade, UK/european history, and migration. Those that aren’t ignorant seem extremely gullible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’ll soon find out what being broke, controlled and trapped feels like that’s for sure. Your £ is already worth only 80p. Suggest you check where the stuff in your home is actually made first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In that case spare a thought for those who don’t. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh come on! The referendum has been respected for three years. It has been respected to the point where all the 2016 promises have turned to dust and what Brexit will deliver is the complete opposite of “sunlit uplands”. Time to #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All Gove and Johnson do to signal they’re about to lie is open their mouths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? Do they have capital in tax havens? Private healthcare? Secure jobs unaffected by Brexit recession? Excellent health? No need for welfare?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“In good faith”? This from Michael “back stabber” Gove! #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, surely you mean Poorly Researched, Delusional World King? #Johnson has asked to be formally addressed as The Great Deceiver rather than Prime Minister, and requested supplicants to leave his presence backwards rather than running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What you fail to take into account is Lemont knows far more about pharmaceuticals than Health professionals, more about farming than the NFU, and just by wiggling his eyebrows can raise the value of £. (He also believes gravity pulls upwards) #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other than lavishly give back some of the money May and Cameron squeezed out of the economy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah so Cummings is a liar too. There’s a surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would appear Gove was talking out of his arse in 2016. And still is in 2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was hard work. He could have said yes right at the beginning and saved us listening to his excrutiating explanation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael no-deal has no mandate and will be damaging to the country, the economy, and jobs. You are the one who needs to look in the mirror and ask why are you jumping to the tune of 1 in 3?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the EU has negotiated a Brexit deal. ERG the secret party within a party didn’t vote for it. Well I didn’t vote for no deal Michael, so get stuffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No offence to Estonia, @BBCr4today , but the only way #Johnson can look good and appear as big as his ego demands is to be seen meeting a minnow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I accept your offer.  As a token of our friendship keep the EMA and EFA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s not the same man is it?  This one isn’t smirking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Trumps stupid hair looks tidy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So reverses some, but not all, of the cuts his predecessors made. A bit the same as reinstating the 20,000 police offices made redundant. Out of interest, where is this money coming from? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominicRaab speak with forked tongue, again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ignorance of the Brexiteers strikes again. I wonder why diesel engines are so called? And we’re lucky the Chinese aren’t seeking reparations for the opium wars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UK_Salvadoran @stroppypanda Welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairer and simpler yes. Lower, need to be high enough to fund the services our civilised and developed economy requires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry, have already added Cleverly to the “assume lying” group.  It’s much simpler that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spin is one thing, but we have strayed dangerously into the territory of bare-faced lying.  Politicians should be struck off for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could think of several other things he could be branded.  Suggest we just tattoo UC on his forehead and allow everyone to read it how they will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t go.  Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We already export stuff to China, so we don’t have to leave the EU to do that?  We make more types of cheese than the French, what’s that got to do with it? I bet the Yorkshire tea is a blend of imported leaves.  #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson ‘s understanding of economics is sketchy at best, his concern for your job non-existent, the likelihood of any business employing such an inveterate liar nil. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Govebollocks “The economic model that the European Union embodies is a job-destroying, misery inducing, unemployment-creating tragedy.” Where did he get that from? And a Johnson apology? Lie upon lie upon £350m for the NHS lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end of the clip Twitter gives you the chance to play again.  I’d rather cut my own leg off without anaesthetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The others being Grayling, Gove, Rees-Mogg, Redwood, IDS, Johnson, Patel, Raab, Davis, Francois, Truss, Javid, Hoey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s going to affect everyone. 1 in 3 of those on electoral roll, 1 in 4 of population. Much lower and it’ll be like those few voting for Johnson. #binBrexit you’ll thank me one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicRaab hanging out for win win. Funny that Tusk described Brexit as lose lose. If Raab wants to mitigate the risks why not revoke A50 we already have the best deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will come as no surprise thar every country in the world trades more with its close neighbours than countries on the other side of the world. £360m lamb per year to the EU, £10m to Japan over three years. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s this? #JamesCleverly being not very clever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except it won’t, nothing can save them now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except it won’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Default setting Mark. Which means square one. Why would any sane person want to do that? Forgot, looking at cabinet there isn’t a sane one round that table. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advisory. Which bit of that don’t you get? If our politicians say they’ll implement it and don’t. Its their word that is broken, like that hasn’t happened before!!! #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How come our government is pursuing a strategy that puts the supply of critical medicines at risk? Extra border guards puts up government spending paid by, oh dear a smaller economy. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think sometimes these apologies for leaders forget that we can remember that it’s the U.K. wanting to leave the EU. We joined willingly over 40 years ago, and we want to leave. (Well 37% of us do)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno how he’s going to help them?  Mind you if the £ drops far enough the French will see the price to them inc tariffs the same as it was pre 2016 without tariffs. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, he is an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. He “is” useless and incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I can’t understand is how anyone could post such nonsense. #binBrexit and get our lives back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richard old mate, haven’t you worked out yet that if we don’t settle our debts with the EU not only won’t we get a trade deal with them (40% of exports) but no-one else will trust us either. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Innovation crushing” what evidence is there for that statement?  Since quite a chunk of research is EU funded and the EU has the LHC and a space programme, it would seem the report is complete tosh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Johnson doesn’t care.  Raab probably doesn’t know where Ellesmere Port is. Rees-Mogg doesn’t drive an Astra. Gove has a sketchy idea about manufacturing. Priti Patel thinks that UK workers are idlers. Javid is looking into where he can send everyone back to if the plant closes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rights conferred on all citizens of member states, and all prices have done since 2016 is go up, and all the currency has done is go down. It fell this week as no deal became more likely and so did the FTSE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#dominicDoverRaab Can some-one please explain a) how a #backstop can be undemocratic? b) why if we’re so so confident of the many tech solutions we even care about a backstop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great tub thumper and campaigner, but unless telling truth completely wasted. Also underlying policy needs to be enriching not job losing economy crashing crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually yes. Rights are being removed, the value of savings is being diminished, prices of imported goods are rising. This government not fit for purpose. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m stunned, the man who was appointed Brexit Secretary and admitted he hadn’t realised the significance of Dover in our trade with the EU has the brass neck to argue the point on what was said in the 2016 campaign? #Morelies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is, those that disagree haven’t done it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following your logic cut your leg off.  Just think of the opportunities that’ll open up for you.  It may hurt a bit in the short term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AlunCairns on @BBCr4today came out with a load of tosh. How can a backstop be undemocratic? If our Brexit proponents really believed their tech solutions for the NI border the backstop wouldn’t be needed. That they’re so frit tells us the tech won’t work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure the spokesman on @bbcr4today quite grasps that the Japanese lamb market recently opened up because of the EU free trade deal. Japan has said it expects to get a better deal from us(for them).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t think he cares, its our money. We just need to remember who these jerks are when the opportunity comes to vote them back to the obscurity they came from. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ueah come on #Johnson #Opengovernment #nomorefibs #nomoresecrets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seem very selective on what you believe and what you don’t? Personally think no-dealing us back 40 years is a stupid thing to do. I’m retired and have no incentive to “get behind Brexit” as it’s all bad news. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rees-moggs department grinds to a halt whilst every report is checked for quirky personal preferences and conversion of measurements into ones no-one understands. And we’re paying for this. #caligula<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonCachia1 Out of interest, is your job one of those at risk from Brexit? Does your company export anything anywhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really love your cavalier attitude! 1 in 3 vote for Brexit lies three years ago. Effect already bad. Outcome predicted to be much worse, no deal outcome dreadful. And you’re fine with that?   Or we can #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been asking since June 2016 for the evidence that supports Brexit being anything other than a flawed proposition.  To date I have only been presented with falsehoods and lies.  I remain of the view the best policy is to #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We might not be, but this government seems determined to wage war on us, wrecking the economy, weakening the £, losing jobs, trashing our rights, and spending our money on completely pointless “no deal planning”.  #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A war cabinet? We aren’t at war, or are we aiming to start one?  Seems to me this right wing Conservative Government are declaring war on the people, smaller economy, fewer jobs, more austerity, inflation, what’s not to like? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today #DominicRaab “where’s Dover” really doesn’t impress. Slippery hardly does justice to him.  Can’t believe he argues we’ll get a better deal with the EU once we’ve left.  We already have a 5 gold star deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Brilliant scientists, academics and highly skilled workers” won’t want to come to a sagging economy, a falling £, an insular xenophobic and insular environment where the government wants to revert to feet and inches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope he doesn’t get paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst a tweet is too short to list all those nations who fought alongside us against fascism in 1940.  “Plus others” hardly does them justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m afraid I go for a comfort break when he’s on. If he’s so ignorant of his own roots (good old Shropshire name like Francois) then I judge his views eminently missable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 37% voted for Brexit three years ago. Never in the history of human conflict have so few buggered it up for so many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facebook lied about Cambridge Analytica? Johnson lies all the time. Johnson can’t remember why he visited Cambridge Analytica. What are the odds he’s lying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Ladbrokes will do an accumulator for that lot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at it from their position it’s us that want to leave. Only 37% of us 3 years ago mind. They’re trying to honour the Good Friday Agreement that took terrorism off our streets. They want to see the tech solution for the border. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it a fossil fuel burning, planet destroyer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could always “get off”. You risk one of us beating you to the punch!  Except I’m on a train just now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Challenge” the mastery of understatement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder what odds Ladbrokes are offering for “disaster under Boris Johnson”?  Do you think we have to be more specific?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>German motor manufacturers will still export to the UK post a no deal Brexit. The cost will be higher because of tariffs and a weaker £.  Much of our car manufacturing will end up in Germany. Will #Johnson explain why they would care if we hard Brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was of course lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just get off the fence and take the Remain fight to him. Focus on calling out his bare-faced lies. Shouldn’t be difficult. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisamanunited @haveigotnews Yeah great speech.  Rousing and uplifting, but what is required is a practical plan to deliver.  A plan wholly within the control of A Johnson PM.  Sadly his plan relies on the EU doing something they said they wouldn’t do. #binBrexit we can do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll all get old one day, but incompetent and out of touch, certainly.  I expected JC to excel at opposition, he’s been against every government since he entered Westminster, even Labour one’s. Now wasn’t the time to change. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>37% voted to leave. Not a mandate, the larger third at best. As a nation we have higher values than has emerged from Brexit over the last three years! #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes the English are unenlightened ignoramouses with a very sketchy knowledge of their own roots and history. Nor much of a grasp of what makes the economy tick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll be fighting to keep all of our social provision hard won after the war including the NHS. Those funding Brexit do so because they don’t want to pay their share of our countries costs and also want to profit from your ill health. Brexit is just the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the amount of control he has is not a lot.  If people don’t want to be nurses or policemen you can’t make them.  If people study in the U.K. you can’t make then stay and work here. His tax revenue will fall and he won’t be able to afford anything. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In both cases Vladimir Putin must be laughing his socks off. Crippling the West with the worst president and the dumbest international trade policy at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump’s words are simple ones often not in sentences always repeated, delivered with gravity.  Johnson’s are multisyllabic, poetic, often including classical references or Latin phrases, delivered as if they are the wittiest lines ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People compare #Trump and #Johnson both use lots of wavey hand gestures, both wear their ties too long, both have rubbish hair styles, both talk in short bursts, both skip the detail, and both distort the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ladycorvia That makes it worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hallelujah!!!!  We ask again “ou est monsieur Corbyn?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes we do @Keir_Starmer where’s the opposition.  At what point will Jeremy Corbyn wake up and realise he is supporting an extremely right wing government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson is quite right, no self respecting country would trash forty years of international agreements and treaties; no self respecting country would disrespect its leaders of the last forty years. None have been lied to so much by err @BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, how come they can tell it how it is but our media can’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sod that, what does it mean for the planet? We’ve only got one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BorisJohnson if we asked you to stick with what you campaigned for in 2016 you’d be keeping us in the single market, and getting the easiest EU deal. You sold us a pup old mate.  If you can’t deliver please ask us or parliament what next, do not crash the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A competent government wouldn’t.  I’m not sure the current government is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds a nasty piece of work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure we’ve previously had such an established bare faced liar as PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where was #binBrexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that’s now Prime Minister #Johnson getting pushed over a Brexit cliff edge so the rest of us don’t hav3 to follow, whose arm is it pushing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trouble is, too many of these political lightweights have insufficient respect for the hard work, labours, and achievements of their predecessors, and the arrogance to think in two seconds they can do better. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the greatest of those sins is wanting the death penalty back.  The state must never take the life of anyone. The state is fallible and errors that cannot be corrected are unconscionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck with that.  You do know that #LiamFox tried but his problem was the other countries saw no rush to do a deal with the U.K. or thought rightly that they could get a better one for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Misread that as “heading for an early erection” obviously wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my goodness, our new Home Secretary actually came out with this!  What century is she in? Are we to expect amputations for theft next? If she doesn’t hold with the culture of the U.K. she should cease and desist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s OK the foreign office has an atlas with the empire in pink on it.  He’ll be able to bone up on it in the way that “research shy” #Johnson didn’t when he had the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>doubt it’ll even appear as a rounding error.  And for us, won’t even buy half a high speed line.  I don’t see any amount of optimism helping you out of the hole you dug for yourself. And you’ll look really pathetic if you try to blame others for your own turds. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do that and our credit rating will drop and our interest charges will rise on the debt your government failed to reduce.  The EU will block you at every turn for flouting international law.  By the way £39bn over ten years between 27 countries,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And anything they buy from us will probably cost them round about the same even with tariffs, because the £ is worth less. Oh you’re threatening to withhold the £39bn we owe under international treaties.  Are you mad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way those exports will continue and if we want them we’ll have to pay more because the £ is worth less and there’ll be duty on it.  Can’t see the EU worrying about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and Andrew Neil picked you to pieces because you hadn’t read or understood that either. But come on put a brave face on it, believe that the EU really cares about Prosecco and BMW exports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As throughout your life you did insufficient research, you didn’t do the hard work to understand what the EU was about and how it helped our economy and our global objectives. Now you bleat on about WTO clause 24,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He now says we need a “hard Brexit” though he’d rather we had a deal. He says it’ll somehow be the EUs fault if we crash out.  How’s that work again? You campaigned for this mess #Johnson at least have the decency to own it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson who’s never made anything in his life that anyone talks about and seemed to get sacked from successive journalist jobs for making stuff up, has taken scant regard that real people are losing real jobs as a result of Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson was appointed to Foreign Secretary in May’s government, and his big pal David Davis Brexit Secretary.  That government served article 50 and Johnson along with the rest bear responsibility for not having a clue what they were doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we’d easily do a deal with the EU. A deal that would kick in the minute we left. That campaign has been charged with overspending.  And some of the big slogans, most notably £350 million a week going to the EU turned out to be wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, let’s get a few things straight. Alexander Johnson (now PM) was the one who drove the #Brexit campaign in 2016 that secured a small majority in an advisory referendum.  During that campaign he said we’d stay in the single market and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brace up we need you as Lib Dem candidate in South Cambridgeshire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>37% of the electorate wasn’t ever a mandate. Boris for HIGNFY not no10.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whether you agree with the politics of it, #Brexit has been a demonstration in world class incompetence from beginning to end by the one time “party of business”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One word, either “No” or “Stop” would have done it.  Straight away too.  Saying neither after basking in the moment for ten seconds fuels the fire.  Mind you can you hear the cogs turning and the beady little eyes calculating the number of votes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus we’ve trashed a hard won reputation for being a safe pair of hands, fairness, pro economic growth, prudence, trade, collaboration, compromise and more, only to call all that into question, at a stroke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone else who is incapable of telling the truth.  Makes Nixon look like a paragon of honesty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man has no track record for delivering anything one thousandth as complex and far reaching as Brexit. He can rabble rouse with the best of them, but in his case there is no substance whatsoever. Plus he can’t tell the truth to save his life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, like they asked us to go did they? Poor show if #Hunt can’t even accurately report on events of the last few years whilst he was in cabinet. And he wants us to let him run the country, sorry that’s ruin the country. #Borisnobetter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Alex Piffle Paffle Johnson will ditch Brexit, cos to be honest it sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Universal credit, I.e. simplifying the benefit system, has an allure, however this is damaged by institutionalising a five week delay partly because of the added process, but mostly because of monthly payment. Pay it weekly and make the process quicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don’t know that politics and economics are intertwined #JeremyHunt then you’re an idiot.  The whole point of the single market is to eliminate barriers to trade and market distortions, like different tax rates, different standards, government subsidy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you talking about Alex Piffle Paffle Johnson? Or as we call him Winger Johnson because he never reads anything or prepares anything? Great fun on HIGNFY but not the sort of flakey jerk you want near your armed forces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So US trade deal won’t add percentage points onto our GDP straightaway, so not worth tearing up our EU deal that has, does, and will then?  And we already have the best EU deal going and ride on all the free trade deals they/we’ve done and are doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So after 3 years, the only regulatory example of Brussels red tape cited by Johnson reveals again his lack of proper research and him just being wrong because it’s entirely U.K. safety regulation, not “red tape”. The only honest part is the kipper. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today While #Hunt is there ask what the point of #Brexit is?  Other than honouring the 3 year old vote of 37% of the electorate in an advisory referendum dogged with fraud, lies, deceit, and international meddling? oh and wrecking the economy. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah @ShaileshVara we are fed up of being told we can’t have a confirmatory vote on any #Brexit deal or no deal. None of these deliver what was promised in 2016; 37% of the electorate is no mandate; parliament must have its say too. #tellBoris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up, never surrender.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just shows what an idiot Johnson is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, as a remainer myself I am flattered to learn that my failure to “get behind” this fruitcake plan is the reason Brexit is struggling. Let’s face it, if it was a good plan it’d fly off the shelves.  Brexit is Betamax to the EUs VHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no better forum than “in public” to express “full confidence and support” in some-one who is a government servant. To fail to do so when asked, is shameful from a prospective PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people, far from celebrating the 70 years of peace the EU has contributed to in Europe want to start a third round!  I blame the constant reruns of Dads Army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Johnson didn’t realise that there is only one answer to the question on live TV “does the ambassador have your full support?” then he hasn’t got what it takes to be PM. Answers open to “misrepresentation” again, make him unsuitable. @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only works if the other party needs what you have more than what you need, and if no deal affects you less than the other party. Neither of these apply with Brexit, however hard Johnson blags they do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who do you think should pay for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it’s a waste. But then you clearly have no understanding of the history behind it. This doesn’t surprise me because you are equally cavalier with the history of NI and the GFA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martin, you really are worryingly dim.  If you want to do your bit don’t go, don’t claim expenses, and decline the salary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But presumably the “elevation” of Hunt or Johnson to PM is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. The Brexit party showcased it’s childish and pugnacious approach to dealing with other countries elected representatives and cultures.  Which is odd because we’re going to need to be far, far, more adult in any future trade deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, it looks like the answer to the Brexit question is “the English don’t want to play nicely with anyone”. That’s the people descended from Angles, Danes, Saxons, Viking’s, Romans, Normans, and a wealth of commonwealth migrants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair point. When did we ever vote on our flag?  New Zealand did.  Are we saying we’re less democratic than New Zealand?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When #JeremyHunt says he’ll cover the additional tariffs for fishing and agriculture, does he mean personally?  Also when he says put aside £6billion, he actually means “pay the EU £6billion a year” this guy is a complete fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to #MattHancock on @bbcr4today “The whole point of Brexit is to return sovereignty to the U.K.”. But we never lost it so that makes Brexit pointless. Let’s #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, because if he’d backed Remain in 2016 we would be in a far far far better place today than we are!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another great deal that we’d be chucking away if we left the EU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A soft Brexit sounds very much like a turd, which of course is precisely what any sort of Brexit actually is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#JeremyHunt “I am trustworthy” If you need to say it, you aren’t. A bit like adding “honestly” after something you say in court.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#bbcnews Have just realised that the BBC helpfully flags dodgy political content by putting (Con) in brackets.  For example “Esther McVey (Con)”. “Jeremy Hunt (Con)” etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So not just Corbyn who is an ineffectual opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #BJohnson wants us to believe he wrote two papers one arguing Brexit the other arguing Remain?  Bet the Brexit one just had “Prime Minister” on it and the other one “Wilderness”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 Business seeks to maintain access to the single market and customs union.  They are moving to stay in it.  This drains economic activity from the U.K., reduce tax revenues, which reduces government spending. Austerity again, the very measure that fuelled the protest vote in 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is a lesson to learn it’s that Remain is taking this seriously. There is no honour in allowing 37% to call the shots; there is no honour in ignoring lies, fraud, and international interference; there is no honour in damaging the economy. #binBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I struggle to see why we should compromise.  A hard Brexit will severely damage the economy, including crashing tax returns that mean all public spending will be at risk inc NHS and pensions. A compromise is slightly crashing the economy. Why? #binBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, why are we leaving?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“A better Brexit” “a Brexit for jobs” “a sensible Brexit” “a good Brexit”. These are ALL oxymorons. Brexit is a flawed proposition that can only deliver the opposite of what was promised in 2016.  In some cases already has delivered it. #bibBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Problem is the people saying this can probably afford it, but the people listening can’t which is what they protested about in 2016.

<|startoftext|>@commer2stroke You can’t seperate the issues. May peope were swayed by the messgae on the bus.  1.there is no Brexit dividend. 2. The NHS will be financially weaker thanks to lower tax receipts 3. Need EU doctors and nurses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair his entire campaign is based on flawed logic and little if any substance. His utterances comprise mostly glib slogans, and he’s likely to contradict himself the following day. He is serving the “left behind” very poorly. Brexit is a lose:lose proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly is.  First major party to support Remain wins the next election. (Unless it’s Labour)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Farage means is he wants to relieve the NHS of some of its money.  DO NOT VOTE for the Brexit party or you’ll end up having to buy insurance to get access to healthcare.  You won’t have budgeted for that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is unacceptable.  By “this” I mean illegal campaigning by the key leave groups.
