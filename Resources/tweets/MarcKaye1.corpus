<|startoftext|>@BillKristol This is true. 4 years ago you could excuse with "they didn't realize." Now, there's no excuse - eyes wide open and we have a lot of soul searching to do; willingly forgoing democratic principals for the "team" and self interests. I hope we can find a path back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump By "right" you mean "left", right? I mean, correct?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jhalifax I like the image - too bad certain people will mistake the image in the T for a dress from a Miss Universe pageant. #TheMoreYouKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This feels like a moment that we will forever refer to as in "before" and "after". Anyone else feel that way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei I get it. It's like we have more hatred because people keep listening. Makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ethannichtern I hope you are ok. Be gentle with yourself, as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Trump loves bullies. He doesn't love Texas and he doesn't even love himself. And we are all suffering because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Being evangelical (or religious) doesn't necessarily have anything to do with morals. That's why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamjohnoliver So grateful for your show. But feel bad - I mean how many times in the past 4 years have you been forced to repeat "THAT..is simply not true" and then set the record straight? You should sue the #Trump administration for emotional abuse. I know I'm thinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod Because we are always looking outward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do gigs and have a laundry list of what I am not allowed to talk about and then we have a president who can go and say and tweet whatever he wants. We are living in interesting times. And by interesting, I do mean sucky. #Trump2020 #TrumpIsNotAmerica #comedian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddApatow I will write your next movie "Trump's craziest moments" with you - for free. The challenge will be cutting it down to 2 hours. But I'll do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman Thanks for posting that. That is exactly how I feel - some of whom I am related to. The rationale I get from them just feeds into racist stereotypes for Jews, too, which really helps with the self-hating Jew part of my personality. So I guess that's an upside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden I can't unclench.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump @CNNSitRoom We're still asking what was he "thinking"? Adorable. He does because he can. We have a crisis of the soul, of values and of the collective "we" of America vs the "yeah, me, too" individualism that is causing extrinsic values to suffocate what is left of our intrinsic ones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you really peel back why people can still support Trump - it's only about their wallet, their skin color or both. Sad to say, but true. We have to think about each other and not just ourselves or we are leaving nothing of value for the future. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danbharris I think the root of all of this is that so many Americans do not want to accept or acknowledge exactly what Gen. Brown is talking about.
