<|startoftext|>6. Midsommar. Movie theaters are dark. Horror movies usually involve darkness and shadows. I just remember that screen being so bright and so much of Ari Aster's horror unfolding in broad daylight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. It Follows followed me out of the movie theater. It had momentarily rewired my brain. After 90 minutes of scanning the background of the picture for a figure walking toward the camera, I found myself scanning the parking lot to see it anyone was walking toward me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. Whiplash. The ending is incredible. It builds and builds and builds. I got this grin halfway through and wanted to give a standing ovation. I left that movie feeling energized, like the energy of the movie transferred to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. I got to see 2001: A Space Odyssey on the IMAX for it's 50th anniversary a few years ago, and it was a totally different experience compared to seeing it in my living room. It was so immersive the "Beyond the Infiinite" sequence almost gave me a panic attack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke And even though we disagree politically, they instilled faith at an early age and gave me the ability to make it my own when I grew up. Both me and my sister.

<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke I have a tremendous family lineage of believers who have helped shape and mold me and I owe so much to them, from my grandmother and grandfather to my parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke Been going to church since I was in diapers, but I stopped caring about denominations. I'm a Christian first and foremost. I need to see Jesus in my church, and I do (My current pastor is doing a tremendous series on grace right now).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke The lure of political power has never been beneficial to the Church. We have never benefited from holding it. It corrupts and distorts the Good News. The sooner the Religious Right divorces itself from the Republican Party the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke I don't know what it will take to break you of your partisan delusion, but I hope someday it does. And I hope you can find your way to a version of Christianity that is not utterly tainted with political ideology the desire for political power.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke Being a Christian and being a Republican are not entwined for me. In fact, I think it's unhealthy and damages the witness of the Christians to be so enthralled to one political party and reduced to a voting bloc. The Church should be so much more than what we've made it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larkindog22 @pastorlocke I don't hate Republicans. I used to be one.

<|startoftext|>@pastorlocke Shocking how many of these cowards talk a big game and then block me to continue to live in their carefully crafted cocoon where they can live in their pretend world and ignore reality. "Wait until Dec. 14th!" But they don't want to face the reality of Dec. 15th and beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MinarchistR @pastorlocke Ah yes, the "I'm rubber, you're glue" defense. Well-played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke What are you even talking about? Hillary was declared the loser election night. She wasn't projected to win AFTER the election. She conceded. She didn't refuse to accept defeat and fight futilely until the electoral votes were cast in December. But I'M the delusional one. Sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke Arrogance is thinking the only way your candidate can lose is because of unprecedented cheating from his opponent and his supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke I did think Hillary was going to win. I learned my lesson. I didn't take 2020 for granted. You're clearly not interested in learning any lessons from this election. The electoral college vote on Dec. 14 is usually just a formality, unless you're hoping for something underhanded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke You're hilarious. What are you expecting to happen on Dec. 14th? What do you actually think is going to happen? I'm genuinely curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laurie4change @pastorlocke You're confusing the Bidens for the Trump in terms of shady, corrupt business dealings and being generally awful. How that Trump charity doing? Oh wait, they were forced to close because they were so bad. How about those trademarks from China for Ivanka? Crickets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neverunderpar13 @rmvsb2013 @pastorlocke Reality is literally the opposite of what this guy is claiming. I don't have to be the end all be all authority on anything to point out the stupidity and waywardness and misguidedness of his stating otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReportThis12 @pastorlocke Ah yes, I'm projecting my denial of reality on all of you. Right. Because saying Spanish servers in Germany showing Trump winning California and 400+ electoral votes is CLEARLY the REAL reality and NOT AT ALL crazytown.  https://t.co/qWToIEGSxX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke That's hilarious that you think two weeks after the election is still the first quarter. It's more like we're up in the Super Bowl by a few scores in the 4th quarter with the ball and just need to run out the clock/take a knee, and we're not the Atlanta Falcons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@schemmy06 @pastorlocke Enjoy the last 63 days of Trump's presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke Also, you think 9/11 was an inside job. There's no getting past that. I got nothing left to say to you. This isn't a debate. You have no credibility to stand on if that's you're position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke Bolton disputing doesn't confirm or deny what Kelly may or may not have heard. And Kelly never came out and refuted the allegations. His silence spoke volumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schemmy06 @pastorlocke 1. Not a fact.  2. His belief is severely misguided because Joe Biden is going to be his next president. 3. I'm sorry that my facts and beliefs are an inconvenience to you, but it's my constitutional right to state them, right? So I'm not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke Ah, there it is. Were the Jews in on it too? Geez, "9/11 was an inside job." I can't say I'm surprised to see that from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke John Kelly said nothing about the Atlantic story that came out in late August/early September. His aide disputed the report. Kelly remained quiet through the election, to the dismay of many who thought he should speak up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schemmy06 @pastorlocke My question was not about the Constitution. I asked about the Church engaging in disinformation. According to the Bible, preachers and teachers of the Word are to be held to a higher standard. I'm sorry I can't help you with your problem of reading comprehension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schemmy06 @pastorlocke What book of the Bible is that in again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamm0rgan Good Manners (As Boas Maneiras). The less you know about it going in, the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke He called McCain ( a veteran) a loser. It was reported that Trump, among other things, called the military suckers, and was in the presence of John Kelly. Kelly, fwiw, never refuted those reports, despite having ample time to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke When Trump was supporting Dems he was a Page Six tabloid clown that no one took seriously. People only started attacking him because of his birtherism and Republicans making a conman like him the head of their party.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@droppedchevyy @pastorlocke Oh, I'm well aware of how the process works. But it's not false information to say that Biden has sizeable leads and is going to be your next president.

<|startoftext|>@pastorlocke Well, as much fun as I've had going back and forth with MAGAhatters tonight who can't accept reality, I must go to bed. Instead of counting sheep, I'll count the days until Biden is sworn in. I hope counting to 63 is enough to get to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Edsren @CitizenSoldie19 @pastorlocke A+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laurie4change @pastorlocke This has been well-documented for over a year now, AND in the reporting at the time it happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laurie4change @pastorlocke Yeah, that's called the policy of the United States and also the policy of our European allies at the time. LOL, did you think Joe Biden went rogue over there??? He was there demanding on behalf of the US government that Shokin be fired because he wasn't investigating corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeriMcComsey @pastorlocke Also, that is SO YESTERDAYS NEWS! Haven't you heard? All the cool cats are now saying that the MAFIA stole the election for Joe, not the German servers. Get with the program!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredCavanaugh1 @pastorlocke That's a funny map. Let me know when it's updated to Biden over 270 like all the electoral maps in the real world. No really, I want to know the moment it actually sinks in for you people that Trump is an impeached, one-term loser of a president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllanPetit2 @pastorlocke I am. It's processing what my eyes and ears are reading, seeing, and hearing. That Joe Biden won in reality and a bunch of delusional people thing Trump won just because they can't deal with the fact that they were suckered in by him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke I love how you call Biden the liar given the mountain of lies that Trump tells. And if I were you, I wouldn't want to hold Joe Biden up to a Biblical standard if I'm supporting the guy who cheated on his wives and is on record saying he doesn't need to ask God for forgiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeneralSniperQ @iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke Trump lost. Biden is your next president. This is reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke Save American soldiers? The same soldiers he called losers and refused to do anything about Putin paying bounties on their heads?

<|startoftext|>@TeriMcComsey @pastorlocke No. I got news for you, the army getting the results of the electoral college off a server in Germany is not how US elections work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DustyScarbro @pastorlocke Hahaha, not a liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneClephane @pastorlocke @jack Ohhhhhhhh. But I thought that the stupid disclaimer meant it was EXTRA true. That's what all my MAGA friends who are leaving Facebook and Twitter have said. I'm so confused now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gustakook It was close. Knowing the way reviews are handled, might not have been enough evidence to overturn the call. But I like where you're coming from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke I very much love my country. It's exactly why I stand opposed to Donald Trump and the way he has diminished it and harmed it through his words and actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gustakook anyone that has "Bill was right on 4th &amp; 2" gets a follow in my book!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregBerr I'm a believer and I don't believe those things. And those views were not exclusive to the Church, especially when the Bible was written. And even though they propagated those ideas far longer than they should have, none of that is the message of the Gospel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Preach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLoV3AmrRicA @pastorlocke I support America and democracy over a corrupt party under the sway of a snake oil salesman. In 2020, that meant voting for Joe Biden. I would've voted for a worn out shoe over Trump. I support his agenda as far as it ends Trump's destruction of our democratic norms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSpake @pastorlocke  https://t.co/WXVwBdrfci<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AllanPetit2 @pastorlocke The MSM is not without its faults, but there is no real case for Trump getting a 2nd term right now short of massive voter disenfranchisement and the Supreme Court overturning the will of the voters or by other unconstitutional means.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@morganjttalley @mschlapp I also love, LOVE, how their solution to observers not being close enough to see the ballots is to just throw out 600,000 ballots instead of, you know, COUNTING THEM AGAIN WITH OBSERVERS CLOSER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mschlapp I thought we weren't supposed to care about the media. Go to the FBI or take it to court. There is a LEGAL process for everything you are alleging. So far, you've proven nothing that can overturn the will of the people at the ballot box.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dammit, I can't be on Twitter reading Tommy anecdotes. I'm still at work and I'm on the verge of tears. He was part of the Celtics and Boston sports fabric for the last 64 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tommy Heinsohn was a Hall of Fame player AND a Hall of Fame coach. He was a Celtics announcer for almost 39 years. He was a fixture of Celtics basketball in one form or another for over 60 years. A true legend. My heart is heavy. #RIPTommyHeinsohn #TommyPoint #ILoveWalter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Oh man, I watched the Mark Levin segment and IT WAS WORTH IT. What a meltdown!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never watch @seanhannity but I recorded on DVR in case Biden went past 270 tonight and I wanted to see a meltdown. Is he wearing bronzer in solidarity with @realDonaldTrump or is the color off on my TV?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MojoCaster Autocorrect and drinking is a lethal combo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MojoCaster I'm not familiar with "Carne aside tacos." Seems like you'd be better off having the carne inside the tacos.🤔😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I think you're missing the point. They're not Fox News! They're not state TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Yeah, but have they called AZ like Fox already has? If/when Fox calls PA, NV, or GA, they'll put him over 270.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Tonight could just be totally bonkers though. Especially if PA or GA get called.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I set my DVR to record everything on Fox News tonight for some serious indulgence in schadenfreude? Yes, yes I have. #TrumpIsALoser #Biden2020 #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020results<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes and yes. Daddy lost. Get used to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's. Always. A. Tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MojoCaster See if voting is right for you????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable Also also, Biden is gaining in PA, GA, and NV, but Trump is gaining in AZ. So let's just count the votes like how it is supposed to happen, and see where things stand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable Look, if you think there is genuine thievery and lying and cheating to steal votes then these accusations can have their day in court and we can see where the truth lies. Anything else is political gamesmanship and muddying the waters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable Sorry, no, I was merely indulging you. Also, "honest" is not a word you can use in the same sentence with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable Must just be following Trump's lead in saying the quiet part out loud. “The things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @DonaldJTrumpJr Anthony Weiner was the one whose laptop was seized days by the FBI before the election in 2016. There is plenty to suggest that helped swing the election to Trump. You would think the Weiner would be someone to take out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok, so Vince Foster, Seth Rich, blah blah blah. Answer me one question.

<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @DonaldJTrumpJr 1. What is it with Trump supporters and BOATS? 2. Yes, I have known it to take time to tabulate all the votes. Remember 2000?

<|startoftext|>50 million people and counting have already voted in this election. Staggering number. To give that some context, about 63 million votes were cast for Trump and 66 million for Hillary. 2020 early voting will likely outpace either 2016 candidate's vote total.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @atrupar Where's the insult? You're throwing out wild future hypotheticals that aren't based in any reality in the present. Is Biden the sharpest tool in the shed?

<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @atrupar Nixon stained the reputation of the office, Carter had his malaise, W. got us mired in two wars and the economy tanked, Trump has been a continual dumpster fire, but, yeah, let's go with Obama for worst administration ever, even though there was sustained economic growth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @atrupar You know, I've run into your type before. I remember someone who was SO convinced in 2016 that Obama was going to confiscate everyone's guns before he left office. Never did happen.

<|startoftext|>@GADeploreable @atrupar What's really sad is how you allowed yourself to be swindled by a snake oil salesman in Trump.

<|startoftext|>The entire game plan for Game 2 should be "ATTACK TYLER HERRO." Dude is a scary, fearless shooter, but he can't guard Kemba, Tatum, or Jaylen. Seek him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, WAY to much dribbling and having to take tough shots late in the shot clock. Hated the end of regulation final possession. Tatum has to get a better shot than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frustrating #Celtics loss. I don't know why they didn't run Kemba at Tyler Herro the entire 4th quarter and OT. His drive and step back jumper at the corner of the key was there ANYTIME he wanted it. Herro couldn't guard that. And they only went to it a few times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lukeluke696969 @RP3natural @wojespn At the end of the day, they either harness the talent they have or they don't. It's ultimately a player/talent driven league. My impression has always been that people who weren't stars in the NBA or even made it to the NBA make the best coaches, but there are always exceptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukeluke696969 @RP3natural @wojespn Yeah, coaching is hard, whether they're a former player or not. PGs are maybe marginally better just because of their perceived role on the floor, but they definitely get more swings at coaching positions, so their failure rate is probably more pronounced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukeluke696969 @RP3natural @wojespn I mean, the guy is right that PGs see the game different because they run the offense and all, so they probably get more head coaching chances than other former players at other positions, but that doesn't necessarily translate to good coaching.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Man, Kemba has been so efficient in the bubble. FG% up (49.1% vs. 42.5%), turnover rate down (1.4 vs. 2.1). Obviously, small sample size, but it's great to see the #Celtics plan to ramp him back up has worked. And his efficiency can help them weather the loss of Hayward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've always been of the mind that playing gives the players the platform to get their message heard about social and racial injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but didn’t show up in 2016. Is there statistical data in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida to support this? (CC: @NateSilver538 @davidfrum @DavidAFrench @Redistrict @stuartpstevens @jdickerson @SykesCharlie @jonfavs @danpfeiffer @murphymike @davidaxelrod)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but on the other hand, the same case is not made about Trump running up the score in places he’s already going to win? Instead, his appeal to the base is viewed as being geared toward turning out the vote in battleground states for people who would support him.../2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I’ve been wondering about recently: Why do pundits say that Biden has to appeal to the broader electorate instead of just his base, because it doesn’t help him to run up the score in California and New York (liberal strongholds he’s already going to win).../1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Show me one letter that Donald Trump has personally written to the family of a fallen soldier. Just one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a lot of questions the Bucks decision. The fact that they reached out to a local state official for dialogue and also for guidance on this speaks volumes about them wanting to do this in a productive way and maximize their collective voice in a way that matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course the nutjob Governor from South Dakota gets to speak at the RNC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not sure airing the Adam Sandler remake of the comedy The Longest Yard is the best way to fill the time that has been vacated by NBA players sending a message to the country by refusing to play their games.  https://t.co/9wUJ8WyZUf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Exsthsy Dude, I know it's Twitter and all, but you can reply without personal insults. Having said that, my apologies. There's a time and a place for anti-Kyrie takes (based on 2 years of word-salads in Boston), and with what is happening in this country right now, this ain't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exsthsy Kyrie was injured and couldn't play regardless of whether the bubble happened or not. He's also an idiot. He's the guy who took one intro to philosophy class in college and thinks he's an intellectual all of a sudden. Kaep and Kyrie are TOTALLY different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy has just shot 3 people, 2 dead... cops responding to the shooting reported and... he just... puts his hands up with his gun hanging from his neck... and they drive right past him... and he just walks away????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Popehat I mean, Pence is speaking in like... 5 hours? Can I get back to you then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing more people saying the players are striking more than boycotting. That makes more sense. Still don't fully understand the endgame here though. Definitely want to hear from the players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the person who murdered two people who were out after curfew... was ALSO out after curfew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF??????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanaHoops Nobody owes Kyrie anything. If they had listened to him then there would be no Bucks/Magic boycott of Game 5 right now. The players wouldn't have a stage to be heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Google... not so fast.  https://t.co/XCaQ31YK8g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess wait for more reporting from @wojespn and @ShamsCharania?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, drawing attention to it may be enough, since there is dead air to fill with no game going on and it will lead all sports shows for days, especially if all the other teams follow suit. But how long does it last and who decides when they start back up again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understood potentially boycotting over Donald Sterling because that was something the league could directly address. There's no direct action the NBA can take in the shooting of an American citizen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know Twitter is the worst place to ask this, but genuinely looking to be informed. What does a Bucks and Magic protest of Game 5 over the Jacob Blake shooting accomplish beyond drawing attention to the shooting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit, this is so frustrating. This administration is intent on completely eroding trust in our institutions, dragging everything down to their level.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having had a day to think on it, Trump's "delay the election?" tweet, while a blatant attempt to undermine US democracy, we also to distract from, among other things, 150K+ Covid deaths, awful financial news, a truly awful answer on Russian bounties, &amp; John Lewis' funeral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsteed Also, he has no shame, so how much does the publicity of his quitting matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsteed "It's rigged, completely rigged, so I'm getting out." I also wouldn't put it past him resigning in the dead of night post-election and taking a sweet pardon deal from interim President Pence sometime between Nov. 3rd and Jan. 20th. Anything &amp; everything is on the table with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexsteed I could envision a scenario where he resigns to try to save face in order to avoid an epic loss in November. Quitting is totally part of his M.O. with other failed ventures.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@finn_tabulous @HawleyMO @amandacarpenter @NBA Also love how Bolton's warmongering is viewed as a strength and asset by all the Republicans and Fox News viewers for the last 20 years until it's no longer convenient for Dear Leader's narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finn_tabulous @HawleyMO @amandacarpenter @NBA Uh huh. Yup. Dear Leader cannot be proven wrong. All praise to Dear Leader who works all things for our good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finn_tabulous @HawleyMO @amandacarpenter @NBA Um, John Bolton's book? The guy who is a through and through lifelong Republican? Straightforward approval there.

<|startoftext|>I don't mean to be alarmist, and I seriously hope I am overreacting, but it seems to me that having a bunch of MAGA supporters and a bunch of people protesting the murder of George Floyd both assembling in front of the White House tonight is an especially bad &amp; dangerous idea /1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>JOHN TESH ROUNDBALL ROCK!!!! Incredible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 And then the decision become even starker and more dire where we say, do we do this all over again or do we just open back up completely and let the pieces fall where they may. To me that is sliding into making a false choice a necessary choice through a lack of discipline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I don't see what you see I guess. Everyone that is expressing concern right now is worried about Covid-19 exploding again over the next few weeks from irresponsible reopening, being back at square one exactly because of how demoralizing, depressing, and costly it would be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333  https://t.co/XtjiBqWcIY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 But it feels like we've been backed into the corner of this choice by disingenuous people and bad actors who went into lockdown kicking and screaming and doubting it all the whole way. And don't even get me started on the "hope" thing given Trump's "hopeful"  cheerleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Because of prior indecision, maybe we are coming to a place where we now have to decide between two bad options that are being suggested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 The way I see it, we've had a series of half measures the entire way (White House messaging, stimulus package, Presidential production order, supply chain coordination, mask-or-no-mask, and inconsistent regional social distancing orders, lack of testing).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Not minimal hospitalizations, just hospitalizations stretched out over a longer period of time to manage caseloads. And how much of the supply chain restraint is due to the fact that the federal government has abdicated their responsibility and put the ones on the states?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 If we want to re-open the country sooner rather than later we need robust testing and contact tracing. Cases are up in a lot of states that don't have the resources of states like NY &amp; Cali. If we do this haphazardly, the flattened curve is going to balloon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Lock down doesn't have to indefinite, but re-opening should be done responsibly. And given that states are opening up without meeting the federal government's guidelines it doesn't sound like that's happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is visiting a mask-making factory in Arizona today. @Grege333 and I determined that the odds on him wearing a face mask at the factory should be -200 he doesn't wear a mask and +300 that he does wear a #mask. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank God, they finally kissed! That must mean the movie is almost over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did this movie get made?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ben Stiller's artist is Bwick Elias, btw. Bwick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one thing that's interesting about this movie? A very young ScarJo in a small role. She must have been 11 when this movie was filmed. Very weird to see a preteen ScarJo. Apparently this was only her 3rd or 4th movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"What's a cute... smart, sexy, good-looking guy... Why haven't you slept with a girl for the last five years?"   WHAAAAAAAT? He's not smart, sexy, or good-looking. Does Elle Macpherson's character secretly have a brain injury or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ben Stiller has a supporting role as a "love interest" for Sarah Jessica Parker (an actress I've never liked), and his whole thing is that he is an artist with dreadlocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An actual pickup line from the movie: "I have herpes... but not down there." Really? I really want to bail on this movie, but I've come this far. And I'm something of a completest. I have to see it through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst part, well, one of the worst parts, is that this movie is only available for streaming on Crackle, so I'm having to watch it with ads. Some how there is still nearly half an hour left in this movie. It is painful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazingly, the movie is written and directed by the lead actor, Eric Schaeffer, who just so happens to have a make out/sex scene with Elle Macpherson. He's also a stalker creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a 90s "indie rom-com" If Lucy Fell on the recommendation of a friend from work. It's... really not good. It's one of those mid-90s Gen X movies that got made in the wake of Singles, and it's like When Harry Met Sally, but with completely unlikable characters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whpresscorps at the daily crisis response briefings should only ask questions of Pence, Fauci, and Birx. Trump only shows up every day to pick a fight with someone in the media. So just refuse to engage with him. We don't need to hear from him anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A reminder that the man in the White House with the nuclear codes has a disordered brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, it was not quite it. Fever has creeped back over the course of the day. No aches or chills, yet, though, which I'm hoping to keep at bay with medicine. Overall, still feel good, but know I'm not quite back to normal. Work is on hold until I'm fever-free 48 hrs./10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougrdickinson Yeah, last night was scary. I'm still going to keep tabs on myself for a bit, just to be safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if this was it, then I think it's pretty safe to say that it wasn't Covid-19 and just the flu. Zero respiratory issues the entire time. Basically a 24 hour bug. We'll see if it stays away for good. But right now, I feel fine./9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fever came down from that dangerous level slightly all night. I was sweating profusely in bed. Slept fitfully. Heat cranked in my apartment. I forgot to turn off my alarm for 5:30 this morning, so when I woke, I checked my temp again, and the fever was COMPLETELY GONE!/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night was an adventure. Chills came back last night with a vengeance. Sustained, full-body shivering uncontrollably for a solid 30 minutes. Exhausting. Puked up my dinner. Body was burning up. Fever spiked at 105.3! So I was determined to go to the hospital this morning./7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fever is down thanks to some Dayquil. My hips are very uncomfortable right now./6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wwcutie You too! I need to figure out something to watch for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwcutie Yeah. I'm gonna give it a day. See how things progress. I have a lot of cold&amp; flu meds as is just to be safe. I feel relatively normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwcutie  https://t.co/O68zalZnGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really not concerned at all right now given the lack of respiratory symptoms. Feel awful about work, though, thinking of how many things I touched there just yesterday. Anyway, will continue to update later. Everyone, listen to the professionals and be safe./5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fever is currently 101.7. If it gets much above 102 I will not hesitate to seek medical help. In the meantime, sheltering in place, hitting the fluids, and playing the wait and see game. Had been working all because we're considered "essential workers."/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talked to a woman at a nearby Walk-In clinic (don't currently have a Primary Care Physician, I know, I know) and they are not currently testing for Covid-19 but could test me more the flu. For now, I'm going to wait and monitor my symptoms and will seek care if I get worse./3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up this morning to a higher fever, (was 99.6 last night, peaked at 100.3). This morning it was 100.8. Should more, zero respiratory issues, so that is good. My mom went to the store and got me some Gatorade, OJ, Cold&amp;Flu meds, and vitamins./2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So last night after work I started getting cold chills, some aches, and a low grade fever. Was supposed to work today, but got someone else to cover my shift just to be on the safe side. Woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat./1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2020 is going to be like Season 4 of Community where we look back on it as "the gas leak year."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they had just won the one Super Bowl back in Super Bowl XXXVI, I would've always wanted more like any sports fan, but I would've been happy. I got six Super Bowls in 20 years. And Tom Brady was a HUGE part of that. So I have nothing but thanks for @TomBrady. #TB12 #GOAT /17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The prospect of Brady leaving hovered over this season, and back in December I resigned myself to the fact that he gets to go out on his own terms and dictate what he wants to do. He has given me &amp; every other Pats fan a lifetime of memories. I can be sad but I can't complain./16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted Tom Brady to retire a Patriot. I wanted him to play until he was 45 and defy the experts and critics and doubters who laughed at the notion. I don't want to have to share any of his legacy with another fanbase. I'm selfish like that I guess. But it's not my choice./15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The team is still solid. They still have the greatest coach of all time. And I'm actually a little excited for how creative he might look to get now. But Tom Brady leaving is a definite transition in franchise history and the closing of a door on a HUGE chapter./14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But my origins were still with those bad late-80s Patriots teams. I experienced the truly awful years. I was going to savor the good years and enjoy them for all they were worth for as long as they lasted. Because I had no idea when they would end, just that they would./13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew about the era-defining teams, the dynasties of all sports, and how they don't go on forever. I knew I was getting to experience something special. And I was determined to never take any of it for granted. Boston sports fans were 100% spoiled for the last 20 years./12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Brady is leaving, not retiring, but going to another team. Which sucks and is hard to accept, but it's the reality. I always knew that this wasn't going to last forever. I knew back in 2004 that I was experiencing the best years of my life as a fan, and it would end./11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That made FIVE Super Bowl wins for Brady and then he added a SIXTH for good measure two years later against the Rams. The greatest QB, the greatest coach, and arguably the greatest franchise put together the greatest run in NFL history and it latest for two full decades./10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I constantly laughed to myself and said, "I can't believe I get to root for this team, with this QB, with this coach." The "I can't believe this" aspect reached it's Alex in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history from down 28-3 to the Falcons two years later./9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Pats made it back to Super Bowl XLIX. Brady brought them back from down 10 in the 4th quarter against the vaunted Seahawks D and they miraculously won the game with Malcolm Butler's goal line INT. I couldn't believe it. In fact, I couldn't believe it for most of this run./8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brady tore his knee in '08 &amp; a few more years passed of the team being in the mix every year, they lost a nother Super Bowl, and it started to seem like it wasn't going to happen again. To that point, no QB in NFL history had gone more than 7 years between winning Super Bowls./7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>championships too. The Pats retooled in 2007 and took a run at history, and Brady, the game manager with ice in his veins, somehow turned into a superpowered elite QB. The season ended in the disappointment with the 18-1 record, something I'll never completely get over./6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inexplicably, they weren't done. Belichick and this kid, Tom Brady, along with a talented defense, churned out 2 more Super Bowls, 3 in 4 years. They became the model team of the league. Also, Boston sports in general started to improve during this time too. The Sox &amp; Cs won.../5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill Belichick was brought in he plucked a kid from the draft at #199 and installed him as the starter in his 2nd season and they went on a miraculous run that ended in winning Super Bowl XXXVI. That was the greatest/craziest sports moment of my life. I couldn't believe it./4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They got the #1 pick and took Drew Bledsoe. Bob Kraft bought the team and saved them from moving to St. Louis. They made Super Bowl XXXI against Hreen Bay and my hopes were dashed when they lost. Then things started to turn sour again. Sliding back to mediocrity. /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was 8, the team went 1-15 in 1989 under Rod Rust. The following year was considered a banner year because they went 6-10 and were the bad team "nobody wanted to play." These were my formative years as a Patriots fan. Everything changed when they brought in Parcells.../2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long, probably rambling, emotional thread on TB12... I started watching sports when I was a kid around age 7. The Patriots, for whatever reason, were the team I gravitated to the most, more than the Sox or the Cs, which is odd considering they were the worst of the bunch then. /1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously, how did Lupita Nyong'o not get nominated for Best Actress? #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister and her husband love to make fun of me for being obsessed with Joaquin Phoenix.

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Champ427 I'm starting to dare to believe that Parasite will win Best Picture, but they've had the anti-climactic endings so many times before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I appreciated your optimism, but I'm a stone-cold realist when it comes to this stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cast of #Parasite is all there, but what you don't know is that those seats were all for other people and one by one they wormed their way into those people's seats. (This joke only makes sense if you've seen the movie.) #Oscars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TIMELORD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't see Harriet, but Cynthia Erivo was good in Bad Times at the El Royale and Widows last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it back JUUUUUUST in time for @chris_onstage's favorite performer, Cynthis Erivo. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. Bathroom break commercials, which I should have done last commercial break. And the more I keep typing about it, the more time I'm wasting before they come back from the commercial break... #Oscars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 The sound in that movie is fantastic and really enhances the viewing experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie, @Grege333, I picked 1917 for both sound editing and mixing, but I was very tempted to say Ford v Ferrari.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OSCARS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHITE INDEED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah yes, in honor of it's *checks notes* 18th Anniversary, here is Eminem to perform "Lose Yourself." #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Bong, Taika, Greta, Noah... this portion of the Oscars is brought to you by my Top 20 of the year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @Grege333, it all comes down to Best Picture between us. If it's 1917, I win. If it's Parasite, we tie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, Laura Dern. Nice moment shouting out her parents. I also love how happy Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig were for her. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 They still have 3 songs to perform, the In Memoriam, a Academy President speech I'm sure, and a bunch of big winners they won't have the guts to play off. I say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, we are NAILING this #Oscars picks so far, @Grege333. @chris_onstage, not so much...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exit Through the Gift Shop, Life Itself, Won't You Be My Neighbor, and other docs that didn't even WIN and in some cases WEREN'T EVEN NOMINATED being used to introduce the Best Documentary Categories because they are so bad at this category. #SMH #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 No Country is definitely up there. So is Dark Knight and Fellowship of the Ring. But Tree of life is in my Top 4 movies of all time, so...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333  https://t.co/yxaHNonCcX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I almost don't care what happens the rest of the night. Bong Joon Ho won an Oscar for Parasite. I'm so happy. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please let this Best Original Screenplay win for Parasite be sign of things to come! #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BONGHIVE! #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 After I see it tomorrow, that is likely to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 That's easy, actually.  https://t.co/nv2FEo5OIZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should have all the original song nominees sing one anothers songs at the #Oscars. So maybe Randy Newman ends up having to sing "Into the Unknown" or something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My thoughts before/during Kobe's last game:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was cool.  https://t.co/zQXquuZGN2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great idea for a tribute throughout the league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kobe's impact on the 2008 Redeem Team is the greatest testament to Kobe's stature in the league and among the players and fans. The story of how he commanded the team in the clutch in the gold medal game vs. Spain is legendary.  https://t.co/hqiCVAMNvJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Celtics fan, I actively rooted against Kobe, but I was FASCINATED at what his post-playing career held. This sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kobe was a Hall of Fame NBA player. Today, he was dad taking his daughter to practice, sharing something he loved with someone he loved. Tragic. Truly heartbreaking. Just brutal. #RIPKobe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walterowensgrpa Yeah, really not the time. His 13-year-old daughter was also among the dead in the crash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww man, this is awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I shouldn't be this emotionally devastated by the death of a person I never even knew and actively rooted against as a player. But Kobe was a pillar of the game and was SUPPOSED to be an elder statesman of the game for years to come. This sucks so so much. Devastated. #RIPMamba.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kobe. I'm numb. Wow. Wow. Horrible. #RIPMamba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Point of the story? As much as I sometimes question WHY I even like to play fantasy football, last night was a reminder of how crazy and fun it can be, even if my team isn't involved. Also, plan for anything, even if the chances of it happening are minuscule. /End  https://t.co/C5V2Byx7aR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took over as Commish of this league 4 years ago, wrote up a whole constitution and changed the scoring to decimal points to try and avoid ties, so there is nothing in the language of the rules about playoff tiebreakers. So I end up using higher seed as the tiebreaker./7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game goes into OT. Philly wins the coin toss, marches down the field for nearly 5 minutes and scores s TD to win the game. Saquon never touches the ball after 8:50 to go in the 4th quarter. Dynasty playoff game, which scores to the hundredth decimal point, ends in a tie! /6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, Giants punt the ball away, Eagles come down and score to tie the game at 17-17. But there's still 1:53 left in regulation and Giants get the ball back. Giants go three and out, Saquon doesn't touch the ball. Philly gets the ball back with and ends up punting with :19 left./5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our league is 1/2 PPR. So a catch would put WWYS over the top. But the catch loses a yard, and in our league 1 yard = 0.1 points. So a loss of 1 yard is -0.1 points. So the play is a bet score of 0.4 for WWYS, which ties the game at 92.86!/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We get to late in the 4th quarter and WWYS is still down by .4 points, 92.86 to 92.46. Giants run a botched flea flicker on 3rd down that Barkley tosses back to Eli Manning, who is going to get sacked so he tosses it back to Barkley, which counts as a shovel pass./3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But WWYS has RB Saquon Barkley and WR Alshon Jeffery going Monday night. Seems like a forgone conclusion that WWYS is likely to advance. But hold up! Alshon Jeffery is carted off the field in the first half with a foot injury. 0.0 points from him. But WWYS still has Barkley. /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Craziest fantasy football story I've ever been involved in just happened in my dynasty football league. 1st round of the playoffs in Week 14. #3 seed Da Bomb Squad (DBS) vs. #6 seed Watch What You Saquon (WWYS). After Sunday, DBS is up 8.20 points./1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy Because the stuff that Giuliani was doing in Ukraine was personal to Trump. It is personally beneficial to Trump that his potential 2020 opponent is smeared and tarnished, it's the only way to make voting for Trump look appealing (by comparison).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh damn, Rep. Jackie Speier with the lone of the day. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMikeTurner's questioning about no one saying to Sondland that it was explicitly a quid pro quo would be a lot more effective if Mick Mulvaney hadn't said during a press conference that "Yes, it was a quid pro quo. Get over it." #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy And you don't need the public announcement, you can just move forward on it. They wanted the announcement for ads and to say Biden was under investigation during the campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy Has there ever been another example of Trump caring about corruption? Other than fretting about the corruption in his own back yard by all the people on his election campaign who plead guilty to crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as I'm concerned, that's the ballgame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amb. Sondland is testifying today. It could be one of the biggest testimonies in modern US history. I'm not even exaggerating. Impeachment of a president could depend on what happens over the next few hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lesmagrittes @EliseStefanik Again, great insight. Thank you for your contribution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriots D has stepped up. Love hearing the boo birds in Philly stands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik You wouldn't know TRUTH &amp; FACTS if it testified right in front of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_own_a_minivan I mean, to be fair, I guess someone on the VPs staff COULD be a Never Trumper...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jennifer Williams is a top adviser to VICE PRESIDENT Mike Pence. LOL. What a buffoon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pass interference is not going to be reviewable next year. Guarantee it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thread. This whole thing was a publicity stunt and a sham. Rushed and all details not nailed down. All of this is posturing, on both sides. It stopped being about football long ago. Kaepernick is not going to be an NFL QB again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik FOLLOW THE RULES, LADY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is a tacit admission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Myles Garrett deserves whatever suspension the #NFL hands down. And this is part and parcel of being an undisciplined team, which reflects VERY poorly on Freddie Kitchens. #Browns #BrownsVsSteelers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCasparriello @FCHWPO @celtics He put the work in. He's always put the work in, but he's definitely jumped up a level. I think Team USA experience helped. But he also learned/grew from coming off the bench last year. I've always loved his game and I'm glad he's putting it all together. Also, look at his FT%!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Celtics @FCHWPO in that 3rd quarter:  https://t.co/GgAiacuAco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaylen 4-4 to start the 3rd quarter after going 1-6 in the first half. He's putting it all together. #Celtics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Day 1 issues. I'm not too worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Odd. I know my Android software is up to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Hard to believe my Samsung Galaxy S10+ is incompatible, but here we are. #DisneyPlus  https://t.co/tc7pxKMevG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaylen's FT% is up. His handle is better. And his finish at the rim is better. Earning that extension and then some. #Celtics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey Booger, the Bengals "Big Base" defense is just a 5-2 front. It's one of the Madden base defenses in the playbook. Not exactly an exotic look. #MNF #PITvsCIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 For the Orange Buffoon, the words cam from his mouth, which makes it perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMasterOfLuck Also, watch the follow through of the defender, his intent was to lead with his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMasterOfLuck Yeah, it was a violent hit. Of course it was intentional, but not an intentional hit to the head. Watch it at full speed. He's a CB trying to tackle a 6-5, 240lb QB. And, if he pulls up and Allen breaks the tackle he looks like a fool. QB should slide and all this is avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMasterOfLuck I believe the rule about helmet to helmet was supposed to be leading with the crown of the helmet, changed for 2018. He lowered his shoulder, but runner going down (bang-bang play at full speed) resulted in the side of his helmet hitting him, not the crown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMasterOfLuck "A runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped." He was in the process of being tackled, but his forward progress was not stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMasterOfLuck No such thing as a defenseless runner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan Fouts really just say, "a viscous hit on a defenceless runner" on that hit on a running Josh Allen? Really? REALLY??? #BUFvsNE #NEvsBUF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Then she goes to the police to say Frank could die and asking them to shut down the Kumite. Then she just drops that and shows up for the final fight and cheers him on, alongside Forrest Whitaker and the other dude who are trying to bring back an AWOL Frank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Having said that, I question her agency throughout the movie. She sleeps with him on the first date. Goes undercover as an escort (??) to get into the Kumite and then she pulls out a recorder in open sight of everyone!?!?!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Women have agency, Greg! They're not just property to barter over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, you're not going to believe it, but that's the only acting credit for the teen who played young Frank Dux.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta say, @grege333, rewatching Bloodsport, there are some problematic aspects in 2019: 1. The black fighter who fights like a monkey. 2. Frank makes a wager with Hossein on who gets Janice, as if she has no say in the matter and has already said no to Hossein's advances.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoodSpooder 1. A city where humans/prey and pokemon/predators live in harmony. 2. Said harmony is upset by weird underground drug that makes predators/pokemon dangerous. 3. A person in position of power is behind the whole thing.  Yeah, I don't see it either...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Did we middle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenase21 That's how I think it goes down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenase21 Fire can't kill Dany (The Unburnt). But he could totally warg into Drogon and take out her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki and then kill Drogon. I think they have to clear them off the board in the finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netw3rk @MalloryRubin seems pretty clear that Dany has to go after Ep. 5. But they have to clear the board of the Unsullied, Dothraki, and Drogon too, right? I think we finally see Bran warg into a dragon and eliminate Dany's forces in the finale. #AskTheMaester<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watched Dr. Strangelove over the weekend. I've always loved it, but it used to have moments that would make me drowsy (mainly the bomber crew scenes). That's no longer the case. It's firmly in my Top 5 Movies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"That 'f***in' nobody'... is John Wick. He once was an associate of ours. They call him 'Baba Yaga.'  "The Boogeyman?"  "Well John wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the f***ing Boogeyman."   "Oh."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I heard you struck my son."  "Yes, sir, I did."  "And may I ask why?"  "Yeah, well, because he stole John Wick's car, sir, and, uh, killed his dog."  [Pause]  "Oh."  #JohnWick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have two Dany-related concerns/questions about the last two episodes of #GameofThrones: 1. What happened to all the talk about her breaking the wheel? 2. The whole "Dany can't have children... or can she?" discussion has been completely dropped as an idea from this last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 It's like that then, huh? Ok. I also say Hellboy makes $14 million this weekend.  And as a bonus, I also say Little outperforms Hellboy .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Congratulations. I do my predictions on the pod. I have a lead and I'm not messing with it. 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 You don't have the pedigree to claim that. You're more like the '18-'19 Celtics repeatedly saying, "We've solved our problems/We'll turn it on in the playoffs when it counts."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 *Walter Sobchek voice* Still closer than you were... *End Walter voice*  And if we're counting wins and losses, you're on the board but you didn't close the gap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Waaay under. That RT% took a nosedive over the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I mean, let's be honest, you got on the board (finally), but I won the week. You were closer on the under-performing Pet Sematary, but I nailed my Shazam! prediction! Better take your extended victory lap now while you can. Might not get another chance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We already know how it started. You and your administration told a bunch of lies, acted erratically, and were super sketchy on things related to Russia.

<|startoftext|>Jussie Smollett charges dropped and wiped from his record, and case is sealed. That seems suspicious. Did the cops screw up something procedurally that would've meant the case got thrown out or something? Why is he letting them keep his $10k bond?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy And if not, we would have a Congress that would check him. Currently, we don't have a responsible executive and the legislative that isn't interested in making tough votes, so the executive assumes that power vacuum by default.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy Of course I can't remember which pod it was I was listening to, but one of them was talking about read Madison or something and realizing the assumption of the Founding Fathers was that a reasonable, responsible person would be elected president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy We're seeing how much we relied on institutional norms rather than laws. A lot of the norms are going to need to be codified going forward. They're loopholes for him because he's not behaving how any president has behaved before, and because Congress has ceded so much power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy We are a nation of laws. This is actually fundamental to the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution. I'm not one for hyperbole. This is a big deal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cware10 @BlacKardKD @MarcJSpearsESPN There's a lot of angles to both sides that can't be properly summed up in tweets. But the media, the players, the agents, and the league share blame in this area.   I think this all gets back to people not reacting to KD going to Golden St. the way he thought they would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cware10 @BlacKardKD @MarcJSpearsESPN Part of the reason Kyrie went off last week was because he addressed his situation in the preseason and then kept getting asked about it over and over and things came to a head last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cware10 @BlacKardKD @MarcJSpearsESPN He singled out Ethan Strauss by name. Is he someone who falsely creates stories? They're reporting on the league. Some of them can be jackals about it (Hello Boston, NY media), but that's a side-effect of having a star-driven league with emphasis on player movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cware10 @BlacKardKD @MarcJSpearsESPN Oh the media is ridiculous, but KD is also notoriously a little thin-skinned. Remember the fake Twitter accounts? And also, when pretty much everyone is resigned to the fact that your team is going to win the title anyway, why should his play matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlacKardKD @MarcJSpearsESPN I understand that, but it's a package deal. The questions he's getting now come with the path he chose to walk down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 Yeah, thanks for the tip. I'll be sure to look up this word I've NEVER EVER heard of before. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 And making these strained connections that have clear leaps in logic do nothing to defeat and fight back the MAGA Hatters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 I'm not making excuses for them. I'm saying they shouldn't cover themselves in black paint. But "Crazies" doesn't make me think KKK, it makes me think Duke (which is only slightly a step up). One doesn't prove the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 My point is not the defend these teens, but that there is plenty of substantive stuff to take issue with regarding these students and their behavior/culture without having to squint our eyes, tilt our heads, and manufacture something like CCC = KKK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 Which makes more sense: HS student section mimicking a college student section that uses alliteration with the same exact word or HS student section uses that alliteration because it will be a secret subtle reference to the KKK because "C" and "K" sound alike?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDrumpf @mrFawkes51 My point about the use of "Crazies" more likely derived from Duke's Cameron Crazies and not for sounding alliterative like the KKK is moot because they wore blackface? Um, ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I thought the CGI overall was good, but some places it was surprisingly shoddy. I'm forgetting which parts though. Slightly inconsistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrFawkes51 I think you're reading more into the Crazies thing than is there. Duke fans call themselves the Cameron Crazies, which I can see kids trying to copy. Also, their fans paint themselves in blue head to toe. Obviously, if your school colors are black, it's not wise to emulate that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 I will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Kamara has the best case, but his numbers are inflated by TDs, which fluctuate year to year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Strongly disagree. His consistency puts him above those guys for me. Guaranteed 300+ touches and 10 TDs. Kamara is the best case, but Elliott is getting 50+ more touches. Gordon misses time. All are great, but splitting hairs, give me the guy who is the workhorse. And Conner? No.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@undertheskiin A guy walked in to a movie late, sat at the end of the same row I was in. Talked to his wife when she walked in. Took a phone call on his bluetooth later on. Then finally fell asleep toward the end and started snoring. Loudly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ExtremistIndy @subpoenaduece @desiredone72 @BarkleyPeigi @brithume I didn't say our government. I said the Mueller investigation. They have had hardly any leaks of information from Mueller and his team since the investigation began. Mueller and his team have been way ahead of whenever there has been breaking news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333  https://t.co/c360bCvQpT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTexaspatriot @BarkleyPeigi @brithume Oh, sorry, you have a nice day as well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTexaspatriot @BarkleyPeigi @brithume 1. Isn't required but still helpful to know as a voter whether someone running for the highest office in the land is compromised in any way financially or could be leveraged. That's basic common sense.  2. "If it's what you say it is, I love it."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExtremistIndy @subpoenaduece @desiredone72 @BarkleyPeigi @brithume And what exactly have we heard from the Mueller investigation for the most part if not... crickets? Mueller's investigation has been very close to the vest and usually months ahead of leaked news. I wouldn't hang your hat on anything until after his report comes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTexaspatriot @BarkleyPeigi @brithume Undisclosed tax returns, unknown financial entanglements, a refusal to be critical of Putin, computer chatter between a Russian bank and a server in Trump Tower, the Don Jr. meeting with Russian officials in Trump Tower... not as catchy a tune, but just as serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@subpoenaduece @desiredone72 @BarkleyPeigi @brithume Well, you know, it's like Putin said in Helsinki, just hand over Mike McFaul and Bill Browder and they'll think about it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desiredone72 @BarkleyPeigi @brithume Unless they are handed over, not much Mueller can do on that front. But indicting them is doing what he is supposed to do and at the very least their actions against the US are now public knowledge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Which is the#NeverTrump position. No matter what good he may actually happen to stumble upon doing while in office it does not change who he is, someone unfit for office. So #NeverTrump did not end on Election Day 2016.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican You don't know me well enough to know whether I like Kavanaugh or not. You don't know what you're talking about. And you still haven't answered my question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican You're still not answering my question. Did anything she said de-legitimize her story? Not that we know. Did anything he said cast douby on his own narrative? Yes. Ergo, she was more credible, if ever so slightly. Feelings literally do not factor into that. How is this hard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican Is how he defined "Boofing" accurate? Is how he defined "The Devil's Triangle" accurate? Is his characterization of the statements from Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser accurate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican Keep calling it emotional all you want, but those are questionable answers that he gave. And I don't know if she gave any questionable answers because the FBI hasn't investigated her claims, which I think is a perfectly reasonable request.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican No. He said the three other people mentioned deny the event took place. That is a false. They said they did not recall, which is different than saying it didn't happen. As a judge, he knows that. Also, his Boofing and Devil's Triangle answers strain credulity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican No, the FBI was not so bad that they missed any hint of Ford's allegations because they were never mentioned to anyone outside of her therapist and husband before 2012. They're investigators, not psychics. As to the Yale&amp;Avenatii accusers, I'm more skeptical, but need more info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican I'm being told I'm having an emotional reaction by a guy with "Angry" in his Twitter handle? He was misleading in his statements yesterday. She has not been shown to be misleading as of yet. There's nothing emotional about that analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tominphx2011 @blackrepublican Does the "B" stand for "bot"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsdeepsea Weak sauce play on words. She contacted her representative before he was even nominated. If he wasn't nominated, this likely never even comes out in the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitterclingerpa Was it within the FBI's scope when they did it with Clarence Thomas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tominphx2011 @blackrepublican That's pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAngryChris @blackrepublican Well, that and his lies, obfuscations, and refusal to answer questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themanfronUNCLE She answered questions. Admitted when she didn't know something. She did not evade or filibuster like Kavanaugh did with his answers or stall or get flustered like he did ("I like beer... I like beer..."). She was knowledgeable about the science and psychology of her situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitterclingerpa They have not looked into the claims of Dr. Ford. They performed background checks on Judge Kavanaugh but this obviously did not come up because it was never reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sen. Kennedy should keep reading to Matthew 23:27: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness." #KavanaughConfirmation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ultimately, I think Kavanaugh should not be confirmed because of his views on the expansive power of the executive branch, which was the primary reason that Trump nominated him. /End<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As for the other accusers, the Avenatii client accusation sounds less credible than the other two allegations. /16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because of all of that, I believe Ford more than I believe Kavanaugh. I think we will never know the truth, but I think Ford is closer to where the truth lies. /15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kavanaugh lied every time he said that the other three people mentioned in Dr. Ford's account refute the assault. They have said that they do not recall. There is a big difference in a legal sense between denial and not recalling. As a judge, Kavanaugh knows that. /14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, from what I have gathered online, "Boofing" and "The Devil's Triangle" [do NOT look them up] are not what Kavanaugh described them as. /13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His assertion that he never got blackout drunk when he was younger does not seem believable to me, nor the weak stomach defense. As for a fondness of drinking, this read this thread:  https://t.co/SDg1cbRKPl /12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kavanaugh's indignation at what his family has endured was also believable and understandable, but I think his combativeness was something that was ill-fitting and not something that came naturally to him. I thought he dodged on a lot of the questions asked of him. /11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Ford came across as credible &amp; believable, her inconsistent memory but vivid details about certain aspects of the night rings true to me. Don't know if she is 100% accurate in her depiction (memory is not infallible), but I don't believe that her story is fabricated. /10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am no fan of Cory Booker, but at least he understood the purpose of the hearing when it was his time to question Kavanaugh and made the most of it. Until the end when he started speechifying. /9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Lindsey Graham should be ashamed of himself. /8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a sexual crimes prosecutor handle their questions of Ford was probably the least bad option available to this all-male and very old Republican membership of the committee. But it was also another illustration of them passing the buck when it comes to doing their jobs. /7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate, hate, hate when these senators are allotted five minutes and spend the majority of it pontificating rather than asking questions, which is the whole point of the Hearing.  /6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Judge not testifying is a joke. /5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the flip side, I think it is also absolutely reasonable to ask the FBI to look into this and report back to the committee. /4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feinstein's actions do not change the veracity of Dr. Ford's story, though. She did reach out about Kavanaugh before he was even nominated, hoping to get this information to someone so someone else would be nominated. /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First things first, I think there is some validity to Feinstein being blamed for sitting on this for so long. She could've given this information over to the committee earlier and still maintained Ford's confidentiality. /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread on the #KavanaughHearing Watched and listened to almost the entire Kavanaugh Hearing today. I've reserved my judgment on a lot of this until hearing both of these people speak. A lot thoughts... /1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm not a fan of Booker, but unlike practically every other senator up there today, he made the most of his five minutes afforded to question Kavanaugh. #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kavanaugh being combative is ill-fitting. #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll ask again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats spending their time grandstanding and putting their best foot forward for 2020 rather than asking Blasey Ford questions. Bad look. Not as bad as GOP outsourcing their questions, but still bad.<|endoftext|>

I do not think they will do this, though, because they are not smart and the Trump strategy is almost always to double down and deny. Full steam ahead more likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems poor political calculus. I think casting aside Kavanaugh is their best chance to retain control of Congress in November. SCOTUS is a bigger voting issue for GOP than Dems and mid-terms are generally bad for party in power. Chance to turn out base in mid-term.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Schmovie The Ramens of the Day #DormRoomSchmovies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All told, I'm really pleased with my team. Got some great values I didn't expect to be available. Some of the other guys I was Skyping with during the draft were less than impressed with my team, but I think Elliott is a workhorse. My WRs are DEEP. Reliable QB and steady TE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myheadisarocket Yeah, I thought about it, but whatevs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... and Ross goes 3 picks before when I would've taken him. Ugh. On tilt, ended up passing on handcuff of Zeke for upside of Moore, but not even sure I want to keep him in light of some others that went undrafted. Still, if my biggest mistake in in the 15th/16th, not bad.  https://t.co/Vs7NViSS7T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is where I made my worst mistake of the draft. I thought it'd be fine to take a K one round early and live with getting one of a few options I'd be ok with (Aaron Jones, John Ross, or Rod Smith to handcuff Elliott). Jones goes six picks later...  https://t.co/T56guj0JSt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our league scores DEF/ST differently than standard. Still not worth reaching in the 8th for a D, but 14th instead of 15th is fine. Also, @Chris_OnStage made back to back picks of backup TE and QB in the form of Austin Hooper and Sam Darnold. SMH.  https://t.co/2oHrqW2KxX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normally I'd be OK not taking a 2nd QB, but the Mahomes team was on autodraft and still didn't have a QB. Smith was great last year and I think he'll be pretty good this year too. Plus Brees and Smith both have early bye weeks. Did this with an eye to trades possibly.  https://t.co/MubPmEC27J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting toward the later rounds, I decided to take a shot on Mike William's, who has generated a lot of buzz in camp. Debated whether to take Theo Riddick or Aaron Jones.  https://t.co/vP9KIPkNw9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw Mack go last round so I decided not to wait on Wilkins, who sounds like he could win the job in Indy. Also, the guy who has already taken TWO QBs and a DEF/ST took the first kicker. @Grege333, make sure he pays! And Marquis Lee is taken by someone e unaware he'll be on IR.  https://t.co/CqwxHnQQ9d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After taking Aaron Rodgers at pick 13, my friend @Chris_OnStage grabbed his DEF/ST in the 10th. And then three others follow suit. There are no words. After missing on Barber, I needed RB depth, so I took a gamble on Montgomery. Should get at least passing work in GB.  https://t.co/hCzDHC6LU1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Crowder. I think he's going to be a popular target for a checkdown QB like Alex Smith. But I wanted to take Peyto. Barber for RB depth, rolled the dice, and got burned by it.  https://t.co/YjKCTPBN6V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ended up taking Brees as the 8th QB off the board. This was the round I targeted a QB based on previous years, but did not expect him and doubted he'dbe available next round. Was quietly hoping for Wilson, who was QB1 last year in our scoring system.  https://t.co/coes8YBn9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't trust Burkhead's health or situation to pick him this high, though I could be wrong. Collins was the best available RB at this point to me. Not sold on him though. Shocked Matt Ryan was the 5th QB off the board. No value in that pick. I wanted Duke Johnson.  https://t.co/PDLWUT4Shd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our league showed (relative) restraint by waiting until the 4th for the 2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th QBs to come off the board. I intended to take Miller, but Baldwin felt like too big a value to pass up. Should have a huge target share and I'm not worried about the knee.  https://t.co/jE4VDCQNnx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was hoping to get Howard, but went the puck before me. Considered Diggs and Evan's, but went Hilton because he could be a top 10 guy with a healthy Luck. Freeman and Henry seemed like reached here.  https://t.co/PwJHenihLs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda shocked I had my pick of Thomas and Green at 21. Guess that happens when someone take Rodgers at 13, Gronk 18, and McKinnon 20. I don't believe in McKinnon that high.  https://t.co/eMmehAA5nF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was content to get one of the top 4 RBs. Elliott was a no-brainer though Brown was enticing. No huge surprises in the 1st round, except maybe the absence of Julio.  https://t.co/wTMDobQz6e<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Eesh. Is it Dez Bryant time? 😕 Maybe we should check into the validity of those Randall Cobb rumors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys, let's cut him some slack. Sure both Bushes and Obama put out moving statements about McCain. This tweet here is all there is from Trump. He's telling us that a short tweet is the deepest sympathy and respect that he is capable of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evergreen tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ffbcoach If someone is going to take a QB in the 1st round I want that guy in my league. Just make sure the Commish got his money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ffbcoach The guy also autodrafted Brady with his 2nd pick. That's not going against the grain or being contrarian. That's just screwing around and it accomplishes nothing except wasting everyone else's time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nate_Bowers  https://t.co/Yuocw9c9y4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage LOL,, we all have our fantasy skeletons in the closet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monkeys_la Take a QB after 7 or 8 other teams have already picked a QB. That could be the 7th. Could be later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monkeys_la Are you in a 10 team or 12 team league? If you're in a 10-team, take a QB after 7 or 8 have come off the board already. If it's a 12-team, take one after 9 to 10 QBs have already been taken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage Ok, Greg's QB drafting history, 2008-2017: 08: Derek Anderson (6th) 09: Rodgers (3rd) 10: Romo (4th) 11: Roethlisberger (7th) 12: Brees (1st) 13: Stafford (10th) 14: Rivers (10th) 15: Brady (9th) 16: Rivers (8th) 17: Carr (8th) Combined record: 66-57-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monkeys_la QB is deep and every league is different. Just keep an eye on where the rest of the teams are taking QBs and just take someone ranked in the 9-12 range. You want to stock up on RBs/WRs until then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage 08: Shayne Graham (12th) 09: Gostkowski (13th) 10: Kaeding (14th) 11: Kaeding (15th) 12: Gostkowski (14th) 13: Gostkowski (13th) 14: Gostkowski (13th) 15: Gostkowski (12th) 16: Vinatieri (14th) 17: Bryant (13th)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage Combined records from 2008-2017: Me: 64-58-2 Chris: 55-68-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage My QB drafting history, 2008-2017: 08: Cutler (7th) 09: Ryan (7th) 10: Flacco (6th) 11: Romo (4th) 12: Rodgers (1st) 13: Newton (5th) 14: Brady (9th) 15: Newton (9th) 16: Luck (5th) 17: Luck (10th)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 BTW, here is the QB drafting history of one @Chris_OnStage, 2008-2017: 08: Manning (1st) 09: Manning (2nd) 10: Rivers (6th) 11: Rivers (3rd) 12: Newton (3rd) 13: Brady (3rd) 14: Manning (1st) 15: Rodgers (2nd) 16: Rodgers (2nd) 17: Rodgers (1st)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 Oh yeah. For sure. I've been trying to remind myself when to take a QB in our league compared to where they go in mocks. Otherwise, someone is going to take their QB2 before I take my QB1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 @Chris_OnStage You'd think after all the years of not winning that he would realize that it doesn't pay to take a QB in the 1st round. You'd think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grege333 No no. Not pick #12. Pick #2. 1.2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been doing all of my mock drafting for fantasy football on FantasyPros. Decided to do one on ESPN just now and some idiot took Rodgers with pick 1.2. Nice reminder why I wasn't doing this on ESPN with other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all the people on Twitter tonight trashing John McCain, I dare you to say that to President Obama's face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NifMuhammad Or maybe take it in the context of the whole town hall as opposed to the clip. He gave a similar answer to someone else who was "scared" of a possible President Obama before that woman.  https://t.co/la3JkkVMbp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He's a decent family man" was an answer that he was giving to shut down people who were buying I to crazed conspiracy theories about his opponent and he was having none of it.  https://t.co/la3JkkVMbp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who take the "He's not an Arab, he's a decent family man" comment as McCain saying Arabs aren't decent people are just wrong. The woman commenting is saying Arab as a pejorative and he is shutting her down. Look how quickly he moves on from her. He won't have it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The death of John McCain is at least giving me the opportunity to figure out who I can unfollow for either tweeting horrible remarks or retweeting other people's horrible remarks. Some people are ghouls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fhelvie I actually think they booked that match perfectly. Even though the crowd would've loved it, they couldn't have Braun cash in last night.

<|startoftext|>@MatthewJGeek @MoviePass Yeah, remember when they started charging "random" subscribers $99 a month? That was SO awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamuelAAdams Huge if true...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scarequotes Instead, under Mitch Lowe, they jacked the cost up on some subscribers to $99 then canceled that but raised it to $40 or $50 depending on where you lived. Then they went in the complete opposite direction with the $9.95 pricing. Yo-yoed constsntly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scarequotes I made sure I got my money's worth out of it, typically going to 5-6 movies per month. If they had made a tiered plan of $20, $30 and maybe $40 then I think people would've paid for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scarequotes I've had MoviePass for 5+ years. I paid $30/mo for the majority of that time. It was still s good deal then. The $9.95 move never made sense to me. Mitch Lowe killed it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@divine_count our back and forth earlier got me thinking. Not interested in revisiting it; rather, genuinely curious your thoughts on Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver and Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Both of them were 12-13 when those movies were filmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divine_count @deplorableKael @RodStryker It's not child exploitation. You're barking up the wrong tree. Like you said earlier, we're talking in circles, so I think we're done here. Have a nice day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. This is 1000% accurate and what I have been saying for years.  https://t.co/GG7Juu4vpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deplorableKael @divine_count @RodStryker Is it ever ok for child rape to be an episode of a TV show to bring attention to it? I don't watch the show, but would it be out of bounds for a show like Law &amp; Order: SVU to have an episode like that? Would casting a child be inappropriate there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divine_count @RodStryker And if you really find that sketch so objectionable, then the onus is on her parents for allowing her to do it. Of course I don't think she necessarily grasps everything going on, but her parents are the ones with the mental agency to grasp that. They're responsible for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divine_count @RodStryker Your rage is misdirected. Maybe throw it toward the parents who subject their kids to these twisted beauty pageants and the people who run them rather than the people who are pointing out how weird they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divine_count @RodStryker Child pageants are creepy, and the fact that a show like Toddlers &amp; Tiaras was on for 7 (SEVEN!!!!) seasons tells me that not enough people saw this Tom Hanks thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodStryker This was s parody of the reality TV show Toddlers &amp; Tiaras. If you don't get the purpose of this comedy then you're being willfully obtuse.   https://t.co/2dx036hhzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevonaWilson9 @RodStryker It's a parody of a reality show called Toddlers &amp; Tiaras. I can't believe this needs explaining.  https://t.co/2dx036hhzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divine_count @RodStryker Erm...  you're totally missing the point. It's a comedy spoof of a reality series called Toddlers &amp; Tiaras, which I can't believe is/was a show. Which is the point of the video.  https://t.co/2dx036hhzF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wrote about #FirstReformed, a challenging, provocative, but also meditative film.  https://t.co/FaFS3T6KAh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I actively disliked this movie. #JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom  https://t.co/rbsVrJqCVu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaineMummy The whole thing is stupid and has gotten so much more attention than it deserves. And probably needlessly helps Trump in the long run because it plays into his grievance poltics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics I have google. I now know who he is/was. I'm not interested in this conversation. I have actual work to do. In short I'd say that Earnest was as cavalier with his lying and defending a terrible person I'd be ok with that too. That was the last question you get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics I stand by what I said in that I shed no tears for Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And if someone doesn't want to bake you a cake you shouldn't want a cake from them anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics Yes, I'm aware, which is why I ound it odd you were saying "You can't refuse..." in your initial argument. And I already gave my opinion. I think operating a business and refusing to serve anyone and take their money is a calculated business risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics Remains to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics But there's a difference between legal and socially acceptable. Anyway, I've said my peace/piece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics Who says I'm opposed to it? If you want to refuse yourself business and possibly lose your company for not accepting other people's money, then by all means go ahead. People can have the right to run their business poorly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics And there it is. You're not interested in having a conversation, you're just interested in the rightness of your point of view. Have a good day. (Go Pats/Celts/Sox)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BostonFanatics (And here comes the test of whether a nuanced conversation can actually be had on social media...)<|endoftext|>
