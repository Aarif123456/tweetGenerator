<|startoftext|>@DCovfefeLoomis but what is disgusting is people like  you that enable him and give him the power to kill 100k people and he WILL destroy the USA, because he is engineered that way and that is in his nature, and you will help him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCovfefeLoomis all his workers to, and many of which he never paid.  This is the example of how he has always run his businesses.  He is such a crook and he continues to be.

<|startoftext|>@DCovfefeLoomis You do sound very well educated. I am confused by your standpoints espoused on your Twitter feed.

<|startoftext|>@DestructiveChem @tonyposnanski cheeseberder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci Understand that Trump's goal is to kill as many people as possible.  It doesn't matter to him who they are.  It could be his followers or anyone.  It isn't just the USA, it is the world.  I am praying for one of those little viruses to fly up his nose. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResisterForever Barr will arrest Obama and Biden before the election.  They are unfolding fake info right now, check out fox news propagandists, what happens after that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddowBlog  https://t.co/QFfWZ1rkiT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika @Twitter Now you may be perplexed about why he is trying to kill his followers ("inject a disinfectant") and can't wait to start his rallies.  He knows he doesn't need them to win the next election, he is that confident in the rigging of the election that he will win.  #MAGA #trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika @Twitter They told Trump that if he could manage to kill between 100k and 200k he would be a total success, thus his statement awhile back about this.  Now that he has killed 92k  he gets a merit badge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika @Twitter Pompeo, Miller etc. realized in January that the virus would be the perfect way to get rid of the poor, the sick and the old.   It would create enough chaos to put the final bullet in our democracy.  They told Trump it would be great for him and make him money, so Trump was in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika @Twitter If you were Trump and you wanted to kill as many people as possible, what would you do?  It is exactly what he is doing.  That is why he said that so many Americans dying on his watch is a "badge of honor".  He is proud that he could kill that many people.  #TrumpLiesPeopleDie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jdawsey1 You know how you can tell if @realDonaldTrump is lying?  His lips are moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoGonx @thehill I agree. @realDonaldTrump was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which often makes the person incapable of having empathy for others.  His parents realized this, sent him to military school and avoided him while he was growing up. He has literally gotten away with mass murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@File411 Unrelated...but I was wondering if you have any research into QAnon?  There seems to be a disturbing growth in their numbers and propaganda.  White House definitely involved with their agenda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RAMRANTS Kavanaugh has demonstrated he doesn't think a law should be followed if it doesn't follow his beliefs, he commited perjury during hearings and he met with Trump's lawyers to make a deal that if he was confirmed he would make sure Trump wasn't indicted. #StopKanavaugh #Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradwvudozer @Kathryn76743665 @JohnnyRox12 @Dax_x98 @realDonaldTrump He is getting paid, but he says it is being donated.   This could be a lie, it would be good to follow up with the charities.<|endoftext|>
