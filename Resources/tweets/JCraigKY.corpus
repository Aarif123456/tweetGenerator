<|startoftext|>Always keep your head up, because if it's down you won't be able to see the blessings that have been placed in your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A positive attitude gives you power over your circumstances, instead of your circumstances having power over you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We must throw #PCintheTrash because it continues to put lives at risk and threatens the security of our nation. #RedNationRising 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before you call it a night, each evening start turning your worries over to God. He's going to be up all night anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you try to figure out everything, you're exalting your reasoning above God's thoughts and plans for your life. Be patient. Have faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandering for Hispanic votes, because it’s okay to destroy America as long as your party succeeds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The irony is hilarious with these uninformed morons. MT “@SwankAshley: @obamaislazy2 Plus, I'm 18.. Unlike you minimum wage working losers”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could've stopped after think. RT “@jennsright:  so obvious @SwankAshley doesn't think for herself”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley @ConserveTruth13 You obviously have not been watching or you'd know all this. A trial's been going on. Pay attn w/o blinders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome. RT “@imWhatYouNeedx3:  but as an adult I can state my opinion without being disrespectful. I'm just saying.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley @ConserveTruth13 No, but you and I were not there in that specific situation. The facts dictate self defense though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL! Yeah okay. MT “@SwankAshley: you're the one that sounds stupid supporting a murderer. I bet you didn't even go to college! Bye, fool!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. Her understanding a tweet or a trial makes her so too. RT “@obamaislazy2: @SwankAshley I like her $ sign. Means she's smart.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley @ConserveTruth13 Of course not. Unless one is slamming your head on the pavement. Then by all means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@imWhatYouNeedx3 Not all, but the majority who flooded my TL &amp; tweeted vile comments certainly are. You were cordial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley Just stop. You're embarrassing yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah that's it. Yep. RT “@PuchiL5:  im beginning to think you dont even know what you meant hahahaha”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@mami_chique Yes, emotions get the best of many of us. Again, God bless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley @ConserveTruth13 Wasn't meant to be. It summarized his way of life. You know the things the media keeps from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@imWhatYouNeedx3 Actually, it was the clear definition of self-defense. Prosecution never proved it wasn't. We will wait &amp; see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to hear your expert opinion. RT “@imWhatYouNeedx3:  you want to defend yourself, you shoot someone in the leg! not kill them!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SwankAshley No, but again your lack of understanding any of this is not surprising. Stupid, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course! RT “@greekkid31:  that's you're clearly a #RACIST. Duh. Your white. U hate all black people or something.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@mami_chique No problem. Thank you. A joke that summarized a lot that's gone on in this trial hit more than a nerve that's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThugLife RT “@ConserveTruth13: @SwankAshley Cause guns, weed, burglary, and breaking noses is how Trayvon rolled.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These TM supporters have been completely Butthurt over a tweet that simply summarized what's gone on in this trial. What am I missing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, but comprehend as you'd like. RT “@PuchiL5:  i get it i get it.. TM smoked pot and ate skittles so his supporters will as well.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God bless you. RT “@mami_chique:  lol. Bye, sweetie.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO that too! RT “@jennsright:  LOL...I read "they live to STAY racist". Freudian”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I shouldn't have to explain that if you've followed the trial. Comprehension skills. Learn them. MT “@SwankAshley: why would u ask that?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trayvon Martin supporters who invaded my TL today. RT “@KristinaRibali: Who is racist?  http://t.co/UY0jbfnyQg”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. We rock, especially in basketball. MT “@mami_chique: You people from Kentucky are lame. Are u upset that ppl forget your state exists?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's basic comprehension if one followed the trial. RT “@PuchiL5:  no need to explain. sorry i cant keep up with complex thoughts of a CEO.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you miss the question mark? RT “@SwankAshley: but why would you assume that supporters are just sitting at home smoking weed?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth. RT “@ryanek9freak:  Just by the fact that they think Treyvon is different because of skin color, proves who the racists are.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theRealConnells @DaRealBuccaneer LOL. I know right. Truly bright they are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today was crazy! I was having @ToddKincannon type of hate. You know shit got serious up in here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. I'm just a White guy. RT “@DaRealBuccaneer:  fuck you wigger”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hate that comes from the prog left or AKA Trayvon Martin supporters is never ending. Amusing at times, but they love to say racist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a play on many things.Crazy I need 2 explain this. MT “@PuchiL5: thats like generalizing all GZ supporters as overzealous rent-a-cops.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that was a question. RT “@SwankAshley:  it's a fact that his supporters are sitting at home eating skittle and smoking weed?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a racist comment made. KKK? That's the Dems. RT “@Its_Mikey_Evans:  hell yeah racist.. Seem to me it's like you running the KKK..”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@JohnnaBelleXoXo No cowards here. No silencing act either. I'll continue to say what the hell I want. Don't like it? Move along. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TrackStarMarcus See. All good. Much love. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilarious! MT “@Pericolo1021: All TM supporters are learning to read and write, to get a made up witness to actually do some good for him.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SoftbalGrind_11 Tons of people getting complete #ButtHurt because they can't face facts or reality of what was 'already' stated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@imWhatYouNeedx3 Hispanic cracker defended himself. Period. Nothing else was proven. Those are the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO! RT “@ryanek9freak: @shellyma21  Oh look an egg avi.  That's racist.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classy. RT “@DaRealBuccaneer:  you a bitch...yo moma needs to be raped”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome. God bless you. RT “@TrackStarMarcus: I think this man @conservJ is really retarded 😂😂”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coward? Huh? It's called free speech sweetheart. RT “@JohnnaBelleXoXo:  Of course you would say that smh God bless your coward ass soul :)”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, TM fans are. MT “@PuchiL5: #purefuckery RT @conservJ: Hey TM supporters: Are y'all smoking weed &amp; eating skittles as you wait to riot?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have. Plus, I'll speak on anything. MT “@VixkzjbszmXuh: don't speak on Detroit or Chicago if you've probably never been to either city”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's quite amusing I must say. RT “@bebessax3_:   tweets &gt; haha. I'm just dying over these people .”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL. RT “@nopenochange: @_ZayNeverDies   a rapper and thug in Detroit has a much better chance to be deleted sooner bruh!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Racist? Lol ok. RT “@Its_Mikey_Evans:  then what are you Zimmerman supporters smoking on.. Seems to me y'all doing crack and being racist”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, riots are for jackwagons. MT “@mami_chique: so I can have my teaching license yanked? No. I'll leave the bafoonery to your jackass.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@KIENDYGURL @TIAAKABVD Yes, preach complete ignorance &amp; your total lack of comprehension of what a tweet means plus reality. Carry on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True story. RT “@LiberalTheory:  And if #Zimmerman was an illegal MSM would bury this story”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@1855ChokeABitch No dumbass! It's called playing off of facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know you or know what you've done. RT “@1855ChokeABitch:  Oh I forgot let me guess I am just a wannabe thug.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TIAAKABVD @KIENDYGURL Definitely not racist, but I'll oblige and speak to any man. I'm glad you love Rednecks. That's awesome. I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like the Prosecution. It's called speaking based on facts. RT “@SwankAshley:  You sound so stupid!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TL has blown up! The crazies take their pot &amp; skittles serious these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TIAAKABVD Stop being stupid. Not illegal I know, but neither is what Zimmerman did so do your thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turn on your intelligence beacon. RT “@_EatMySwagg:  turn on your location.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. You're still an idiot. Congrats. RT “@WassupRedBonee:  I fixed my tweet, thank you very much”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck that! MT “@JohnnaBelleXoXo: Your an asshole! If u don't have anything nice to say,don't say it at all. U are old enough to know that!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. These TM supporters are truly ignorant. RT “@MsPilotJones:  this is just so ignorant”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent point! RT “@GlitteryJesus:  Have they illegalized skittles now? Do better.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they are. MT “@TiffBadAzz: Ignorance RT @conservJ: Hey Trayvon Martin supporters: Are y'all smoking weed &amp; eating skittles as you wait”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop eating bowls of stupid. Bad for you. RT “@WassupRedBonee:  get away With it?  You probably are.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@_ZayNeverDies Thank you for that. Appreciate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Butthurt MT “@Woahh_Jennifer: “GROW UP.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome. Then the riot. I get it. RT “@mami_chique:  actually, I'm writing a paper and drinking coffee.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actions do. Burglaries, etc. MT “@1855ChokeABitch: Maybe someone should follow and kill someone you love so does that make them a thug?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@1855ChokeABitch I didn't assume. Trayvon was, but you're an idiot for not comprehending a tweet or the trial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they are. MT “@KIENDYGURL: “@conservJ: Hey TM supporters: Are y'all smoking weed and eating skittles as you wait to riot?" FN idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That too. RT “@DeanDesign101:  or, sadly another black boy w skittles”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made sense. RT “@WassupRedBonee: i don't know... are you following behind random teenage teenage boys plotting their murder?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aww! RT “@JohnnaBelleXoXo: No, but are you? That's not even funny either, you need to grown up!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go ahead &amp; black out your profile pics. I'm sure you did that for the 700 murdered in Chicago or 500 in Detroit. #JusticeForZimmerman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Trayvon Martin supporters: Are y'all smoking weed and eating skittles as you wait to riot? #ZimmermanTrial #JusticeForZimmerman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome! MT “@Starr_bucksterr: my tweets are embarrassing just to let you know your tweets are on IG and some other websites”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said it before,but allow me to repeat. If Zimmerman's last name was Lopez, you wouldn't even know about this case. Period. #ZimmermanTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That makes no sense. At all. RT “@GoogleThis_Hoe:  you claiming #JusticeForZimmerman . Racist”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These young whippersnappers today I tell ya. Product of our fine government school systems. Yay for #BigEducation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amen! MT “@sarahhowie: I don't want to live in a country where we aren't allowed to protect our neighborhood, our family, and ourselves”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Starr_bucksterr Hey dumbass! You tweeted me. Don't get involved in adult conversations then if you can't handle reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Starr_bucksterr No 'if'. I don't. Plus, your pic is completely ridiculous, but that's your thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellemalkin We just want to see more babies saved. Insane to anyone with a hint of common sense why we wouldn't save a 5 month old.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hell with grumpy cat. We're Grumpy Americans fed up with Obama and Washington in general! It's about WE THE PEOPLE! #WAR #2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proud1American A complete shame that nobody calls him out on this total abuse of power. #2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made a mistake in voting for Obama or Democrats before? That's fine, correct them in #2014. #VoteRepublican #WAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Failure after failure,scandal after scandal, job losses, part-time nation, credit downgrades, etc. This is not hope and change you expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember this people. 2014 is near &amp; we have to make a stand. We cannot continue down this Obamafall any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They realize they cannot have employers dropping employees like flies just before the 2014 Midterm elections. They will lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Obama &amp; his Democratic stooges know how bad Obamacare is already. They have seen all the job losses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>....."would be clothing the president with a power to control the legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allowing the president to refuse to enforce statutes passed by Congress....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder had Mitt Romney won &amp; chose not to enforce the Obamacare law or parts he didn't like without repealing it, would anyone be upset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is abuse of power,but the way he dumbs it down for those who blindly follow will simply accept his response as he knows best. A joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The point is that the President cannot simply choose which parts of laws suits him to enforce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if a GOP President was in office &amp; decided the tax rate on capital gains is a drag on economic growth &amp; told IRS not to enforce it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look, we know the law sucks. Employers know it sucks. Most ppl w/ common sense realize it sucks. Now Obama himself is telling you it sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The employer mandate in the ACA contains no provision allowing the president to suspend, delay or repeal it. Obama supporters okay w/this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hildismom Lol. We have to get intelligent convo from somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaBee511 Yes ma'am it should have.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trayvon Martin thought his thuggish, drugged ass could do anything....oops. How'd that work out for him? #zimmermantrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trayvon Martin supporters: Take age out of it. Forget about what he looked like when he was 12. Irrelevant. Pay attention to the real facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another Obamacare implementation being delayed? Thought this thing was full of awesomeness! Why wait? Hmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with or without one. Just ask George Zimmerman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Zimmerman's last name were Lopez, you wouldn't even know about this case. Let that sink in. #zimmermantrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know or care about the other Trayvon Martins who also lost their lives around the same time frame? No? Oh that sucks. #BlameMSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless of what you think, George Zimmerman still successfully saved his own life. #SelfDefense<|endoftext|>
