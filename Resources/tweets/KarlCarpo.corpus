<|startoftext|>@philipnolan1 Thanks be to Jaysus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could every #GreenParty member, do us, of a certain generation a favour. Stop telling us you’re resigning. You got lucky again, every young person went green. You were shite before and by your in fighting your showing you’re shite again.  A F’ing waste of 12 seats. Now FO please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActingTheGom @fionamitchell56 @greenparty_ie They are a waste of space! No costings on anything. Makes them look like a crowd of tree hugging amateurs. This collapse even adds to that thinking. 12 seats for SFA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob0Sullivan @molloy1916 Right lads, everyone who’s left the #GreenParty tonight grow a set of balls and do something. Personally I think it was the greatest waste of 12 seats in history and tonight you are all proving me right. A crowd of chancers, tree huggers, with no costed economic policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donal_OKeeffe @saoirse_mchugh So where does she go from here? Realistically, truthfully, what has she achieved apart from press and airtime?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVsCarlKinsella Give them a cycle lane and the first thing they do is complain? How can you miss a bus coming towards you FFS? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jimmy_J_Hickey Left wing greens? Are you having a laugh? Try Greens that can actually cost all the economic shite they talk about rather than, we haven’t a clue how much any of this shite will cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenfoxe So there’s plenty of room for her to set up a party that will count. Instead of milking a party of 12 wasted seats. Now’s her chance to achieve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saoirse_mchugh Would you mind costing all that please? As a former member of a party who costed nothing. I’d like to see your coatings now, to get my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So are we now going to get Altgreen? Greenlite?Lighter shades of Green? Such a waste of 12 seats. Made a balls of it before and about to do it again. #GreenParty #saoirsemchugh #EamonnRyan Please god they’ll all leave and wipe themselves out. Zero economic credibility.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donlav @dublinmacker @williamhboney1 Ah Don F**c off and give him some encouragement instead. He hasn’t burnt a pony, I’d sh*** those boys. He’s got his life together and doesn’t need this hanging over him. Say a prayer for him when you’re next in church as I’m sure you will be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @molloyjh @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney This calls for another Athlone summit Tom to discuss further. My fingers wrecked from tweeeting! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelsCoDub Rumour has it they don’t miss you either. 😂 They prefer the good food as take away sans the talk. 😉😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Fran ever do any work in other gardens? #supergarden Fran has a plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @molloyjh @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney We had to lockdown, did you not watch #Dispatches last night? We’d have lost ‘000’s more. We need to reopen but cautiously. But we cannot throw endless money at it. BTW have no SME’s any reserves built up? I had. Didn’t spend what I hadn’t got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @molloyjh @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney Tom who pays the extra tax? The squeezed middle? The people who have already paid tax on company sales? Pay again? We have one of the lowest tax rates in Europe. Norway biggest sovereign wealth funds in the world pay more personal tax. I know our tax exiles have to pay more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulineEdwards They’re not dogs though! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@molloyjh @ThomNolan @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney As long as we don’t get a second wave John. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney Borrow and live like Japan on hereditary debt, be able to pay interest. Has to be a bigger gap in working and social welfare benefits. Full employment in this country is 4-5% unemployment 120-150k at least that’s an insult to everyone else who works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney And if it’s SF policy to find €70bn again without a plan to pay it back, I’m sorry I’m not paying for it again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney Tom you know as well as I do this is populist. A part time worker getting more money than they would earn is unsustainable. We closed businesses to save lives. WHO advised us on hospital beds, we followed at great expense yes. You’re the accountant do the maths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjanemurf @SarahAMcInerney Well he could always use some Northern Bank money? Or just the money tree they have. Populist S*** with no explanation on repayment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tobiL22 Totally agree. Having been involved in underage soccer for years.

<|startoftext|>@mernaghroisin @roisiningle It was sorted in less then 24 hours so  🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mernaghroisin @roisiningle They did not need to publicly state the deal was off. They could have quietly said to the government or whoever that they needed further clarification. It obviously wasn’t a huge gap if it got sorted so quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mernaghroisin @roisiningle You wouldn’t be in the TUI then Roisin? I’m practical that’s all.  We need solutions to this, not ridiculous postering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mernaghroisin @roisiningle If you mean this “large irrecoverable costs and expenses”. Under the indemnity originally offered I don’t think any civil servants or judges had to do this. Another example of the ASTI flexing its prehistoric muscles. Amazing that the TUI had no problems.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimfitzpatrick @angiebeeb Sorry went to bed. I feel the private owners are getting away with a lot here, how could the HSE be responsible for what stocks of PPE private were supposed to have originally? Yes I agree that the government had to take control after, but questions have to asked about the start.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hurleronditch11 @jimfitzpatrick @angiebeeb No, they are NOT responsible for them! I would like to know how many deaths there have been in private and HSE separately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddycosgrave Are you @Jimcorrsays in disguise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomNolan @cathalkeogh No, only 50000. 10000 actuaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimfitzpatrick @angiebeeb Question, should the government be responsible for private nursing homes too? Or the owners charging astronomical fees? Had they no duty of care? I would like to see the breakdown between private and HSE. Also 55% of deaths in Europe occurred in NH’s. Bad advice from WHO first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcadam_rob High BMI one cause of death with #COVID19 some of these lads should be cocooning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Holly0910 Actually it was 3 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Holly0910 Eh NO! 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbmosligo @angiebeeb @bobby9496 @Revolution_IRL @olivercallan That's a different arguement to what Callan said and any sheep who say that are sick. I don't do selective compassion or unfollowing because of debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbmosligo @angiebeeb @bobby9496 @Revolution_IRL @olivercallan Get a life lads, really? I think the "sheep" were just showing a bit of human compassion. Maybe those that didn't even vote for him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zuroph In Limerick? Wow 😂😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebeeb @bobby9496 @LeoVaradkar South Korea have only just learned that the people they thought were reinfected turned out to be false positives, so everyone is still learning. That's very good news BTW. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebeeb @bobby9496 @LeoVaradkar We hadn't got reagent to test initially. I'm in the chemical industry and the BS about this was incredible. " lots of Pharma plants we can make it" pure shite. You have to have the tools to test, now we do. We have to test and trace agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebeeb @bobby9496 @LeoVaradkar Pass. I honestly don’t know. Maybe the medical advice??? Haven’t a clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbmosligo @olivercallan @BrianDBourke Cannot argue with that on homelessness. No one can. On private hospitals I think they were scared shitless by the lack of resources in the public system which goes back 20 years at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbmosligo @olivercallan @BrianDBourke Following WHO advice to cover beds. I know the costs are ridiculous. They are only human and I think when every country looks back on this we will come out better than a majority of others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebeeb @bobby9496 @LeoVaradkar Absolutely not. But they can come down from the North. My point is regardless of what one thinks of LV this is unknown territory for every country. While not perfect I don’t see the point in kicking everyone on political grounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebeeb @bobby9496 @LeoVaradkar We have an open border on the island!!! I would have loved the reaction to closing that by every “republican”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbmosligo @olivercallan @BrianDBourke Peter Everyone’s an expert on Covid. Globally 55% care home deaths. WHO wanted hospitals sorted first. LV is by no means perfect didn’t vote for FG, but my point is, this is no mans land. So they all TH, included are trying their best. That’s all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trafotoz @JimMFelton @Lord_Sugar Check your facts. Unlike your government we are reporting care home deaths which are at 47% remarkably you have none. Do the maths.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cheerfullron @Shevaunne I live here I’m high risk I’ve been self isolating for 28 days. No country will remain on shutdown they will do a risk benefit analysis on it. This is not going away until there’s a vaccine. So we cannot remain locked up for 18 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheerfullron @Shevaunne And BTW Sweden today admitted they’ve got their strategy wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheerfullron @Shevaunne No economy in any country will be able to survive without rebooting that goes for any political party. All countries will make a choice about a virus that will be with us until a vaccine is found. Not just FG/FF 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KavanaghCk I read a load of the articles and was quite surprised by the “known”  content. Made me wonder if a lot of journalists/reporters said nothing during late 2018 and 2019 to keep in with IRFU and staff etc. All a bit to soon to wade in and yes LR is full of corporate wankers now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>England’s attack Wales defence #SixNations2019 #GrandSlamchampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd the ref has to ask if we can still take a throw in off the penalty. #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair play to Wales. A shocker from us. Don’t know what we were thinking about not closing the roof. #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bad again says the ref. He’snot great to be fair. #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland off form since Joe announced he was leaving. #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martin Johnson saying the ref is a bit harsh on Ireland MJ FFS! #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamie Heaslip will not say a bad word about anyone today. He has to be a bit more neutral for commentary #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipnolan1 Need more than that.  https://t.co/27RUWydj35<|endoftext|>
