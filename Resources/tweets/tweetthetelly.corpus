<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I can't believe you watch this drivel as well... Bad enough the husband does, but not you! What is the world coming too!!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just going to say it... I really like #doctorwho Series 7b opening titles. I know it's a rampaging mess of stuff that looks half finished, but at least it's not a bloody vortex! The music's crap, so we'll skip that. I'll play it over #PeterHowell! @bbcdoctorwho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not my favourite version of #climbeverymountain... Got a bit shouty at the end, after being barely audible at the beginning... I'm sure it'll be on over Christmas. #Strictly #StrictlyComeDancing #Strictly2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast I might be "wet behind the ears", but at least I don't fall for every conspiracy theory that comes along. Looking at yours, looks like you do! So enjoy no deal Brexit, Biden in jail, the Covid cover up, and all the other BS you peddle online. Read a book! Make a better choice!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast @AngieMichelleE5 Bless her @TheBluestStar. Maybe I'll be that lucky as well!! Christmas wish and all!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast I'll keep doing what I'm doing, that's my right. I hope you have a really good Christmas, and you get to be with the ones you love. Maybe a vaccine will help us all be around for the next one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast I work with vulnerable young people who are petrified by what is going on around them right now. If there is even a glimmer of hope that something will help put this year of misery behind them, then I welcome it. You believe what you want to, that is your right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast Probably. You carry on with your “nutrition, vitamins and hydroxychloroquine”, as recommended by your medical guru.

<|startoftext|>I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing, but #DannyDyer has been acting his bloody socks off lately! It's an actual joy to watch, not the horrendous storyline, but his character losing the plot. Been there and he's doing a fantastic job!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast Well, your link doesn't work - leading me to believe it's bollocks. Plus, most of her her posts are labelled as being "fact checked", which again leads me to believe it's bollocks. You might want to quote proper fact checked sources before you start wittering in the future 📺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngieMichelleE5 @TheBluestStar @IamHappyToast As he is, probably, clinically obese - like me - he should be at the front of the queue.

<|startoftext|>Catching up on @BBCiPlayer with #strictly... Who the actual fuck is #HRVY... Seriously. I know I'm unhip but didn't think it was this bad📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarlGrayTrekkie None. None at all. When the series came back he slagged off some previous arrangers of the theme tune. Kind of put me off him a bit. I know they weren't perfect, but they didn't have a full orchestra to play with, or any kind of budget. Did it all on their own. End rant📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hooray! A superswarm of locusts... Shame they bugger up modern TV compression and it all goes blurry! #bbcnaturalhistoryunit @BBCBristolPR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar It's my bus stop doing from when I went to school, I'm that old! It's much better if you pretend to do the video and spin around a lot... Worked for me, and I'm still normal!!📺 (PS, I'm not)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BBCCymruWales please can we have more #ageofoutrage as soon a possible as it's just blooming marvellous!! Unless you're Nick Knowles! 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off!   The Independent: Boris Johnson blames rising coronavirus infection rate on UK’s ‘fraying in discipline'.  https://t.co/vUWdRy9Tmc  It's your discipline, and your cronies, that's fraying!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the government put as much decision into what was going on as #PhilTuffnell and team just did on @QuestionofSport we'd be sorted! 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been a bit quiet on the @bbcpointswest front, back at work... Still watching, nearly, every night and loving the amazing work that @alexlovelltv @DavidGarmston @fergieweather and the rest of the team are doing. Keep up the great work!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drab nasty food. Passionate about ripping students off. @TaylorShawUK £3 for a sausage roll and a bottle of coke... You wonder why students are braving the weather to go to the supermarket. Buck your ideas up!  https://t.co/36FIiMpPUO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cold soggy chips, cold fish and mushy peas you could grout a floor with... That's what @TaylorShawUK are feeding to our children... I know there's a pandemic on, but it wasn't any better before tbh!  https://t.co/Y1UuFSzkeB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Morrisons There are so many people having a go at you on @Twitter today... Maybe if you just got things right, this wouldn't happen! Just a thought 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DirectLine There's no point. You just don't care about long term, I'm talking over 20 years, customers. You milk us dry and get fat in the profits you make from us. I'm changing next year so goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DirectLine I'd rather you gave decent insurance, and didn't rip off loyal customers, than give us this trite twaddle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar You are such a soppy date!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope these people get training. There's so much bad singing technique in this show... And before you ask, I performed for over 30 years and have taught singing since 2000. This show is poor behind belief. @bbcone #LittleMixTheSearch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So every fit young man is going to squeeze into the Band Room...? God this painful to watch! #LittleMixTheSearch 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me this #littlemix show fucking cringe worthy... Talent's good, but they are just embarrassing 📺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Reminds me of a party I went to once, coke and sticks, well something like that! 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #EatWellForLess is like watching the #TwoMinuteHate for a while hour! You don't want to, but you just have too!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Certain things from different shops"... So, this week are the wonder twins going to get food shopping from one place for this family? No, it will be from all over the place as normal. Hypocrisy personified! #EatWellForLess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PritiPatel On @BBCr4today is showing us exactly how disengaged from the public both she and the #tory government are right now. No answer to questions asked, and would dob in her neighbours... Hope you don't live next door!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar No dear, that's a pint of - I'm assuming due to your Irishness that you never go on about - Guiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why we're worrying about #brexit, the way this government is handling #covid19, we'll all be bloody dead by the end of the year!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not normally one to use foul language, but fucking hell this is just amazing!! Love to Vince &amp; Andy, and Emma and Val (I think), for an amazing show. @erasureinfo    https://t.co/xe0slkZsDE via @bbciplayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those chairs, @MonForNothingS4 should have been stripped, repainted, or revarnished, and reupholstered... Not ruined with glued on fabric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Sarah @MonForNothingS4  butcher a gorgeous vintage typewriter into cufflinks? Jeez! Take it to @TheRepairShop and get it fixed... There's one on eBay for £1000!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcPoV Why is everyone hating on Mary Berry? She's been helping people cook for nearly 60 years. Definitely deserves better than morons berating her. You get a TV show and cook for the nation! Oh no, wait... You can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that the @Telegraph review of #MaryBerry was a little harsh. Ok, it wasn't always "simple", but it was comforting. And so what if she goes off to buy a dress... Name another TV chef that doesn't go off the beaten track on a filming jolly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know #RichardHammond isn't exactly flavour of the month with the #bbc, but what about the nice lady that presented #TotalWipeout with him? She was brilliant! Where is she?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HandsFaceSpace Jesus Christ! Patronising advert or what? You decide!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ianhwatkins @OfficialSteps @_ClaireRichards @llatchfordevans @LSLofficial @Faye_Tozer If only it was the 90's, I was a student, and drunk... Then I'd be able to join in 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok @startrekcbs #LowerDecks, I want a #badgey!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like listening to #GregJames as I am not really in his demographic... Probably for the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of @bbclaurak's language on this @BBCNews report is a little inflammatory... "Hate", "appalled", "progress is plummeting". Seriously, how is this person still allowed to broadcast such biased views?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryadeIsHere I do get that, but to get the exact savings that are mentioned on the programme they have to get the items that are swapped. They won't have coffee as cheap as Lidl where they normally shop. Swap like for like where they shop. That would make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these food swaps are great, but you've got to shop at 75 different places to get them! #eatwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #crunchie is NOT a chocolate biscuit... Jesus! #eatwellforless. Love this patronising shite being back on the telly... Can't have #eastenders, but we can have this... Boo!!!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best thing about #littlemixthesearch is that we don't have to watch it... It's all in the trailer! That's another pile of shite I don't have to watch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I had time in the morning to make scrambled eggs with Cajun spices, it would be a miracle! #bbctwo #loseweightforgood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've missed a @BBCCountryfile segue into the weather... Nicely done Mr Baker! Lovely to see #MaryBerry too. She should be on TV 24hrs a day 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #TheHeights... I do like to see Iris happy! #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbconeness I'm so bored of these now. They were bad enough before lockdown, now they're just dull and repetitive. Bored of capoeira, football, knitting, making a cuppa, and most of all that singing one... Plus an the others I've forgotten. MAKE THEM STOP!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Not sure you're really telling us how you feel about this... 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! The lady on #escapetothecountry this afternoon is really unreasonable. All three of the houses were amazing. Just not right, though. Go off and buy a brand new 5 bedroom new build box you miserable trout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These two young ladies on @BBCBargainHunt are very, very noisy! If I was the auctioneer, I'd ask them politely to shhh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Erm... @bbcpointswest I'm not sure what language #Spainish is?  https://t.co/FrfPYsgQ2T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greenekingcares If I'd been going to The Crown, I may have done. As it was, I was being driven past... Sorry, I teach English and it just caught my eye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @greeneking might want to spell check your signs before you put then out... #Saltford  https://t.co/3CKKLVWNgv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again young people are being let down by the appalling #torygovernment. Teachers have worked so hard, I know cos I'm one, and have not had a skive the last few months. When is a government going to sort out the shoddy education system in this country. Why not ask a teacher?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I had a witty thing to say, but it's been sucked out of me by a fucking stupid smoke alarm... And relax 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing @BBCTheOneShow has done... Not have #davidwalliams as a judge! Nasty piece of work him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @KFC_UKI could you please let me know why your vegan option has been removed from the menu. When I asked politely earlier in #trowbridge I was told, "we can't because of coronavirus" and no further explanation. Went somewhere else and had a lovely vegan burger... Your loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I always thought it was your wit and charm!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For god's sake @TheGadgetShow it's a piece of cake to set up Google home... Plus you missed a load of steps... Plus why use #Hue? Much easier things to set up @TPLINK bulbs, for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @BBCTheOneShow tonight makes me wonder why I'm still paying my licence fee... God this is utter drivel. Can't escape as moving tomorrow and any other entertainment is packed!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbeckettcomic looks like he's got a runny bogey... @BBCTheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like the rest of this appalling #tory government, @GavinWilliamson has let down hundreds of thousands of children and young people. He's never worked in a school or college! #joke #letdown #notmygovernment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did @BBCBargainHunt become #TreasureHunt? "How much time's left?"... "Stop the clock we've got the items...". It'll be red and blue jumpsuits next 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always thought that #timothydalton was the best #jamesbond... Just never really got a good run at the part due to times-a-changing and possibly poor box office... he would have been great in #GoldenEye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a physio appointment with #attendanywhere recently and it was... Interesting! If it's recorded somewhere for a Christmas tape, I will be more than happy to receive repeat fees for my hysterical rolling around on the floor!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please like @NHSMillion if only to annoy the #toadmaster general!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#conversiontherapy is evil. Can't sugar coat it. It is evil and prays on young people who may be having a problem with sexual identity. Religion is to, mostly, blame and seems to miss out the bits about loving your neighbour, whoever they are, when it suits them. #evil #lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm not an expert on these things, but I have heard they can keep your glowing rod quite warm, if you know where to go...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to come out and say that I just don't like #BigFinish audio stories... Never been able to get into them, and have tried many times. Then I look at #TheStranger and realise why. They were going well for the first couple until someone became involved and it went wrong...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I did consider it when I married the Mr, but thankfully it was off the air! He'd never have got the right combination of  #DoctorWho, #StarTrek and random 80s stuff... I'd have had such a paddy... Plus I'd have looked awful in the dress he would have chosen...📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @itsmymatepaddy Is that legal to buy in the UK? It sounds dangerous...📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Olly isn't careful, he's going to sprain something! @TVsPointless #repeat 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DestinationSounds... If you have an #IQ in only double figures... #bbcsounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It says something when the best thing on Saturday night TV is #janemcdonald... Geez📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh @UnitedWeFallABC... I tried to like you, I really did... Just couldn't take it anymore. Sorry! 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, do we call them #Alexisms? #snookee!! @bbcpointswest 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @BBCTheOneShow is back to normal and talking over the star turns... Jeez. 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thisisourstory is great. It's beyond amazing to see all the major public broadcasters working together. @BBCOne @ITV @Channel4 @channel5_tv. Long may it continue once this current situation is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Points of View... When, oh when, oh when will #homesunderthehammer change the bank notes in their opening titles... It's most off-putting!😁📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @AlexRiderTV is starting really, really slowly... Don't know if I'm hooked to watch the rest...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do wish this woman on #escapetothecountry would pronounce #NorthPetherton properly, being Somerset born and bred it's a bit grating! Plus it's where my, only, girlfriend used to live... Get me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love @ImpossibleBBC, but I do feel sorry for the poor runner that has to put those 10000 one pound coins back in the exclamation mark! I hope they get gloves 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if I'm just the wrong age, or the wrong {insert something here}, but I just hate @BBCTheOneShow. I can't stand it. Mostly patronising twaddle mixed with terrible interviews and talking over the star turns... Just run its course. #timetogiveup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been another great week from @DavidGarmston @alexlovelltv and the rest of the team. Really heartbreaking stories covered with such dignity to all involved. Great news team @bbcpointswest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcnews #itvnews #skynews When are you going to call out #BorisJohnson as not having a clue what he's doing? It's obvious to a layperson such as myself. Why can't you just come out and say it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @Printerpix isn't charging £10.99 delivery a bit steep for a #free mask? Surely the package it comes in can't be that large or heavy - after all it's only a piece of fabric 11cm by 16cm. Or is your elastic really heavy? Or are you just ripping people off in a pandemic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Gemma is going #outout after the weather tonight! Fab jacket!! @bbcpointswest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apple Erm.. no thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children's TV in this country is an abomination! Even #cbbc and #cbeebies are just babysitting, as can be seen in the latest promos. To take away @BBCNewsround is a joke. I watched it as a kid and it helped shape my view of the world. #jeez! 📺   https://t.co/rGORjmojtb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendani49488772 Oh dear, oh dear oh dear, oh dear oh dear oh dear... I'm sure they were glad to get you out of their business to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! More patronising twaddle about fat people - I'm allowed to say that as I am one of them. This is all bollocks when there are far more pressing issues at the moment #covid19 #brexit #shittytorygovernment. Let's sort things out one at a time. #bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Might be one to many Ron's in there... Fuck it! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Ron, Ron, Ron... Ron Weasley!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, school went well for these two numpties on @TippingPointITV today... Jesus. Winning by default doesn't really count methinks. Can't wait to see how he does in the final round... Could be quite short...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear, if I was a horse, I'd have been taken down the knackers yard years ago... Which part of me is going to stop working properly next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at @bbclaurak swanning about @10DowningStreet like she owns the place. Amazing what perks you get from your #tory #overlords when you help get them into power. Asking #boris to be honest is like trying to ask the sky not to be blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's been 250 shows since #Pointless has had a five figure jackpot... So sometime last week then... #boomboom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or are these new #brexit ads just taking the piss? We are still in the middle of a global pandemic and we're expected to worry about red-faced #gammons not getting their way! Jesus, keep it real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't this #Panorama a bit late? Surely the media should have been doing this BEFORE all this happened! Questioning policy, etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sacha_dhawan Sod them! You were bloody marvellous. Not quite so insane as John Simms, and subtle nods back to classic Masters. It's a difficult character to pin down - being beyond insane. If you get the chance to come back to the role, please do. Thoroughly enjoyed your performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was going to start watching #MrsAmerica, but saw that #TraceyUllman was in it... So decided not to bother. She's not been any good in anything since #ThreeOfAKind in 1981...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My knee really f***ing hurts. The #zapain no longer works... Bugger!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, just how is this person - use the term loosely - the president of anything? He shouldn't be in charge of a #RicePudding!  https://t.co/nce758wUx6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I promise not to tweet about @bbcpointswest so much this week. Not because I watch it any less, or think less of it... They're all probably bored of me doing it! Regional TV is being eroded in this country. Let's not see the #BBC turn into ITV... ever! #savetheregions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who whine and bitch about stuff - to the nth degree - aren't true fans, however many phasers they may own. Storytelling is a difficult business, which isn't going to go right every time. At least we have stories to watch. Just take a deep breath and calm down 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not an obsessive fan of anything, but I like to be able to watch what I want, when I can. I'm not going to get upset by a uniform being the wrong colour or something out of place. It's a TV show, that I can turn off and not worry about any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DoctorWho #StarTrek #StarTrekPicard #startrekdiscovery #LowerDecks #scifi #windyourneckin. All it takes is an executive to send an email and everything is gone! I know it's not all perfect, but it's better than nothing... Been there, done that... Didn't like it! #pipedown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a part of many fandoms, too numerous to mention here. It really, really annoys me when so much vitriol come as a part of that. If I don't like something, I don't watch it. I don't go on #YouTube and bitch about it. We're lucky to have ANYTHING to watch. #pipedown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, #youtube as a specialist subject on @MastermindQuiz? What next...? I must be getting old!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've tweeted a lot about @bbcpointswest this week, because it is a great show, with great presenters who care about the region. I'm so angry that #thebbc has decided to cut it back as a service - along with other national changes. #thebbc is falling apart piece by piece... #shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MiriamMargolyes is an absolute legend. If I ever grow up, I want to be just like her. Be rude, be abrasive, but be honest! An amazing actor who goes from strength to strength 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful news about business in the West country tonight on @bbcpointswest. Bless @BBCBusinessDave for wearing the most amazing socks whilst delivering it! @DavidGarmston and the team giving us more top quality regional programming. Long may it last!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thanks to @Protyre Westbury! Brilliant service, as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, man, man, man (possibly), cows, church, bridge, boat... It's time for @bbcpointswest with the, always fabulous, @alexlovelltv and team. Best local news in the region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the #Conservatives have finally won. The #bbc is falling apart. Even though they helped the #Tories get into power. Nearly made it to 100 years. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really a fan of #ripoffbritain, but #GloriaHunniford is a funny lady!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, there is a preacher on #tbnuk who just said, " I don't have to understand this (a bible) to follow it". Yea you do, I studied A-Level religious studies for 18 months... I understand the bible. That's how I know it's bollocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#richkidsskintholiday I really can't  write what I'm thinking right now... I know there'll be a revelation or something later but right now... Jeez!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #richkidsskintholiday Harry needs to just fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#notv #fartooearlyorlate #argh I can never sleep when I need too... Even run out of stuff to watch on #youtube. What's wrong with me lol  https://t.co/cCWpMibsYh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear god. There's no hope for the human race if people can't heat soup in a microwave... Might as well start looking for another asteroid!  @BBCTheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So forget the 44000+ people that have passed away due to #coronavirus, you can get your bikini line waxed Kym!! @BBCTheOneShow, even for you this is shallow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For goodness sake @bbcpointswest, can you not let @fergieweather have a small corner of the studio to do the weather when it's raining? Poor soul must be soaked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see that talking over the star turn is still happening in the absence of Ms Jones!! Oh @BBCTheOneShow you never let me down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh @alexlovelltv you are a star! Hopefully we'll get back to the health  lady later in the show 📺 @bbcpointswest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BurnhamOnSea has never been so popular! Mind you, that bottle of hand sanitiser they keep flashing up on the news looks a bit grim @bbcpointswest @itvwestcountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Off I go to remove the images of #Shaggy that popped up in my brain by washing my it in caustic soda!😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar So where you gonna put the #scoobydoo boxed item? 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kym's top is very "busting out all over" on @BBCTheOneShow tonight... What would #LordReith say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar There's nothing worse than a poorly pussy! Mine was poorly a few years ago and is now partly bionic... Beat that #MrsSlocombe! #AreYouBeingServed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm loving the professional chef at the #londonunderground workshop, I'm so sorry I forgot your name! She's keeping them going, giving amazing support and not shouting at them... Yet!! What a fantastic person. @MasterChefUK #brilliant #iwouldeatyourfoodnoproblem!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #entertain is pushing it a bit far @BBCTheOneShow. I've been more entertained watching sawdust drying out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #DingDong it's the final of @GlowUpBBC. I love this show, it's inspirational and aspirational. Please bring this gem back for another series. Whoever wins, you're all winners 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we have to cut down on local services like @bbcpointswest, but the #bbc can remake #TalkingHeads and plug it into the schedule wherever they feel like it... God!!📺 And don't get me started on @BBCTheOneShow... They can cut all of that tosh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Just drink it neat or mix it with lemon jif... Tastes the same xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was this old when I found out the rules of #swingball... Thanks @bbcpointswest for an education!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar No! You can't go outside, you might run into stupid people... They're fucking everywhere! Stay home, order online. You can get everything online and I do mean everything #winkwink 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the #bbc is reducing local services across the country! What an absolute mistake. My beloved @bbcpointswest appears to be one of those affected. These are vital local services that we can't afford to lose! Don't want another #ITVWestNews, cos that's awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how the #Bubbles system is going to work in schools... Maybe we should ask @RealMattLucas might have a bell better insight than #GavinWilliamson!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the education secretary doesn't know about how #ofsted has changed the inspection framework... Now we're screwed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GavinWilliamson what the hell word is #moosant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought there'd be a worse #educationsecretary than #MichaelGove... I was wrong. #GavinWilliamson is just terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that parents shouldn't be going back to work, but under ideal circumstances not just because this pathetic government has run out of money 📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Let it all hang out and about love. You're fab and if they can't see that well fuck 'em... With a big stick. Up the bum. Maybe a poker. A hot poker... I'm enjoying this far too much!!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being an FE teacher myself, what the hell does #gavinwilliamson know about being in a classroom? Has he been in any classes lately? Young people are still vulnerable. This is all so that parents can go back to work and stop costing the country money. Not right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #phil thought about #grant while he was doing #sharon!!! There's a whole storyline I never want to think about ever again!! @bbceastenders #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BBCOne I think today's modern audience can deal with bars at the side of the screen... Why stretch @bbceastenders so everyone looks wide!! Show us what it should look like for goodness sake!📺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar It's what they're playing at my funeral! I'll make you all sad one way or another!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone, it's time for #alex and #gethin to talk over the star turns again... Yaaaaay!!! @BBCTheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit! #DomLittlewood is on @BBCTheOneShow... The universe is going to disappear into a black hole of banality!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, season 2 of @DCDoomPatrol is no less fucked up, so far, as season 1... And I love it! Great show... Looking forward to the rest of the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... Why do the, bloody awful, presenters on @BBCTheOneShow insist on talking over the star turns they have on the show... Especially the ones on the screen! Let people fucking talk. No one's watching this shite to hear you waffling on about bollocks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @bbclaurak is back on the #labourbashing again. When are pros going to see her bias towards her #torymasters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Snap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought you were safe, with @BBCWatchdog being reduced to nothing... No the #bbc is back with #MattAllwright and #howtoscaretheshitoutofyou #yourmoneyandyourlife... Jeez!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Glad to be on the list!😺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @IdealWorldTV, I'm not sure I'd use #sesameoil to fry with...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just about sums up the UK...  https://t.co/1QuS0EO8ZR bloody #gammons everywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So schools are getting millions of pounds to help tutor students who've been affected by the lockdown... What about the other learners that school has let down over 12 years of education and it's the left to #FE to pick up the pieces... Hmmm! @GavinWilliamson @10DowningStreet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CategoryTop @bbcthree So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... Nothing to do with losing a contestant earlier in the series and not wanting to cancel your arranged gigs... #glowup @bbcthree. It's fine, but just be honest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonymovieuk It's a fantastic film, which I thoroughly enjoyed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat watching #labyrinth whilst doing the worst #DavidBowie impression ever... More like something from #SteptoeandSon... So says my supportive husband!! @sonymovieuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'll give you day 9...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar .. is the title of my sex tape" is how that sentence should have finished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar And you've never felt better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I fear the Paltrow may have touched a nerve... Don't worry there's a #Goop vaginal douche for that xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best things about #BakeOfftheProfessionals is the passion that @cherish_finden and @BenoitBlin_MCA have for patisserie. Yes, they are hard taskmasters but that just shows how much they adore the subject matter. Love this show! @Channel4 @LoveProductions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar You're on the ball today my lovely 😺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I think if you stood on one in a nose-bleedingly high stilleto heel it might just go pop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#anewlifeinthesun... Is it just a romanticism to call UK emigrants "Ex-Pats". They're really immigrants, plain and simple. Can we call them what they really are please! @Channel4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Ok, ok, we'll change it from goats to tardigrades... I don't think they're currently offensive to anyone, except possibly other tardigrades... and maybe #cherylcole... We shall see xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Obvs, the gays do it with more style... 🤣 But, there's only so many ways you can use entrails to decorate a home! #SacrificeEyeForTheStraightPeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Were they supportive in hospital?” #alexjones... No they usually just kick you out once you've produced your offspring! God almighty!! @BBCTheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm a gay... That's nearly as bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Looks online for goat farms...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar God damn!!! What the hell do I actually have to do... Sacrifice a goat on YouTube live?😺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelBall has been on the sherry before @BBCTheOneShow tonight... I'm just jealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#songsofpraise... Kind of sums up the last few months... #boring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #TheForbiddenPlanet with the husband. I'd forgotten just how beautiful this film is to watch. For 1956 it's just stunning, a true masterpiece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar We had a bit of a sofa incident today... Thankfully it's the colour of cat food, grass and cat hair so we barely noticed 🐈🐾😺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #totp1989 just makes me feel very, very old... But also proud that no other decade produced such a diverse range of tat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insidecadbury you feel like Hagrid is going to walk in saying "You're a winner..." whatever the poor lads name was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insidecadbury your taste test panel wasn't exactly diverse... Do only women eat chocolate... #stereotype<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#chasethecase... #facepalm... Oh @bbctwo is this the best you can offer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @QueerEye season 5... Getting ready for the be drinking game. Every time @tanfrance says "French Tuck" you need to take a drink!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #BorisJohnson look like he's wearing his granddad's suit? #DailyUpdate #uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm no fan of football, but whoever put the #rewindtheeuros trailer together is a bloody genius! @BBCSport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar At the third stroke I'll be drinking @irnbru and it will be vaguely nearly 6pm! Beep, beep, beep...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, for the second time, @JustEatUK has made a total cock up. You go to order, it tells you the payment hasn't gone through - twice - and then two hours later they tell you your food is on the way! Thankfully I got hold of the restaurant and sorted it out. Bit of a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Just give in to the fringe. Be one with the fringe. One day it might get you into an accident at work advert on the telly!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Hello, I'm #borisjohnson and I'm going to potentially undo all the hard work that the nation has done by lifting sanctions on groups of people so they forget about #DominicCummngs..." I really hope we aren't all fooled by this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ffs, @CWBatwoman, just catching up with this... Please just kill #Alice!!! I know it would be a short season but God it's so tedious now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BakeOfftheProfessionals is back! How we've missed the gorgeous @cherish_finden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar If love to judge you, but I'm so #unhip I've never heard of anyone on that list. As long as it makes you happy... and I never have to sit next to you in a train xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @bbcpointswest, Bruce's shirt is definitely mind altering!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I already do...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lucky I got #coronavirus 36 years ago, cos that's how long I've seen wearing glasses... What a knob! #dailyupdate #BorisHasFailedBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this wasn't so awful it would be hysterical! #ukupdate #answerthequestion #BorisHasFailedBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that they've broken #borisjohnson... He appears to be stuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... Not going to answer any questions on #DominicCummngs, maybe you should resign as well #boris! #BorisHasFailedBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @BBCNews skipping over the debacle with #DominicCummings... Impartiality is now a joke. Bring the #PrimeMinister to account!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bollocks that's all I need to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar She should just let them in... It's probably the #JehovahsWitnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's good enough for #dominiccummimgs, I'm getting in my car to go visit my niece in #scotland. Oh wait, I can't because I'm a responsible person not some #tory #arselicker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, @BBCNews stop letting the vindictive #conservativeparty dictate your content. If you report the truth, they won't be around to get rid of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @BBCNews is just skirting round the issue of #dominiccummimgs because of the fear they have of their #tory overlords. #bias central. #Disgraceful #shouldbeashamed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really scares me that some of these useless c*nts are role models for children today! #celebritycomedinewithme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @Schafernaker is rocking a #Beatles look today! Nice!😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on, you know you want a #lego #commodore64 as much as the next person!!  https://t.co/tw23JvASNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#titsandarse has to be trending in the next hour! #TheOneShow. Love @ZoeWanamaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again @BBCTheOneShow drags people across the country for a @BBCWatchdog interview... Nice! 😁 Can't this programme just bow out gracefully, now, and be replaced by paint drying or something else as exciting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Telly's crap, still. Here's my beard project instead of some finely crafted TV drivel!! 🎅  https://t.co/fSkNg22O5P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government in the UK is obsessed with data. If only they'd been obsessed with the data regarding the underfunding of the #NHS before all this kicked off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see #KeirStarmer had got his finger in the pulse of the nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A 50 page 3-step plan... Thank God it wasn't something comprehensive! #BorisHasFailed #omnishambles #10Downingstreet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson right now!  https://t.co/U85PKIk7cr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is showing a pratt making a giant cup of tea in a recycling bin a good thing right now? There might be people who don't have tea, milk and sugar right now. Bit of a wasteful indulgence methinks #ReasonsToBeCheerful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the emojis... Really gives it a touch of #Gravitas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @krishgm is on the telly... I walked past him once at an awards ceremony. #claimtofame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #unitedkingdom, if you don't do what I say you won't have jam for tea!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @ITV your new advert fill in about bringing people together would have worked better in the 1980's when you gave a monkeys about the people in the regions rather than the money in shareholder's pockets. Sad demise of a great institution. #bringbackregionalitv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to say that the soundtrack for @WestworldHBO season 3 is just bloody fantastic. @Djawadi_Ramin you are an absolute legend! Been one of the best things on TV, lately, and the music is just phenomenal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @mansunband To my favourite ruler of the dark Dominion, which will look weird when you change your Twitter handle to #fluffypumpkinlover or something, #happybirthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Telly's crap at the moment, so here's a picture of my baby boy - a bit knackered after his first day out!🐈🐾😺  https://t.co/qXBTGSedyV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he didn't knock the door as I am sat right above it on the first floor with the window open. So if they are getting training on how to do it, might want to get them to do it a little bit harder so that humans can hear it, not just cats and dogs. @dpd_support #DPD #dpd_uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, tomorrow is a bank holiday... Are you delivering on a bank holiday? If not, then it will be two days I have to wait for my parcel... Might start charging you rental on it... @dpd_support #DPD #dpd_uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I realised what it was I called him back straight away before he left and he just ignored my call. #rubbishservice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @dpd_support, do you not train your drivers to knock on doors? I'm sure I'm not the only person who won't answer an unknown number calling. I know he came to the house as he put a card nearly through the door. Absolute joke. #DPD #dpd_uk #wasteofmytime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my version of #lockdown is slightly different to that of #theduchessofcambridge. I'm sure they haven't run out of essentials, or anything at all. #ThisMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I take your purple wee, and I raise you a mauve turd!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why couldn't @BBCTheOneShow @BBCWatchdog have done a virtual interview with Martin, rather than drag him across the country like I'm not allowed to do? Is he Matt's neighbour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Same! It's a bitch ain't it!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, some fucking flannels, a couple of plastic boxes and some "essential" oils priced at £45... Fuck me sideways #thecustomerisalwaysright #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror The extension at number 32 across the way had come out better than hoped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage I'm not keen on the yellow corduroy trousers, but with a bit of practice you could be on #BritainsGotTalent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so @CW_TheFlash seems to follow the same route every season. Something happens, no one believes one of the team, something else happens and yada yada yada. BORING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh God... @CW_TheFlash  is just becoming so bloody tedious these days... nothing seems to happen. This mirror thing has dragged on and on and on and on and... I'm on the verge of giving up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartdenham @Google That would be nice, about £60000!😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is just a massive twat! #dailyupdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror The #newschmoo has let itself down recently... Oh the pains of being an #80s TV star<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the daily update on the crisis... Why does #BorisJohnson just make a bloody joke out of everything? (Austerity for those that didn't see him) If he wants to do stand-up then resign and get on the comedy club circuit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BeatTheChasers doesn't appear to be the #clusterfuck I thought it was going to be... Bit of fun from @ITV for once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know times are hard, but wool feathers just takes the piss. #keepcraftingandcarryon I have avoided you like the plague all week... Now I feel justified in that decision. Not as patronising as #JamieOliver but not far off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 5pm on @Channel4. Time to turn over to anything else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry Davina I'm an adult and I would not like to win that prize. Thanks #BigNightIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Love it! It's basically me in the morning before I drag myself to my desk to teach numbnuts all day!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm #fbi #fuckingbrainlessidiot #theoneshow #nottheamericanfbi #aukbasedknobhead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This even got me searching for a hankie... Not the biggest fan of #RussellTDavies, but this is just beautiful... #FarewellSarahJayne  https://t.co/L3pKztvhG1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @BBCTheOneShow is coming up to 14 years on screen... #Nationwide ran for 14 years... Maybe #theoneshow should bow out gracefully after dribbling through this current crisis. #justathought #bbcone #drivel #borednow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #theoneshow, what about all the teachers that are still working from home trying to get their students through qualifications. I'm sorry that schools being closed is cramping your style a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #doctorsleep and, it pains me to say, I really enjoyed it. Bloody good film all round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror I'm more interested in the backstory of the pumpkin. I bet it could tell a few tales!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of watching some upper class tosser telling you what to do next week, watch @dkitchenlive with the amazing @BootstrapCook and @matt_tebbutt. Loved it this week, looking forward to more next week! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4 @KirstieMAllsopp Yay! I can't wait to see this. It's so great to be told what to do by the landed gentry. Bring back the fuedal system I say! I love having to make do and mend from my choice of homes xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm sorry my dear, to quote Rupaul, but #DerekandClive do it better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#oldhousenewhome not impressed with the drab #monochrome look from the boys last night. Looks like a show home and not somewhere you would feel like you could relax. I know it's trendy, but put in some fucking colour!  https://t.co/zHuy9KYEjD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I highly recommend watching @Devs_FXonHulu starting on @BBCTwo tomorrow. It's highly intelligent, beautifully written and a treat to the eyes. Great cast, great production team. Watch... You won't be disappointed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @dkitchenlive with the cat... I'm enjoying it, him just chilling out! #iplayer #bbcone  https://t.co/HaWyOgCtpR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I grow up I want to be like #angelalansbury in #deathonthenile! #bbctwo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This appears to be the time my soul has been stuck at for the last fortnight...  https://t.co/T5tFrjH5rP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. Just to ruin the surprise... It's awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @AwaitFI while locked in our house... Hmmm hope it ends well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grateful that I was able to get this while I could. Birthday present for the #husband! From the fabulous @KBJWhitstable online shop.  https://t.co/dzbzNjlBEn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out my podcast, Tweet the Telly, on @anchor:  https://t.co/WvdDi1Eyv3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The daughter did it... #fatherbrown just a guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#fatherbrown is on again. Where's the fête?😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love having #Scifi back on the telly so much, but why does #netflix have to keep slopping out dross like #anotherlife? It's just one disaster trope after another. A bit like #origin from #youtube. That was awful. Give us intelligent sci-fi! We need it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #FatherBrown is on the #bbc. Only seen one other episode. Seems like they are always having a fête, and the person who gets murdered pisses off everyone in the village. At least it's never dull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Who are you and what the fuck have you done with Tara?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PapaJohnsUK not impressed with delivery tonight. Nearly £50 for lukewarm food that wasn't quite what I ordered. I get you're busy but no reason to compromise. Not happy. Won't be ordering again #papajohns #justeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one in the top left just looks right pissed off #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charming!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who are these charging old people on #theoneshow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #anotherlife on TV... God it's awful. Just got to the possible alien contamination bit and I really want them to all die horribly! I know there's another eight episodes so I won't get my hopes up #Netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when did @bbcone start using 24hr clock in their trailers... #questiontime #militarytakeover...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My life appears to be turning into #Avenue5 , just waiting to see how #BorisJohnson lights up this shit show... Not enough glitter on the planet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @andyparmo Mine are fabulous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar There's no allowance in the new social control measures for brushing hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar More of a boobbox than a boombox! I'm here all week, don't forget to tip your waitress... Oh shit, you can't... Forgot about that... Erm... Hides in shame... (and washes hands)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pressgazette All this as #winstonsmith hides around the corner in his hovel and writes his diary...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think #MattBaker or @BBCOne would be able to afford a better internet connection. It looks like he's #skyping from the 90's! #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @BBCPanorama, is anyone actually surprised by the fact that we have one of the worst public transport systems in the world. I'm not. Bloody joke. All the fat cats creaming off their profits while we put up with shite! Needs proper investment, not just lip service!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've sung #happybirthday so many times this week I'm now 154 years old! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad that rich and middle class people can afford to be more choosy with their clothes shopping. The rest of us have to just make do with the cheap tat that we can afford. #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VeryHardQuestions is just #veryhardtowatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelAspel looked amazing on #theoneshow. Always thought he was such a gentleman. I genuinely miss him from our TV screens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"So we do this in our house..." Do you fucking bollocks! If you haven't seen any of these "life hacks" before then you obviously haven't been on the internet since it was created. Utter shite #itv #thismorning #bollocks  https://t.co/CwMLkDXfhb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I never thought I'd hear #nailshairhipsheels on #bbcone at teatime. Go @todrick and #dancepoint. Voted already!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anything @SusanCalman isn't a superfan of? 😉 Liking the #tardis necklace... Looking for a part in the next series by any chance?😁 #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, why has #keith come as a member of #bros this week 🤣 #PotteryThrowdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love #MiriamMargolyes just a shame she's being interviewed by these two vacuous stick insects! #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 4000000 episodes, something that made me laugh on #theoneshow. Can't wait for the next 4000000 episodes so I can laugh again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well @bbcpointswest I'm really glad that Kathryn had enough money to keep all her lights on over the winter. I know I don't, and I'm sure millions of others don't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All ready for #MatthewMorrison to be miserable and grumpy tonight. To be fair, I've never rated him as a dancer... But, what would I know with four years of training in musical theatre and eight years of teaching. #GreatestDancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar  https://t.co/PFznHzduPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror @ArtDecider That mirror is going to need some serious Vim and elbow grease!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#gardenrescue has become my new guilty pleasure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, guess what? Eating junk food and doing no exercise is really bad for you. No fucking way!!! I'd never have guessed that. Thanks patronising bunch of shite #thetruthabouttakeaways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EE This is what I get in my laptop and phone when I try to access your site. I've tried 4 times to upgrade, and my current phone is now, literally, explosive. I give up  https://t.co/mI7aPw1H1w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EE is your website down? Can't do anything... looking to upgrade, but might move provider after the weekend I've had with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the same level of commitment went into the weather segue tonight. Well done! #countryfile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm getting a vibe from an old J. J. Abrams show with a guy from Dawson's Creek, and the lady from Mindhunter... It's on the tip of my tongue... Plinky plonky theme tune. Set in the future, in the last season. Went between dimensions... It'll come to me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #ReadySteadyCook looks fucking awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has Matthew left the rest of his scarf at home? #GreatestDancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #BondJamesBond theme is just awful... Where's #shirleybassey when you need her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VeryHardQuestions is very hard to watch. Not the questions, or the contestants. It just feels really stilted. Hmmm, probably won't become a fan. Sorry #channel4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early #dalek experiments with creatures from earth... #doctorwho  https://t.co/3DcJSCDacj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @StarbucksUK service in your Melksham store today was appalling. We walked in and had to wait to be acknowledged. They were doing drive through a too, but a "Hello, be with you in a moment" wouldn't have hurt. Won't be coming back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how they'll smoothly segue into the weather tonight on #countryfile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serves you bloody right for helping them win the election, you bloody idiots! #bbc #ballsup #facepalm #toldyouso  https://t.co/y0uWsKzNj0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#firstandlast is utter shite! Makes #pointless season 843 look promising...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cheryl's eyes should have there own TV show... The Curse of the Eyes of Doom, or something... Keep expecting #thedoctor to pop in and save her from the blah blah blah, bored of this tweet now #thegreatestdancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all honesty, not a fan of #thegreatestdancer but #dancepoint just blew everything out of the water. Well done, really fantastic work. Amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrumpySkeletor In the words of "The Partridge Family", I think I love you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar The mere thought of it makes my, admittedly large amount of, skin crawl!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelycocktail Wasn't complaining! Just not sure how well you knew him 😉. There should be more hugs on TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best way to get over your #bodyimage issues is to get off fucking social media. You don't need to compare yourself to the rest of the world. I'm a right fat cunt... Don't look on social media! Fuck everyone else. #easywaystolivewell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fiona on #mastermind was a bit huggy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar You can use a better word than that... Onanist! Doesn't have an actual female transliteration, I believe, but what the heck... It's only Monday! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCTheOneShow isolation for students is the worst thing that has ever happened to schools. Rather than deal with an issue students are isolated, which makes it worse. Working in FE I have to pick up the pieces of students that have been isolated. It's an easy get out clause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was only missing the bit where #heman or #liono turned to the camera and said, "Today's story was all about...". Not belittling #MentalHealthAwareness but does it have to be ladled on with a massive spoon! The art of being subtle in drama has gone #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#doctorwho please don't be preachey tonight... Getting a bit bored of it now. Ta, xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Hear, fucking hear!! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... I finally give up with #raspberrypi's. They are shoddy pieces of shite that have drained too much of my precious life energy over the last 6 years... "Won't boot with a USB hard drive attached"... What a pile of wank! @Raspberry_Pi. I'm off to buy a proper computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Conservatives party political broadcast is just sad. Really sad. He's going to take his chance by removing all the funding you've had. Plus, you're very media savvy "Dave", or whatever your made up name is! #bollocks #fakenews #fuckoffborisyouslimeycunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mary Beard's Shock of the Nude... My TVGuide tells me it may contain nudity... I should fucking hope so!! #bbctwo #marybeard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... Being a bit preachy again tonight. #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I wonder which character is going to turn out to be another #doctor tonight? 😉 #bbcone #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@putthetellyon Too many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CPdeHaviland @davidschneider @AnimousUK It's been buried under #Charleroi since 1981<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathyBurke We appear to share similar physical and character traits... It's great isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar To my brightest bluest Star. It's not right in any world. But, in billions of years time, Sarah's atoms will be wandering the universe seeing all the wonders that it holds. Who knows, they might even meet some of yours. I'm sure they'll have a great time together xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #bbc. It's been fun watching you over the last, nearly, 47 years of my humble existence. But, due to the fact you wouldn't fight the #tory shitstorm, you are now going to go the way of the dinosaurs. I will shed a tear when you finally disintegrate... But only one. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrexitReality... #noeticdysentery. Thank you, and goodnight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror This is early test footage of a Yeti from Doctor Who.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary 8 years of bitching, slagging off and general nastiness. Yay!!!  https://t.co/dwpOeeD2lm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To have #smartmotorways, we need #smartMP's and we know we don't have any of them!! @BBCPanorama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the advice from #ukgovernment is to stay in your car or try and get out? Putting people's lives at risk. As always a fucking joke! @BBCPanorama. Why is the government making it the fault of the driver, not the tosser that signed off on #smartmotorways? Because they are useless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had the misfortune of watching #livingontheveg for five minutes. Why are #citv presenters running the show? Could it be any more patronising? #itv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryAndersonTV Baby Yoda...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found these in @marksandspencer just down the road from @ValerosoLounge... Maybe you could have sent someone to buy some... Not very expensive!  https://t.co/j5q9B2MTHa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now they've taken my drink away before I'd even got halfway through... Other half waved her over to get it back but she'd touched it by then and it was with other dirty glasses... Bleurgh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat in @ValerosoLounge in #Trowbridge... Not impressed. No buns for burgers, when it turned up I actually had to ask where my chilli was... Bit of an #omnishambles... Plus no one seems to have been here more than 2 shiftd!  https://t.co/bkGKyro1Sr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Well, if it makes someone feel good about themselves, then who are we to judge. Plus, it's more reliable than Tinder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion is kind of lost as they live in the plains of Africa, not in a jungle... I don't think he'll be able to sleep in a a jungle with all the noise from the jungle creature that he is not used too. Although, if he'd come from a zoo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@putthetellyon If it's #DavinaMcCall, then I'm never watching the show ever again. She's like #gonorrhea in a sixth form college... Everywhere!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm marrying an email<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well fuck me sideways... The fabulous @GraceandFrankie are back... Thank God! Normality has returned!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews fun-ish facts about an impeachment that could change the power across the world... Oh no, you're up #trumps arse as much as you're up #BorisJohnson's. Bye bye to neutrality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been listening to @BBCr4today, on and off, for nearly 50 years. I'm disgusted with the fact that it has become a #tory mouthpiece. Looks like all the free press in this country has finally died a death. At least there was no @bbclaurak droning away this morning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phantom_flinger Anyone on #ITV2 usually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How dare these foreign avians come over here, eating our food... I thought #Brexit meant #Brexit! #countryfile (#irony)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Channel hopping and landed on #itv2... #SupermarketSweep seems to be more cringey than the last time I watched this reboot... Where do they get these people from? Bus queues? Job Centres? Leave them where they were next time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Damn it, you found me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stickytarts Yes... Sadly missed as well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to say, delighted that #greatpotterythrowdown is back... One of my guilty pleasures that has been missed!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's talk about climate change as they waste paper by making paper aeroplanes! Fucking hell #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to #firstandlast celebrating mediocrity!! Yay!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's not an undead evil vampire, he's a very naughty boy!! #Dracula #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to do a new take on a vampire story, why not try making #necroscope by #BrianLumley. Great stories, 3D characters. Nothing like this bollocks on #bbcone #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a gay man, I love seeing a stereotypical young queen on screen... Not!! #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this #dracula or fucking #hollyoaks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror It's almost a genuflection, must be a good Roman Catholic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so wunderbar: Open Letter:  https://t.co/QYMWWAJ1TB Dear John Lyndon Sullivan... Bring it on you homophobic shitstain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a great idea. Let's all just slag off the new series of #DoctorWho so it gets cancelled again. Then we're all going to be fucked. If you don't like it, don't watch it and keep your mouths shut. If you like it, tell everyone! #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Now it's turned into #draculaad1972... We all know how well that worked... #Dracula #bbcone #fuckmesideways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a little tribute to the other members of the #leagueofgentlemen with the horror being #InsideNo9?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's terrible accents everywhere tonight #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the whole of #Dracula is going to be told in flashback? I hate flashbacks... I hate this interpretation of a wonderful story, to be fair. Sorry Steve and Mark, it's "nul points" from the Tweet the Telly jury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where the hell is #PeterCushing when you need him? #Dracula #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The name is #VanHelsing... #AgathaVanHelsing... License to something or other... Lost interest #Dracula #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #dracula get his cloak from the same magical place #themaster did in #thefivedoctors?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did we really need a #sherlock reference in this pile of shite! #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #dracula feels a little #scoobydoo in places<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this new #emporerpalpatine show on #bbcone looks awful... Oh no, wait it's supposed to be #Dracula. God help us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was such an amazing touch. Brought a tear to my cynical old eyes. #legend #doctorwho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then, #DoctorWho just finished... Popping in #twitter to watch the internet melt #mwahahahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientits ☑️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #dracula looks like a massive pile of shite! #bbc #notmylicencefee xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh #mocktheweek I do love you!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@No1Hornet @SellingAMirror I'm wondering what her other two listings are?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Time for @CraigRevHorwood to be booed at constantly by #fuckwits again. #StrictlyComeDancing #Strictly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both @RoyalMail and @parcelforce have let me down the last couple of days. Useless. Completely useless. Promising deliveries that don't appear. Tracking numbers are pointless. No wonder private companies are winning the postage battle. #terribleservice #pointless #wasteddays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror It's like an initiation ceremony for selling mirrors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is #MichaelMcIntyre just going to #fuckoff. He's not big, he's not clever and he most definitely is NOT FUNNY!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh no... I'm so upset... Who will they get to replace him... There can't be anyone else... I'm available if you're up for rocking the boat a bit @bbcone #theoneshow @BBCTheOneShow  https://t.co/CPTB8hC7uq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I do love a toffee penny... There I've said it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Depends if you're eating them or fucking them I guess...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really fucking hate #rent... #Strictly2019 #strictly #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it appears that @ClaudiaWinkle is wearing a dress made from the hair of dead #movellans... That'll upset the #daleks! #StrictlyComeDancing #doctorwho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror 16x32 what? Feet, miles, light years! Specifics needed before I can sleep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar And fuck you! Not really, cos you're adorable... but fuck you anyway xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not going to dis #childreninneed as it does a fantastic job. I just can't stand #tessdaly. She has to be the most insincere person on British tv!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's got to be #teamdivina all the bloody way! #RuPaulsDragRaceUK @dragraceukbbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #season2, please get @Lord_Sugar on to #readthosequeens! He'd be fantastic! @dragraceukbbc #thelibraryisopen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just scoffed a whole tube of #snackrite salt and vinegar crisps from #aldi. I don't care one fucking bit! Thank you and goodnight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are the subtitles for #strictly on a Sunday so far behind? The show is recorded... Everyone knows it's recorded... Just subtitle it normally! #StrictlyComeDancing #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Now, don't hold back... let us know what's really on your mind. It's good to get these things off your chest xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whirring sound you can hear is #bobfosse turning in his grave. That was a terrible routine from #emmaandanton #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What really annoys me about the audience on #StrictlyComeDancing2019 is that they always "boo" when a judge, especially @CraigRevHorwood, tells the truth. Yes it might look pretty, but this is a judged competition. The dancers need to improve by being told the truth! #strictly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got no idea who most of these "celebrities" are on #pointless tonight... So I doubt if most of the #saturdaynight mob who are only waiting for #Strictly have any idea at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror I'll start the bidding at £10...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @wordnuvola Rude! I shall immediately pray for your redemption or some shit 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CadburyUK Just sell us bloody chocolate for god's sake! We all know it's bad for us, but we enjoy it just the same without all these theatrics... Bring back the gorilla playing the drums or something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror Well it certainly isn't the "Sale of the Century..." Not at that price anyway #NicholasParsons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Mostly as it's complete arse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Just bottle it and sell it as an aperitif! "Eau de T" mayhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are #strictly ever gonna sort out the microphone on the star turn? Every week they get drowned out by the rapturous applause for the hoofers! #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019 #Strictlyresults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yay! #MichaelMcIntyre is back on the telly... I really wish he'd just fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's introduce our singers, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich! #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started watching #ForAllMankind bit dull... If this is what @Apple #TV+ is going to bring us... Don't think I'll bother if that's ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faye_derek I miss #AnnieWalker... Went downhill without her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Takes me back to my childhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Like #FreddyKrueger this will haunt your dreams for a long, long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a bloke on #qvcuk who's really excited about developing a silicon arsehole!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jae_fitz 46 and I still can't ride a bike... Sad, but true ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror The cat is adorable, but where did they get the bat bunting from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No wonder the IQ of the UK is rapidly decreasing... Watching morning TV is enough to melt anyone's brain. Thank God it's only a week for half term! @ITV @BBCOne @BBCTwo @Channel4 @channel5_tv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @ITV have turned #allrightonthenight into #youvebeenframed... At least #walliams is only a disembodied voice, so something to be thankful for? 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't going to tweet about #Strictly any more, as it's an easy target... But, fuck me the singing is awful tonight! #gwenstefani and #jimmysomerville should sue. #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror It's like that one out of the Harry Potter films... If that's their happy place then I dread to think...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #JohnWick3... How the fuck is #lovejoy in everything these days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a balanced diet is in order then... Meat and vegetables. Not the latest dietary news there. Plus, nothing wrong with eating all that protein as you pee out any your body doesn't need! 😁#eatwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Make sure you give it a sniff to make sure it's not anything nasty... It's what the doctor told me 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So five portions of fruit and veg is just an arbitrary figure... No real scientific research on that... #eatwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TakeAShite Isn't this a #montypython sketch...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never want to see #BenMitchell move his hips like that ever again  #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TakeAShite What if you don't have any elderly relatives? To whom do you give the stamps then? I mean, you've gone and bought them, shame to waste them... being so expensive and all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #hangry section on #theoneshow is just about as believable as one of those convoluted #topgear skits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that @KelloggsUK #whitechocolate #cocopops are the cereal equivalent of #theemporersnewclothes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Because it's hysterically AWFUL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror It's like being at the fairground!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to confess that it's taken nearly twelve years to realise that @tomallencomedy was #PipBin in #BleakExpectations. I feel I should flagellate myself immediately!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Fuck the world, just be you. Be you and Mr The Bluest Star standing on the edge of the universe looking out into the great beyond, and eat chips xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emma better be super fucking amazing this week or she should find #Dev and give him her place! #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I can't claim credit for this, it was in the tweet immediately above yours and I thought it would make you feel better... being all Irish and stuff xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What drugs are the people who choose these song mashups on? #StrictlyComeDancing #Strictly #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar  https://t.co/t2lI06O4TS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with @CraigRevHorwood Emma did look like someone threw a bag of #kingedwards on the floor at the end. Saying that, she is an accomplished amateur and to put that together in a couple of days should get some credit. #Strictly #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StillOpenAllHours, #stillnotfunny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a bit of classic #doctorwho #theinvisibleenemy with the fab @Lou_Jameson and the gorgeous #TomBaker!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skinny_fatbloke Limp cheese and tomato sandwich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#eatwellforless is on... Just going to delete Twitter... It's simpler 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TakeAShite It's that a dead hampster to the right of the picture? Don't fancy that in a sausage roll!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really sorry @bbcstrictly but the decision to get rid of #dev is an absolute joke. He's a more competent dancer and was better in the dance off. #fix #strictly2019 #Strictlyresults #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five minutes and I'm turning off #TheWall. Why not just have #angelarippon present the show, rather than a disembodied voice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's never too early for a sherry for Shirley!😁 #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Shirley should cut back on the pre-show sherry!😁 #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror This is the stuff of actual nightmares! I feel scarred for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then... @TheCWSupergirl is still trying to be several different shows at once. It's kind of mostly failing at all of them. The only redeeming feature from episode 1 was @MelissaBenoist's wonderful revelation to @Katie___McGrath. Beautiful scene. Shame it won't probably last!☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #dyson are full of shit then. Stop buying their fucking overpriced products! #wiltshire #electriccar #debacle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, they did look like ice dildos... #TheApprentice #TheApprentice2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You're going home in a great big taxi cab" #TheApprentice #TheApprentice2019 or two...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't keep my hands up this much... It hurts! #TheApprentice #TheApprentice2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do wish that @Lord_Sugar still used the #amstrad #emailer to call the lady in reception. It was a fab product and I would still love one today! #TheApprentice #TheApprentice2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How @karren_brady keeps her cool is a complete mystery. You have the most amazing willpower. #TheApprentice2019 #theapprentice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KialoHQ I love trolls and shouting matches, so I'll stay here thanks! Good luck xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#theoneshow is a visual version of #takeabreak... That's in the fact that it's fucking awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another night of them screeching out songs from movies... God awful noise! #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best scenes in a film ever is where #jamescosmo says goodnight to his wife in #allthequeensmen. Just a simple, beautiful thing screenwritten by the amazing @davidschneider. The rest of the film is not bad either... Even with #mattleblanc!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SaturdayKitchen must be running short of guests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chinnyhill10 It's it wrong to just not give a shit? This can't be a real person. She's just so dull!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband and I got married on a shoestring and had an amazing day with close friends and family. Of course, being gays, #theoneshow doesn't give a shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blond cockney one reminds me of a young #lordsugar or some other blah blah blah #theapprentice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... The time has come... #cockwomble alert!!! #theapprentice is back!! Woo woo!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get patriotic very often, but #dinaashersmith was just bloody marvelous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does it feel nigh on impossible to delete a bloody @EA online account. I don't want to have to talk to someone, I'm a grown up and want to delete the account I was forced into getting to play bloody #fifa19 that one time... Plus it keeps getting hacked. You're bloody useless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg is a lieing sack of shit #channel4news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BBCNews @Channel4News @SkyNews etc. Please interview people who aren't out and about during the day because they are the ones who don't have a vested interest in staying in the #eu. Please talk to real people with jobs and a notion of what is actually going on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror It's to keep him inflated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the sneaky advert for #DragRaceUK in #eastenders...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't Sonia just #fuckoff! #eastenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJHesketh @Im_Cheaper_ @Morrisons You could start worshipping an ancient Greek or Roman deity... Probably the only reasonable way is going to appear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror #pauldaniels eat your heart out! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I had a dream where a little girl ran away and as I went to chase her I flew up in the air and a monster grew out of the planet, ripping it to shreds. I've booked myself in to Gresty Fennels home for the criminally incontinent just in case 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thankvis Basically anyone else! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CDisillusion I've got a handbasket in the corner of the room asking if I'd like to go to hell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ratwomanme Cheesy chips and rhubarb gin from a can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I might start watching #TheVentureBros again... From the beginning. It's just fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IStandWithNaga say no more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss #LynnFauldsWood. Even #annerobinson was enjoyable TV... Dumbed down drivel #watchdog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a Twitter vote is a scientific method of measuring stuff... Let's run a parliamentary vote now #bestorworst #watchdog #ffs #labourorconservative #youdecide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So flushable wipes aren't flushable... At the forefront of reporting tonight #watchdog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So no one at #pontins #cambersands recognised the lady off the telly booking in? #bollocks #watchdog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thewall #tippingpoint... What's next #whackamole on the bloody telly? Stop going to the seaside and using games from the pier as primetime entertainment* (*allegedly)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did #partypoliticalbroadcasts become soap operas? What happened to a man in a suit telling you how one party would do better than another? I miss the simpler times<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Don't think there's going to be a Hollywood handshake...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm sorry my dear, but I'm more of a Kelvin fan - just don't tell the husband! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar The small yellow shark appears to be excreting a person... This is the stuff nightmares are made of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The terraforming scene in #DarkPhoenix isn't half as impressive as the #genesisproject from #startrek2, and that was nearly 40 years ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, halfway through #darkphoenix and it's fucking terrible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @michellevisage was just purely fabulous! #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else get a #kinda vibe in #StrictlyComeDancing just then #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @bbclaurak It's because she has no soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insideoutwest. I kinda get what these parents are trying to do, but it just seems extreme. Cute kid, but can't they work out their own journey? Even being gender neutral is still being a gender. Surely it's the child's choice to choose who they want to be, not yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror What are the blue bits for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus chips! @jarvisma are wet going to cope?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm this drunk! Gorgeous! 😁  https://t.co/CoF6sUQiKn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You watch one #space1999 video on the interweb and the bloody theme tune is stuck with you forever! I'm currently annoying the hubby @jarvisma by whistling it really badly whilst waiting for dinner to turn up!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I have to say I identify with the portly lady at the bottom of the picture. Also, I am a bit drunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Pinot Grigio Fizz... Looks for delete button... 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Makes note to self to rewrite will in the morning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar That nurse from yesterday is down there... Having another look!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a #BigGirlsBlouse and I think that @BorisJohnson is an empty vessel, making pointless noises, as he knows that nothing he can do now will have any effect.

<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I'm sure it would have been an 8... Not that I have any experience in judging such matters, but it's a nice number! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Did she give you a score of of 10?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just resurrected my #google #nexus7 (2012) after being "lost" for about 3 years... I can't believe it still switches on, let alone charges. What a wonderful device. I have missed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stuck behind the family from hell in a #subway... Not on a bank holiday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to #bankholiday TV? Now it's just another day. Not even a #jamesbond film on until 9pm... And that's on #itv4!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's it me or was #deborahmeaden looking for the red button during that song @BBCDragonsDen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Erm... @BBCDragonsDen I think this bike thing already exists...  https://t.co/DYtgqCovCM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @BBCDragonsDen is a bit like #Menudo. Just goes on and on and changes the line up as the members grow up... #peterlord... maybe one day you'll escape!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fourfoot Made a note to scribble Tenby off the bucket list, when I return home...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If children were actually taught the value of things then we would solve a lot of problems overnight! #shopwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... STOP BUYING STUFF YOU DON'T NEED! #simples #shopwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about you buy your own fucking mobile phone you spoilt Trollope! #shopwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giffgaff having an issue with signal in Bristol. Activated a new SIM last night and topped up. Now, 24 hours later, no network access to 2G. Quite frustrating as it's for an elderly relative. Is this a problem across the board?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar It's down to your age, you're a lady, your age, your age, you're a lady and it's all downhill from now. I don't have a happy ditty to rhyme that to from the YouTube. Oh, and your age. And you're a lady. And stuff. Not sure about the lady bit... You might just be old. I'm fucked😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Hopefully you're not allergic to either of the main ingredients. If you are, then I'm afraid I don't have an EpiPen to hand as I'm about an hour and a half away from you. On a positive note, I do have the tune to #deckthehalls running through my head. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #greggwallace pronounces croissant with an "r" one more time I'm going to have a complete #bitchfit. #insidethefactory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you think it's safe to put the telly back on, @jimalkhalili appears on #PointlessCelebrities. Yay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not as oversweet as some of the other ones, but it's a bit like drinking #mouthwash. @Lipton  https://t.co/lc6ELw5aC4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @TheDCUniverse please pick up #Krypton. I know it's had a slow start, it's been a bit inconsistent, and it's been on @SYFY (who have a habit of cancelling shows just as they start to get good), but it deserves at least a season 3. Bring it back into the fold! #BringSegHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, who the hell are half of these "celebrities" on #celebritymasterchef?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when #eastenders can't get any worse #adeedmondson appears!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#krypton has gone a bit #GameOfThrones with all the blood, guts and violence. Not complaining... It's about time! @KryptonSYFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Looks a bit scary for me... (roots around for a Catherine Cookson and a cup of cocoa)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The fabulous @jimalkhalili is on #bbc4. Love a bit of decent science on the telly! #smartphones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Slept like crap so look forward to being erased from history? Mwahahahahahahahahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarvisma Every single drawn out and lengthening day of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterOnions @SellingAMirror That wallpaper is just atrocious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar I shall erase you from history for such evildoing! Or not... Depends how I sleep tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarvisma please can we have a TARDIS shower curtain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to #marklobel, #nigelfarage is a #marmite figure. He's really not. He's an evil toady who will follow the band wagon on any topic and then deny all knowledge. #polishedturd  https://t.co/TUchvrj3T0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#topoftheshop is a nice idea, but it's a bit confusing in execution. Is it #dragonsden, #theapprentice, #millionpoundmenu or a cooking vehicle for Tom Kerridge. Just don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; 30 - 50 Feral Hogs. I recently found their first album in a Sue Ryders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, tried @Skittles yoghurty coated. Divine! In other news a picture of my cat!  https://t.co/ezXvyIAcpA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SellingAMirror She could have at least made the bed and had a tidy round. Shocking. Imagine coming round to buy it! ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @angel28kc PS... She knows #jesus loves her... Say no more!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar @angel28kc Now, now. Just because this person is living in a deluded fantasy land doesn't mean she hasn't got the right to say these things. She's wrong, very wrong, very wrong indeed. One day her sins will catch up with her. Or possibly a mob with pitchforks and burning effigies. #ttfn xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarvisma more @todrick on the telly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to be honest, as a fully paid up member of the #gayclub I couldn't stand #queerasfolk. Watched an episode... Didn't watch any more. #nufsaid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar No you can't... It's rude. That's not a nice word to use in public. I use it myself from time to time but only in a darkened locked room. Mostly when I'm talking about #greggwallace xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've no problem with #eatinglessmeat, but it's the middle-class tossers lording being a vegetarian/vegan over the rest of the world that pisses me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, @BBCRadio4 here's a suggestion for the first #moralmaze of the next series. Should #MichaelBuerk watch his p's and q's around the #NHS and how it spends it's money?  https://t.co/lmKcXQJYPY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about old people... Let's just let them out in the coldest, darkest winter nights and let them fend for themselves... Maybe people aged 73. Used to respect #michaelbuerk now I just think he's a fucking cunt. Sorry, not sorry. I'm off to eat a cake! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hallelujah! #InsideTheFactory is on. Just popping out to take a long walk in a short pier. #greggwallace #dearlord #istherenobeginningtohistalents!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear their must be a version of hell where #TheOneShow is playing on a continuous loop. One dreary bunch of segues after another for eternity. I fear my place has already been booked... Front row seat... Oh dear!☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought this #Oasis #aquashock today, and it's really quite nasty! Avoid! 😁  https://t.co/iUPiRa5imI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Now, now, we can't be horrible to the criminally insane. He just needs a new jacket... White with very long sleeves. Followed by a short stay a Gresty Fennals. Then he can be reintroduced to society in a useful role as a street cleaner or something xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insidethefactory so cakes are eaten by people in the North and the South... Well there's how we solve Brexit... Put it on a #cherrybakewell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insidethefactory   Me: Those cherries are a bit wonky!  Husband: That's cos that cunt put them on.  Me:😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Greggwallace in the nut room... Let's hope they let him out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm... 😁  https://t.co/Ifjc8OdNSL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working my way through #DRAGSOS what an amazing programme. Let's start #nationaldragservice... Might sort out a few problems we're having in the world! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #NigelFarage is saying that watching #DonaldTrump is like watching the #daleks... He does know who they were based on, doesn't he? #doctorwho  https://t.co/2tVNyAWZsf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Now, now... Don't tell everyone or they'll all want to come round and help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Well I've been mopping up dried in cat sick, so I think I'm edging ahead of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to watch #season3 of the amazing #HandmaidsTale but every picture I see from it, someone's crying. Is it too much to ask for a musical number?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnCraven you are a broadcasting legend! You started my crazy obsession with TV! Thanks!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBluestStar Today I am wearing lobster pants. There, that's an image for you to scream yourself to sleep with later! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#borisjohnson "I'm going to promise everything I can, because I know that none of it will ever happen". Surely people aren't going to still believe this #chump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the concept of #insidethefactory, but #greggwallace is a twat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well fuck me sideways... Not a complete #dipshit! #six questions right in #universitychallenge 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference with putting a man in the moon and #Brexit, #BorisJohnson, is that the moon landing wasn't headed up by a buffoon! (Which I fear Brexit will be soon) #NotMyPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #whodunnit #timetodye. Not only the wonderful #JohnPertwee but the fabulous #PaulDarrow. I thinks he channeling #columbo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#annwiddicombe is just a huge bag of #homophobic #shit. She's a disgrace to this country. #notinmyname #notwhilethereisbreathinmybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#greggwallace is the #borisjohnson of the culinary world #eatwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #familybraingames is about embarrassing young children on national television. Yay! (Not)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#familybraingames is so dull. I love quiz shows, but this just sucks the life out of the genre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sat watching @bbcPoV and I'm not sure I like this new format. I do miss an in-vision presenter. I'm available #bbc if you need someone!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you think #YearofTheRabbit can't get any better... Bloody #keeleyhawes appears!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lasted about 10 seconds of #borisjohnson on the @BBCOne debate... Just had to turn off. None of these candidates are worthy, or trustworthy, to run this country. Open it to the people, let democracy decide... as if!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or are #littlemix on #TheOneShow just fucking awful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've let @fergieweather have a brolly! About time @bbcpointswest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got to the robot bit... It's this supposed to be serious grown up drama?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm battling through the first episode... It's hard work. Terrible script, dodgy acting, predictable storylines... Boring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only person that things #yearsandyears is a bit shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad news that #PaulDarrow has passed away. One of my all-time favourite good guys! Give my regards to #servalan! #blakes7 #RIPPaulDarrow #liberatorcrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KillingEve #season2 not quite as good as season 1, but @jodiecomer is absolutely phenomenal. @IamSandraOh just keeps giving and giving. The rest of the cast keep getting better as the story becomes more convoluted. Catch up on #bbciplayer before it starts again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #annwiddicombe... #fuckoff    https://t.co/dkw7H9b3Nv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCabournSmith This was definitely one of the best things to be on the radio in a long time... If only there were a few more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So has #Swansea turned into a recycling #nazistate? #TheOneShow #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly couldn't give a flying fuck about #GavinandStacey. Never watched it... Don't intend to start at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pointlesscelebrities is going swimmingly tonight! #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#numberonesandnumbertwos... Second half of the round name is quite appropriate! #TheHitList #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vogue, bit more #vague #imho #TheHitlist #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheHitList don't think it's going to be a patch on #namethattune! #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#michaelgove jogging is enough to make me bring back up my dinner! #bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else finding #thetwilightzone a bit dull? Each story becoming less and less interesting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My poor husband has had to endure half an hour of me watching @RealLyndaCarter changing into #wonderwoman... It must be love lol. PS How many purses did she get through? Different one every episode!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this goes against current trends, but #greggwallace is a smug #arsehole. Telling people to swap teabags when he's stuffing his face down #theivy or some other fine establishment. #eatwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me, #eatwellforless is sinking to its usual patronising level. #frozenspinach... What next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #annewiddicombe is showing her #homophobic side again on #sundaypolitics @bbcpointswest. This woman is a disgrace to politics and the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #TheBrexitParty you are a joke. Your leader is a joke, your existence is a joke. #FuckOff, just #FuckOff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @itvwestcountry for the first time in a #LONG time. I miss he good old days. These two couldn't look less interested in the news of they tried! Bring back proper #HTV. Won't be watching again for a while... @bbcpointswest all the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No spoilers, but @Maisie_Williams turns it up to #eleven tonight... and then keeps on going! #bloomingmarvellous #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @CadburyUK, I remember the celebrities in your adverts, as I am 46. Your #darkmilk is not for me, as it tastes like death. Please stop making it at once. Thanks. Ta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Americans on #theoneshow is priceless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had this bollocks posted to me today. I've only got one thing to say to #TheBrexitParty... Go fuck yourselves you ridiculous pieces of flotsam and jetsam. I would never vote for you and that obsequious, self-serving tosspot #NigelFarage  https://t.co/pJYgqrRqXk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Girl! You are on top form tonight! @cherish_finden #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My #blueplaque... "Today I swore to never watch #TheOneShow ever again, as it's utter shite!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, #theoneshow is down to it's usual standards tonight... #UFOs, #russelltdavis, what more could a boy want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AvengersEndgame ☑️, #GameOfThrones ☑️, #LineOfDuty ☑️... Safe to get back on the internet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of being a miserable old fart... A picture of my cat. Makes a change I guess? 😁  https://t.co/Sc3uhV6pK5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #martinanavratilova has kind of boiled my piss this morning by suggesting that, "men will become women" to win medals in sport... Seriously! What planet are you on? #transphobia at it's worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if I missed the ruler tonight, but thank goodness @cherish_finden is back on the telly!! #GBBO Oh, and the fabulous @tomallencomedy!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #catchpoint is a total pile of toss. Should be used to this on a Saturday night from #bbcone now. Trying to be #ITV and are going the right way about it! Sad day for us all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well @GameOfThrones was a bit of a disappointment... Wasn't expecting fluffy, filler episodes in the final season... but we got one! 🐉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have recently been on a train, and wish to god that I had had drink! Journey from hell.  https://t.co/6ZS0uhyNm4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#greggwallace is on the telly again... Where's the bloody remote? #SupermarketSecrets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_lequesne I just love being old!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#yourhomemadeperfect Robert can't hide his disgust at the small changes they have made to accommodate having a family!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#yourhomemadeperfect really? They've built a box on the side of the house? Well at least it's a flat roof extension... That won't start to leak soon or anything...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#yourhomemadeperfect... Three foot drop into hard wooden floor. Sensible move with three young children... Sit in the garden casually watching them fall down... Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#yourhomemadeperfect. The guy architect is a bit of a #dick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the actual fuck has happened to #benmitchell? #eastenders #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ripoffbritain, theme music composed on a 1987 #bontempikeyboard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or does the trailer for #forest404 sound like the opening to #nebulous starring the amazing @Markgatiss #bbcone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see that homophobic old cunt #lionelblair is still going! #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then #LineOfDuty, still giving us the runaround... #bastards! (But it's still bloody marvellous)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope that #whatshername from #whereveritwas enjoys this moment in the limelight. What a terrible show #AllTogetherNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKChristmasTV It's utter drivel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank fuck #AllTogetherNow is nearly over. How any of the #100 call themselves experts when they don't pick up on breathing errors, over mouthing, straining and other simple errors is beyond me. Please don't bring it back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting down with a fantastic glass of #wildrabbit from @Secret_Orchard_ and a couple of amazing sausage rolls provided by @LJHorners. Looking forward to cheese from @thesomersetdeli later. All thanks to @EatFestivals #eatweston.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #thetruthaboutobesity, which one of the many different ways are we supposed to try. I'm quite happy to volunteer for anything to stop being a fat cunt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, my piece of string only works if I'm 18 feet tall #thetruthaboutobesity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a grumpy old #queen, and I don't care one jot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. Train's now delayed and I have cramp in my thigh... Other people are all cunts and I wish they would all fuck off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus the "guys" on the other side of the aisle just keep wittering on about utter bollocks. Shut up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking phone now... Hope they're not on twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to the #ribena and how much water is in it... And a snog and fondle. Fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now they're on the #kinderbueno. This is like a really bad TV show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now they're analysing a bottle of #ribena... Something with passion fruit. Oh god!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat on a train coming home from London... Couple opposite are really loved up... Get a room you filthy so and so's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... @theresa_may is going from #Berlin to #Paris... If she'd just rearranged her schedule, she could have managed a bit of disco to brighten up #brexit...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @McVities not very satisfied with your "Limited Edition" #strawberry #jaffacakes. There isn't even the vaguest hint of strawberry in them at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @MrJonCryer has made #Supergirl worth watching again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @PoseOnFX is just fucking #fabulous. #80s, #houseofevangelista, #vogue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone's going abroad it seems! #EastEnders. Hopefully they won't be affected by #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then, I wonder how @BBCCountryfile are going to smoothly segue into the weather tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving @SHOBlackMonday! Phenomenal cast, superb writing and funny AF. Please watch this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've sat through, and defended, many seasons of #Gotham but this latest episode is just fucking awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AllTogetherNow really is shite!🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AllTogetherNow #itsakindoftragic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a bit of a cynical old queen when it comes to @BBCTheOneShow but the story about Jack is so inspiring that everyone should watch it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry to everyone involved, but is there a day in the week that @TVsPointless isn't on? That might be the day to surface from my pit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really excited about the new series of #AllTogetherNow, oh wait... No I'd rather shit in my hand and clap!! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me, #Hollyoaks is a complete pile of wank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#insidethefactory never fails to surprise me as to how thick "TV celebs" really are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @bbcpointswest please let the poor @fergieweather inside. The poor begger must have done something really wrong to never be let in the studio these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a pastiche, it's still just awful. These programmes are bad enough already without this "affectionate" piss-take. #ThisTimeWithAlanPartridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so sorry, #ThisTimeWithAlanPartridge is just awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you do vote whilst watching "on demand" then you are a fucking dipshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who the choreographer is for #GreatestDancer but they are bloody awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't watched any of #greatestdancer until tonight... Now I can see why. It's such a shame that the professional dancer showed up her act!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love a bit of @gracedent action on #MasterChefUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still not sure if I like this new format for @MastermindQuiz seems a bit too #TheChase for my liking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The audience on #100kdrop look like they've been bussed in from #bullseye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#jeremykyle should lead the next round of #Brexit negotiations, as he seems to think that taking slowly and shouting at people is the way to win a situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Origin does make it to another season, can you please find a way to bring back #FionnulaFlanagan? She been the only ray of light in this depressing event!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pam on #callthecleaners might be a hoarder, but my god she looks fantastic for #seventy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @YouTube #Origin is a big pile of clichéd twaddle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheOtherTwo is just fantastic. Beautifully written and superbly acted! New favourite show! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a bit of #rhonddawegian drama with the hubby. #Hidden #s4c #itsinbloodywelsh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manilaluzon  https://t.co/SNtl4dtyYM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, #smallfortune looks like another piece of high quality entertainment from #itv... Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why play a song and then have people talk over it...? #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited about my new #rationbook that will be coming through the door on #1stApril2019. We are such a lucky country. Yay for #brexit #BrexitShambles #nofoodintheshops #fuckme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the guests on #TheOneShow tonight is a bit like looking at a before and after (the other way round). His face must have cost a fortune! #bros<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... I got fired for just saying the word "#fisting" in the staff room... It's like being @JulianClary in 1993!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vincecable is not exactly inspiring when it comes to #PeoplesVoteNow. #LibDem boring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #cheryl dressed like a #seventiesbathroomsuite? #theonesgow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BBCOne, please stop advertising the last series of #luther on #iplayer. It was terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is #ianbeale still such a gullible twat? #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me, now we have to say goodbye to our stuff... #Kondo #TheOneShow #whataloadofbollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An actress doesn't sound like she does in a film... That's acting #mattbaker, it's what they do! #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Conservative party is full of crap. They have lied, led the country into chaos and shown their true colours with regards to what they actually care about. They have let this country down and #TheresaMay should resign immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see #theoneshow is back with vim, vigour and the same soulless bollocks as last year! Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next Sunday on #channel5, Britain's Favourite Letters of the Alphabet! Will your fave make it into the top 20? Vote now !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thegreatestdancer seems to take all the worst elements of TV talent shows and then adds #cheryl as the cherry on the bottom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, #EastEnders is making #brookside look realistic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or is #EastEnders just going from bad to ridiculous?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#replay2018, I have no idea who most of these #celebs are! I think that's not a bad thing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the point of the grumpy old queen on #alltogethernow? Never stands up, never smiles, boo!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's #ChristmasEve, and there's fuck all on the telly... No surprise there then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh, @courtneyact on #mastermind... There is a God!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did #mastermind become so glitzy? Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I dropped a tab of something? #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone at the #bbc please promote @ClaudiaWinkle to main host on #StrictlyComeDancing as she just so much more personable than the other lady. #Fanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That cock dribble excuse for a #christmas  campaign is on the #bbc again. It really is twaddle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a merry Christmas one and all #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThePredator is... Really, really bad. We're talking #Brexit level bad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be honest, I don't give a flying fuck how millionaire #phillipschofield spends his money at #christmas... I've got tuppence to spare this year so might be a stick and a hoop for the Mr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #StrictlyComeDancing2018 how many more times are they going to shoehorn in #ChrisEvans before the night is over #iplayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure who's wearing more makeup... #alfie or #kat? #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheHauntingOfHillHouse or #tenhoursofmylifeillnevergetback. Sorry, but this is awful, just awful. Badly written, badly acted, badly executed. Avoid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spankybackpack #drivel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No... I hate this #BBCOneChristmas twaddle. Bring back the spinning pudding. At least it did what it said on the tin, rather than provide a story that no one cares about! Please don't do this again next year... Oh and please get rid of #oneness ta. #bbcone #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a pile of wank! Why is the #BBCOneChristmas thing more emotionally draining than the #JohnLewis Christmas ad? What is the world coming too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then, what's the link between all the z-listers tonight? #pointlesscelebrities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, moved over to #bbc2... Can't comment on #mastercheftheprofessionals as that polished turd #greggwallace is gurning away already and I think I might implode my account!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, #kirstieallsopp is taking the piss with this shite! #theoneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!! Multi-million heiress #kirstieallsopp is on #theoneshow telling us how to do Christmas on the cheap. Patronising twaddle alert!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #tv. Please can we have something that doesn't have as fucking flashback in it. Why does everything have to happen in the fucking past!! (In the context of the show that is)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cyclist (#noun): Person who shows blatant disregard for the highway code, unless you pass within 152 #lightyears of them whilst overtaking. At this point they remember point 163, and start shouting about it as they fade into the distance behind you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone else finding @TheCWSupergirl just really FUCKING DULL lately... well, since season two. Please stop trying to ram morality down our throats. We get the world is bad right now. I'd prefer a bit of escapism in my TV rather than this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early to bed tonight. Can't be arsed to watch #watchdog any more... Not the same since #hughscully stopped presenting it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Talking of #DoctorWho are we going to have an opening title sequence tonight? Kind of my favourite part...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see #TheFlash reveal the season villain in an epilogue... again! Just as it was starting to turn into #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoever the poor bugger having to sing all these high notes on #Strictly tonight had better have a rest tomorrow! #StrictlyComeDancing #strictly2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Strictly is back... Can't be horrible to @CraigRevHorwood as we have a mutual friend!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! Now there are two human emojis in #MasterChefUK #greggwallace and #johnpartridge. Woo bloody hoo!! Which one's worse, you decide!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you think #theoneshow can't get any worse, fucking #jackwhitehall appears... On a scale of 1 to #jamescorden he's about an 8.54887<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#wtf has #ruby done to her teeth? #EastEnders<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone else completely underwhelmed by the prospect of #TheCircle later? Reality TV is so last century!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a bit of #startrek #voyager... #courseoblivion. I just love #katemulgrew. Bloody fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Xfactor still don't know what this foetus #LouisTomlinson knows about a) judging and b) talent... So judging a talent show must be really pushing him to the limit of his ability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayjayhetty @jarvisma @Morrisons It wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had, and it probably wasn't worth the hassle... But, it was tasty and filled a hole. 4 out of 10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!! Only three hours after leaving the house this morning!😮😜  https://t.co/yoXRomt0SF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been here so long it evaporated!  https://t.co/4i9CLDKVQj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a full head of luscious dark hair when I came in!!  https://t.co/Ovty28bJX8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spy a microwave... Might go and heat up a pastie while I'm waiting  https://t.co/1mdZdAo8Q0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still waiting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🎶Just a spoonful of slushee helps the coffee that doesn't exist go down🎶  https://t.co/4ny50kzjuz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No longer my lucky number!  https://t.co/iPYPk8y6a6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They hadn't run out of coffee, just said they had... Then brought out more beans. It's a bit like an episode of #thetwilightzone or #beadlesabout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm eating a slush puppies with a spoon as they apparently ran out of straws too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the waiting continues...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably should have read the reviews before we came. Was enticed by the big breakfast... Bastards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stood in the cafe queue at @Morrisons Weston... Fuck me, I only want a bit of breakfast... Going to be drawing my pension by the time I get to the till!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the love of all that is holy, can we please put #greggwallace on fucking mute!!! Totally ruins @MasterChefUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#andipeters... For the love of God, please grow old!!! It's not fair on the rest of us!!😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never heard of her before, but I think #stellaparton is my new favourite person!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely the women smashing the glass on #TheOneShow should have been wearing eye protection? Just a thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #kirstieallsopp should wind her neck in... BBC News - Kirstie Allsopp's parenting tips: 'I smashed my kids' iPads'  https://t.co/Aqcp69PjX8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, how is #LouisTomlinson qualified to "judge" on a "talent" show. Fucking joke #XFactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #slimer... Next time can you please take that #smugcunt from #Halifax with you so we get no more of these fucking shitty adverts... Thanks XXX #Ghostbusters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#5GoldRings sweet mother of God... Has it really come to this... #hoopla on the telly... I give up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not watched #shopwellforless tonight as it's just a pile of shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #MasterChefUK. My god, #anitaharris looks stunning!! How the hell does she look the same as when I was a small child. I want what she's having!!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad the #theventurebros is back on the telly. A superb piece of animation and a masterpiece of writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShopWellForLess could learn a lesson from #DIYSOS and really help people who need it, not families who can't work out why they have no money because they spend it all on stuff they don't need!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShopWellForLess I'm sorry, but you're just shouting out "I'm an arse..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @stephbreakfast @MissAlexjones Please stop making this drivel! #shopwellforless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShopWellForLess is a complete pile of wank. Just proves that you can make a TV show out of any old toss these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShopWellForLess spoilt brat alert!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShopWellForLess #blinkineck will be replacing the more traditional #bleep over a swear word from this moment forth!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I do love @PrueLeith, but why the cable tie necklace??? #catchingup #GBBO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#papasmurf is on #therepairshow #bbc2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... Watching #starwars #episode4. Why didn't the #deathstar just blue up the big red planet? Even if it was too big to destroy completely, the damage done would severely screw up the moon the rebel base is on... #justathought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we need so many adverts for ladies having an #accident and #thrush? Especially at #teatime...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ginoswinyourwishlist... A sofa... A fucking sofa... Fuck me sideways... (Watching on plus one)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... The inventor bloke with his "camera" that looked a lot like it was filming children... Hmmm. #britainsparkinghell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the child parking space "hero" has parked in the supermarket but isn't shopping... Anything to say about that @asda #britainsparkinghell #mindyourownbusiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "child parking saviour" on #britainsparkinghell needs to get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "inventor" on #britainsparkinghell is just a bit of a dick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The women from #aplaceinthesunwintersun is on #theoneshow... She doesn't look the same in Leeds as she does in the Bahamas...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #vinted is where you sell clothes, why is she selling a satchel in the advert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#starwars #thephantommenace... They have so many opportunities to do in #jarjarbinks... Why let it live?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with these twats on #escapetothecountry... Fucking hell, give me £800000 and I'll move in to any of the houses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WeddingDayWinners what a load of #codshit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The latest batch of #Vodafone adverts are just #shite... Please go back to selling us overpriced contract phones rather than dramady shorts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear the wife is #gayletuesday... #EatWellForLess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, everyone goes shopping with a camera crew attached to them #EatWellForLess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat watching the #WorldCupFinal but only so I don't miss the @bbcdoctorwho series 11 trailer... Once it's been on I'm gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #michaelbuble tribute on #comedinewithme was a bit terrible, to be honest... Not that the original is much better #more4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for boil in the bag Ripley! #alienressurection is on #filmfour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does it seem like every advert has to #rhyme these days... #BORING!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beccaspeaks I have to be honest... I turned off before the very end, as there were tears... I think the mother and son were in the lead as I recall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #fourinabed on #more4... What the fuck sort of name is Jeronomy? Is that even a real thing... Seriously, who names their child #geronimo... #Deuteronomy ... #jeremy... #wtf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is yet another perfect example of why #PiersMorgan should not be allowed on TV. The man has a racist, sexist, homophobic and political agenda that is not in touch with the 21st Century.  https://t.co/wlZwakDqgQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnie_langford is just totally amazing. From my earliest memories of her as #violetelizabeth in Just William, to Mel in #DoctorWho to Carmel in #EastEnders, plus all the other stuff in-between. A true legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the 1954 version of #nineteeneightyfour. The first #twominutehate is a bit like a #DonaldTrump rally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is the point of #BlindDate to remove these gimps from the gene pool? If not, just floating an idea to TV execs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#traceybreakstheneews is utter #shite... Can you not go back to America where people pretended you were funny<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheWomenOfWho Thank God he has finally gone! Good riddance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, #LostInSpace continues to get more and more fucking ludicrous... Pisses me off that shite like this gets made, and great shows are cancelled every year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Battling through #LostInSpace... Fuck me it gets worse... Didn't think it was possible... Do they all die? Probably for the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostinspacetv this is not #lostinspace. This is 21st century pedestrian twaddle. Yet one more childhood memory raped and sodomised. Make up new stuff, stop fucking over the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lostinspace #netflix why is #maureenrobinson such a whiney  bitch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god... They crowned Kenny! Yay! #MasterChefUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #masterchef, which dish isn't the most important they've ever cooked?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or did the #peb for the #liberaldemocrats seem really disjointed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely to see @cherish_finden on the TV. Always lights up a room!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sueperkins there's a bit of hate going around about the #GenerationGame. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yourself and Miss Mel are sublime. Keep up the good work. #bloodymarvellous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheTitan what a load of #shite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to #h2g2 on @BBCRadio4... It's a bit bollocks. I'll stick to the original if that's ok<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ITVWales It brings back memories of when #ITV was somewhere to watch interesting programmes that weren't full of "celebrities". When regional programming wasn't a 20 minute news opt-out a day. When Independent Television meant just that, not the sponsored farce it morphed into.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just when you think it can't get any worse, #antondubeke fucking turns up #WeddingDayWinners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #WeddingDayWinners isn't here to numb us all completely before the world is destroyed later this year. Thanks @BBCOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WeddingDayWinners #fuckme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/UNQvmPHRSq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to work... #boo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Inferno is a really bad film... Really, really bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#hootenanny is no substitute for the word #crackerjack (#crackerjack) and should not be used as such!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don't get #EdSheeran and I probably never will #hootenanny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phantom_flinger I didn't realise there was a funny one... #SundayBrunch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Je_suis_Lilly Sounds like an excellent plan... Where's the gin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itv #allstarmusicals repeated already? Oh dear, oh dear oh dear, oh dear oh dear oh dear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV #GuessTheStar I've given up... I'm off to read a book or something. You have made me lose faith in humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV #GuessTheStar I worked it out in 1 second... Do I win a prize? Can I have the fees that these #zlist nonentities will have earned for this crap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itv #GuessTheStar it's like watching that uncle at Christmas... The one who always goes a bit too far with the Christmas spirit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV #GuessTheStar seriously? How is this entertaining in any way, shape or form?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @NetflixUK #USSCallister spinoff show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always have leftover #panettone #SaturdayKitchen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure this #nigelslater recipe was on the other day... #bloodyrepeats #SaturdayKitchen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#raymondblanc seems to be enjoying his harem on #SaturdayKitchen today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching this collection of #DoctorWho themes  https://t.co/LFU0EVyobV and realising that I really hate every insipid version that #murraygold has ever produced... Second half of season 7 is probably the best of the bad bunch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I may have to microwave my brain to remove it from my memory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #firstchoice rapping advert is quite, quite awful. #c4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #diehard in honour of Jake and the crew #Brooklyn99 #MerryXmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cillitbang... Don't you think #rustytoolbox sound a bit like a #pornstar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to love #alright on the night... I still do, but I mute #griffrhysjones. #dennisnorden you are still missed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please let #maxbranning die tomorrow... He's a fucking dick! #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is the woman in the onesie... She's not a very good actor... #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have Stacey and Martin got two cheese graters? #EastEnders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MuppetsChristmasCarol can't go wrong with this, thanks #c4 much appreciated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#evenbetterthantherealthing, no, no it isn't. #bbcone #ffs #wtf #fml #christmastellyusedtobegreat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so my #Christmas TV starts with #theposeidonadventure... Ah bliss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnlyConnectQuiz what wonderful TV... We need more things for people with a brain!! (And a knowledge of @ChesneyHawkes) #onlyconnect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@always_almost_ Never a truer word said!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #ClassicCorrie on #itv3... Now that's what a soap opera should look like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you noticed how Marcus and Monica go to sleep when Gregg starts talking #mastercheftheprofessionals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For god's sake #greggwallace... Stop talking rubbish!! He knows what's in it, he just spent three flipping hours cooking it!! #mastercheftheprofessionals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... #EastEnders has gone to #brookside levels of ridiculous... @bbcone @BBC @bbceastenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #countdown on #channel4... Thank God I don't retire for another 23 years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the stressy head chef on #mastercheftheprofessionals please sort his wonky glasses out... More annoying than a quenelle that's shoddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see #thechasers prostituting themselves to sell #galabingo #thechaser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#stillopenallhours is just a bit #shite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok #EastEnders I do still love #bonnielangford whatever crap you throw at her to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexroehl Hide, mostly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSBC The other 58% have seen sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbc5live And this impacts my sad non-existence how perchance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do like the @BBCOne #Christmas idents... Mostly because I hope it brings an end to the ridiculous #oneness ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Eastenders is a bit too shouty and dribbley for me tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sod #briancox... #Elizabeth has to be our next #PrimeMinister!! #TheApprentice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... The #EastEnders pantomime has started early this year...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always had a crush on #joannalumley! Purdy and Sapphire two of my favourite TV characters ever! #TheOneShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Allinson looked proper #fuckedoff at the end of #UniversityChallenge... It's only a game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat at work... No #tv... No life... No point...  November<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About bloody time too lol!  https://t.co/c6v3nRusoX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EastEnders is gripping tonight... Phil doing #ikea furniture. Woo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And let it be known that every local #bbc and #itv station week now be finding the most tenuous links to the #RoyalEngagement... #jeez!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love @MelissaBenoist as #supergirl, she is phenomenal. Please, though, can you give her some superhero stuff to do and not just crying! She's better than that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you think @CWSupergirl is getting back to being a comic book adaptation with some decent sci-fi elements... It fits back to being a slushy love story again... #really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brooklyn99 I just love #hitchcock and #scully...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #mastercheftheprofessionals on catch-up... #greggwallace is being a patronising so and so tonight... Like to see him butcher a bloody pigeon under pressure... I'd also like to not see him as well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turn the phone off... #BluePlanet2 is on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beezeee call my bluff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah Christmas... finally some worthwhile tv to stuff my face too... #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people really are just selfish #wankers... you know who you are. After everything I did for you, you still #pissedonmycornflakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well... early to bed for this #tvaddict. Bit of #SeventiesSciFi for me I think. What a way to end the #Olympics... with a whimper. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still just cack on the telly... It gets worse! Hopefully we will run out of "#celebrities" soon. #tvisshite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please stop now tv. We've all had enough of thick twats thinking they are celebrities. Grow some balls and give us quality over quantity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do wish that #MurrayGold would get off his well paid arse and arrange a complete version of the (cont)  http://t.co/0j5979LM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HarryHill you are a genius! #TVBurp just gets better and better... I have to be honest... I've seen every episode! #BiggestFan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another glorious weekend of drivel on the telly... Thanks #bbc #itv #channel4 #channel5 #sky for making me go out instead... I'll bill you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still nothing excites me television wise... Caught the end of #Whitechapel... Looked quite good, might have to #ITVPlayer that one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Survivors on #BBCFour is outstanding tv, plus the presenter is absolutely mental... Eating surviving creatures for tea like an ancient god<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bored of #Corrie now, didn't even bother watching tonight... And don't get me started on #Hollyoaks... What is tv coming too these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And... How many more #cookingprogrammes are we going to be subjected to #itv1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although #Perfection is just utter crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love #FlogIt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartdenham And your last too, hopefully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quiet night of pootling about, just watching tv in the background... Don't think I missed much tonight. Enjoyed the proposal in #Eastenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blinge... This shall be my word of the year... Respect to #FrankSkinner #Room101 #bbc1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched #Coppers tonight. Rather a good show... Nothing to do with fit men in uniform... Promise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In bed with an old movie... Ahhh bliss! No gore, no violence, no sex, just a good story and superb acting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sword now in penance for this most heinous crime... and breath... Time for my next glass I think, whilst I while away the hours til dawn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tonight, whilst watching one of these insufferable programmes. If the inventor of the internet has any moral fibre he should fall on his<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Addendum: just something you can watch, enjoy, appreciate rather than have to analyse and score... They've got apps for that too I found out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rant over... For now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that tv producers are forced into making good tv mainstream again, not something you have to hunt around for in hundreds of channels!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would say bring back the game shows but they're all terrible as well now... It makes your blood boil. Can't we just get rid of #Sky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday nights used to be good for settling down with a glass of wine and a box of chocs... Not any more, too much reality and dancing! Argh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is there just so much crap on the telly at the moment... There are a couple of gems about, but they are few and far between<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartdenham Thanks for following me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is everyone suddenly an expert on tv reality gameshows... Especially when they've never lifted their arse off the sofa!<|endoftext|>
