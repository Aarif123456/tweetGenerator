<|startoftext|>I’ve been away from Twitter for awhile, because we’re moving. Packing, cleaning, and all the other assorted bullshit that comes with taking all your crap to a different place. I’ll be back to normal in probably a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged My unsolicited answer in regards to you is: you’re 1. Definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged I can accept that. I would’ve picked 2 for me, because he looks goofier. I’m just glad you didn’t give me 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foIIowinghannah @mmpadellan Or Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, France, Germany, or Iceland. All of which enjoy better quality of life than the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged Who am I?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin Yes ma’am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Verotika” is proof that you can’t fix a problem by throwing titties at it. #horror #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlViolas @Shudder Never seen Cradle Of Fear. But the closest thing I can compare the quality to is “Slithis”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTysklind @HeyahNew @SqueeMedia @Shudder You may change your feelings about him after you see this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SqueeMedia @Shudder @HeyahNew I’m very down with a screening with the #mutantfam. I love you guys so much, that I’ll watch it twice. That’s dedication.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessicagnarly @Shudder Trust me, when you start it, stick with it. You will want to quit within 10 minutes. But stick with it. The “acting” is unlike any I’ve ever seen. It’s a glorious piece of trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Verotika” is something everyone should experience. Because if I had to experience it, then I’m taking everyone else down with me. #horror @Shudder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @realDonaldTrump becomes unable to perform his presidential duties, I don’t think we’ll be able to even tell the difference. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@masiragz The worst this that’s been in the foreground is my ex-wife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 has been an infuriating year. But taking out your frustrations on Rick Moranis isn’t gonna solve anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wolfsoul4 @woofknight Nah. Notify your HOA. It’s their problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some motherfucker punched Rick Moranis?? This makes me wanna support capital punishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve75250379 Not a chance in hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody else bummed out after D-Con gave human personalities to rats, and then MURDERED them?? Damn, D-Con. #BB22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What really concerns me is that I have trusted @Ally with my money. I don’t know if they’re intellectually capable of it. Because this is comically dumb. So there. 8/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking to @AllyCare just wouldn’t make the situation budge. @Ally won’t accept a check from their own damn institution! I guess they’re afraid they’ll bounce their own damn check. 😂😂 7/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So here I am. I’m overnighting their own fucking check right back to where it came from at @Ally. *sigh* It’s not even the money I’m frustrated about. Whatever, I’ll eventually get the money in a couple of days. It’s the unbridled dumbness of it that gets me. 6/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I called @AllyCares and expected that someone would see what was going on, and we’d have a laugh about how silly it is, and then the problem would be fixed. Nope. I talked to a supervisor, but nobody would use one ounce of critical thinking skills. 5/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me repeat clearly, because I know the story sounds unbelievable. @Ally mailed me a paper check. I received it today. Then they told me that in order to deposit it, I have to mail it back to them at the same address they just sent it from! Wtf??! 🤣🤣 4/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I get an email back saying that I have to mail the check to them physically. Where does @Ally want me to mail the check? THE SAME FUCKING PO BOX THAT THEY LITERALLY JUST MAILED THE CHECK TO ME FROM!! 😂😂 3/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long story short, @Ally won’t accept a check from their own goddamn institution! I closed an account with them, and they mailed me a paper check with the account balance at the time of closing. 2/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Ally has done something so insanely stupid that if I were to tell you, you’d think I was joking. This is so dumb that I literally can’t even say it out loud and keep a straight face. You can’t make this shit up. 1/8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cuVel_ We can do this! There will probably be withdrawal symptoms. FB was designed intentionally to be addictive. But we got this. Thanks for trying it with me. 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did it! I deactivated my FB account, and deleted the app from my phone! I dunno if this is permanent, but it’s at least for a month. I’m gonna spend October detoxing from that poison. #DeleteFacebook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@JoeBiden please sir, I’m begging you, throw decorum and civility out the door tomorrow night, and verbally pummel his ass hard. Come at that dumb orange dickhead like a fucking barracuda. He’s not gonna play nice, and neither should you. Verbally beat him into submission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @tom_six, it’s been a shitty year. But if you give us The Onania Club as an early Christmas gift, then everything may be ok after all. Any chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceAldcroft Absolute piece of cake. Sign me up for The Devil’s Rejects. Hell, I’d probably do it for $100.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceAldcroft Elvis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally watched “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest”, and I don’t see the big deal.  After years of hearing nurse Ratched jokes, and hearing how horrible the character is, the worst thing I saw her do was refuse to let someone watch the World Series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceAldcroft I’ll make this costume look good.  https://t.co/iAP6ZSSRgR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Of course it’s from Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m watching “Island Of Blood” on Amazon Prime, and it is the darkest #horror film I’ve ever seen. This is some seriously dark shit.  Hey filmmakers, next time hire a lighting guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching “Fade To Black” on @Shudder. I’ve seen it before, but it’s probably been over 10 years. You know what movie it reminds me of now? “Joker”  #horror #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preachzilla @Shudder Yep. This is really an undiscovered movie for lots of #horror fans. I saw it on HBO in 1981. I was 15. I’ve never forgotten it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is now streaming on ⁦@Shudder⁩! This movie is extremely hard to find. Don’t miss it! #horror #MutantFam   https://t.co/MQZoJ3nw2F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlViolas @NOFSpodcast  https://t.co/FyZxC6Yira<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlViolas @NOFSpodcast I have not. But I’m intrigued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz My ranking of these movies probably won’t win me any friends:  1. Devil’s Rejects  2. 3 From Hell 3. HO1K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Dammit! I’ll let you get away with that, but it’s a good thing you’re pretty. 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz If HO1K Corpses wins this thing, I’m gonna dispute it Al-Gore-2000 style. I’ll take this thing all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie_Nash “Friday The 13th”.  There was a lot of promise in that one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HorrorLibrary_ He’s a genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CribleyBrown A couple of years ago, it was streaming on Amazon. But it’s since been removed, and is hard to find. Too bad, I have similar memories of it as a teen. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That time that Danny Bonaduce liked my joke about one of his movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cordisbored Fear. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bloodflower1313 I saw it on Amazon Prime. I’ll bet it left Hulu and went to Amazon. It’s worth tracking down imo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m tired today. Didn’t sleep very well. I had a rough night of fighting Leatherface.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pander_Bear28 On your back? 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrakaroozorn Had to google it. Yep, that’s a good one. Since this is 2020, we should prepare for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s your favorite fungus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The remake of “Coal Miner’s Daughter” is gonna get really weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s your favorite Leatherface quote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll choose animals over people. Every. Time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LalalooGray @Stop_Trump20 A very diverse, poignant, nuanced selection of some of the finest literature from around the world. Books from some of the greatest thinkers of modern times.  Nah...I’m just kidding. It’ll be jack-off magazines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has begun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin Oh sure, it’s adorable when you say it. But I say it and nothing good happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have I never even heard of the 1983 movie The Being??! It was glorious! Not quite as glorious as Slithis, but damn close.  Shout out to Amazon Prime’s Al Gore rhythm for recommending it to me. Hey, @kinky_horror, here’s one to add to the Last Drive In wishlist! #MutantFam  https://t.co/I015UfZj9k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CinderBomb99 Babe Ruth. Or maybe Billie Jean King.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceD_0ut_Ace They need to stop making their headlines so damn enticing! I’m like an alcoholic - every time I swear it’ll be the last time. But then I fall off the wagon again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My greatest weakness is clickbait. I fall for it every time. I know it’s gonna be crap, but damned if I don’t click it anyway. If you need some clickbait clicked, I’m your man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerKlownEric @SpaceD_0ut_Ace I have Spectrum too. In DFW. Same shit tonight. But I restarted my modem and router and it started working fine. In all fairness to Spectrum, I rarely have problems. Most of the time my connection is rock solid and blazing fast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My favorite type of #horror film is where people see something they’re not supposed to see. Like a lost or forbidden film. Such as Sinister, Cigarette Burns, 8mm, The Hills Run Red, Antrum. Movies like that. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wm_Sadler @Maroozk @Winter Never imagined a Bill &amp; Ted movie would make me emotional, but waves of warm nostalgia washed over me. I’m not crying, you’re crying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceD_0ut_Ace Good answer! Geez, how could I forget that??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin Honest to god 100% true story: my wife and I were in a Walmart once, and this little kid (about 8-10 years old) kept saying to his mom over and over, “mommy, I want to peel your face off.” #truestory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more unpopular opinion. “The Lighthouse” was a boring, pretentious piece o’ crap. I couldn’t even finish it. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unpopular opinions: “It Follows” sucks. I remember leaving the theater thinking it should be called “Shit Follows”.  “The Babadook” was a little better, but not much. The only horror movie I’ve ever seen where the monster is defeated by getting a stern talking-to. #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slasherwomen Horror is the only genre of film that gets shit for doing its job properly.  Nobody ever complains “You know, that comedy was just TOO funny. Way too many laughs. They took it too far.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin 🙂❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin I don’t believe in the “get laid” fairy. Turns out it was just my parents sneaking into my bedroom when I was asleep, and gently lifting my pillow to put something...uh...never mind. This is getting weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anth_Carrigan Dude, you damn near stole the show in @BillandTed3 as Dennis Caleb McCoy! I was laughing my ass off! #BillAndTed3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved Dennis Caleb McCoy in @BillandTed3! Damn funny character. #BillAndTed3WatchParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you so much, Alex @Winter, Keanu Reeves, and all of the talented people that finally gave us @BillandTed3! It was funny, heartwarming, and tied everything up neatly. What a perfect end to the trilogy! Most excellent! #BillAndTed3 #BillAndTed3WatchParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I won’t spoil it any more than JBB did, but @Felissa_Rose’s death is insane in this movie. Just wait and see. #mutantfam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Victor Crowley is really fun! If you’ve never seen it, I think you’re gonna love it. #mutantfam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know I’ll get my #mutantfam card revoked for this, but I’m skipping Victor Crowley. I saw it at a special screening with @AdamGreen in attendance. Back when we were allowed outside.

<|startoftext|>Alot of people think OCD is a kinda cute, quirky disease. That’s how it’s portrayed in lots of pop culture.  Let me set the record straight, as someone who has taken meds for it for the last decade. It’s not cute and quirky. It sucks ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin I feel ya. I overthink everything - even the smallest, mundane decisions. I have a crippling case of OCD, that I have to take meds for. Even with the meds, it sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have Amazon Prime, I can’t think of a better way to spend 90 minutes than watching “The Vast Of Night”.  Very Spielberg-ish, 80s-ish film about aliens. 👽 Reminds me a lot of “Close Encounters”.  And it was filmed in my state!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarpyDiem Tax-free weekend is such a crock of shit. Stores routinely run sales like 10% - 50% off, and nobody cares. But give them 8.25% off, and they go nuts.  It’s just psychological. They feel that with no sales tax, they’re giving the finger to the gubment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@awveaj08 I got that feeling. Fortunately, there wasn’t much going on. I barely saw anyone. The streets were empty. Eerie. Hey, I at least showed the restraint and respect to not wear my Leatherface shirt!  https://t.co/YlvSNctlGE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amystarcher2 My favorite thing about BTK is the dumbass way he got caught.  “If I send you a floppy disk, there’s no way you guys can trace it, right?  Oh, no! We can’t trace a floppy. Send it over!”  What a dipshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candymarietayl1 Ha! 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stevie_Flicks For sure. It’s old, but not TOO old. And the endless speculation means that it’ll never get stale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@staybloodred @OhioBoogeyman Almost has to be Aileen Wuornos then, right? I know there are others, but I’m still guessing her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevie_Flicks Definitely true. Not making excuses for him. Well, kinda not. He could’ve chosen a different outlet for his anger. But his mom and grandma were teaching Serial Killer Making 101.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realkmdark1 Dexter is always an acceptable answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonmcbrine Love Deranged! Seen it a few times. One of my favorite pieces of 70s trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SqueeMedia Where can I watch your Lansdale doc?? He’s my absolute all-time favorite author!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Just finished reading this. Great job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH This a glorious piece of 70s sleaze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSmokeBreakK1 That’s my choice too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josejosyNY Nice choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Just hit “play”!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carryaboomstick Good one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlucypher Ed Gein. He’s also the Psycho dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_egerton Just finished reading his Wikipedia article. Yep, he was a creep alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_egerton Hmmm...guess I have one to look up. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Not a book, but the ID channel series Serial Thriller did an excellent 3-episode show about him. Look for Serial Thriller: The Headhunter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bourne0513 I don’t know much about him (yet). But I love watching Very Scary People, and I think they’re gonna profile him on the next episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a soft spot in my heart for Kemper for two reasons:  1. I’m a big, tall, goofy motherfucker myself. But I don’t kill people. But still.  2. His story is tragic on so many levels. For the victims, of course. But also for Ed. I believe he was made evil - not born evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorningNeurosis Here’s me on the road in front of the Gein farmhouse. This was 2014. It was isolated af. WAY out in the middle of nowhere. Can you imagine how isolated it must’ve been 60 years before this?  https://t.co/R18uTZA996<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My answer to my own question is Ed Kemper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Whoa! I had no idea! Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorningNeurosis Good ol’ Eddie!  https://t.co/sNqp9k3hCX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shorror_ Tasty choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Yes, and I’d love to see it. I understand it’s kinda hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlmightyRatPope .My favorite serial killer is Ed Kemper. Big, goofy, genius motherfucker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged Good to see you love the classics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesoldezzo Fair enough. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH Good one. But I don’t like the fact that we don’t know who he is. I like to put a face to the madman. Or madwoman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlmightyRatPope Excellent choice. He’s my second place pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesoldezzo He’s ok, but for me using a gun every time is just too mundane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s your favorite serial killer? And don’t pretend that you don’t have a favorite serial killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin You make trashed look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @KirkCruz @Intellivision Wasted alot of hours playing Demon Attack! But never tried Fathom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_nickol @KirkCruz @Videonastys @Intellivision The D&amp;D Treasure of Tarmin game was groundbreaking. Literally. It’s considered to be the first 3D first-person. Doom was greatly influenced by it about a decade later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirkCruz @Videonastys @Intellivision Imagic! That’s the third-party company that made it. They made some incredible games for Intellivision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirkCruz @Videonastys @Intellivision Nice! Do you remember your initial impression of it? I loved that game. Played it for hours at a time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirkCruz @Videonastys @Intellivision My favorites: Sea Battle, Night Stalker, Utopia, AD&amp;D Treasure of Tarmin. And from the third party developer whose name I can’t remember: Dracula and Microsurgeon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @Intellivision I loved Utopia back in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @Intellivision As much as I love the wood grain, I couldn’t resist the sleek black one. I’ve had mine on preorder for a few months now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsasherz .This is the closest I’ve ever come to seeing Bigfoot. Trip to Fouke, AR with my wife and cuter-than-crap puppy, Abbey. Bigfoot is lucky Abbey didn’t see him! She’d bite his face off. But she did take a crap in his yard! 😂  https://t.co/jCZKWlFYDO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Actually, I don’t. Or I just don’t have enough knowledge of the subject to even have an opinion. He might be. I dunno. I’ve always been way more interested in UFOs than Bigfoot. But I do believe Bigfoot exists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz You could be right. This will be earth-shattering news. They may trickle info to us, until they feel we are primed enough for the big “president on live TV” moment. I dunno how it’ll be done, but I’m like 95% confident it WILL be done. And soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz In my opinion, they’ve already released enough info to squash the “do they exist VS do they not exist debate.” They exist. And they’re very likely extraterrestrial in origin. 👽 🛸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz It’s not only gonna happen, I believe it IS happening. Right now. I don’t think there’ll be one big “president goes on live TV and tells everyone” event. It’ll be just what they’re doing now. Releasing info slowly, until they finally just show us videos of extraterrestrials.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged I’m all fairness, I was 16, and I was more concerned with trying to get in my date’s pants. If I were to watch it today, I’d probably like it. It’s hard to concentrate on the movie when you’re 16 and your dinky keeps talking to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged I went to see this in theaters on first run in 1982. I was bored shitless. Barely remember a thing about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herbmarselas @foREVerDeranged You beat me to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Your kid makes slime. In the 70s, I was making napalm with my chemistry set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ Yep! And a bunson burner, in case you wanted to set the acid on fire!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Seriously, I’ll bet Dahmer wasn’t the only kid to find “alternative uses” for his chemistry set.  Those things were insane in the 70s! Looking back on it, I can’t believe nobody got hurt. Mine was filled with highly corrosive liquids, and a fucking bunson burner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz So did I.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember chemistry sets for kids? I checked, and they still sell them, but today’s versions are wussed down. In the 70s, we had some hardcore chemistry sets.  I was 7 years old when I received my first bottle of sulfuric acid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ @angiebulkeley I think so. But I have no idea who it is. They look way too douchey for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ @angiebulkeley It wasn’t! 😂 I dunno which boy band it was, but it wasn’t NKOTB. I didn’t see Jordan, Joe, Jon, Danny, or Donny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ @angiebulkeley Oh...and that gif isn’t NKOTB. Other boy bands won’t do. Demand NKOTB, and accept no substitutes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ @angiebulkeley My little sis and I still go to see NKOTB together! It’s been a tradition with us. The first time we saw them, they were basically unknown. We saw them before they were big. My little sis is about to turn 44, and we saw NKOTB last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebulkeley Anything by NKOTB. When they were huge in the 80s/90s, my little sister loved them. And since I’m the best big brother ever, I took her to a couple of their concerts. After awhile, I started to like them! I’ve probably seen them in concert at least 20 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2Blue2Beetle We can only hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_KatLock_ 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angiebulkeley @_KatLock_ You’re not wrong, but I think “I’ll Melt With You” by Modern English edges it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My first marriage was a mixed marriage.  I’m a nerdy white guy from the suburbs, and she was a demon from the darkest pit in Hell.  Daughter of Satan. Princess of Lies. A direct descendant of the Dark Lord. Sister of Beelzebub.  Oh, also a first-class cunt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wrote to @therealjoebob a couple of times at the Herald, and he printed my letters. I sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to him, and he sent me back an official Vomit Meter showing my ranking on the Vomit Scale. Dammit, I wish I hadn’t lost that. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One Friday in the early 80s, I grabbed the Dallas Times Herald to see what movies were opening that weekend. I found a brand new column - Joe Bob Goes To The Drive-In.

<|startoftext|>@Cadillac_Creek Definitely!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lifewithshar It’s probably not so bad. Lemme see, and I’ll give you my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True story. When I saw Human Centipede 2 at a midnight show, the theater manager made the following announcement:  “There are trash cans in the aisles every 10 feet, if you gotta puke. Do NOT puke on newly reupholstered chairs!”  At least one person I saw didn’t listen. @tom_six<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What’s your favorite color? The correct answer is purple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elviraswig B. Purple is my favorite color.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do a Google image search on “mt Everest corpses” and then go bleach your brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mt. Everest is littered with corpses. People die trying to climb it, and it’s too dangerous to try to get them down. So they’re just left there. A couple of the corpses are so familiar to climbers that they use them as navigation points. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have two favorite pieces of trivia. They’re both pretty well known, especially amongst weirdos like us. But here they are anyway:  The last guillotining in France happened while Star Wars was in first run.  And...1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealElMaximo Not gonna lie, that is simultaneously cheesy and badass at the same time. If it’s from a later movie, I wouldn’t know. I gave up in Hellraiser after 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, there is only one correct answer to this poll. 😆 But I don’t wanna influence the voting, so I’ll wait til it’s over to let you guys know if you got the answer correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealElMaximo Oh shit...did I miss one? I like Hellraiser, but I’m not fanatical about it. I had a feeling I’d embarrass myself. 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watched “Warning: Do Not Play”. Well, I kinda watched it. I played on my phone and half-ass paid attention to the last 20 minutes.  The sad part is that by that time in the movie, something was *finally* happening. But at that point, I just didn’t give a shit. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jsfinalgirl @j__rogers I might actually be guilty of doing that too. I love to read the trivia section for a film on IMDb, and then share my knowledge with Honey Poodle - whether she wants me to or not.  Of course, when I do that it’s not annoying. It’s charmingly cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Honey Poodle is one of those people who think movies are a puzzle to be solved in advance. She can guess every twist and turn - and then tells me. And she’s usually right.

<|startoftext|>@HeroesDoExist66 I have no sources. Just blind hope. :)  But the “chatter” about UFOs is cranking up. Pentagon releasing videos. Other countries outright admitting they exist. Maybe just a fantasy, but I think we’re really close to disclosure. #IMHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, everyone who helped me in my quest to reach 1K followers today! I don’t think I’m gonna make it with only 8 minutes to go, but getting very close. Probably hit it this week for sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Couldn’t help but notice that I’m creeping up on 1000 followers.  Since my entire self-esteem is based on hearts and followers, would some of you help me get there today by RT this? My very fragile ego would thank you. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin It’s on my watchlist now. My very long watchlist. That I’ll probably never be able to complete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin What movie is this from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror I’d never heard of Pinnocchio’s Revenge before. Now it’s all I wanna see.  And it’s directed by Kevin “Night Of The Demons” Tenney! #bonus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcogs But ep 1 &amp; 7 were the only two exceptional episodes, where I liked both movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcogs I’ll be honest. That night I wasn’t feeling so hot, and I’m sure that influenced my decision. I kinda like Brain Damage, but not a fan of Deep Red. There were no total dud nights for me. At least one of the movies on each episode was good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s funny tho...if I were to rank each movie separately instead of pairs, the list would be a little different. I’m not gonna do it. At least not now. But I know which would be first and last: Bloodsucking Freaks and Troma’s War. #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, @tedcogs, I wanna play too.  ep 7: Mayhem/Tetsuo ep 1: Chopping Mall/Bloodsucking Freaks ep 2: Maniac/Heathers ep 5: Exorcist III/Deadbeat at Dawn ep 4: Tromas War/One Cut of the Dead ep 6: Dead Heat/Cannibal Holocaust ep 8: Scare Package/Hogzilla ep 3: Brain Damage/Deep Red<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Kill it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perillomike24 @wanttobeleavin It’s everything I require from a movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure @hulu &amp; @blumhouse owe me royalties for basing “Good Boy” on Abbey, The World’s Most Hardcore Dog™️. But that’s ok. It was such a good movie, I’ll let it slide! #horror #MutantFam  https://t.co/I6aEFRcVq8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin Love that movie! Still haven’t gotten around to watching this yet tho.  https://t.co/YrWEFkGIO5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyCat613 So many options, settings, and choices. I know most people would consider that a good thing, but for me it just means I’ll need to pop an extra fluvoxamine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wordpress stresses me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arneyhern1 Yep. Sadly, drive-ins have become family-friendly, pussified joints. Leatherface would not approve. Neither would boobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rushe_steve @foREVerDeranged Since The Italian Stallion wasn’t a choice, I picked Demolition Man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I 🖤 spooky chicks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged @wanttobeleavin We followed each other a couple of weeks ago, and I can personally vouch that everything you said about her is accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the original 70s/80s series, I like Halloween II better than Halloween.  There. I said it.  #horror #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged I like you. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged Physical beauty. Because the sad truth is that if you’re beautiful, it doesn’t matter if you’re just average at everything else. The world will treat you better, and you’ll be more successful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiTurner03 @kinky_horror @therealjoebob @mutant_fam Love it! Oh...and happy birthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Compersian_ I’m off to bed. Can’t keep my eyes open. It was so great seeing you pop up! You’re one of the few followers left from the old days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Compersian_ Nah. I’ve lived with it for 54 years. It’s the only thing I’ve ever known, so I don’t even realize what I’m missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Compersian_ Roaches in the projector is all part of the drive-in experience. It adds ambience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz The world needs gross old bar hags! They’re an important part of the ecosystem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Compersian_ Me either! When I close my eyes, I get blackness. Nothing else. I absolutely can’t conjure up even a simple image, like a red ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Totally understand. From looking at your profile pic, I have no doubt that you have other things to do on a Friday night. 😋  But I’m old and married, so I got nothing else to do. Look at me - glimpse into your future! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok guys, this time I’m really off to bed. Gonna follow thru with that promise. It’s just so damn fun talking to you all! Goodnight. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have aphantasia.  A month ago, I didn’t even know what that word meant. I had no idea that when people said “I can picture it in my head”, they meant it literally. I was blown away. I had always thought that was just a figure of speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged I’m kinda the same. Long term memory is amazing. Short term, not so much. I compare my LT memory to a DVR. I can “play back” convos and events that happened decades ago, and remember the most minor details.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foREVerDeranged Shape shifting. Because it would be fun! No other reason.  Not to brag, but I pretty much already have perfect memory recall. Ok, maybe I’m bragging a little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a little sad that next week is the season finale of #TheLastDriveIn. It went by so fast.  Don’t u think it would make more sense to start them around Memorial Day, and have it run thru the summer? I mean, summer is drive-in season. Maybe it’s an availability thing for talent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror Had fun as always! Thanks Darcy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlohaPete A musical tribute! I’d expect nothing less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @therealjoebob @kinky_horror @RadioParfait @AaronBKoontz I agree. Never got bored a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Halloween 3 is trending. This has truly been the bestest of nights! #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m old, so I’m going to bed. Goodnight! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was fun! We should totally do this next Friday too! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could Darcy be any more adorable? I think not. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeEyes1 I’ll say this. I liked it better than Scare Package.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worsethanjail Exactly. Tonight’s first movie could learn a lesson from the pig flick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That wasn’t so bad! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New followers: because I’m a gracious ruler, I’m extending the deadline for you to mail me your toenail clippings for my shrine. You have until Tuesday. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There. Finally. Now can someone please make fun of this bitch’s corpse? #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry about me @therealjoebob. I’m having a blast!  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H1pHopAnonymous Forgive me, for I have sinned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please tell me those were cyanide pills she gave Joanna. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make fun of this all you want, but this is basically what The Blair Witch is. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PIG!!! 🐷 #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let us not forget that the shaky cam POV kills were used in a little film called Evil Dead. @kinky_horror  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m feeling way more threatened by Abbey right now than I am a pig. #TheLastDriveIn  https://t.co/oYPw9xAcwp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GothicToaster That’s pretty fucking funny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatMuffinKing Same! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The filmmakers are genius for not showing the pig! They’re obviously using the same technique that Spielberg used in his masterpiece Jaws. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KBS_Sully @therealjoebob 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JediHouse1348 @therealjoebob Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cast @therealjoebob as Crazy Ralph in the Friday The 13th remake! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Jodie the pig in this? Because that would kick ass. 🐷 #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are those disembodied voices in the car? #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perillomike24 @kinky_horror Very!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well damn! Now we got ourselves a movie! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m pumped!! And @kinky_horror did a helluva job with the drive in totals! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m very intrigued. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why @kinky_horror is my hero! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcogs Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcogs I know. I’m way to nice a guy. It’s been a curse my whole life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I’m gonna stick around for the pig movie.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If any of the filmmakers are seeing my tweets, just ignore me. I’m not trying to be a dick, but it just wasn’t for me. Still a helluva lot better than I coulda done. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ultimately, I think it was the runtime that killed it. Could’ve been maybe 20-30 minutes shorter. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone notice that Emily Hagins is the girl that made the zombie film Contagion when she was 12? They did a documentary about it. That was about 10 years ago. She must be in her 20s now. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. It was ok. I’ve definitely seen worse. But yeah...that’s about all I got for it. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Bob to the rescue! Maybe. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look, I don’t wanna be a dick. I know that independent filmmakers poured their heart and soul into this. I get that. But this one missed the mark. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcogs Fraid not. Almost tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“None of this is helping anybody.” My review. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cabin In The Woods Part 2? #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JBB nailed those definitions. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far, nothing has topped the goo story. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amber_cadabra I’m not. But is past the halfway mark “so quickly”? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This started out really strong. But I dunno. I think it’s starting to crap out. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mfanny Yay! Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is tonight the season finale? Is it over already? 😢 #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@breannimator Hard to say which of you is hotter. 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz @kinky_horror Actually, it was a small one. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! “Hatefucking the hand they smeared with mother’s lipstick”  Well done, sir. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had an amazingly hot chick who would talk to us, joke with us, and occasionally show us her boobs. @kinky_horror  For alot of us nerds, that was a dream situation.  And then along came an immature turd head, and possibly ruined it.  Fuck. This is why we can’t have nice things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn’t directed at everyone. In fact, it’s not directed at most of you. Probably just one of you. Here goes...  I can’t fucking believe that some dickhole pissed off @kinky_horror so much that we don’t know if she’s gonna be back.  Way to go, shithead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhorrently_urs 🔥❤️🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror I also noticed that this shit nugget doesn’t use his own pic for an avi. Granted, neither do I, but I also don’t get my rocks off by insulting people.  I wonder what kind of beauty queen this mommy’s-basement-dweller is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And...George Clooney’s dead. #horror<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedcogs Same. There’s so much more to drive-in cinema than horror. I’m in DFW, and I’ve been with @therealjoebob literally since Day 1. In the early days, he did review many types of drive-in movies. But I do get that @Shudder is a horror channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One genre of film that I love as much as horror - 70s hicksploitation! Watching this shameless Smokey &amp; The Bandit rip-off now. #nowplaying  https://t.co/73o0XLteV7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday to @kinky_horror! 🎂 The nicest, friendliest, most adorablest piece of mini skirt-wearing, horror-loving, remake-liking, boobie-flashing horror hottie hostess ever! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz You should also take a look at Brooke Shields in Brenda Starr, Reporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz An 80s pop singer. Cheesy top 40 teenage pop, but catchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz Molly Ringwald. Lucy Ricardo. Tiffany. Jessica Rabbit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d watch that.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darcy’s shirt button needs a raise. It’s working very hard. @kinky_horror #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite episode of Last Drive In so far this season!  @therealjoebob @kinky_horror @Shudder #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The third Kill Bill movie is kinda weird. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eraserhead meets Evil Dead.  Hey, that rhymes. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time the movie flashes static, I expect JBB to come on. #PavlovsDog #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I. Love. It.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a film can make an Asian hottie wearing glasses and a pencil skirt seem like something I’d wanna run away from - rather than towards- then the film is effective as a horror film. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling the director has seen Eraserhead a time or two. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen Tetsuo either. Shit, JBB is making me question if I really am a horror fan. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually liked The Belko Experiment. I’m a sucker for The Purge and Purge-like movies, where people can murder without consequences. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been entertained. Thoroughly. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, Darcy! I wasn’t prepared for that mini skirt! #TheLastDriveIn @kinky_horror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TarH2O23 Scott Pilgrim meets The Purge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many JBB movies have tried to distract me from Twitter. Only one has succeeded. Much respect, Mayhem. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Samara Weaving in this. She’s hot, badass, and funny. #dreamgirl  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be my favorite movie so far this season. Closely followed by Bloodsucking Freaks in 2nd place. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really good! That’s why I’m not tweeting. It’s got my undivided attention. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should the other Serbian Film! @kinky_horror #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The virus is a hoax! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds fucking great! Here we go! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen Mayhem. I’ll give it a shot. Why not. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDK17011 @CraigLGOOH @kinky_horror Yep. I’m hearing from others that Re-Animator was on the first JBB @shudder special. The one that broke the internet.  I’m suddenly not so confident in my answer.  But then again, the original marathon was 3 years ago, right? Maybe not too close together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigLGOOH @kinky_horror Thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin  https://t.co/k6sPAyiWVj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miss_t_re Ha! That got me! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin Leatherface in last place? I’m very disappointed in the voting public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After months of shooting at them very poorly, when I was 10 I finally shot a bird with my BB gun. The vision of that little bird laying on my lawn dying is something I never forgot. After that, my BB gun wasn’t as much fun as it once was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look, I don’t wanna be melodramatic. But watching that poor little muskrat being butchered was something I could’ve lived without seeing. I’ve been thinking about it alot today. What kind of a Henry Lee Lucas does someone hafta be to watch that for entertainment? #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsfinalgirl Your hubby sounds like a decent man. Fuck masculinity. Masculinity has nothing to do with this. It’s about having a heart and a soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarpyDiem Thank you, Miss Cutie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredthewolf Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dropyourlinen That helps a little. But for me, the screaming is the worst part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had forgotten how horrible that muskrat scene is. That literally broke my heart. I almost cried. My clinical depression doesn’t need this. I’m out. Good night everyone! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsasherz I’ve actually seen it twice before. I don’t think a third time is gonna happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Honestly, I’m about done. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SetDarcyFree Ears too. The screaming makes it especially horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot about the muskrat. Fuck. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Told you it had some beautiful music. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomicidalKaci @therealjoebob @kinky_horror You rock! Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JBB is really selling this film! I may stick around for the first segment, even though I’ve seen it before. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, please Motel Hell!! That would be my best night ever!  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of new followers tonight! If you’re new to following me, be sure to mail me a lock of your hair for my shrine.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am gonna watch @therealjoebob’s commentary for CH tomorrow. I do wanna hear that part. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m tapping out for Cannibal Holocaust. Not because it offends me (which it does). But because I’m old, sleepy, and seen it a couple of times already.  You guys have fun and cover your eyes for the sick parts! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait to see Scream, Queen!  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannibal Holocaust actually has a great musical score. Seriously. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liked it. But only because I watched it in this setting with my #MutantFam.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The seat of a girl’s bike. Yep, that line happened.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SetDarcyFree This has gotta stop. Seriously. Twitter needs to get their shit together. How hard would it be to flag your account as an entertainer, and let their algorithm know to expect lots of tweets and interaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t realize that Vincent Price set policies and ideals for the GOP. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do seriously miss these type of movies with the 80s vibe. The style and edits are very 80s. I also miss the days when a piece of shit like this could get a wide theatrical release. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty fucking cool!  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C’mon...he didn’t say “he’s swimming with the fishes”.  Is that line too low-brow for this flick? #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would actually make a pretty good episode of “Supernatural” #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK this scene is pretty cool. I like it. I like it so much, I’ll even those horrible one-liners that Piscopo is spewing. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpaceD_0ut_Ace You’re right. And my wife has forced me to watch several movies that I never would’ve watched otherwise. And then she makes me admit that the movie was good, and I was wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, the Disneyland joke got me! 😂 #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Repulsive...sophomoric...dumb”  I’m gonna watch, JB! You don’t have to sweet talk me anymore! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I’ll give Dead Heat a shot.  Thank god it wasn’t Big Trouble In Little China. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carryaboomstick @therealjoebob Nothing comes between me and my Cheetos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I’m sittin in front of the TV in my drawers, drinking chocolate milk and eating Cheetos, that can only mean one thing...it’s @therealjoebob time, baby!! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StreamingScoop I dunno. I’ve been hearing rumors of Big Trouble In Little China. I hope that’s not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like yesterday when I was choking back puke watching Bloodsucking Freaks. And tonight I’ll be choking back puke watching Cannibal Holocaust. Where does the time go?? #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a little bummed because Joe Bob is almost over again. Damn, these seasons fly by fast!  #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam @therealjoebob @kinky_horror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagellanTVDocs Stop it. 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tried to find the video again, but no luck. It’s been at least 10 years, but I never forgot it.  Many of the comments on the video challenged their hypothesis of “turtles are exactly like worms”. #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Years ago, I saw a Cannibal Holocaust reaction video by a couple of stereotypical giggly, “airhead” teenage girls.  After watching the movie, and carefully considering it, they reached the conclusion that “turtles are exactly like worms”. Score one for science. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wanttobeleavin It’s definitely a drive-in movie. But unsimulated animal cruelty is also sick af. But I’ve already seen the movie, and those images are already burned into my brain anyway. So I guess one more time won’t hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crpWritescom Death Proof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrophyWifeDayna Me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We once had a piñata at an office party. A team-building thing. I went so gangsta on its ass, that I’m surprised HR didn’t require me to get a psych exam before I returned to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abbey, The World’s Most Hardcore Dog™️, is pretty chill most of the time. But when it comes to unsimulated animal cruelty in films, she will straight up bite a motherfucker’s face off!  #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn @therealjoebob @kinky_horror @shudder  https://t.co/mDVUfo9Tq5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StreamingScoop I mean, “squish videos” are illegal, because unsimulated animal cruelty is sick af. Maybe that rule should apply to animal cruelty in all films, not just squish films. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StreamingScoop I can handle it too. But should I even have the opportunity to handle it? Probably not, IMO. Censorship sucks, but society has deemed some material to be so offensive, it’s illegal. Child porn &amp; snuff films come to mind. Probably should add animal cruelty to the list. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That being said, Cannibal Holocaust is one of the only films I would approve of censoring. The animal cruelty scenes offer nothing to the story. They could be removed without hurting the plot.  I dunno. Censorship is a tough issue. But animal cruelty ain’t cool. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve seen Cannibal Holocaust before. Yes, it’s very disturbing. Real animal cruelty. I’m an animal lover, so I can do without that shit. But here’s the thing...animal cruelty only takes up a few minutes of the running time. Probably less than 10 minutes. #MutantFam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@perillomike24 Really?? Wow. Didn’t know that. But that definitely explains the crappy “ending.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perillomike24 Yep, I guess it was on Epix last year, but I never knew about it. I wish I still didn’t know about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CleosLogic Lol....  Dear Sirs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished the new “War Of The Worlds” on Amazon Prime.  What a crock of shit.  That was barely a Minor Squabble Of The Worlds. Not even a Fistfight Of The Worlds, much less a war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh. Just learned that Roger Ebert gave Motel Hell 3 out of 4 stars. He loved it! #MutantFam #horror   https://t.co/PDyLc5al2N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHorrorGuru @kinky_horror That picture makes me have conflicting feelings about Farmer Vincent. Very confusing feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoodProfessor Piss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Motel Hell” is great drive-in movie, and a helluva dark comedy. I was just a little too young when it came out, but I can imagine seeing it on a hot Texas night under the stars, like god intended. Maybe @therealjoebob could show it one night? @kinky_horror? #MutantFam #horror<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimmikillzombie That was the funniest episode ever!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Joe Bob, the motivational speaker! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @kinky_horror, @therealjoebob, and @Shudder! Damn fun night! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t think I’ve ever done a 180 like that during a movie. The last half started to win me over, and when the movie was finished, I was smiling and realized I just had a helluva time. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad I stuck with it. I love it.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really starting to win me over! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, I’ll admit, this is getting pretty clever. I dunno...maybe.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dunno. I’m too deep in now to quit. I’m gonna see it through. But yeah...I dunno. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, never seen this one, and I’m very intrigued. I won’t be tweeting during this one at all. You guys have a great night! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna treat myself to a bag of Funyuns and a glass of chocolate milk. I’ve earned it. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @therealjoebob @SetDarcyFree @kinky_horror I’ve never seen it. I didn’t think I was interested, but now I’m looking forward to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Videonastys @therealjoebob @SetDarcyFree @kinky_horror That’s what I was hoping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealElMaximo @kinky_horror Ha! Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love @kinky_horror’s puns! #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to like it. But it was too damn long.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s actually some pretty good stunt work in this. Some of those falls from rooftops are impressive. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a spunky little band of misfits. I hope after this they save the youth center from that evil real estate mogul.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is what’s gonna happen if one person goes to 7-11 without wearing a mask. #TheLastDriveIn #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen this flick. So I’ll be tweeting less during this. #TheLastDriveIn #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror We definitely did! If you were there, I must’ve missed you. I don’t think you were at that show, because...uh...well, you would’ve caught my attention. 😂❤️ Hopefully, we’ll see you in DFW again soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror My wife and I saw Joe Bob’s redneck show in DFW. I don’t remember every single joke, but I’m pretty sure there was nothing offensive. Certainly no rape jokes, or jokes at the expense of the LGBTQ community. Just asked my wife, and she agrees. She heard nothing offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This damn #COVID is now infringing upon my right to Purge! @UniversalHorror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Felissa_Rose Back atcha! ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breannimator And get this...6 hours later, she remembered our names! There was nothing remarkable about us. We’re just fans like the hundreds of others she saw that day. But she stopped us and said “Goodbye, Gary and Courtney!” We were blown away. Wow! @Felissa_Rose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breannimator I met @Felissa_Rose. Hands down the nicest celebrity I’ve ever met. I mean, most of the celebrities I met were nice, but she took it to a new level. We were leaving the con about 5 hours after we met her. We passed by her table, and she stopped us to say goodbye! Cont....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror Congrats to cute couple! ❤️💜❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the dickturd attacking her? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp guys, I’m tapping out for Deep Red. Gotta wake up early, and never been a big giallo fan. You guys have fun! I love doing this on Friday nights. Oh...and welcome new followers! #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As bad as that joke was, it’s still better than watching Heathers. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this joke the second feature? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn! My heart can’t take it. @kinky_horror #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was so good!! How have I never watched that before??  #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is @kinky_horror’s cosplay gonna be?? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh, I’m counting 3 breasts. Right @kinky_horror ? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChainsawXCherry I’ve got a sixth sense about detecting boobies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t miss the boobies!! #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to take a bathroom break. Did I miss the two breasts? Just give it to me straight. I can take it. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Curly Howard were still  alive, he’d be cast in the role of Bathroom Guy who gets brain eaten. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all have that annoying uncle that’s always performing that magic trick. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck, can somebody please shove a dickturd down this annoying man’s throat? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, I love @Felissa_Rose. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the most glorious fucking thing I’ve seen in a long time!!#TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when “Finding Nemo” came out, and every kid wanted a clown fish? Just sayin.  #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story of a boy and his dickturd. #TheLastDriveIn #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d take that deal in a heartbeat. #TheLastDriveIn #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dick/turd did not disappoint. #thelastdrivein #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am kinda curious to see what a cross between a dick and a turd looks like. And maybe even tastes like. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen Brain Damage, so I won’t be tweeting very much during this. #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think I owe it to my followers, and the public at large, to inform everyone that I’ve pretty much spent the entire quarantine binging on true crime murder shows.  But I’m pretty sure it hasn’t affected my psyche. Kinda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dustinhenson94 I can accept that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you bailed on “Bloodsucking Freaks” last week, but stuck around for “Heathers” last night, then just understand that I’m shaking my head disapprovingly at you. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love “Heathers”. And I love Joe Bob. But I just don’t like both of them together. “Heathers” is way too glossy to belong on a drive-in screen. But I also know that it’s impossible for JBB to please everyone. Looking forward to next week! #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonsWsim2323 @SetDarcyFree @therealjoebob @Shudder Yep! I love Sharon Mitchell. My favorite porn star of all time! Have you seen “Porndemic”? It’s really good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DfwSter @kinky_horror @therealjoebob @Shudder Ha!! Nice one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many blondes does it to be strapped down in a chair and tortured by a vice? Just one!! Ha! Get it??  #TheLastDriveIn @kinky_horror #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FVasquezJr Apparently, @therealjoebob got some emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you get offended by blonde jokes, you’d best just tap out right now, before “Bloodsucking Freaks” starts. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won’t be tweeting much during “Bloodsucking Freaks”, because I wanna pay the movie my full attention, and give it the respect it deserves. #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t even describe how much ass “Bloodsucking Freaks” kicks! #MutantFam #TheLastDriveIn @kinky_horror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People seriously need to get a fucking grip. Getting offended at blonde jokes?? The fuck is that about?? #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nowadays, head- exploding scenes are done with CGI. The days of actually exploding actresses heads are long over. #TheLastDriveIn #technology @kinky_horror #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BornToBeMildOne @kinky_horror @therealjoebob @Shudder You mean Cameltoe Music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the freeze frame “Police Squad” credits.  #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suggestion for @therealjoebob and @kinky_horror: Run “Slithis” one night. It’s glorious. #TheLastDriveIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, you guys!! If you’ve never seen “Bloodsucking Freaks”, then strap in! Oh, and get your drinking straws ready! #TheLastDriveIn #MutantFam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very hard to make me actually LOL, but @therealjoebob just made me snort with the “alligator and the toddler” bit! #mutantfam #TheLastDriveIn @kinky_horror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number 5 is alive...but you’re dead. #TheLastDriveIn @kinky_horror #mutantfam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatdudescott Ha! Fucking brilliant!<|endoftext|>
