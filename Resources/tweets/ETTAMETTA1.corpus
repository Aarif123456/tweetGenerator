<|startoftext|>@RepVernonJones @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson None of them will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris I'm going to be honest with you: #LameStreamMedia says you all are "leading" in the polls. Keep laughing baby as you are doing these days when you are asked serious questions. #AmericansAreNotStupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stayoutofmytown @KyleMartinsen_ I thought of that.....goodness me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawnG927 @nascarred14 Those people singing while people are "praying" are despicable. A thing like that should not be tolerated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dbongino @KamalaHarris What is this with  #KamalaHarris. Laughing when asked a serious question?  Very unnatural in my opinion...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump, of course he can call you George and get away with. Remember, #joebiden believes "scientists".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFTVMedia They miss playing with speed. Too slow and predictable. #Arsenal looks too tired.<|endoftext|>
