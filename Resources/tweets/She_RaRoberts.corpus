<|startoftext|>@HaydenHewitt @HydraheadHunter Exactly. It's not transphobic or anti-trans to be pro-women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HydraheadHunter But the patriarchy is appropriating misogyny. I really don't know how you can't see that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HydraheadHunter @HaydenHewitt @KatyMontgomerie @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets It actually demonstrates your misunderstanding of misogyny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HydraheadHunter @HaydenHewitt @KatyMontgomerie @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets So transwomen are more marginalised than women? Yet women are being murdered at the hands of men at a faster rate than transwomen?  I'm really not, I'm sorry that you think that, but you're resoundingly wrong.

<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Are you still talking??  You provided one ref and told that you've given loads. I've gone off my own actual, real life conversations with people with DSD, and listened to what they said. If you don't like, that's fine. Idc.

<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets "literally citing a bunch of intersex orgs", you've provided one link to a group in Australia.

<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Do you speak for all intersex/DSD people?  Because some that I have spoken with don't like the term intersex, hence why I use people with DSD.  However, if someone with DSD tells me they prefer intersex, then I'll change my vocab accordingly. When I'm in Aus, I'll do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Sorry, are you still arguing about semantics? Or whether trans and intersex/DSD people want to be lumped in together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets I am listening to intersex/DSD people, and they don't want to be lumped into the same category as Trans people, hence my original statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Well here's a study for you  https://t.co/179NGHfFUM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HydraheadHunter @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Cis is a ludicrous term, as sex is observed at birth, not assigned. Cis also excludes intersex. You've appropriated misogyny to anyone who identifies as a woman. That includes a man who has not undergone any form of hormonal/ surgical intervention. Do you see how it's offensive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HydraheadHunter @HaydenHewitt @KatyMontgomerie @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets By your standard, Elliot Page has been raised with male privilege, despite coming out as Trans a week ago. The second a man identifies as a woman then it's misogyny. It's bullshit and offensive. "Hush" is misogynistic! Happy to provide real life examples of misogyny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eggynack @GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets I was using the preferred medical term to make my point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GenGillette @JaimeLThorne @KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @eggynack @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets People with DSD are not Trans, and it's wholly unjust to lump them into the same category.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyMontgomerie @Kaliathane @HaydenHewitt @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Misogyny is sexism, not genderism. Find a new word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyMontgomerie @HaydenHewitt @eggynack @JaimeLThorne @Phildidgee @helenstaniland @AidanCTweets Sorry, that's not misogyny. You can't identify as a woman and then proclaim misogyny against you. If you're born male, you have been raised with male privilege. Girls don't get to identify into male privilege. It's not to say TW aren't subject to hate crime, but it's not misogyny<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrJessTaylor I completely agree that you don't have to forgive your abuser/s. Women should learn to forgive themselves for what they went through.

<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender @BuckAngel What am I misunderstanding about trans-people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender So you have a strong preference to one sex over the other, not a gender. Got it. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Why would you define yourself as straight if you don't have a sex preference?  Defining yourself as hetero is saying you have a sex preference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Wow! You're getting really angry now.  Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender @BuckAngel How am I being transphobic? What have I said that is transphobic or anti-trans in anyway?   Why isn't buck angel great?? He's an outstanding ambassador for the trans-community.  Unless you don't like him because he doesn't fit into your narrative of what a trans-person is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender But the person they're intending on sleeping with has every right to consent to sleeping with them.   Again, this was where my question about where gender ends and sex begins. Sex cannot be ignored or erradicated as you said trans-people want to do. And why should sex be erased?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender "Act" like what?   Do you mean have an opinion and want to protect my sex based rights? They absolutely do. I will absolutely defend my trans-friends, as much as I've defended my gay friends over the years  Plenty of trans-people have the same opinion as me, check out @BuckAngel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender But many trans-people don't want or need to have surgery. Many don't even want hormone therapy.   In Scotland, a man can easily self-identify as a woman without the need for a clinical diagnosis.    https://t.co/AKSltiDq83<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender So what's the difference?   If a person says "I don't want to sleep with you because I have a preference for different genitals to yours, even though I prefer your gender" is that better than saying "I won't sleep with a trans-person"?   Isn't it saying the exact same thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender It is personal, but it works both ways.  "Some feel uncomfortable with different genetalia"  You've just said you would call a lesbian a transphobe if she doesn't want to sleep with a TW.   Can you see the flaws here?  Who is misgendering? Who is harrassing trans-people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Define explicitly. Define "being seen". That insinuates that misogyny can be felt by anyone who wants to interpret it that way.   I do actually, plenty.  One of my good friends that I've know for 18 years is trans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender If you're not a gay man, but you would sleep with men and women, it just makes you bi.   Are you able to distinguish between sex and gender at all through these conversations?  Like how a lesbian shouldn't be targeted for abuse because she wouldn't sleep with a TW?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender I know what you're saying, but misogyny doesn't start the day you decide to identify as a woman.   Trans-rights are human rights, but they're not women's rights. And its not anti-trans to be pro-women and want to protect women as a sex class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender We're absolutely not in agreement!  Transwomen cannot experience misogyny, because misogyny is a wearing down of a woman since girlhood.  Just you assuming that anyone can experience misogyny, is inherently misogynistic! Misogyny is based in sexism, same as misandry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender This is the point of the question.  When faced with the scenario, what would you actually do?   Where does gender as a social construct end, and the sex of the person begins when it comes to forming intimate relationships?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender If a lesbian rejects a transwoman, regardless of whether they've transitioned or not, she will be vilified as transphobic and a terf for not wanting to sleep with them. So consent effectively gets thrown out the window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Cis is a ludicrous term. Sex is observed at birth, not assigned. Cis also excludes people with DSD, who may not even know they have issues until the reach puberty.   Because misogyny is sexism.   https://t.co/oklPJNlkOI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender What about any gay man? Should he be punished for not being attracted to a TM? What about a hetero man, should he be punished for not wanting to sleep with a TW?    https://t.co/umqRuO1m3E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender But the language you used, regardless not whether it was intentional or not, is still misogynistic.  I'm glad that you corrected it, but can you see how easily misogyny is embedded in language?    https://t.co/wKhQFCXAss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender "The harrassment was caused by her being a woman"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender The harrassment was caused by the man being a complete bellend.   Don't blame Laverne Cox for being attacked - that's victim blaming 101.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender You can be any gender you want - you can pick your gender like you pick your Starbucks latte, but my sex isn't disposable.  Women are not equal in this world, and getting rid of sex is not going to make anything better or easierz by any stretch of the imagination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender But I dont want my sex to be irrelevant.   Why should I have my sex taken away from me, along with my sex based rights, and experiences?   Do you not see how that is based in male privilege and misogyny?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Right ok, so again, that's not misogyny.   It's a perfectly valid hate crime, just like Laverne Cox got attacked earlier this week. She wasn't a victim of misogyny, she was a victim of a hate crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender I had a friend in school who was entered into an arranged marriage. Since was 18 when they married, he was violently abusive towards her. If she didn't marry him, her family would have potentially killed her for shaming the family. She was terrified. Again, it's sex, not gender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender If you look at the differences between me and my boyfriend, you certainly wouldn't look at him and think he has good birthing hips, but you might think that about me. That's a secondary sex characteristic. Like how I have boobs and he has a beard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Sorry, that doesn't make sense to me. "Because they dared to be sexually harassed"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender That's secondary sex characteristics, not gender.   Which male or female characteristics can be seen in both genders, other than limbs, where your head is, location of your face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Ok, so many TRAs are GC in the sheets.  What if it was the same situation but you're gay, and it was a transman (no gender reassignment, hormones etc). Would you sleep with them then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Hahah! That's really true!!  Most TRAs are misogynistic to their core!  You need only look at the death threats, "suck on my girldick terf" assaults that women receive to know that its completely misogynistic.  Why do you think there isn't a male alternative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Right, so the guy is the misogynist. By that count any man who was mistaken for a woman (ie has long hair) would then be a victim of misogyny. Is that what you're saying?  Do you think his attitude would change if he realised the woman he attacked was actually trans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Just to understand where you stand. If you were a hetero male and you met a woman at a bar, you went back to her place, but you realised it was a transwoman who hadn't gone under any type of transition. It was just a man who identified as a woman. Would you still sleep with them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender So that's sexual harrassment, not misogyny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Can you explain how society mostly works on gender please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender FGM &amp; forced marriage are cultural but they are biological realties for millions of women globally. You can't identify in or out of it. In M√©xico, 10 women are killed every day just for being women. They cannot identify out of it. We are defined by our reproductive organs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender It's good to challenge things like toxic masculinity, but what makes you a man, won't necessarily represent the next persons lived experiences of being a man. But why should it? Women's lived experiences cannot be commandeered because someone thinks they feel the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender But the point is that TRAs are forcing people in boxes. Feminism is about tearing down the stereotypes, while TRAs are trying to reinforce it.  Why should anyone be goaded into changing their physical sex, for a social construct like gender?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Misogyny is a gradual tearing down of a woman and her place in the world, from a very young age. Many women won't automatically recognise misogyny because it's so ingrained in society, but they will recognise a specific incident in their lives. TW don't experience that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender Transwomen don't experience misogyny. They may experience derogatory comments, attacks, be victims of hate crimes, but that's not misogyny.  TW have been raised with male privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender My womanhood is based on my experiences. What is the feeling of being a man in your head, compared to what it's actually like in reality? Think about your own situation, and explain to me what the differences would be. External Vs internal influences Can you switch between sexes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWallerborg @helvelyn1960 @DezereDawn @SAStanleyNOFO @minoukith @Mermaids_Gender It's the basic difference between a lived reality, and imagining what it's like. I'm not imagining what it's like to be a woman. I was born female, received different treatment based on my sex compared to my brothers, experienced misogyny from a young age &amp; will till I die.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DuncanHenry78 @glosswitch Feminism opened the door and made it more acceptable for LGB people and rights over the years.

<|startoftext|>@tinternetqueen @andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB Exactly  Why not just call yourself bi and be done with it?  You'd never expect a gay man to sleep with a woman who identifies as a man. It simply doesn't work that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB Oh sorry, in your book rad fems and GCs can't be lesbians because they don't want to sleep with TW, so their opinions and voices are silenced. I understand you now. You only help those that reflect your definitions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB Strange how you can be skeptical of people on twitter because you don't know if they're genuine LGB or not, but a woman can't be skeptical of a man self-identifying as a woman because then she's suddenly "transphobic". GCs &amp; Rad fems can be lesbians too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è saviour syndrome much?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB But you've just said you hear it from lesbians on twitter, but have completely dismissed them.  There are a lot of women who don't feel safe confiding in men. I'm not sure why you think you're an exception.  Do you come on twitter threads like this purely to cause arguments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB Apart from on here? You mean twitter?  I'm sure it's not a topic of conversation that comes up every day, and certainly not on that women would want to share around for fear of being attacked by people like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andrew_bogg @ALLIANCELGB I actually told her that I don't give a shit about her personal preferences. Why would I?  But that she shouldn't be speaking on behalf of lesbians who get attacked when they refuse to accept TW as actual women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALLIANCELGB I had someone on a FB group trying to tell me that she's a lesbian who is attracted to other women and see transwomen, and that should be enough to completely change my pov!  I told her that you're not a lesbian if you're attracted to literally anything in a skirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJessTaylor I'm fed up of women having to change our looks, our clothes, our attitudes to accommodate men's behaviour. I'm fed up of women having to be the ones to bend to men who want to enter women's only spaces by claiming their women, and women again being attacked when they say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALLIANCELGB He attacked Lewis Hamilton the other day too.   He seems to think that everyone forgot that he clubbed a fox to death in a Kimono on Boxing Day because he's a massive c*nt and didn't properly protect his chicken coop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ToniHargis @DrJessTaylor I totally get that. However the farming industry is perverse in that way.

<|startoftext|>@davidschneider He can't say any.of it with a straight face. Then he goes on to say that they'll be removing votes if they were done improperly.

<|startoftext|>@AlessandraAster We don't know where women's rights are on their agenda, so it's not right to say they're last.   This is a huge moment - Harris has broken the glass ceiling for women by becoming the first female VP in the white house. That's an incredible moment for women's rights. Celebrate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlessandraAster Biden winning is far better news than Trump remaining in office. That's the bottom line.  You're never going to get a politician or political party that you are in 100% agreement with. But the most that you want vote for is the one that you have the most in common.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@randomizeintro1 @johnlockesclock @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam The voting system is not democratic because all votes are not equal.  FPTP is the "preferred" voting system, because generally people don't know the major underlying issues with it. The campaign for AV was deeply flawed, and utterly ridiculed by RW papers  @MakeVotesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlockesclock @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam PR leads to parties putting away their tribalism and working together. That's the essence of a democracy - to have all stances represented, and to work together. FPTP doesn't allow that. This is why the UK is in the shithole it's in. NZ has PR, look how well it's worked for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirchallReckons @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam It was a simple question, that they failed to answer.  FPTP isn't easy to understand and doesn't work for democracy in this day and age. If it was, the question I asked would have been answered.  People don't vote under FPTP because they know their votes don't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam It's fine to say you don't understand. If you did, you'd be more outraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlockesclock @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam It's not proportional. So each vote doesn't have an equal standing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam When the Leave campaign have been fined for fraud, that's how the EU Referendum wasn't democratic.   However, the ref and elections are two different things. If you don't understand how FPTP works, then that's fine, just don't say it's democratic when you don't know how it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlockesclock @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam Explain how FPTP is democratic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlockesclock @Non_Chicken @owenbarder @Sathnam Just because anyone can stand if they pay ¬£500+ each, doesn't mean it's democratic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThePoke 'Sorry' in this context isn't an apology.  It's a ruse to pretend they're nice guys that got "carried away" and not the dirty slimebag incels they really are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WirralWalsh @WirralCouncil @PavementsFW Probably because it's a private homeowners hedge rather than council owned.

<|startoftext|>@lascapigliata8 @DrJessTaylor Baron Cohen is Ashkenazi Jewish; he had links with Israel; he's fluent in Hebrew.  To call him racist because of his comedic performance of Borat I feel is unfair, but I don't expect others to 100% agree with me.  To compare to blackface is disingenuous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ben_garrod @XRebellionUK Utterly phenomenally selfish and stupid behaviour.  All he asked them was to be nice and not do something illegal.

<|startoftext|>@lascapigliata8 @DrJessTaylor I totally understand the arguments against him, the characters, and that was my initial reaction when I saw the first Borat. However, from seeing more interviews with Baron Cohen, I understand the point he's trying to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lascapigliata8 @DrJessTaylor He addresses and confronts peoples biases with his characters. It's not meant to punch down, it's meant to put a mirror up to bigots, homophobes, misogynists, and racists. He's done this with all his characters including Ali G, Bruno as well as Borat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckAngel I had that yesterday when I was arguing with a trans-person.  Genuinely confused by their reaction.  I think you're an astounding ambassador for the trans-community, and honestly cannot understand the hostility you receive.  https://t.co/O2cJFprwy3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpinVector @IanDunt No idea what this one is about, but a couple of weeks ago someone called him a eugenicist because he's discussed population control.  It's absolutely staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qikipedia That's because the French and Germans live in France and Germany, and commute into Lux city.   The commute if you were Portuguese would be a nightmare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Back tracking? Interesting. And you weren't using a layman's term by your reference.   You were comparing a hair colour to an organ.  As though your heart, lungs or brain has a phenotypic trait. Absolutely ridiculous.   I'm going to mute you now, because it's late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Because reproductive organs aren't a trait.  A trait is how a genotype is displayed, and it's displayed in a phenotype. So red hair = phenotypic express of the gene for that hair colour, blue eyes = phenotypic expression of the gene for blue eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Just to save you the trouble I have a research masters in conservation biology. I've studied genetics of humans and animals. You clearly don't understand the subject of traits, so I'm going to save you the pain of this. But please do read a book on biology.   Night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @IDD64 @2damntrans @NeverTheSun23 @HassanMamdani @sally_hines I mean, there actually is a lot of research going on but if it doesn't suit your narrative. You're entitled to your own opinions, but you're not entitled to your own facts.   https://t.co/iLakVjZomX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll That's not a trait.  You can have personality traits, but you can't have reproductive organ traits.  Maybe look at a biology book before making ludicrous statements like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Having a womb isn't a trait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll It wasn't even that long ago you were getting upset by the use of the word trans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll I'm telling you that I feel excluded by that term and you're trying to argue why I'm wrong, when I've said why not use "women and..." So it is inclusive.  Honestly, you're not for one second trying to understand why so many women are angry and upset about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll It literally is.  Your examples are not valid - red hair, acid reflux, size 6 feet can exist in any body. They're not bodily functions assigned through sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @IDD64 @2damntrans @NeverTheSun23 @HassanMamdani @sally_hines Is there a study to back that claim up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll So you're allowed to say "the use of the word women doesn't include me and I find it offensive" but I'm not allowed to say "boiling me down to a bodily function is dehumanising and offensive".  Do you not see the hypocrisy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Right so you're deliberately misinterpreting.  Ok, well women are people, but to be referred specifically to a 'person who menstruates' is demeaning and dehumanising as it removes my lived reality as a woman and boils me down to my biological functions.  Is that clearer for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll So can you give an example?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll So when would women or woman be used where it doesn't include other natal females?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Where have I said that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll A trans-person isn't going to be called a ~phobe of any kind. And I would go one step further and say it's a bigger issue for TRAs than actual trans-people.   What is so offensive by the word woman that the entirety of the language needs to be rewritten?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Because I don't 'feel' one is contained within the other.   I find being called a person who menstruates incredibly demeaning and dehumanising. Yet, if I say how excluded I feel by that I'm then labelled a transphobe. It's double standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMannRE @Femi_Sorry Chiming in - yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll It doesn't matter what the blank is - it can be "women and people who menstruate' or 'women and birthing parents' or 'mothers and birthing parents'.  It doesn't imply that women aren't people, but erasing the word women literally erases identity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll @BuckAngel No. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll You've invalidated your own argument in the same thread.   https://t.co/THsBRzXJMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll @BuckAngel They're different kinds of men in that there's natal men and transmen.  Can you imagine the blacklash if there was a Prostate UK poster with a natal man and transwoman on there?!! FML! There'd be outrage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll @BuckAngel Are you really getting hung up on a space?  Maybe the space is to signify the drop of the word ~gender So instead of transgender man, it's become transman (or trans-man, or trans man) I really don't think it matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll @BuckAngel Right, and if you look down slightly it says plural noun: transmen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll And as I explained, 'people' and 'guys' can be used as a collective noun for both men and women.   So your argument of using people, is essentially the same as using guys, but neither of them stand up. Also, as I said earlier, why not use "women and..."  That's the most inclusive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll @BuckAngel Does a dictionary definition help?  https://t.co/oIwWuj5KaB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Maybe you want to take a second and re-read the thread then. It might help make more sense of it, and where you went wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Transmen are transmen. Transmen may have gynecological problems, but natal men don't.   I hope that's cleared it up for you, but if not I can ask Trampa for his advice @BuckAngel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Have you met a straight man? They would turn round and say they fuck women, not people.    Jeez, you don't even see how dumb your argument is. Actually quite staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Ask a straight man if he fucks people and you'll quickly learn it's not   Your argument is idiotic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll It literally is gender neutral.   I walk into the office where I work with lots of women, and I say "Hey guys". My bfs daughter will run up to us and say "check this out guys". It's literally gender neutral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll Right, so 'guys' can be used to describe a group of people with no specific connotation to gender, so why not use 'guys who menstruate'?   Using 'people' doesn't have a connection to gender or sex but the argument for health campaigns is targeted at sex, not gender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll So what's wrong with saying "women and people who menstruate" or "woman and birthing parents", rather than erasing women entirely?  If you want inclusivity, it should be 'women and...', and not boiling us down to bodily functions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll So why exclude women from the conversation around gynecological problems entirely, when those natal females who've self-identified later on, know the posters around cervical cancer include them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll In fact, around one in four men know what their prostate does, so imagine how many don't even know they have one. You're not getting "prostate-havers" to the doctor by calling them that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate @living_droll The point is that whatever you think should happen, it isn't going to happen.   It's actually phenomenally difficult to get men to go to their doctors, for male health issues. So they're not going to make it harder by using 'inclusive' terms like "prostate-haver"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeepsMenstruate We're not though. Prostate UK still say men, and that isn't going to change any time soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sally_hines It's not opening out when you're banning the use of woman, women or females.  It's the definition of exclusion.   What's wrong with saying 'Women and people who menstruate' or 'women and birthing parents', surely that's more inclusive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLNewsome @daveweigel She does nothing of the sort! Are you on crack????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry He was absolutely bang on! Incredible to hear someone of that level actually come out and say it.   But you're right, you would never got your message across by including that.   Whilst the bulk of the Brexit blame sits with Tories, a huge chunk of it sits with ex Labour leaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alison_B2 @suzanne_moore I've asked this question several times and never had a response. Are transmen and non-binary females (sex not gender) truly offended at the words women or female in this context?  Or is it transwomen that are the actual ones being offended?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evolvepolitics I think someone needs to call Bellend Ben's mum and tell him he's being very irresponsible on social media again.  He should have his phone, laptop and iPad taken away and told to sit on the naughty step and think about what he's done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's evident of a failed education system that people are "shocked" to find that some manors and houses in the care of #TheNationalTrust, have colonial links to slavery.

<|startoftext|>@amandamilling @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner It's interesting to see how deeply offended you are for being called what you are - scum.

<|startoftext|>@BloomAndNora @JMarple4 Are transmen and non-binary females (sex, not gender) truly offended by the use of the word women? Or is it transwomen who get offended?  Just curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans You did say that though.   Where's your mum or parental guardian?   You've been on twitter for far too long today, and you're really not making anything better by incessantly tweeting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chinaxo @EricROlson It's interesting that you raise people with DSD, but blatantly ignore it when I do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  (Btw, it's people with DSD, not intersex)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chinaxo @Indy_Sinead @Telegraph So you ignored my reply on people with DSD, so that's interesting.  You're conflating sex and gender.  Tbh, you can be any gender you want - you can customise it, like you do your Starbucks latte, I really don't care. However, female is a sex, as are gynaecological conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chinaxo @Indy_Sinead @Telegraph So how many genders get endometriosis?   Or is the article (not the title) refering to biological sex?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chinaxo @Telegraph So you mean people with DSD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph Male endometriosis must be really painful.  Will there be an article about that any time soon?   Male gynecology is definitely an area that's ignored.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Beeron1030 @IanJon407 @JulianHoffman You have no idea what ecology is, or how much woodland is left in the UK, nevermind ancient woodland.

<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman So this is the third time I've mentioned a 300 year old oak tree, and nothing from you other than "it's a balance". It really isn't a balance at all; the UK has &lt;13% woodland cover, and you're for getting rid of it for a train. 2020 Vs Victorian trainlines is not comparable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman But you're sacrificing the environment for the sake of these trains.  On what planet is cutting down a 300 year oak tree a reasonable sacrifice for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman Right, thanks for that clarity. The whole point of my original tweet was about the environment.  Now I know you seriously couldn't give a flying f*CK about it in any shape, we can end this pointless conversation. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman Did you know trees absorb the heat, reducing that overheating you're banging on about. A train isn't going to stop the overheating, but demolishing the environment will make it worse.  Noone said anything about the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman Wow. Just wow!  You talk about congestion, but you're literally chopping down the trees that are improving our air quality. Really couldn't give a shit about the South East. The richest region in the UK. I travel to London for work via train. No need to get there 20 mins quicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman No need to protest?  So you're completely happy that ancient woodlands, and 300 year old oaks trees are hacked down and bulldozed for the sake a of a train track?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman You specifically said "which parties do you think it should include for my statement to be valid", so I replied and now you're trying to redirect.   Maybe don't chime in on a tweet that you can't back up.  Keep scrolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman You said you would provide a statement.   Don't promise things you can't deliver.    https://t.co/9Tzv5OGo3L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman So you're not sharing the stats &amp; info you promised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman Well, the Green New Deal came after the fact, not before.  All valid UK parties that supported this being approved in Parliament.  So UKIP doesn't count as they've never had an elected MP.   Also, which people - not MPs - with political affiliations does it "unite"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJon407 @JulianHoffman It doesn't "unite people from pretty much all parties" at all, by any stretch of the imagination.   Do you have any facts or statistics to back that statement up?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ALLIANCELGB @Keir_Starmer @RosieDuffield1 It's an insane world where women cannot speak about women's rights and women's issues, without being labelled transphobic, by a group of people where this specific issues don't involve them.<|endoftext|>

January 1st when we fall out on WTO, the food is backlogged at the Border in a 10 mile, 7 day queue, and the supermarkets are empty and people can't buy loo roll, that's why they'd use military force.

However, this isn't actually proof that she is transphobic, it's a character assassination with a lot of deliberate misinterpretations and insinuations.  Also, CIS is a ludicrous term, as 1.

<|startoftext|>@francesweetman It's also not transphobic or anti-trans to be pro-women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesweetman They see it as 'there's a man in a dress, who might feel threatened by going into a men's space, therefore it's logical they use a women's space', totally discounting the impact of the presence of the male in a females space. Which can be triggering for some women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesweetman i.e. an outsider's perspective - they've never been in the position of a girl or woman, who has been groped, assaulted, verbally abused, had misogynistic slurs and names thrown at them, to then have their single sex spaces potentially invaded by men attempting to gain access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesweetman It was Neville Southall. I actually don't think he really knew what he was talking about. Like many people, they see glimps online and form full opinions based on the tweets or comments of a few. They also view the issue from a male perspective.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoIAmTonyGreen The divide between the city was so strong there was a literal line between the two.

<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl Who knows? I'd rather it spark a movement than be a flash in the pan, but only time will tell and I hope to be proven wrong.   Indeed it is! Conversation in the time of Covid. With Merseyside imminently going into lockdown it may be a while off yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl Absolutely but that's one magazine. While Chris is still getting dead crows lynched from his gates, I would say the other side are unmoving. They're also not the ones buying this magazine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl The challenge is that only one side wants the conversation. The other side is happy to carry on as they always have done, for the sake of "tradition".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WlPEDOUTPILOTS @mooreimel @nypost It's not anti-trans to be pro-women.   The conversation is far more detailed than the capacity of a tweet, which is why TRAs get so triggered - it's easier to kick off on a comment than use critical thinking and debate skills.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @joe_beale @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl @MarkAvery I agree, petitions don't work. Unfortunately, we do have a corrupt gov, who are too influenced by friends in high places. So the current state of affairs won't see it resolved, regardless of the far ranging impact grouse shoots have including increase flood risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl Clay shoots wouldn't give them the "thrill" required, otherwise they'd just go paint balling.  A scent drive is where they put "artificial" fox scents down for the dogs to find, and they all go off in a pack. More often than not, real foxes are hunted down by dogs and killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl Does it count if I just read your article in the shop and put the magazine back on the shelf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @joe_beale @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl I'd recommend you read Inglorious: Conflict in the Uplands by @MarkAvery for better understanding of how detrimental and damaging driven grouse shooting actually is.  You've seen the fires burning over moorland close to Manchester? They were deliberately set for grouse shooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDevTom @McKenzie6593 @ChrisGPackham @FieldsportsJrnl You mean like the alternative to fox hunting is scent drives which ultimately just provides a different way for the illegal hunts to continue?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 Rats are better pets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thonoir Absolutely, and it works both ways hence the lack of critical thinking and debate skills across much of society.  Honestly, it wasn't intended as a conflation between the two, more of a remark on the energies spent while there are grave things happening w/out the attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thonoir Define problematic behaviour.  Society lacks the critical thinking and debate skills needed to develop a better society &amp; ultimately change behaviour. This is what I refer to when sections of society are waiting to get triggered on social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thonoir Obviously people care and focus on multiple things, issues and causes.

<|startoftext|>@theworksofwitti @janesarah870 @ALLIANCELGB @jk_rowling In order for you to better understand why many women feel threatened, then you need to understand women from a natal woman's point of view.  It's not anti-trans to be pro-women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lottelydia This is why it's so important to differentiate gender from sex, and why people with DSD are not the same as transgender.

<|startoftext|>@John_J_C_Moss @AgainstHunting @rachhutch13 @Urban_Pictures @XRebellionUK @XRLondon So within the same thread you're condemning India and China and saying protesters should go there, while referencing an article that discusses the  reforestation projects in India and China. Do you not see your own failed argument?  Also, reforestation doesn't solve the crisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_J_C_Moss @AgainstHunting @rachhutch13 @Urban_Pictures @XRebellionUK @XRLondon Neither are good options.  The world has changed, more people are working from home and businesses are realising how much money they're saving, so don't need regular high speed travel - via flight or rail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_J_C_Moss @AgainstHunting @rachhutch13 @Urban_Pictures @XRebellionUK @XRLondon That's unbelievably not true.   Please provide references to back up this ludicrous claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_J_C_Moss @AgainstHunting @rachhutch13 @Urban_Pictures @XRebellionUK @XRLondon Can't adapt on a dead planet.  We need nature more than nature needs us. Currently, the UK gov is tearing up the countryside and ancient woodland for its vanity HS2 project. That is certainly not reducing GHG emissions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PiersJH Thanks for sharing your opinion. Have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PiersJH Firstly, the question was hypothetical.  Also, there are stories of families of the deceased meeting the recipient of their loved ones organs, so it's not always 100% anonymous.  And when it comes to transplants, it depends on what is being donated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PiersJH Because the person I asked has had two organ donors from people unknown to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@celeftiespotter @martymitch_ @GaryLineker @RESCUE_UK Whose virtue signalling? That again, is your assumption and bigoted views.   I'm really not sure why you're attacking me, when clearly it's your morals and ethics that need reexamining.   And no, your dad doesn't count.   Anyway, have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@celeftiespotter @martymitch_ @GaryLineker @RESCUE_UK Ah, so you don't see any good in people, you just see fake actions with no actual positive, real world impact at all?

<|startoftext|>@celeftiespotter @martymitch_ @GaryLineker @RESCUE_UK Did I say I was certain? No, I didn't. I didn't even make the illusion of such.  That's your assumption based on my hypothetical question.  In my hypothetical question, they are organ donors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ALLIANCELGB Why they don't start their own trans-league? I do find it interesting that there's very little coming from transmen about joining the men's league.

<|startoftext|>@Purrrrrrr @notwaving @bigballskev1 97% of climate scientists agree of the anthropogenic causes of climate change. 3% don't.   You wouldn't go to a cancer hospital and have 100 doctors assess you, and then believe the 3 that say you're fine, while ignoring the 97 doctors that say you're sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purrrrrrr @bigballskev1 @notwaving Right, I remember the campaigns to stop CFCs in the 80s, the hole in the OZone layer, the oil spills and tragedies of wildlife being covered in oil, the devastation of deforestation. They weren't lies.   What's the harm in believing climate scientists now over deniers?  https://t.co/QaVAXQ213u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purrrrrrr @bigballskev1 @notwaving You're complaining that she's reading from a script (every public speaker uses prompts).   You can't even spell check a hashtag that you've copy and pasted!   You have no right to complain about a 15 year old giving an interview.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@notwaving I imagine they have the same reaction to climate change news as I do when the sport news comes on The difference is climate change requires people to change, and they don't want to.

<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec I wasn't lying. I have nothing to apologise for. You need to get over yourself.  Clearly you're having a bad day, you've doubled down instead of admitting your own hypocrisy, and are in the need of an argument, and frankly you're boring me now.    Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec FYI, I'm a GP member primarily for my environmental and pro-EU stance. GP are also the only true socialist party. I was asked to stand by my local party to give people an option. I did not campaign.  Your assumption of me is akin to some peoples views of Karen's.  Hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec So you're doubling down instead of apologising?  Yea, I was because you asked what a "woman" was and I know Solange@ is of the same opinion as me (and it's woman, not "woman"). Again, wtf has that question got to do with anything?? I really don't what point you're trying to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec I don't think that. Where I have said anything of the sort? You've made assumptions based on what? My political affiliation?   I wasn't policing anyone, I was saying the Karen is the hair.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec You feel attacked by some people calling some women karens, and have decided to speak on their behalf. You are a woke bro. That's nothing on me. I didn't have to Google you to find that out.  Why does woman need defining? What's the relevance to this conversation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec @solange_lebourg you might want to question why you follow some people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexrubner @123cookiec Wow! So you don't like people using a generic term for some women who complain a lot, so to try and make a point you frantically Google women and try and make the attack personal?   Does that make you feel like the big man, does it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel Interesting, so what else about me and my actual lived experience are you going to attempt to mansplain?   Most managers don't give a shit - they're not going to sack you for taking one day off.   Maybe that's just your experience BC who would hire you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel I didn't craft a wrong point.  Your logic does imply that you never apply for jobs! üòÇ In the EU, you tell your new employer when you have pre-booked holidays.  Sorry you live in a country that doesn't pay holiday time, but that's not my problem.  Also, the thread is about the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @grouperfintendo @kndnsmnst @YaqoobIsmaeel They're not comparable at all. Having experience working with HR &amp; hiring managers, and actually having been HR in Amazon and working with agencies are two very different things.  I'm sorry you're wrong and can't deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel Riiiiigghtt... There's no "strawmanning" going on.   Maybe it's the difference between employment law in the EU and employment law in the States. You tell your new employer (or agency) or any pre-booked holidays to accommodate. If they don't, then you don't have to take the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel I literally worked for Amazon HR with agency managers. What I'm saying is from actual lived experience. If it was just for one day, they would have worked around it, or told him to call in sick.   By your standard, you would never apply for a job because you need a day off. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel I've worked with plenty of agency managers who tell their staff that they can have the time off, and report them to the hiring company as sick or some other excuse to keep them on the books. Especially if it was just for one day. There's more to this than he's telling everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrMomCallsMeMrP @kndnsmnst @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel He would have been agency. They have different rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kndnsmnst @UrMomCallsMeMrP @grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel There's a % of the facility that can be off at the same time on holiday; they do increase it for Eid. Yet holiday booking process is typically 1st come 1st served. Eid is booked up sometimes months in advance by the current workforce. They need to state time off before starting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel I've previously worked in HR alongside agencies  Unfortunately there's a large number of people who are told to take jobs rather than actually wanting them. They don't turn up for work, so agencies have to get them off their books in order to give the role to someone who wants it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grouperfintendo @YaqoobIsmaeel I'm assuming you've never worked for an agency then. They all do this.   All big companies that require warehouse operatives hire through agencies, and this is an standard thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LTDangerous @NatskuLove @kxller_queen @Bubblejet @JonHartleyInBSE @theAliceRoberts So I define the two separately.

However, the TRAs won't recognise the difference...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LTDangerous @NatskuLove @kxller_queen @Bubblejet @JonHartleyInBSE @theAliceRoberts Unfortunately a blanket approach is seemingly the only option.

<|startoftext|>@LTDangerous @NatskuLove @kxller_queen @Bubblejet @JonHartleyInBSE @theAliceRoberts I was fully in support of trans-women having access to whatever bathroom they felt safe in, but then I started hearing of reports where men were abusing this right.

<|startoftext|>@LTDangerous @NatskuLove @kxller_queen @Bubblejet @JonHartleyInBSE @theAliceRoberts It's not putting yourself in the presence of a man, it's being in a single sex space that's infiltrated by a man.

<|startoftext|>@glosswitch Brilliant! I've raised my own childhood abuse in conversation, but repeatedly told that's my problem and trans-women are one of the most attacked minorities.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover As with all new methods, they need to be trialled and tested first. Green hunting is far more beneficial BC you can take biometric data, put on a tracker and understand over a longer term the conservation needs of elephants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover It's exclusive to SA atm, and has been stopped for the time being, as the gov states only vets are authorised to use tranq darts.  However, hunters still get the thrill of the hunt, but they actually benefit conservation at the end.    https://t.co/MXHtHZ7sSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover This fuels poaching as it keeps the market stimulate and keeps that need going This is also the reason why in many places, mammoth ivory is banned. W/out testing it, it's near impossible to verify the species. Elephant ivory will be marked mammoth to be legally imported<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover One of the biggest problems with trophy hunting is that it's open to exploitation and fuels poaching. It's cheaper for a Chinese businessman to send people over to legally hunt elephants and rhinos, and bring back the risks/horn which is then sold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover elephant numbers have plummeted, particularly in the last 30-40 years, when trophy hunting is meant to be providing all the benefits you suggest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover As a scientist, I don't allow my emotions to dictate my response to emotive subjects when it comes to wildlife. Green hunting is a valid and beneficial alternative to trophy hunting, but it doesn't appeal to the white narcissist who has to glorify the kill. Pray tell me why...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover I was a conversationist well before I was vegan. I've studied HEC extensively, and I know all the arguments for trophy hunting, but I don't agree with them. There are valid alternatives to trophy hunting, that don't involve willfully killing animals to "save them".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterEgan6 @wwf_uk I understand the economic reasons why some big NGOs like WWF support trophy hunting, but I don't understand it from a conversation perspective.  The money from slaughtered animals doesn't go back into conservation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jypseywheel @Loukanikos161 @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover There's a blatant disregard for the behavioural ecology of animals and their impact on the environment.

<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover So birth control is readily available and encouraged in rural communities across Africa, India and in developing countries, and religion has no affect on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover To my knowledge, Green hunting has been implemented from one university, so not a big enough sample size to make that claim. So if you want to share other places it's been implemented and been unsuccessful, I'd love to read about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover It was meant to be a legal hunt.  Youu're trying to state that legal hunts are good for the animals, conservation, the people and everything is hunky dory. Which it absolutely isn't. I didn't say it was up to you to punish them, just that there was no punishment for his actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover By all means, quote tweet your references - I would hate to make assumptions because you've told me to scroll up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover But we're not just talking western women. We're talking globally. Religion is a huge consideration for all countries, when discussing population control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Cecil was a lion in a protected area, who was lured out by a rich white man to be shot. You're talking a out legality, and I've given an example where a legal hunt was turned illegal and nothing happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Do you know what green hunting is?  Why should we appease the blood lust of these individuals, that by any other means, would be a psychopath?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Many women are on birth control for a limited time, not permanent. In fact, I tried throughout my 20s to get sterilised because I didn't want kids, but no doctor would let me "because I might change my mind".   Many women like me have found the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Let me think, the whole religious lobby would 100% be against it. It would "breach basic human rights", a policy against the poor. It's not a vote winner - people will happily tell you who they think shouldn't have kids, but they'd be outraged if you said it included them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover I'm asking you specifically, not others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover It absolutely does not go back into wildlife. It many cases, it doesn't even go back into the poorest villages that need that money  The legal way to hunt? There was nothing legal with the way Cecil was slaughtered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Alternatives exist, but unfortunately they don't pander to the sadism of hunters. Green Hunting is an example of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover But humans do breed indiscriminately. And noone would vote for human population control. It's not a vote winner which is why no government has implemented it (China is the exception not the rule, but noone wants to recreate what they did, for very valid reasons).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover So we save elephants from being poached by culling them or by getting a fat white man to shoot it? Riiiiigghtt. That generated money doesn't go back into wildlife though. How are those elephants affecting the herd? Male elephants are solitary for the most part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Who does it help? "Killing some individuals to ensure a better chance for the rest of the population to thrive..."

<|startoftext|>@AileenLovelace @Loukanikos161 @ChrisKrxss @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover I do.  Humans are the primary cause for the issues all wildlife face today. What on earth makes you think killing them is going to make it better for them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisKrxss @Loukanikos161 @jypseywheel @sarahcpr @WWF @AdamRuins @adamconover Where poaching and hunting occur, those older males can still have an active role in producing the next generation - not just from fathering but also from the bachelor herds.

<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb I'm really struggling with your argument. One option is fencing in people; this has worked with bees being used around farmland, to keep elephants out. Again, your argument doesn't support conservation efforts; it's supports the continued expansion of people with nature suffering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb As I mentioned earlier, I've studied HEC in Sri Lanka, met with family members of those who died as a result of crop raids. I've also seen how elephants get tormented by villagers.  I have Levison's book.   The biggest killer of farmers? It's actually snakes, not elephants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Why do you think elephants crop raid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb They would move with the great migrations, but due to colonialism, they've been forced to settle. This has then created more problems than it solves. The issue of hunting is a sticking plaster over a bigger conversation in both cases. Why not start a different conversation now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Their histories are totally different. As I've said before, humans have eradicated the predators that would "control" the deer population &amp; an excellent argument for rewilding.  The ecology of the elephant is that it's evolved to migrate; African farmers used to be nomadic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCGQT That's... That's.. strangely hairy....üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Yea, let's compare red deer in Scotland and elephants across the continent of Africa. Completely comparative study. Sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb The answer isn't to cull or hunt, the answer is to look at landscape conservation, wildlife corridors, and working collaboratively, because the benefits' elephants bring - from ecosystem to economic - are huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Surveys in Botswana revealed that the elephant population wasn't growing as initially suggested, but with HEC, it was a more tactical decision for rural votes from the gov for the then, upcoming election. Botswana elephants migrate into 3 neighbouring countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb There's no such thing as "too many elephants".   Humans have decimated the elephant population.  Elephants are ecosystem engineers, and yet you wonder why the habitat is in such poor condition?  Correlation doesn't always equal causation, but there's a very strong argument here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb So again, your argument is to kill the elephants, not deal with the human problem?   I did my undergrad research into human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. The humans were fenced in, not the elephants. I'm happy to share.    https://t.co/X2e9fMRl90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Elephants are ecosystem engineers - how are they destroying the bush habitat that sustains other species, when they literally are the ones creating it - from seed dispersal, to pulling down trees that redirects water to grasslands, that creates habitats for the whole ecosystem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Mass extinction is caused directly or indirectly by humans. I'm struggling to see your argument of saving animals from starvation, disease or inbreeding by killing first.  We need a different conservation argument that doesn't revolve around white people with too much money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Much of Africa is fenced off, preventing natural migrations from occuring. We no longer have elephant graveyards - when we kill elephants regardless of hunting or poaching, were not just losing genetic diversity, were losing the ecosystem services they provide - which are huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Red deer do cause significant damage to trees, particularly saplings, and Scotland has a significant timber trade &amp; plantations. But that's an argument about rewilding, not trophy hunting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb The argument for culls of red deer are entirely different from trophy hunting in Africa. Humans have caused the extinction of all large mammalian predators in the UK, and there's huge backlash against rewilding of wolves, lynx and bears in Scotland, even though it makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Your comments don't answer my original question, and they also don't make any sense.  We should cull male bears before they cause infanticide?  It completely ignores the behavioural ecology of animals, or the external pressures they're facing that would drive them to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Unhealthy overpopulated wilderness?? Sorry, but that makes no sense; we're in the midst of the 6th mass extinction.  By your comment, humans can willfully reproduce but wildlife, which is under immediate threat by humans, needs to be correctly managed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesMowlem @DrHWeb Management of which population? You say there's finite space, but that doesn't mean quality habitat for all species to survive - humans have eroded, encroached on viable habitat, and then there's climate change impact too. Can you provide references to that last statement please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mladydik I honestly cannot stand either of them. She's hateful and ignorant, but he's a little bitch. He's incapable of a grown up conversation without either reducing it to insults, or storming off like a child. I blocked him from his Corbyn campaign, and is why we have the gov today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrHWeb Do you think there are valid alternatives to trophy hunting, and where is the line, if it exists, with canned hunting?   My biggest issue is with the kill at the end. Green hunting is a model that can and has worked. What purpose does the kill have to conservation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@15nyancats @iSigFreud @RichardDawkins You mean like people who scream "terf" at JK Rowling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @EdConwaySky So are we ever going to find out how many people have actually died??  I've seen predictions based on ONS reports stating that it's over 60,000 dead; however the gov (with their dodgy maths) is saying 44,000.  Which is accurate? And where can we verify these numbers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ala_cult @thatsnotitatall @jk_rowling That's not the case everywhere though. In Scotland, they've changed it so any male can self-identify as a woman and not required any hormones or surgery. Can you see how this could open doors for abuse towards women?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Captainsensi @ChrisS144 @Bakpfeife @Gladwell You said they're attacking you, not disagreeing.  You can absolutely have a conversation with someone, and that's what it looks like.

<|startoftext|>@PickardJE I took my car to the dealers for a service and they asked if I could sanitise my hands.   I'll tell you NOW, that was the nicest hand sanitizer I've ever used!  Had a light floral scent too! They're not cheaping out on that stuff!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @RadFemme74 @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood I'm sorry that you and your partner have had to deal with hate from other people. I absolutely stand by the rights of genuine trans-people. But while those rights are being abused by others, and they get protected by TRAs, then I can't silently stand by. One rape is too many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @RadFemme74 @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood I'm really not. You've had crime rates given to you (not just from me), examples of actual crimes and yet you're still point blank refusing to give the opposite side of your argument any consideration whatsoever, based on your own experience. So again, why can't I use mine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @RadFemme74 @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood You're really not getting this are you?  Maybe take a step back from your own situation and look at the data, stats around violence towards women and girls and try and understand the concerns your own sex have.  You seem to think only your experience matters.  https://t.co/GFh0ge6uZr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @RadFemme74 @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood No, as I've explained clearly before, there is a difference between genuine trans-women and men who self-identify as women to gain access to women's only spaces. I'm not sure which bit you don't get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @RadFemme74 @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood It's interesting how you can use your own experiences to validate your point, but I can't use mine.  Your misogyny is unreal.<|endoftext|>

Crime is going to happen, let the police deal w/it. You're an utter hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Captainsensi @ChrisS144 @Bakpfeife @Gladwell You're not being attacked.  They're disagreeing with you.   ...Oh, is this how your interpret "invalidated an entire group's existance"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Captainsensi @ChrisS144 @Bakpfeife @Gladwell Do you have some sources of what she said that was misinformation, and "invalidated an entire group's existance", please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlessandraAster Never heard of them, and now will thankfully never have to listen to their bs music!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood I'm not sure why you're comparing abled-bodied people against the Paralympics, but again, you're very clear in your stance that women come second.  That's fine, I understand where you are with your misogyny. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood So women have to deal.   It's really interesting that on specific subject areas you are as neutral as a tin of beige paint; yet when it comes to anything regarding equality for women you're blatantly not interested.   Fascinating conversation. Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood We wait for the crime to happen. Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood Or do we not do anything and just deal with the consequences?  What about the women who have tried all their lives to compete in competitive sports, are at the top of their game, but a trans-woman outcompetes on every turn?  https://t.co/lQ5FNMAiNK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood So how do we define who is an innocent and who is a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood Right so you're saying "people get attacked all the time, you just have to deal with it". Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood Again, my argument isn't against genuine trans-people, it's against the ones who abuse those rights for their own gain. I don't have a solve for this, but it does need to be discussed. Unfortunately, TRAs are so "woke" that the second anyone tries to discuss,they're screamed down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadFemme74 @LisaPatrEvans @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood If you have looked through my tweets, you will have seen that I talk openly about my childhood abuse. That abuse left me with PTSD and is triggered at times that I can't control. Why should I and women like me have to compromise time and time again?  It's not anti-trans at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood So you're happy if a 10 year old girl gets sexually attacked by a trans-woman in a supermarket bathroom, because the police will deal with them? Interesting. Being pro-women doesn't mean you're anti-trans   https://t.co/SlWAIS4fkr   https://t.co/qyeSXfcGLv   https://t.co/sazHRU03Tz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood So a question for both of you - do you see, the image in the quoted tweet, as a misogynistic man with an erect penis, or a trans-woman telling women to suck their "ladydick"?  Where does your support align?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaPatrEvans @RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood I have friends with PCOS so I do understand through their experiences, the betrayal you felt from your body. But to have someone tell me that "I don't like women having self-determination, agency etc" is utter bullshit. Their answer was absolute BS, based on no evidence as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood I never once said I spoke for every woman. When I say you have no idea what women go through, you were born with male privilege - I'm not blaming you for that, and it doesn't discount your own experiences. But your experiences are not the same as a womans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlessandraAster I think she defined cancel culture in that tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CritFacts @kevinadiamond @ALLIANCELGB @G_Brsky Right, because I've asked for examples of this misinformation and noone has actually provided any.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood What the actual fuck are you on about??  The issue is you might be a trans-woman, but you have no clue what women go through based on our sex. I'm very much pro-women, and happy to support any genuine trans-women, but don't conflate the experiences of one with the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadFemme74 @mulletlesbian @CuptainSprinkle @MargaretAtwood Interesting how you specify women in this context and not men. Surely toxic masculinity needs to be addressed first and foremost as it's males that have the bigger, more toxic issues, or do you not see the misogyny that underlies comments like this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CuptainSprinkle @mulletlesbian @MargaretAtwood They are real, and they do exist. But to deny sex means that you're denying genuine trans-people the validity of their feelings by saying sex isn't real. 'How can you be born in the wrong body if sex doesn't exist??' You can be pro-women, it doesn't make you anti-trans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuptainSprinkle @mulletlesbian @MargaretAtwood Orgs like Mermaids tell kids that if they don't fit into gender norms, then maybe they were born in the wrong body'. It's absolute bullshit! They just like what they like. For the small % that do genuinely feel they were born in the wrong body', it doesn't make them less valid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RidgewayGirl01 @Harpers Would you say the same of the author who shared your view, who raised your same concerns to a bigger audience, and enabled that conversation? Or is it just the authors that you don't agree with that you reject?  We can't be selective - we have to have both perspectives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RidgewayGirl01 @Harpers Interesting.  They're raising the platform for conversation, encouraging debate, discussion and provoking thought.  As writers, isn't that the definition of their roles? They created their own platforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RidgewayGirl01 @Harpers That makes no sense, can you clarify please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harpers You can buy the book and not agree with the author.   You can only move on, develop, evolve as a society if you have open conversation. Hear the voices.  People have a right to question your views or beliefs, but they don't have a right to vilify you.  Don't agree? Mute &amp; move on<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GenderDude @jubalcurrent @rockaddict420 There is a part of me the questions why I have to justify not wanting biological males in a female only space, but men aren't questioned about why they want access to those same spaces. There are misogynistic undertones to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 I challenge myself every day to think about things differently - that's why I engage with conversation on twitter. I'm happy to learn and have my opinion change, but honestly some TRAs are so militant about trans-rights that they refuse to have a discussion. It drives the divide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 It's lived experience mainly.  I have a good friend who is now trans - well, he/she swaps on how they feel at the time. Some days he's out as a gay man, other days he's out as his female self. This is why I don't argue about gender, but why sex is a different subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 I wish I had an answer that would satisfy everyone but I don't This is why it's so important to talk about and not squabble and name call. This is why #IStandwithJKRowling, because she elevates the discussion. Noone wins when it boils down to mocking, name-calling and derision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 privilege does have a lot to answer for.  Just looking at the furore over trans-women using women's spaces, and transmen using male spaces - I hear virtually nothing of the latter. Why? Is it because they've grown up with misogyny and "knowing their place" too? Just curiousity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 A trans-woman has grown up as a male, so that lived experience is very different to the lived experience of a natal female. I grew up with blatant misogyny, not just at home, but school, &amp; in the workplace &amp; education. Trans-women can't be blamed for that but growing up with male<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 For me, I almost feel as though the penis is symbolic - its a symbol of ingrained patriarchy, that dominance over women and girls.  In some ways, it's a weapon (and in the case of rape, it definitely is).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 Does any of this make sense or explain the perspective of women?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 My biggest issue is with self-identification without need for hormones, surgery, or medical sign-off.   So where is the line? I will march with trans-people for them to have equal rights. Yet there are those who will abuse this, so there has to be checks and balances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 It's not imagining! Please research into it - again it's not solely a bathroom issue. Its all women only spaces including competitive sports. Does trans-rights give an avenue for rapists and paedophiles to predate women more easily? Yes. Is this the fault of trans-people? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 People can look however they want, that's not the point. But a young girl on her period having to use a bathroom where anyone with a penis walks in, is deeply unsettling for them. I don't expect you to understand this, but here lies the problem. Don't tell women to just deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 This is just me and my case. Please look at domestic violence statistics to understand why single sex spaces are valuable to women.  Not all women will agree with me, and that's fine - but they're not my priority when it comes to protection. Again, it's pro-women, not anti-trans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 It's not irrational! Personally, I was a child who suffered excessive domestic violence by my dad and brother. I'm undergoing EDMR therapy for PTSD linked to my childhood. It prevented me from forming trusting relationships with men. Not feeling safe around men is not irrational<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 Trans-rights activists (typically people who are 'woke' and not necessarily trans people)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 It's such a complicated issue that I honestly am staggered how many people will roll over to the TRAs and accept everything.  It has to be questioned and scrutinized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 I've heard of a number of cases where men self-identify as women, apart from at work because they don't want "being a woman" to impact their pay. Men self-identifying as women who then go on to commit heinous attacks (as above) are skewing the conviction data for natal women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 I'm more than happy with three sets of a bathrooms, but that won't be enough to satisfy TRAs.   It absolutely isn't at all. Gender is a social construct, I honestly don't care what people identify as. But sex isn't - intersex &amp; trans people are different arguments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AquafabaMcGee It's those people who bang on about "you get unhealthy vegans" but fail to notice the overwhelming human population suffering from ill health while stuffing their face with ultra-processed meat. ü§¢  I'll take my slightly salty vegan burger any day thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 Try understanding where women have come from, how we've fought for equal rights for over 100 years, and how they're being systematically stripped away and called bigots because we're defending what we've died for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 There's two cases provided as examples to demonstrate the point, not a article write up with every problem that has ever been caused. The problem isn't restricted to bathrooms and prisons, it's also women's refuges, women's sports, and women's healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 It's the rapists &amp; paedophiles that are exploiting the trans-movement for their own gain. Unfortunately, women can't say anything about their own safety without being called a terf - it's pure misogyny. Yet, while TRAs are condemning women, they're ignoring the actual problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubalcurrent @GenderDude @rockaddict420 You're either obtuse or have zero comprehension. Trans-people are people.  It's men who self-identify as women to gain access to women's only spaces, not genuine trans-women that are the problem.

<|startoftext|>@stomachonlegs Tbh, I don't care that much. I'm not a labour voter (nor Tory) and never will be, but I abhor the current government and Starmer is the right person (who has a chance) to lead this country out of this cesspit of a mess.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NI_Atheist @micknugent @jk_rowling Being referred to as a 'bleeder', 'menstruator', or 'ovulator', rather than woman utterly misogynistic and denotes me to nothing more than a biological function.

<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 The solve isn't an overnight fix. But the starting point is an open dialogue and conversation. I'm tired of the hate being poured on JK Rowling. She's not saying what she's saying from a place of hate; but there are very real issues &amp; concerns on both sides that need addressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 Can you see why the safety &amp; security of that single sex space would be eroded if (specifically) a man who self-identified as a woman could gain access to a female only bathroom? This isn't to say trans-women don't deserve safety, but we need to find a happy middle ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 If you are trans and not had that experience, then I can see why you might take her opinion as offensive. My dad was horrifically abusive, where I have PTSD from my childhood. So for me a single sex space is somewhere that I can have assurance &amp; control my anxiety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 When you've been through domestic abuse, whether as a child or a partner, you are more defensive over those single sex spaces.  Even when the known threat has gone, you still have this crippling anxiety that lives with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 By the Scum interviewing JK Rowling's abusive ex-husband, the rhetoric against women still prevails - denying the lived experience that she was beaten and raped. Our arguments are the same, so that's why I don't see JK Rowling as anti-trans. She's pro-women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 I fully understand that many within the trans community are scared. Women have been fighting for equality for over 100 years and we're still not there. Feminism has enabled the LGBT+ community to have a voice, and in some elements, it's feels as though it's being used against us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 Trans-women aren't the only ones angry and in pain. But when any female (gay or straight) questions the trans-community about things that directly impact them, they get absolutely screamed down. There is no conversation, so there is no room on either side to address the issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 I don't doubt for a second that she has thought that and questioned herself. But it's not possible to have an open dialogue when the conversation is so one-sided. I don't see trans-women asking women why they might feel uncomfortable, intimidated, or even scared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VexNemorensis @Morrissey_MyE @taru_sisko @Femi_Sorry @benleo444 @katejourno1 Would you listen to anyone who immediately screamed 'terf', 'bleeder' or other derogatory slur in your face?  I wouldn't. For a population that is screaming for inclusion, there is a very real misogynistic underbelly to the whole thing, which is frankly repulsive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeColourWords @carolecadwalla They're trivialising the abuse she suffered by saying "I slapped". He also said that it wasn't prolonged abuse. This platforming of an abuser, and by all accounts, rapists, is so abhorrent it's beyond reasoning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoraReed @harveyparadox @PhilipPullman Actually, when men self-identify as women use this to gain access to women only spaces, where they then commit rape and sexual assault to women and girls, you are the paedophile &amp; rapist apologist. That's not saying TW are doing this, but self-identification enables this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoupieDragon @PhilipPullman Quite agree. Men and women are not equal, despite over 100 years of a long fought for battle.  So to be told that trans-women are women by men, who have sat on a throne of privilege, uses feminism against the group it was founded to uplift.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien I think people need to take their rose tinted glasses off when talking about Churchill.   Yes, without him (and allied forces) Britain might not have succeeded in World War II.   But that doesn't excuse the absolute atrocities he caused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling I know, but I'm not talking on behalf of @jk_rowling or that specific article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling It's not at all, in this particular area it's branding all women and transmen as 'bleeders', 'menstruators' or some other derogatory term.  That might be fine to use for transmen, but I'm not happy being referred to as bleeder, that's absolutely disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling I can assure you, it's not about a right to exist - everyone has that right. I want to assure you that I fully support the rights of trans-people, but I have to draw a line when its at the expense of others. That's not to say all, but there are clear cases of that happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling You need only look at the sheer hate and vilification of women (including gay and queer women) by those who scream terf in their faces. I'm open and happy to have a conversation, but I'm not willing to engage with people like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling That's wonderful for you. I'm really happy for you.  I don't feel the same, so I will speak up for others who feel the same as I do.   Feminism has enabled the trans community to speak up, and that's wonderful, but there are those that are silencing women by turning it derogatory<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling And the trans community ignores this, I cannot fully support it. I was fully supportive of trans-rights until I saw womens rights &amp; protection being eroded. I can't idly stand by and watch women's rights disappear like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling mtDNA isn't phony science, it's actual science. I've also read a lot of reports and articles of men self-identifying as women to gain access to single sex spaces, where they go on to attack and rape women and girls. While rapists and paedophiles can hide behind a trans tag..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed on down the maternal line. So before people say 'trans-women can have children through surrogacy too', they do not have ovaries, so cannot pass on mtDNA.   They can pass their Y-DNA, but that's paternal through sperm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheena_Hatton @Aleen @jk_rowling Fair comment. In some cases biological females can be born without a uterus, but they still have ovaries making the ability to have children possible through surrogacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley It just means you need better fox proofing if your chicken coop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glinner For as much as TRAs bang on about inclusion, they're demonstrated none of it themselves.

<|startoftext|>@BilNaylor_ @ruthpeacey @IoloWilliams2 I'm fully aware that lockdown has led to job losses meaning people have turned to poaching. I wouldn't be surprised if the recent outbreak of Ebola was caused by increase in bushmeat due to lack of available food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilNaylor_ @ruthpeacey @IoloWilliams2 I know - I'm not saying overpopulation isn't a problem, I'm saying that human impact comes in many forms. Humans won't be going anywhere, not for a good few years anyway. While population control is controversial, you have to focus on consumption and impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilNaylor_ @ruthpeacey @IoloWilliams2 Population is not the only problem.  Encroachment on land for housing, business, &amp; agriculture; overconsumption; exploitation of natural resources and pollution also play a significant part.  A lockdown at specific times of the year would give respite to wildlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indusindianahi @PoulomiMSaha Exactly. There's no regard for wildlife when it comes to infrastructure. The lockdown has at least given wildlife some respite, but humans are the ones that need to be fenced in. I can't see anymore photos of elephants being killed by trains, it's so utterly heartbreaking üíî<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Crowsiie @PoulomiMSaha It's utterly heartbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crowsiie @PoulomiMSaha It's to elephants that crop raid. They love watermelons and can't resist.  But really, their habitat is being taken over by humans, so they struggle to find enough food in nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indusindianahi @PoulomiMSaha It's happens in rural areas to elephants that crop raid. In all honesty, it wouldn't be possible to police. It's absolutely abhorrent practice, and aside from education, I cannot think of a way to stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMFelton I appreciate racist identifying themselves by standing against a fence. Its interesting that the 2nd amendment has absolutely jackshit to do with a free state.

<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders @Matt_Clough There's also the 2nd Amendment for a free state, and that's not happening either.   Funny how the NRA and proponents of that go silent when this was their whole fucking argument about having guns in the first place. Jeeez!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badbhonnie @zoeyy227 @JoshuaPotash Or this is how the Handmaid's Tale starts, or the Hunger Games - I mean, we're only six months into 2020, anything could fucking happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the NRA vehemently support the 2nd Amendment which states "a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state".  Surely Trump sending in the military directly contravenes this?  So where are the NRA, or gun-toting Americans protecting their "free state"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnboy_Cook That's actually not a bad strategy to have!   Oh, I'm sorry I didn't pick up on that comment sooner, I would have said something to her.

<|startoftext|>@catherinenben @LMcKLtd @Johnboy_Cook Thanks, but I'm totally fine permanently socially distancing away from you.

<|startoftext|>@catherinenben @LMcKLtd @Johnboy_Cook I have no idea who your horses are, so how could I possibly know if any of those things were true??  I also couldn't give a flying fuck what job you do.  Also, too dollar???   Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinenben @LMcKLtd @Johnboy_Cook It's not an insult if you are diagnosed a raging maniac. Then it's just fact.  You can't see both sides. Have a look into the ethology of horses, and do a comparative behavioural study and get back to me.  Have a nice night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinenben @LMcKLtd @Johnboy_Cook You actually didn't. There was no reference to what the cons where, or what the difference was between the US and UK. It won't make me happy to see a horse die at the hands of a bullish trainer like you. Maybe look at how wild horses live to understand why yours are miserable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinenben @LMcKLtd @Johnboy_Cook No, because you sound like a raging maniac, not someone open minded and happy to have a educated debate.    You absolutely can't see both sides!! If you could, then you wouldn't be calling people liars!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Vej_Gee They were only interested when someone else did it. You can easily count this as the same for abattoirs. Except animals have done nothing to receive the death penalty. It infuriates me that people say 'you're behaving like animals'. Animals aren't inhumane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vej_Gee *take stock and review, had he killed innocents? He went and asked a group of people if they believed in the death penalty. A few of then said yes. He then asked if any of them would actually execute those found guilty. None of them said they would. He quit his job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vej_Gee I was listening to the radio earlier and they were talking about an executioner in the States who has just died. The executioner has killed about 68 people. There was a case where a man had said he was guilty but then pleaded his innocence at trial. This made the executioner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwainAlty @simon_brooke @velobetty @theroyalparks 1. I never mentioned bridleways 2. I'm ref. an up to date HC, not one ~200 yrs old 3.

<|startoftext|>@OwainAlty @simon_brooke @velobetty @theroyalparks Actually, the lowest form of travel has priority - cyclist over car, pedestrian over cyclist. It's literally the highway code.

<|startoftext|>@velobetty @OwainAlty @theroyalparks Tbh, it infuriates me when I see people walking the wrong way down a road - the wrong way for pedestrians is walking in the same direction as cars and bicycles.  Why? Because you need to see what's about to hit you!  Also - highway code.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob There's literally *one swab* that you have to use in your nose and back of the throat, not only is it disgusting, but I've honestly never seen a test done like that before. It's utterly bizarre!   Clearly testing is not being "led by science".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@affleckquine *quiet CAP doesn't work well in the UK, but that's because of the gov, not the EU. The policy exists and it's up to the country to implement how they see fit. UK use subsidies for landowners (like Dyson), not farmers. While France supports smallholdings, not landlords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affleckquine Regional differences definitely play a part, as does the NFU.  I know NFU were quite on the subject for a long time before saying that leaving the EU wasn't a good thing (they didn't fully reject it). However many thought leaving the EU &amp; Common Agricultural Policy would be good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wendycockcroft @Glinner Of course, anyone in that category have probably also been the ones most likely to die of Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendycockcroft @Glinner But that doesn't actually answer the question.  Women historically die during menopause, hence the use of HRT.  So when we see those shortages next year, or HRT becomes phenomenally expensive because of WTO, who gets to take it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendycockcroft @Glinner The HRT shortage was Brexit related, not coronavirus. The real impact won't happen until next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry It's probably a blessing that you got out of the Tories when you did!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Geryonsbackaga1 @Glinner @JifMOD Phenotypic and gonadal sex isn't perfect. Things can happen like hermaphroditism and intersex.

<|startoftext|>@Toontweeter @con_derry @GaryLineker What was 'holier than thou' or 'condescending'?  There are multiple definitions of theory.

<|startoftext|>@Toontweeter @con_derry @GaryLineker I'm a scientist, I don't have beliefs.  Pregnancy and Covid are a comparable analogy.  You believe they're not, and there in lies the problem with having beliefs - they don't allow you to change your mind with evidence, ask questions, or open up discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toontweeter @con_derry @GaryLineker On which bit - The comparison, or the interpretation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toontweeter @con_derry @GaryLineker You're saying you can't compare Covid to pregnancy. I'm saying its a fair analogy.   What you believe and what he actually says are two, arguably, very different things.  Mainly because Trump doesn't understand words, and you're trying to reason with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toontweeter @con_derry @GaryLineker But arguably, you can be asymptomatic of pregnancy while actually pregnant.  Have you never seen "I didn't know I was pregnant"???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicktolhurst Millennials are people born between the early 80s and mid-late 90s, so unless they're mature students, they weren't in school or uni during the referendum.

<|startoftext|>@moules_tony @RoryScottC @guardian It is true. Strains of Covid-19 can be found in bats and pangolin. It's a zoonotic disease which means it's passed from animals to humans.  And it's also true that it's Wuhan has been determined as the location of the outbreak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andyh_uk @Mandoline_Blue But none of those things are happening.  There are plenty of reports coming out to say that people died with Covid-19 but not of it, and that's a huge discrepancy when recording death counts for the pandemic.   https://t.co/Anf9SEMuw7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyh_uk @Mandoline_Blue It's says "if directed by a coroner or pathologist" doesn't say that should, they have to or that it's required - it says "if directed".

<|startoftext|>@monacochick The #ToryDeathToll just keeps increasing.  If the austerity measures weren't bad enough -130,000 as of last July  ( https://t.co/l5ogsQIbTo), incompetence and inaction has caused another 10k in less than 5 weeks, and predicted to be 66k by the end of summer. Enough with this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mandoline_Blue I read that they had to be tested for Covid-19 while they were alive and get the results back for it to go on their death certificate. But they're not testing, so they can't possibly accurately record the numbers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FinnB53 @Di_Garrison @matthaig1 They're trying to flatten the curve, so when people do get it, the NHS has a better chance of coping. It's nothing to do with stopping it. If he wanted to stop it, then you test the fuck out of people - compare the UK to Germany, and you'll understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinnB53 @Di_Garrison @matthaig1 Not only that, but the gov isn't recording deaths accurately. They're not recording deaths in care homes (official figure was 20, but IRL it was more like 120), they're also recording some with not of Covid-19. Did you play Pandemic and think you know how to mitigate disease?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinnB53 @Di_Garrison @matthaig1 With a total lockdown, the UK would see 20,000 deaths. Without, it's looking at 260,000. We don't have a total lockdown. Factoring in Tory austerity, cuts across our NHS and Brexit causing 10k EU NHS workers leaving, the death toll for the UK is predicted to be 66k by end of July<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Di_Garrison @FinnB53 @matthaig1 New Zealand went into lockdown when they had one death on the 25th March. They now have two.

So no, meat eaters don't get a pass because of what "one person" did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HylianWolfMage5 @AndyLatics @natsch_journo Which one person? It wasn't *one* person who are pangolin that then caused the pandemic.

<|startoftext|>@tyrathetaurus My favourite bit is that a vegan diet doesn't cause a worldwide pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VixL I'm not even clear on how they're reporting the deaths. From what I can tell, they're only reporting on deaths from inside hospitals, but - from what I've read - 111 are trying to not get people to go to hospital, so I don't know how they're recording deaths at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VixL I find it astonishing the narrative of the media in this country. When it was happening in China, Italy, and other countries, it's was all red alert huge death numbers. But on numbers within the UK, it's all 'oh, it's not as severe as we thought'. It hasn't even properly started!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Glinner This tweet posed a question: this individual is not in the UK, but if they were - we're already seeing shortages of HRT for women going through menopause.

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot With this, I am by no means justifying what they're doing. I find the whole thing utterly abhorrent. It's not just bats and pangolins, it's a behaviour ingrained across elephant and rhino poaching to name but two. So this is a huge cultural shift for China &amp; other Asian countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot Wet markets exist (not specifically talking about wildlife) but their desire for warm meat. Many rural communities don't have refrigeration, so warm meat means it's recently slaughtered. They also have a distrust of cold or frozen meats. So it's not a simple as shutting them down<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @DGreeenshields @carolecadwalla Are you now agreeing with me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A48percenter @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla That's why I said evolving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @DGreeenshields @carolecadwalla One that were aware about. Just because you haven't heard more about it, doesn't mean it's out there - controlling the fear and anxiety is also about releasing information when people need to know about it - not when people are panic buying toilet roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @A48percenter @carolecadwalla I've got an MRes in Conservation Biology, which included zoonotic diseases and evolutionary biology. I'm gonna take a hunch and say I've probably read a shit ton more books and scientific articles on this than you (one of my essay exams was on parasites, diseases and evolution).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A48percenter @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla The only age bracket that doesn't seem to be significantly affected are young children, and that may be due to not having been infected significantly by other coronavirus families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A48percenter @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla But the chances of developing immunity are slim to none. We don't have immunity from colds or flu, so why would this strain of the virus family be ant different. Again, it's an evolving virus, it's far, far too early to be discussing immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vrsimility @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla Reinfection is reinfection. The variables that surround it is not known but you don't blame your underlying conditions if you get flu twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @A48percenter @carolecadwalla You need to Google immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A48percenter @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla What's unproven? Reinfection? Because there are already cases of it, so its not really up for debate. How it's expressed the 2nd time round is still an unknown, particularly when looking at numbers; however, there are reports of reduced lung capacity in recovered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla I'm honestly really struggling to understand what is difficult for you to grasp.  Herd immunity is quite simply not the solution to this. It's not going to flatten the curve and it's not going to take pressure off the already overwhelmed NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla Do you have a basic understanding of evolution? You know that covid-19 is an evolving virus (evident in that it's a zoonotic disease never before seen in humans). Also, because it's so new, it's difficult to predict with some saying that it could also become seasonal, like flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A48percenter @HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla Yea, I think you need to re-read my original tweet. I never said there was a problem with herd immunity, I said it's only works if you can get immunity to the virus in question. Which you can't ergo, it's frightening that this is the govs stance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiverpoolEmpire Thanks! I'll keep checking in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntedTeamNick @carolecadwalla Oh right, so how does that explain those people who are getting reinfected with it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Herd immunity only works if you can get immunity to the disease/virus. It's in the same family as flu,  not chicken pox. There's so much basic misunderstanding from the gov and their advisor is frightening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi @nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy Why are you asking me to judge you?   My morals and ethics wouldn't allow it, but that's me, not anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi @nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy Only you can answer that. How would it align with your morals &amp; ethics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi @nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy Are you honestly asking this question?  You've said before that you don't eat at KFC, so unless you're also not buying anything from a chain supermarket (which you likely are), what is the point of this question?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi They're a billion dollar business for selling chicken, not for selling chips, rice and beans.   I'm honestly not sure what your point you're trying to make, other than trying your damnedest to 'get one over on other people".  You're not actually making any point whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi @nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy Sorry, where do I say "Tesco don't profit from selling animal products"?   Oh, that's right - I haven't said that at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Is that better, or do you want a PowerPoint presentation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi So 1. KFC is a chicken factory. You're purchasing directly from those with blood on their hands.   2. Tesco is a supermarket. You're purchasing vegan &amp; cruelty-free products, and Tesco are the third party. They use this market information to make their buying decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi I disagreed with the statement about fast food chains - purchasing anything in KFC is funding animal cruelty. As vegans are first and foremost about animal welfare, I don't understand vegans who do purchase from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Happily. You're insinuating that I support anyone buying the plant based product, as they're not funding animal abuse.  However, you've used that in the context of a restaurant/fast food, not supermarket which is what I discussed.   https://t.co/oqddaUiomr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @MatOeal @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Please don't misquote me.  Buying from a supermarket is different to buying from a fast food chain like KFC.  If you purchase a vegan burger from KFC, then yes you are funding animal cruelty.  If you buy a vegan product (that isn't tested on animals) from Tesco, then no.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnetteWardell @_VB78_ @veganmillsy @Mrs_Veg @Herofthewords @bigchow84 @DaveTheHerbi @TheVeganSociety @HappyCow That sounds amazing! Definitely going to download that!

<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi 1. KFC is a chicken factory first and foremost, Tesco is not.  2. I've not suggested that at all. I actually said I don't understand why a vegan would go into KFC, not that they shouldn't.  3. Maybe read the conversations first before honing in on one comment you don't agree with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Support is a strong word. You're still shopping in there, or with any other chain supermarket. You're not supporting their animal cruelty if you're not purchasing animal based products.  So you're saying you can't be a real vegan unless you exclusively shop in vegan shops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Because by going to KFC you are actively funding animal cruelty. And a vegan is about animal welfare, first and foremost. You're not supporting animal abuse, by buying vegan products in Tesco. Tesco uses that market research to understand their shopper profile &amp; cater accordingly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOwenMyers I was really hoping the dog would bite his finger off at the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi I don't think you know how sales work. I don't buy a product, so how do they profit from me not buying their products?   3rd time - Veganism is about animal welfare first and foremost. Do you agree or disagree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi A better question would be whether you buy Colgates vegan toothpaste, knowing their products are tested on animals. And no, I wouldn't do that either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi You're answering a question with a question.  I don't buy eggs so there is no reason these companies (manufacturer or shop) would profit from me not buying their products.  Buy buying a vegan burger from KFC, you're still contributing to cruelty. Veganism is about animal welfare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_VB78_ @AnnetteWardell @bigchow84 @veganmillsy @Mrs_Veg @Herofthewords @DaveTheHerbi It's still a standing joke to a lot of people, so giving a chicken burger instead of a vegan burger, is like 'Oops! I don't care'.   You wouldn't ever think about giving a Muslim a pork sausage, but for some reason with vegans, it's a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @chloeyloman @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi It's not bad memories, it was evidence of what happens in their intensive farming factories and slaughterhouses. Veganism is about animal welfare, first and foremost. Would you agree with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnetteWardell @_VB78_ @veganmillsy @Mrs_Veg @Herofthewords @bigchow84 @DaveTheHerbi @TheVeganSociety I use Happy Cow. That's been amazing. I'll check out the vegan society one though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chloeyloman @nonoyobidnesss @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi So I should go into a chicken shop, whose animal cruelty was the primary reason why I went veggie 17 years ago, because that might encourage them to start making more vegan burgers? Bit backwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @Herofthewords In an ideal world, but that's not to be expected. They're a chicken shop worth over a billion dollars.  How many vegan burgers must be purchased in order to make that much of an impact, when the average lifespan of a KFC chicken is 35 days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Exactly - they're a business thats worth a billion dollars because of their trade in dead chickens.  They are a chicken shop, first and foremost.   What on earth would make you think they keep their vegan burger profits totally separate from their meat sales profits?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @Herofthewords You're never going to turn KFC vegan.  You've got a better chance of shutting them down through legislation, than purchasing vegan burgers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Which is why I referred to plant-based diets.   If you're plant-based, then animal welfare isn't a priority, so I can understand why they would go into KFC.  But being vegan is first &amp; foremost about the animals. Hence why I don't understand why any vegan would go there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @Herofthewords But it's not though (and definitely not literally the same thing), unless you don't understand business models.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Again, I said I don't understand why someone vegan would go into KFC. I'm not sure what you're not getting.   Where in that sentence did I say "you're not a real vegan if you go into KFC"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Herofthewords The CEO of Gregg's is plant-based, not vegan. The vegan burger in burger king isn't vegan, but suitable for plant-based diets.  You can draw the line wherever you want. People can make a bigger impact with their supermarket purchasing than KFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @Herofthewords Again, you're insinuating things and deliberately trying to cause an argument about things that have never been said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Never said you did. You said that you 'apparently wasn't a real vegan' based on the article, which was about vegans going to fast food chains like KFC.  I never said anything about them not being vegan if they did, I said I couldn't understand any vegan that would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi You haven't had a conversation, you're merely quote tweeting and leaving it at that. I've asked you to convince me why, as a vegan, I should go into a KFC and buy their vegan burger.  I'm still waiting for a response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmasanV I'm not suggesting anything of the sort, I'm referring to Shell's 'carbon neutral' points scheme which is blatant greenwashing, just like KFC selling vegan burgers. It's a fad, it's not going to change KFCs business plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Herofthewords The argument (was originally but then subsequently conflated by others) about vegans going to fast food chains like KFC. I've never once said that vegans can only get their food from allotments, others have insinuated that. I do have an issue with vegans who will buy from KFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msangiemoon That's the point of the argument. It's vegans going to fast food chains like KFC that I have an issue with, not supermarkets. I've asked people to convince me otherwise, but instead it's just conflated arguments that serve no purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Yes it is. Are you incapable of having a conversation, or do you prefer quote tweeting for likes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msangiemoon @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi So you have absolutely no issue with purchasing a vegan burger from a business that's worth a billion dollars due to its trade in dead 35 day old chickens?    Idc why they made it, it's business. But by purchasing it, vegans are condoning the mass chicken slaughter. Astonishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Because the profits derived from that sale will go back into purchasing more animals for their main business area.  They don't have a separate business plan which is exclusive for vegan burgers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi as I said earlier, a vegan burger at KFC is the equivalent of going to Shell to be carbon neutral. It's greenwashing. Purchasing vegan/cruelty-free products in a supermarket has more of an impact &amp; we can see that in the ranges made available. Fast food has a different agenda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Sorry, I hadn't seen your question. Also, Happy Cow is a blessing.  I disagree with your statement though. Recognising the difference between plant-based and veganism is the start. Veganism is about the animals, plant-based is not. Purchase power does have an impact, but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Bye Dave  https://t.co/0CRAGbHFoY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @bigchow84 @DaveTheHerbi Wow! Ok. I find that utterly astonishing, but each to their own. Have a nice life.  Shame the same can't be said about the animals dying in the companies you support. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceresisaplanet @veganmillsy @bigchow84 @DaveTheHerbi I don't deny that it's easier now. It's phenomenally easier to go vegan now than it ever was to go veggie 17 years ago.  I know it's not possible for everyone to go wfpb.  The bit for me is vegans going into KFC. I just find it astonishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins You can disconnect morality from human development. Morality doesn't define us - consider rape, murder, genocide etc. If morality defined us, humans wouldn't do these things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins Why on earth would I speak for anyone else but myself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins Explain then. The wonderful thing about being an atheist is that I'm open to having my opinion and view changed. So change it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins That's debatable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins What am I wrong about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins We don't even have to concentrate on humans &amp; animals. Through selective breeding, we are able to eat potatoes; ears of corn are yellow not multicoloured; the splicing of DNA into other species has enabled certain grains to include more beneficial vitamins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins With all due respect, I don't think you are.   Ethically, eugenics of any type is repugnant; I don't condone it on any level. From a point of genetics (ie removing the emotion of the subject), it can and does work (it's not perfect, because it's biology).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @bigchow84 @DaveTheHerbi "It's about the animals but I'm still going to KFC because they've released a vegan burger".  The hypocrisy is astounding, but I guess you're the exact type of person that KFC loves.  I went veggie 17 yrs ago because of KFC, why tf would I go back in bc they have a vegan burger?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hawkatana @RichardDawkins I don't think you're interpreting what I'm saying. Also, there are two forms of eugenics. What you're referring to is negative eugenics (getting rid of the 'undesirables'). The other is positive eugenics (breeding the 'best of the best'). I'd highly recommend James Watson's DNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soymilkbitch @bigchow84 @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi Its the equivalent of greenwashing. They release something that others interpret as cruelty-free &amp; ethical, but you're still purchasing it from a company that profits from cruelty.  Like Shell and their 'drive carbon neutral' campaign. It's corporate bullshit made to appease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardDawkins The comments section doesn't seem to understand the difference between science and ethics.  From a genetics perspective, it works. From an ethical perspective, its repugnant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi You're still funding cruelty at KFC.  When you purchase from a supermarket, and only purchase vegan and cruelty free products, then you're making consumer decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigchow84 @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi  https://t.co/o0LBGPGPhQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selltheworld @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi But you're not though. That principal might work for supermarkets, but not for fast food chains like KFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigchow84 @veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi I haven't actually, but thanks for asking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi KFC didn't make their vegan burgers to attract vegans, they did it to keep their current customer - who might want to reduce how much meat their eating - happy. Same goes for Burger King, Gregg's, and the rest of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Hahahaha, ok. Tell yourself anything you like üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonoyobidnesss @DaveTheHerbi I've a lot to say about them.   I've asked to be convinced otherwise, so please - enlighten me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wojowojowojo And you are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veganmillsy @DaveTheHerbi And there in lies the difference between plant-based and vegans.   Vegans do it for the animal welfare (purchasing anything at KFC still supports the suffering), whole plant-based don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveTheHerbi Ok then. Interesting debate. Bye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@buchanan17 Them Brexiters - they knew exactly what they were voting for.   It would actually be fascinating to hear from someone who works for an airline and voted Leave. Did they honestly and knowingly choose to stop their own careers like this??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot TL:DR  Carnists hate vegans because carnists cannot justify their actions of eating meat when a vegan turns up - makes them face their own moral dilemma (cognitive dissonance)   Carnists hate vegans because research shows vegetarians actually think they're morally superior<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimmytabuk @nicktolhurst @Steve_Lyons_ @KLM Completely agree. Its tragic, but the Brexiters knew what they were voting for - which means this is a known consequence of their vote.

<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews You're missing the clear part where I've said "she would have been through hours and hours of interrogation, therapy and reliving every waking moment" Again, you're cherry picking to suit your narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews I didn't say that I would absolve someone bc they couldn't remember. A deliberate misinterpretation. Shame on you.  So you can see it from his perspective of beating the living shit out of his wife and daughter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews Your inability to look at the situation from anyone's perspective other than your own opinion is quite alarming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews You can't possibly say she did it on purpose when she doesn't even remember picking up the knife!   She would have been through hours and hours of interrogation, therapy, and reliving every waking moment. Shock and trauma would block it from her memory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews It's not bending words when murder is premeditated, and this wasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews Fact: murder has to be premeditated. This wasn't. It's really simple.  I'm not biased at all. I can empathise with the woman, you can't. You've cherry-picked segments that support your otherwise, factually incorrect point of view. The forensics would support her 'claim'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews She went to trial for killing him. Jury heard all the evidence and found her not guilty of manslaughter or murder, as she was defending her life and that of her mother's. End.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews That's not true at all!  It's self-fucking-defense!!   I hope you're never say in the jury seat for anything more than a parking fine! Completely warped sense of justice, and reason. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews Thing is, you don't know the crime. You've read an article.  I've got PTSD from the years of metal, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my father, so I can fully empathise with her.  You on the other hand, haven't heard a fraction of her case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews Pray enlighten me - what should be her 'punishment' if you never said she should go to prison, but she needs to stop twisting it to go her way and what she did was actually murder?    This is your time to shine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews How can she twist the law when she wasn't on the jury for her own trial??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews He was beating the shit out of her and her mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews This is why it's self defense. It's fairly simple, to be honest.  173 people were murdered last year in incidents of domestic violence. You're siding with the abuser and that frankly, is utterly abhorrent. You should be ashamed of yourself.    https://t.co/bsnZuXTqIB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews If you've never been in that situation, then you have no idea what goes through your mind - you do whatever you can to get out of it. You cannot imagine the stress, pain or panic she was in - your flight or fight instinct kicks in and you have no logical control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews You actually are. She isn't going to prison, and you're saying the law shouldn't be bent this far. If you'd read the article, she's been aquitted for murder and manslaughter by jury.  If you'd read the story, she has no recollection of holding the knife.   https://t.co/wzb69sZofs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Amelia_Womack @Primark I'm concerned with the amount of plastic they have labelled as faux leather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AureEntuluvaaaa @BBCNews What she did was suffer horrific physical and mental abuse for 19 years at the hands of her father - a man that is meant to care for and raise his daughter with love.  What she did was in self-defence.  If this was two men fighting, you wouldn't call it murder.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ErikSolheim A lot of elephants are trained into 'dancing' to music.

<|startoftext|>@fredopups @EllaWitchwood Wow! He's rich, so fuck him - he deserves to get battered by his wife? Amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredopups @EllaWitchwood Her actions absolutely have that type of power. She has a platform, and cried as though she was the one abused.  She's a narcissist, who has not only damaged women who are being abused &amp; can't get the support they need, but also abused men who really need those safe spaces too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredopups @EllaWitchwood I don't think Johnny Depp is full of shit at all. He's been in a series of high profile relationships over the last 30 years, and all came out in support of him. That speaks volumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_gosden A dignitas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredopups @EllaWitchwood When this all came out the first time round, she played the victim. She turned everything on Johnny Depp and he was vilified.

<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt Though the union does need reform, the EU is not to blame for Brexit.  That lies with The Tories, Farage &amp; Putin, and Cambridge Analytica.

<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @trymybest18 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot Again, you're trying to say your original comment was about behaviour. It wasn't. It was about nutrition, and I haven't disagreed with the rest of the statement, only the point you're trying to backtrack on. Please re-read my responses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @StigAbell It most definitely is a cuntry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Brexit Gravy train keeps on rolling in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trymybest18 @kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot The original comment was nutrition based, not behaviour. I've agreed that behaviour is hard to change. The connotation of the original post is that meat is 'hard to quit' based on nutrition. This inherently wrong - we wouldn't have seen the no. Of vegans increase if it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trymybest18 @kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot I guess that's where we differ - I don't think calling a point within a statement bullshit, rude. It would be rude if I said kcz was full of bullshit...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @trymybest18 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot It's nothing about pronouns, it's actually just rude. I've read it several times to address your point. Your original comment wasn't about behaviour, it was about health as your discuss the nutritional benefits of meat. And by saying "hard to quit" it does assert addictiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @trymybest18 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot I did say behaviours are hard to change, but an unhealthy person can be unhealthy with any diet. Meat is not indicative of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @trymybest18 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot 'She'?! I already did explain it, but let me try again. What is inherently wrong about your statement is that meat is not "hard to quit' because it's not an additive substance. Chocolate has properties that release chems that leave cravings but turkey twizzlers don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trymybest18 @kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot In my experience, people ask me why I'm vegan. I then tell them. I only talk about my experience - I couldn't give a shit what people eat, or whether I'm liked. I know a vegan diet doesn't work for everyone, and that's fine. But I will call people out on their BS arguments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot It's a bullshit argument. If I was berating you then I would say you are full of bullshit, but it didn't. Apologies because you clearly took it personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot I'm not berating you and your choices, I'm commenting on one aspect of what you said which is inherently wrong.  Dietary habits can be hard to change, but you can be a unhealthy vegan as much as an unhealthy meat eater.  Meat isn't the issue, behaviour is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agricontract @GeorgeMonbiot I mean, I'm in therapy for everything else, my diet just isn't one of them! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcz100 @Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot I was raised on a meat based diet. All meat, every meal. I was veggie for 14 years, and have been vegan for 3.  Saying it's 'hard to quit' is honestly bullshit. It has no addictive properties, unlike alcohol, tobacco, or heroine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agricontract @GeorgeMonbiot Never been healthier than when I've been on a vegan diet. Have had bloods taken to be checked and it's all come up perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agricontract @GeorgeMonbiot So why bother responding in the first place? Just scroll on.  Also,  https://t.co/gVx0gJzJG5  You do? That's interesting bc I was veggie for 14 years, and have been vegan for 3 and never had a B12 injection. In fact, of all the vegans &amp; veggies I know, only 1 had to have it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nat_Carnegie @GeorgeMonbiot Humans have evolved thanks to a cooked diet, not a meat based diet. You talk about adapting to meat, but never in human history have humans produced &amp; consumed so much meat, as they have in the last 60 years.  https://t.co/LRXN28G1pM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clairabellejp @rablivingstone Because most shops have sensors that register the no. of people coming in and out.

<|startoftext|>@timeforpj @Radical_Podcast @scandalousT @Channel4 @GeorgeMonbiot I actually asked you first to reference your carbon footprint calculator, which you became very offended by.

<|startoftext|>@timeforpj @Radical_Podcast @scandalousT @Channel4 @GeorgeMonbiot Ok, so less address the real reason why you're so offended at the thought you might have to cut down on red meat in your diet.

<|startoftext|>@timeforpj @Radical_Podcast @scandalousT @Channel4 @GeorgeMonbiot Again, you need to cite what you're referencing.

<|startoftext|>@ChisieWeirdo @Radical_Podcast @scandalousT @Channel4 @GeorgeMonbiot Depends which report you're reading - yes if you're only looking at volume of CO2, but wrong if you're looking at other GHGs and the impact of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Thank you for speaking sense on Radio 2 earlier about the bludgeoning of the fox. My blood pressure was through the roof with the absolute idiot that was on previously (with the pet fox), so you managed to bring it down with sense, compassion and reason!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sheff_socialist It beggars belief.  I'm noy a labour voter (Labour safe), but in the north west, people don't read the sun. Still voted Labour. I do think there's an interesting correlation between which papers are being read and how they voted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheff_socialist I do appreciate you tweeting your story. We have a right-wing media; Labour know this, so should have managed it.

<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden 'Terf' stands for 'transphobic radical female'. However it's used as a derogatory slur against all women who dare question the gender Vs sex debate. There is no space for reqsonned debate.   https://t.co/QbDuHJ1kUH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alltimejo @halford_rosie @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_  https://t.co/L3Urb7pJSJ   https://t.co/GPwaM0lMO4   https://t.co/NuAhYjc6Ad   https://t.co/4RJXW3UHej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. In a country that's literally #burning due to the #climatecrisis, they still insist on arresting a child for protesting the inaction of a government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halford_rosie @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ I think there are too many grey areas where (born) women are still vulnerable, and that needs absolute protection. It's not to say transwomen are safe &amp; sound in the world, it's saying that, particularly for now while society catches up, they're two different issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halford_rosie @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ I disagree. She doesn't come across as transphobic. She, as a domestic abuse victim, is standing up for women's rights that have been long fought for. There are cases of men 'self-idenfying' as women for access to women's shelters, where they've gone on to rape &amp; beat their exes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoodemote2 @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ For me, women still don't have the equality or privilege of men and it's been a battle that's been too long fought to be silenced by derogatory and hateful comments, such as women being called 'terf'. I'll stand against bigotry - I don't agree with Maya, but I do see JKs side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoodemote2 @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ Apologies if I'm thinking out loud, but I can only refer to my own personal experiences.  I couldn't give a shit what people do with themselves or what they want to be known by. But I do take a stand if I see it impact someone else negatively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoodemote2 @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ Which again falls down to the social and equality struggle that (born) women have been subjected to. There is entirely different biological needs of a (born) woman, compared to a transwoman, and that's not to cast blame or irrelevance, but it does need to be recognised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoodemote2 @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ Whereas you've said that gender does not need to exist/ is separate from sex.  The bigger issue I have is that you only hear the 'transwomen are real women' and any (born) female who dares to question or disagree is a 'terf'. Meanwhile, there's no 'transmen are real men' outrage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoodemote2 @Smol_Kiwi702 @_Snape_ The issue is noone actually has a clear definition on anything. For me, you can have any and all the genders you want. Gender is a social construct. Biological sex - there is two. There are, of course outlying cases of hermaphrodites etc, and others in the animal kingdom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guardian There's two very different things going on here.

<|startoftext|>@TheProleStar You know that time, around 100 years ago when women weren't allowed to vote, and men of a certain class couldn't either. Yea, this is form of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T2Toaster @maurawilson63 @KassFireborn @Roland00Address If you're born with a pee-pee though, that's quite a defining feature that makes you not biologically female.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllianceLGB Or am I missing something that's blatantly obvious to everyone else??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllianceLGB But for many women, it will feel like another tactic or tool to silence you and shut you down (years of female oppression has done this). There's no safe space for discussion. And I find it quite shameful from the trans-community -who want to be heard as equally as everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllianceLGB I fear that the way the world is turning that you can no longer express a view without there being some derogatory term given to it. Terf, for example - clearly JK isn't transphobic, she's also not radical. These are incredibly emotive words designed to shut down the conversation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thonoir I disabled my Facebook for around 2+ years, and it was wonderful. I've been back on for just over a year, simply so I can see photos of my baby neice.

<|startoftext|>@sarcastic_prick @MartinERimmer @yorker129_7 @britainelects Did I say that? No. Your question was about the media and I'm answering it.  It's a comment on sun readers and how their political tendancies are swayed. Nothing about whether it's a good or bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarcastic_prick @MartinERimmer @yorker129_7 @britainelects He was centrist. You couldn't call him a Marxist, you couldn't say he was a Tory - he had the backing of The Sun (one of the reasons why Labour retained their seats in the north west is because noone reads it).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @RudyGiulioni @NEVERTEEN2 @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh I think you'll find I specifically said wild animal circuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Il_mostro_ @Femi_Sorry Wow! My dad was verbally, mentally and physically violent towards me growing up. One thing it has made me do is recognise narcissistic, misogynist wankbags, like yourself and know how to easily wind them up.   Love my hair colour. Distinctly nicer than the Gammon red of your face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Il_mostro_ @Femi_Sorry Do you have a strong arm because you wank so much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @RudyGiulioni @NEVERTEEN2 @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Peru, for example - banned wild animal circuses and successfully closed them all down within a year. UK - Chipperfield (circus owner, convicted of animal abuse) lives in Cameron's constituency, and it took over 25 years to get wild animal circuses banned (still not enacted).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarcastic_prick @MartinERimmer @yorker129_7 @britainelects We have right wing media in this country. This isn't new information, Labour have had plenty of opportunity to manage it. Don't start acting the victim; Labour are the reason why Johnson feels like he can make up his own laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dxckstep @sarcastic_prick @MartinERimmer @yorker129_7 @britainelects What's that got to do with the price of milk? Doesn't make Corbyn any less incompetent!   Under PR we'd have around 18, but "socialist" Labour only supports an archaic voting system that benefits the few, not the many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiulioni @Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Absolute lunacy! I've been to South American countries less corrupt that this one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarcastic_prick @MartinERimmer @yorker129_7 @britainelects strange way of looking at it, two and a half years ago, Corbyn didn't win. And he lost again with the biggest fail since the 80's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Tories have already backed out of their environmental pledges.  The only parties that benefit and gain power from FPTP are Labour and Tories, so why would they go for PR. We're all losers when it comes to FPTP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh I vote in every election. Doesn't mean it's democratic. FPTP isn't democratic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Did you actually write that with a straight face??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Then the system is corrupt, and susceptible to further corruption and manipulation.  I've already given examples of why none of it was democratic, so without you providing evidence to the contrary, you cannot disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh I've just provided plenty of examples of how it wasn't democratic. But I guess that's the thing with the right-wing of the country, it's only democratic when you swag the conversation to your benefits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TinaSleepyCFS @Conservatives Oh my god!!! Am I bitching about it? No! I'm saying you can't cite a derailment as an argument for nationalisation!  https://t.co/acMhqvGLj4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Again, define left?! Labour are centrist, not left and that's why Corbyn failed miserably.  I didn't have a choice of living in this country, but I'm half British half Dutch.  Again, what has the EU ever done to you to so negatively impact your life?  FoM is my democratic right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinaSleepyCFS @Conservatives You cited a derailment as a reason why people need to stop bitching about privatised railways. Labour losing isn't a vote against renationalisation, it's a vote against Corbyn and Labour for their utter incompetencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Again answering a question with a question.  If my profile isn't blatant enough, then I'll tell you that I'm a child of Freedom of Movement, I have dual nationality, I am European, and I won't have that taken away because the right-wing want to leave the EU for no valid reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Sorry, what was democratic? Because Johnson &amp; Co have been caught lying and cheating; Vote Leave was found guilty of fraud, Cambridge Analytica were involved in their Leave campaign (proven to interfere with elections globally), and the Russians have had their involvement too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @NEVERTEEN2 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh Define 'the left'.  Because I've been asking every leave voter and Brexiter 'what the EU has ever done to them that has so negatively impacted their life, that they want to leave?' and all I ever get back is hate and vitriol. Never a legit answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinaSleepyCFS @Conservatives 2 days after an election? Not quite!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh I fucking hate Tories, but I equally hate Labour. Why? Because they've both systematically destroyed this country. I have every democratic right to hate these parties. I don't target individuals but you can't help if someone takes it personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__asroy @VixL @paulmasonnews Until Labour back PR over FPTP, and openly start talking to the other parties to enable tactical  voting/future coalitions, they can never call themselves a socialist party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VixL @paulmasonnews "Absorb the Green Party" what absolute ludicrous bullshit is that??!! üòÇ  I've never voted Labour - not once in my life, and it they destroyed my party by 'absorbtion', they'll certainly never get my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landi683 @RudyGiulioni @EssexPR @HackedOffHugh The hatred is across the board, not just the left.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OllieAlex13 @matthaig1 That's interesting, because I've always found it goes the other way. anti-Semitism is brushed aside (namely from Corbynites who resolutely disagree that there is a significant problem [even 0.1% is a significant problem]).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AntacsB @Unwariest @JolyonMaugham But they've not gone on to like him any more over the last 3-4 years. He was popular to start, but once they've made up their minds, that's it. We have a right wing press, Labour need to factor that in.   https://t.co/BoOiuyGrFM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iain_waugh @nlitchfield @colinrtalbot A democracy should represent all views - Nick Griffins was given a platform, and he totally shot himself in the foot. Where are the BNP now?

<|startoftext|>@AntacsB @Unwariest @JolyonMaugham Xenophobia &amp; racism hasn't won outright. A huge reason why people voted Tory was because of Corbyn - they hated him. He was so bloody flaccid throughout the last 3-4 years, noone knew what he actually stood for. He's a mediator, not a leader Leaders make choices - he coui do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahmed_dossa @rodjgrimmer That would be to assume people liked Corbyn. They absolutely didn't. He might be a lovely man, but he's not a strong leader. Anyone else at the helm of the Labour party wouldn't have seen a defeat as severe as this - we'd more likely have a hung parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahmed_dossa @rodjgrimmer However, it's also indicative of a failing education system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Biggers @davidschneider Of a very sick country. Unfortunately, those that did vote Tory for the first time in 30,40, forever years, will be the ones that will suffer the most. However, if this is the only way they'll learn to never vote Tory again, so be it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Biggers @davidschneider Except, this was run under FPTP, an archaic voting system that is completely undemocratic. There's a reason why a general election was called (Dislike/trust of Corbyn, &amp; voting system) and not a referendum (PR). So brexit isn't the will of the people, it's a symptom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beccibec @ColinLusk @concretemilk It's a shame some people can't have a debate. This is why the country is in the mess it is. üôÑ  https://t.co/0w63yHSqNZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GIFTCIC @VixL Greens have the democratic right to stand in every constituency. Why should we step down and deny Green voters a voice? It's hardly Labour stronghold, and as soon as you deny people the chance to be heard, then you cannot call yourself democratic or socialist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VixL Little Island, the Cult of Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beccibec @ColinLusk @concretemilk The delusion of the Cult of Corbyn and refusal to see any flaws in him, or listen to people when they said "i don't like Corbyn', has left us with a Tory gov. I'd laugh, but people will die from this gov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beccibec @ColinLusk @concretemilk I'm aware how Hitler got into power, but the last time I checked it was Labour with the anti-Semitism problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beccibec @ColinLusk @concretemilk We have a right wing press - that's a fact. Labour should have planned to it, instead of conceeding defeat to it.  People were saying 'anyone but Corbyn' for a reason - he's been utterly incompetent for over 3 years! Corbynites just refused to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@concretemilk It's was difficult to say because you'd get resolutely shot down by the Cult of Corbyn and called a 'fucking Tory' if you did say anything against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OzraeliAvi Sorry, but FPTP isn't democratic. The investigation into the Russians interference wasnt released prior to the election, which wasn't democratic. And if you think the UK is a democratic country, then you're going to have a shock!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@96Tjames @matthaig1 It just simply never made sense.  He's too left wing for some; the anti-Semitism &amp; being unable to apologise didn't help, he just came across as being placid, flaccid and passive. That's not a leader. Johnson, despite all the lies, was at least passionate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@96Tjames @matthaig1 They simply don't like him or don't trust him. People need a leader, not a mediator. Leaders make choices, choices lead to change. Remaining neutral on Brexit can come across as deceptive - what are you if you have systematically voted against the EU, but are 7/10 for remain??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@96Tjames @matthaig1 Corbynites could never see why everyone else disliked him, or didn't trust him, so when you have people knocking on the door to talk about him, it was akin to Jehovah's witnesses coming round. They treated him like he was a Messiah. When he was as deeply flawed as anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@96Tjames @matthaig1 In order to do that, you need to understand the reasons why they voted the way they did. Part of it is to do with the Daily Heil, it's the 'charisma' of Farage &amp; Johnson's BS, it's brexit -whatever that means. But for many it was also to do with the fact they hated Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BJChela @TheGreenParty @CarolineLucas Labour can fucking do one! They have plenty of their own options - Starmer, Lammy, Phillips, Thornberry to name a few.  This isn't football, you cant just trade politicians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much sums up the entire Labour campaign.   Placid, flaccid, and benign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brainbowsloth @brotherpug @webber_karen @RosiePearson59 @IanDunt It's literally in Labours manifesto to not change the voting system.

<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 It's like their stance on FPTP, and refusal for PR. I don't think they can call themselves a socialist party when they support a voting system thats for the few, not the many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brainbowsloth @webber_karen @RosiePearson59 @IanDunt Because it's only Labour and the Tories that benefit from FPTP and neither want to change it for PR.  You don't think Labour should have a policy on reforming the voting system, because it benefits your party? We've been ping-ponging between the two for decades. It's a joke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@webber_karen @RosiePearson59 @IanDunt It does. FPTP is an undemocratic voting system. PR would see more Greens voted in. This is one reason why Labour can never call themselves a socialist party, because they support a voting system that benefits the few, not the many.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MagicMagid It's hard to tell from this soundbite if he was specifically asked about Halal slaughter, or that's just where the conversation went.

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob The best parliament is a hung Parliament.  It's about cooperation, not one vying for absolute power. This is why I'll never refer to Labour as being a socialist party, because they support a voting system that benefits the few, not the many.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willhquick @OwainAlty I cannot knowingly vote for them while they waste nearly 10% of the time we have left arguing about bloody brexit. We're in a much stronger position to impact the climate crisis in the EU than we are out of it. My conscious won't allow me to vote for Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willhquick @OwainAlty Especially not with their current stand on brexit. We will still be arguing over brexit when we're burning to death in summer, drowning in autumn &amp; spring, and swinging between mild and freezing winters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willhquick @OwainAlty We have 11 years to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis. We're never going to stop it, it's already happening. And that's not prep stuff over the next 11 years, that's actually doing it between now and then. It needs to be a Green Revolution, but Labour doesn't cut it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willhquick @OwainAlty My opinion is that is it. I have more online attacks from Labour supporters than Tory. For a party that claims to be socialist, they refuse PR. For a party that's claimed to be greener than the Greens, they've back out on 2030 pledges. I live under a labour dictatorship, so yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwainAlty I cannot knowingly vote for a party where Brexit might still happen. I have to vote with my heart, and vote Green.  Like I'm sure many Remain Labour supporters who disagree with Corbyn will.  Thanks to FPTP, Labour won't lose based on my 1 vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwainAlty I've been getting pushed this evening to vote Labour in my constituency because the current Labour MP is "worried" that she will lose her seat. We're at a state where for me, voting Labour is as bad as voting Tory. They support a form of Brexit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heyitscamblack @chelle2002 @BrassHammer @HIndexer @mrjamesob 1. Learn to create a thread. It's not hard. 2. Corbyn is literally applying for the job of Prime Minister.

<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds @TheGreenParty Why are you using Labour as an argument against the GPs stand on halal &amp; kosher?   You've also not remarked on the Tories legacy with fox hunting, the burning and draining of moorlands for grouse shoots, nor the illegal perseuctit of birds of prey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds @TheGreenParty I thought so, nothing to do with the slaughter of farm animals. But heres our policy on BSL  https://t.co/mIIskG1Att<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds @TheGreenParty Can you elaborate on BSL? I don't know that acronym in this context. The policy isn't solely about proper labeling, it's about working with different religions to provide more humane deaths.

<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds @TheGreenParty  https://t.co/mbnR8alerd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds @TheGreenParty Wow!  Maybe you should read up on our animal rights policies, and then compare them to your Tory policies and see who comes out on top. And if you think that halal is worse than western slaughter, then I recommend you visit a slaughterhouse to see what they're really like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterTatchell @UKLabour @MakeVotesMatter So much for calling them a socialist party, even they won't allow all the peoples choices to be taken into account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Friendbearx @carriesymonds There's no choice for the voter under FPTP. To think Johnson cares about anyone or anything else is a fallacy. The man doesn't even know how many kids he's got, so he won't push through any of these. He's #LiarJohnson for a reason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lobjob @_IsaacHunt @EmmaKennedy @davidschneider @beatieedney They were going to protect freedom of movement, but now they're not, so in a deal they would have to leave the single market, but they've said that would be catastrophic for the economy and jobs - it really is on the fence!

<|startoftext|>@BullshM @MarkBurnettLD @Ali3Mctavish @ArchaicNonsense @Amelia_Womack @TheGreenParty @RemainerNow As demonstrated earlier, many people didn't know what the EU was before voting, many more people regreted their vote for Leaving because they didn't receive the correct information from either side.

<|startoftext|>@simondebrux @lewis_goodall Exactly! He's has every sodding opportunity, but he's just not bothered getting up off that fence - every single time!

<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @TheGreenParty @jon_bartley Well, unless you're the head honcho at the NHS and can do something about it, you're stuck aren't you.  And you should go on holiday, it'll do you a world of good instead of getting angry behind your little brexit computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @TheGreenParty @jon_bartley How do you expect the NHS to function without EU nationals as doctors and nurses?   Also, quick question, where do you go on holiday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @TheGreenParty @jon_bartley No, you want to end migration of a migratory species - you think leaving the EU will stop every other nation from coming in, I'm merely explaining why you're wrong. The country is 68.5 million people. 200k is a drop in the ocean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @TheGreenParty @jon_bartley Also, humans are a migratory species. Thats how we've come to inhabit every continent. Without migration, you wouldn't have that profile image of yours - Buddha, is a eastern god. So you're happy to take what suits your agenda?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CyrusPeroz @PavelVlasov1902 @CarolineLucas @TheGreenParty Have you spent time to read the GP policy &amp; the supporting docs?

<|startoftext|>@CyrusPeroz @PavelVlasov1902 @CarolineLucas @TheGreenParty The number one action by the UK, that will work to mitigate the impact of Climate Change is remaining in the EU.

<|startoftext|>@MattAsAHatter @MollyMEP I totally get that, but the first thing they should have done was have a new leader. Corbyn is far too divisive for both remainers and leavers.  When papers are calling him a Marxist, you're never going to get that Leave support. They needed a centrist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattAsAHatter @MollyMEP Labour could have made a pact in Stroud for example, to assure the seat wasn't so marginal when it came to the vote. I'll never understand for a party that claims to be socialist, that they don't want to work with other parties. I find it madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattAsAHatter @MollyMEP This is why this should have always been a 2nd referendum and not a general election. People can't vote for the changes they want to see - confined by the options of remain or leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattAsAHatter @MollyMEP IF we get a second referendum with Labour. I wouldn't trust Corbyn as far as I can throw him. He's had opportunity after opportunity to act, and he's still not done anything. If this is what McCluskey is saying, then it makes me wonder what else they're saying behind closed doors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CurtisMorgan_ @Omi_233 @HumanOceans @CarolineLucas Not at all. Green New Deal isn't UK specific, the Greens are part of a network of @globalgreens so for impact, it's Greens all the way.

<|startoftext|>@Omi_233 @CurtisMorgan_ @HumanOceans @CarolineLucas Considering the Green New Deal was conceived and written by Caroline Lucas a decade ago with a couple others, then Labour are late to the party, have somewhat adopted it but then still promote airport expansion, there just isn't any consistency in what they're preaching.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sleighbrokedown @snickletweet @MagicMagid Agree. Trade deals are a bigger deterrent than Trident. Climate change is a bigger threat to those countries than Trident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimJimmehyo @MagicMagid But they have more missiles and bigger missiles. Trident really isn't that much of a deterrent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomskibg @MagicMagid @sianberry The only use of trident is as a reactionary weapon.    For example, Russian or China or the US wipes out the UK, so the trident missile is then deployed.   The damage would already have been done. It's not a deterrent. They've got bigger missiles and more of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Do you need to have a cup of tea and a lie down? I think you're getting quite worked up over this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @UKLabour I previously said " LibDems policy wants fracking banned EU wide. Don't mistake Jo Swinson for the whole party."  Which is exactly what you did. You assumed Swinson' actions for the whole party; so I counteracted with your logic for a statement to demonstrate its lunacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Jewish Labour have made the accusation of anti-Semitism within the party. Not me.  Are you really going to go through policy by policy where LibDems and Greens differ?  Because you might have all the time in the world, but I've got an actual job to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Also,  https://t.co/B7cCGgz65a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @UKLabour Context, Hun. People need to read the thread and understand your actions and how the statement is actually a reflection of your behaviour.   Also, quote tweeting? Calling on a labour account to help because you're so inept you can't have a discussion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Prove it - show me the docs &amp; transactions that prove that statement. The onus is on you to demonstrate your accusation.   And yes, you're the hypocrite.  Also, quote tweeting someone and a call to arms from your cronies, is trolling. It demonstrates you don't have an argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Says the person who started smearing other people. You're a hypocrite. You might want to take your judging eye on your own party before attacking others.  When Corbyn loses this election, that will be his legacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's good for you that kids can't vote, isn't it you absolute kook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty Protect the middle class from socialism? What are you on about? The Greens are a socialist party. In fact, UBI was taken from GP policy.   Ok then by that account, Corybn is a raving anti-Semite which is why he's not actually dealt with the growing issue in his own party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMJo1 @TheGreenParty I'm also a GP wildlife &amp; habitats policy writer. LibDems policy wants fracking banned EU wide.   Don't mistake Jo Swinson for the whole party.  It's like saying the whole of Labour are utterly incompetent because Corbyn.  Labours "green" manifesto is greenwashing at best.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcgt06part2 @ivewire @MagicMagid @joswinson I'd love Lucas to be PM that's not going to happen any time soon, due to the current voting system.

<|startoftext|>@mcgt06part2 @ivewire @MagicMagid @joswinson Clean energy will take over and render fracking pointless by the time they've sold that one.  In terms of current political leaders and their personal gains, I'd rather deal with Swinson than Johnson or Farage (not that he's standing, but he always manages to profit).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcgt06part2 @ivewire @MagicMagid @joswinson It's banned until they (Cuadrilla &amp; other fracking corps) can prove its safe (ie minimal to no seismic activity). Which they can't.  As for her funding, I don't know about that. LibDems do want an EU wide ban on fracking, so Swinson should be policy above personal gains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcgt06part2 @ivewire @MagicMagid @joswinson Fracking is banned now, so we dont have to worry about that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ahmed_dossa @IanBailez755 @ToryFibs @LawrieJohnston That's because Pro-Brexit voters still admir and respect what Johnson has been trying to do (and the Daily Heil narrative isn't to mention the illegal activities he's been up to). Meanwhile, Remainers are waiting tirelessly for Corbyn &amp; Labour to actually do something of merit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahmed_dossa @IanBailez755 @ToryFibs @LawrieJohnston He's trailing Johnson by 17%!!  Labour are polling at 26% and Tories are at 38% (politico 2.11.19).  He should have had this in the bag ages ago, but nothing. It's time he said 'I can't bring this country together' and stood aside for someone who can -- like Starmer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaleBlueDotBen @mrjamesob Nah, waterfalls.

<|startoftext|>@unicornthejayne @fluffybubbles73 @mattzarb @Cllrjfahy No, he said he will make a 'better' deal (which is a misnomer as nothing is better for the country than remaining) and then offer the Labour deal and remain as part of a public vote.  What he hasn't discussed is which one he's going to back during that campaign. Can't do both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattzarb I'm glad Bernie's impressed with what Corbyn's done, because as far as I can see, he's tended his tomato plants and sat on some trains.

<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy @drmarielouise Tbh, I can't comment on that, BC I don't know that case. However, it doesn't sound like the action of the main party.

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn So you're going to renegotiate a Brexit deal, that's been negotiated twice before, and then you're going to offer a vote on your deal or Remain?

<|startoftext|>@karma_galore I know. I was trying to make a point that quote tweeting is such a hideous tool to try and belittle and patronise the person you're trying to have a discussion or debate with, not least the use of the word bitch - I hate name calling and wouldn't do it personally in a discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse Wow! Just wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 It's funny how you quote tweet, you have no self identifying information on your profile, apart from an angry mare.  I have a research masters in conservation biology, so please don't patronise me because you cannot have a grown up debate. Chill your bean, Hun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have two (2) degrees in conservation biology and this bitch can't handle a discussion on controversial opinions, so she quote tweets. Girl, passive aggressive much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 I have never once said humans should be killed off! That's you projecting your misinformation and assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 I actually don't think you know nearly enough about mosquitoes to have an argument for or against my statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 If you read my original tweet, you would see that I actually said overpopulation and exploitation of natural resources. No other species has caused damage to the earth akin to what humans have caused. That's a fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 Human overpopulation is a major issue. Ever heard of carrying capacity? I highly recommend you research around the subject. Also, this thread stems from 'controversial opinion'. I've given mine (based on scientific fact and reasoning), and you've countered it with emotion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lookin4porpoise @yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 Just because there are some extraordinary humans who have propelled humanity forward, doesn't mean the whole species is extraordinary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lookin4porpoise @yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 Actually what you have said shows that you think humans are a superior species. I wouldn't say humans are extraordinary amongst animals at all. There are ravens more intelligent than some humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lookin4porpoise @yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 Again, you're seeing humans as separate from the natural world.  Do infant animals of any other species die due to disease? Yes.  Do you demonstrate the outrage for them as you do humans? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lookin4porpoise @yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 There is more to life on earth than humans. Humans are not superior, they're not separate from the natural world, but it's attitudes like yours that would see the ultimate end of humanity and every other species with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lookin4porpoise @yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 Did I say anything about getting rid of mosquito nets? Did I say anything about stopping medication, malaria tablets or treatment? No. Don't fill in the blanks with your bias &amp; misinformation. The eradication of mosquitoes is horrific as they're a key food source for many species<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DennyRun @FeministAgain @CDReisswriter @RobHaines905 @KevinBiaggini @StefanMolyneux You literally sound like the creep that everyone is trying to avoid by carrying keys as weapons.

<|startoftext|>@menageriegirl @PeterEgan6 There are those that have to have meat in their diets - I wouldn't deny them. someone I volunteered with, his daughter had bowel cancer, and lost a large part of her intestines to it. Her body cannot hold or digest the bulk of  fruit &amp; veg thayts needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@menageriegirl @PeterEgan6 For me, I decided that if I couldn't raise the animal myself, slaughter it humanely, then butcher, prepare, cook and then eat it, I had no right to eat any animal. I've studied farm animal management, I still couldn't do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@menageriegirl @PeterEgan6 Not to mention milk that comes from a farm that actively participates in the badger cull. It's also the male calf's that get shipped off to veil farms, if they're not shot on sight first. So really, your choice is far ranging. If you rear &amp; slaughter your own, that's different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@menageriegirl @PeterEgan6 There are firstly the animal/s that you purchase a piece of, the transportation, slaughter, and in some cases the horrific conditions they've spent their life in. It's also the impact of feed and where that gets imported from (not everything is grass fed) - like the Amazon fires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@menageriegirl @PeterEgan6 Firstly, being vegan isn't a belief. People are vegan for a myriad of reasons, such as health, animal welfare or environmental. All verifiable facts, no god needed.  Your choice to eat meat is your choice. However, it impacts more than just the single use plastic you buy it in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dairylea I think you want to be a bit more specific with your targeted advertising. As a vegan, this is utterly wasted on me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katsgardens @Botanygeek It how about we start with improving animal welfare, and people start seeing it as a luxury item not essential. We can reduce the number of animal farms and use the tax on meat to fund crop.farming on ex-animal farm land. We would also start saving money on the NHS with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yomanshouse @BobSingleton_59 @matthaig1 The biggest threat to the planet is overpopulation, exploitation of natural resources, habitat &amp; species loss - humans are the cause of the 6th mass extinction. It's an incontrovertible fact.  Bill Gates projects to eradicate mosquitoes is one of the gravest mistakes ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry What I do find interesting is if (and when) they lose the election, and are unable to even form a coalition, they'll still have to pay up as the anti-tax avoidance directive comes into effect. So not 100% sure what their strategy is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tesseri I don't think it is damaging either; they actually discussed this very think on R4 yesterday. It appears as though the ERG were more likely to listen to Johnson, than they were May.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesseri There's nothing yet to say Johnson's deal is any different from May's. As far as I'm concerned, they're as incompetent as each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewKForrest @Mathew45 @matthaig1 The focus is on the word attack. He didn't attack anyone. Inconveniencing people isn't attacking.  I don't agree what he did, but he didn't attack anyone but it did result in getting his head kicked in - he was literally attacked for inconveniencing people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking it's the same May deal, except the EU just spoke a bit slower and louder until he understood it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewKForrest @Mathew45 @matthaig1 Did this man standing on the roof of the train indiscriminately attack commuters?   Rosa Parks refused to move.   Why are you condoning violence?   Would you rather see the planet burn? Because if we allowed that to happen, noone could get to work on time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mathew45 @DrewKForrest @matthaig1 Exactly! Rosa Parks politely got out the way to demonstrate her cause!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 As idiotic as it is to stand atop a commuter train, I find it appalling and sickening that people would react by kicking someone's head in.

<|startoftext|>@gibb_dave @mahatir_pasha I'm not condoning standing on a tube train. That's idiotic and defeats the objective of XR.

<|startoftext|>@NeilPugh5 @Robbie_Wallis1 @IanDunt 1. If you were being pulled by the ankle from a height, you would kick out.

<|startoftext|>@adrian_armitage @berniespofforth @cww007 As a conservationist, we need to have no fish zones, we need more marine conservation zones and we need to leave fish stocks alone! Conservation and consumption don't go hand in hand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline There really isn't the support you think there is. You actually have to go out there and find real life examples, not just quote a gov website. I know plenty of people who I studied with and on other courses who have been unable to get PhD funding due to Brexit. That's reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline A number of them I've looked at have had reduced headcounts and full funding availability is difficult and highly competitive to come by.  My options have been taken away from me, through no choice of mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Because SLC isn't there for postgraduate funding. UK scientific research is heavily funded by the EU. the UK is already seeing a 'brain drain' as EU scientists are moving. Not only does this impact research &amp; funding, but availability of PhDs too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline So you're arguing with a tweet from EU nurses saying they're understaffed, and you're arguing with the stats that state that 5000 nurses have already left from a more recent article?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Funny how you want an answe now.  Dual nationality - born of Freedom of Movement. Family in two countries has caused divide.

<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Brexit for me is personal, so yes my question to you is what the EU has ever done to you that has negatively impacted your life? Because Brexit has already negatively impacted mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline "Almost 5,000 nurses and midwives from EU27 countries have quit the NHS in the past two years, with many of those identifying Brexit as the trigger."   I'm a research scientist, it's not me who isn't grasping the data!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Not at all. You've failed to answer a simple question on 4 occasions. I asked on here because you're selective over what you're choosing to answer and this one you are.  With that, do you not thing the FT equivalent stats are concerning? Especially when considering waiting times?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Whose trying to scare people to remain?  And on that, what actual harm is there in staying in the EU? As I've said previously, the UK was the sick and poor man or Europe prior to joining the EEC.   Making shit up is entirely different from predictions! See the difference?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline You clearly are cherry picking. You've failed to mention nurses, when I've referred to them on several occasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline You have still - for the third time of asking - failed to say what the EU has actually ever done to you that has negatively impacted your life. Are you ever going to answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline The UK has a much more complicated relationship so naturally will take longer.   https://t.co/DOUh673Vbt   https://t.co/ih6oj0MEji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline Have we left the EU yet? No. It's called projection. And I've just shared a link about how 5000 nurses have already left.  Are you going to become a nurse or care worker to take up the slack?  It took 7 years to negotiate the Canada+ deal which Boris is currently referring to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline I'm not saying it's fake. There are ways that stats can be presented to tell the story you want.   https://t.co/SR0Nveg3KB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline They, including this lady, have been legal for 20+ years then people like you change the goalposts and don't give a shit.

<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline It's not 2 years. The impact of negotiating trade deals, including social care, medicines, and research will impact the UK for at least the next 10.  How is the UK meant to mitigate that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline It's a tweet by a political party, not from an official Department of Health twitter page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline Wow! 300!! Do you think it's anywhere near enough? Or if they're going to be trained in time for a No Deal?!!   https://t.co/GGxLRkpaSZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline I've asked for the original resource material, not a screenshot.  What the NHS on their website can easily be manipulated but Pro-Leave/Brexit websites. It's basic! Which website did you get that screenshot from, because it's not from a UK gov website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 So @HughFW can change EU fisheries legislation from a TV campaign, but Farage who is paid to discuss and write the legislation, can't?  Wow! I'm not surprised you hate the EU if you think that's what they do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline So you listen to stories like hers and not give a flying fuck?   https://t.co/WlNvhE5V7Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline So you're referencing something from 2 years ago, that compares data to 9 years ago, as a way to predict how many doctors the UK will have after Brexit?  That's clearly not from the NHS website, so if you'd like to share the actual reference we can look at legitimacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 They're there to discuss and negotiate. To think they have no purpose whatsoever, is to say that Farage actually turns up and does his job. It's a total fallacy.   You still haven't said what the EU has ever done to you that has so negatively impacted your life. Can you answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline Do you have an inability for form a thread on Twitter??   There already is a shortage of doctors and nurses, and there are more to follow - are you not aware of Settled Status applications and EU nationals moving out of the UK??   https://t.co/z3FCCEluOY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 My word! The EU doesn't supercede the sovereignty of the UK! It's not forced into anything &amp; the UK can use vetos!  We vote for MEPs, they speak on behalf of the UK. Farage attended 1 meeting out of 42 for the Fisheries Committee, thats when we need to change the MEP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @paulrey99 @spikedonline They don't need to do anything. The UK will be an inconsequential blip on the map.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline Noticed you didn't answer this one @PJBinghamF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline So you don't want foreigners living here, you just want their money?? Also, the UK will have to become a tax haven - that's exactly why Brexiters like Farage and Rees-Mogg want the UK out of the EU.<|endoftext|>

Not quite!  https://t.co/Kje6AoXj9f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline What exactly has the EU ever done to you to so negatively impact your life? Really??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline Financial services are moving to mainland Europe, call centres are moving to Ireland. Even Pro-Brexit Dyson has moved his operations to Malaysia!  The UK will suffer - food shortages, medical supply shortages, a shortage of doctors, nurses, teachers, researchers and academics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @paulrey99 @Shandy_al @spikedonline You do know the UK was the poor, sick man of Europe before it joined the EEC in 1975?   What exactly do you think the UK has to offer the rest of the world post-No Deal?  It's no longer a country of manufacturing, and what little there is would have an additional 40% WTO on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @BorderSolution_ @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 I don't think you've ever been in an negotiation. That's simply not how it works in normal life, and definitely not when you're trying to negotiate the future of an entire country!   I'd highly recommend you watch @thegreathackdoc on Netflix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 You mean you're happy to not pay a bill? Would you do that in your own life?

<|startoftext|>@paulrey99 @PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline But Boris hasn't proposed a new deal. They've just crossed some stuff out and wrote Canada+. That's not a proposal or negotiating strategy. Would you rather accept any deal or no deal, rather than remaining?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBinghamF @Shandy_al @spikedonline @paulrey99 So you don't think the EU should have the interests of TWENTY SEVEN other countries at the heart of their negotiations?

<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil If you've read anything I've written you'd see that I'm not defending the council - I abhor the labour dictatorship I live under.

<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil Not where they've sprayed on the beach what?  So you think just allowing it to stay would be totally fine and it would never become an issue for the local flora and fauna?

<|startoftext|>@jtwebb @davidlharrison @chrisshields10 @DBFole13 @CHIMPSINSOCKS @JamesMelville Yea, but there's a lot of Brexiters that would refuse to pay it, travel anyway, and would stand in a queue in the airport demanding to be let in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil I disagree. We have sensitive flora and fauna along the North Wirral Foreshore, and due to the impact S.angelica has had across the estuary (Parkgate to  beyond Burton) it has to be controlled. Glyphosate is idiotic. However it needed removing for conservation, not aesthethics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil Didn't say it wasn't a native species, just that it was introduced to the Dee in the 1920s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This goes for spraying #glyphosate on everything too, @WirralCouncil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil It's presence in Hoylake is away from that wetland area though, along the North Wirral Foreshore. There are plenty of ways to remove it that don't include glyphosate or spraying chemicals. Plenty of volunteer groups, for example. The Labour ruled council are pathetic at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyH19852 @WirralCouncil Spartina is an introduced species. It was introduced on the north Wales coastline many years ago, but never took. It did however, make it's way to the English side of the Dee and accelerated successional growth. It has also assisted with wetland creation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@07glen @colinwforster @Levisonwood @PlaneTicketAway @JuliaHB1 @HansRosling Humans are the cause of the climate and ecological breakdown.  Do you honestly think wildlife doesn't burn to death in wildfires, drown in floods, or dehydrate because they can't walk ant further for water?   https://t.co/sWt3c6jjZz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyDing42 @Levisonwood @PlaneTicketAway @JuliaHB1 @HansRosling I'm always curious what people like you would do when we see that decrease? Would you sit there and think 'well, that's tough shit - at least it's not impacting me' or would you think 'we had an opportunity to do something to prevent that suffering'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyDing42 @Levisonwood @PlaneTicketAway @JuliaHB1 @HansRosling Seriously?  https://t.co/I2k5K2euWj  You are aware that with ant exponential growth (as can be seen in humans) always has an exponential decrease - humans consumption far outstrips what the earth can produce. We've already gone passed our Overshoot day  https://t.co/cV7aq7mRdD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinwforster @Levisonwood @PlaneTicketAway @JuliaHB1 @HansRosling Do you think droughts, wildfires and floods only impact humans? Or do you recognise that humans aren't the only species on earth, and we have a responsibility (due to our direct &amp; indirect actions) to ensure all species have the chance to survive &amp; thrive in their environment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinwforster @Levisonwood @PlaneTicketAway @JuliaHB1 @HansRosling All of them. Evolution is about the adaptation to change environments &amp; pressures. Warming global temperatures - even 1.5c on pre-industrial levels - doesn't allow time for that adaptation within species or niches. There are keystone species - if they go, everything else does too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sussexsaint72 I found a bee, and rather than give him sugar water (which I didn't have any of), it was quite a cool, windy day. So I just kept him on my hands for a few minutes to warm up.  He got a bit more active, took a massive shit and flew away!  Happy bee, messy hand!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PacificStand So for reusable bags in shops, I'd guarantee more men would rather struggle carrying their shopping than just putting it into a sodding bag!  If straight men were as secure about their 'straightness' as gay men were about their sexuality, then they would just get on with shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PacificStand I used to work in bag shop. We had lots of really nice men's leather bags (go vegan kids!). Rarely did we have men come in looking for a new bag.  They didn't want to come across as gay for having a bag. It's like, some point after school, college or uni, suddenly bags became gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher Greens should stand up for what we want. Now is not the time for compromise when the health of the planet, and the future of the UK is so gravely under threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher However, the stance of LDs has changed that markedly. There appears ever more to be a lack of wanting an actual collaboration. We're more likely than ever to have a hung parliament if a GE was triggered, &amp; yet I have no idea who would work together, bc they're out for themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher I agree. Previously, I have been very much pro-alliance for tactical reasons. I, and I think many Greens are policy above party - as long as we get the changes we're after, what does it matter how it happened.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a child of Freedom of Movement, I love the EU because I am a European.  It is my birthright, and it is my identity.  It gave me life, freedom, opportunity, and family. It gives me security and it is my future. The EU is by no means perfect, but no family is.<|endoftext|>
