<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS You are deflecting.  You, the great defender of Dear Leader must tell me wtf that transcript is supposed to mean!  Or do you agree he was snorting Aderrall that day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 Funny you mention Blessed Mother!  I don't believe in the Church, but you can never take Mary out of a Catholic!  I come from a very large Irish family, boy the Hail Mary's we did on our knees! Lol, I believe we converted the Russians back in the 60's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS You like what he says.  I get it now...America First.  https://t.co/Q1HtrhWUzm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS Oh, you like what he says.. Gotta read this actual transcript and tell me what he means please.  https://t.co/PLo2I32qlp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 You just can't face the fact you are just in another cult!  Now it's tRump and his whole grifting family!  Like wtf is the whole gang doing ruining the country?  Who voted for them?    Only mobsters bring in the family, cause they don't cough up the goods!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 So you seem to be okay with all the abuse the church has been hiding and the millions they've paid out to victims?  Like I said before, I was "raised Catholic" Im no longer a sheep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 Lol, restorting to religious icons!!    Lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 I can't stand the hypocracy if the Catholic church AND Trump supporters. Those talibangelicals are the WORST!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 oh give it up!!  I was raised Catholic, does that sooth your hurt feelings?  I don't give a damn what the "CHURCH" thinks, I think for myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 find the tape with Howard Stern and see what he says about Marla Maples pregnancy!  Trumpsuckers; "oh, but that was before he was saved" or some other BS  and as I said earlier, I'm not president - my moral compass is not important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 that's how they get you in the cult  The abortion issue!  I'm not concerned with cells and I'm Catholic.  Women need to make their own choice. The right loves to use the "butcher" word.  I can almost guarantee BLOTUS has paid for several abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS that's the kool-aid talking.  He hasn't changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 can you see their lips moving - or not moving?  nothing so blind as a #TrumpSupporters<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS And your bullshit memes mean nothing.  Unless you have credible information on this dress bs don't waste my time.   On another note, at least its not a skin dress!  Lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS Why would they still have an A rating?   Perhaps it's where you get your information from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryTrue4 @andrewwgold @FLOTUS not anger, I am just LMFAO SO LOUD right now at the knots you #trumpsuckers tie yourselves into for that moron.  The simple truth is they are BOTH PIGS!   Get over it - you should be used to it by now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TitaniumArtNerd @AimeeHiHo @spottedTB @JoyceWhiteVance do you do the same with down comforters?  Mine says dry clean only (after 5 years)  There are no dry cleaners in my small town.  I put it out in the sun shine every weekend that it's not raining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DmJ43 @JoyceWhiteVance probably because they were feather pillows back then!  I only use feather and never wash them - sun bathe them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance I should add, they only last about 2 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance I love feather pillows, so they don't get washed.  I wash the protectors once a month and pillow cases weekly.  Feather pillows go out in the sun once a month - or the dryer for a tumble.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoudiniObama No Go Fund Me, no bankrupcty, not even an ambulance bill, which in Ontario if you call an ambulance you get a $45 bill. They did have to pay for their flights home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoudiniObama A weeks stay at the BEST hospital, round the clock visits from every specialist imaginable, both parents every need imaginable was tended to!  ZERO COST! Best part, to see them now...it's like it never happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoudiniObama Each child had to have a full EMS team on board and room for both parents.  They got two planes in 2 hours. These 2 and 3 yr old children had MRI's, consults with neuro surgeons, cat scans before 8 pm same night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoudiniObama Two of my grandchildren were in a horrible accident 4 months ago. This tiny town in the middle of nowhere had two Dr's and a whole team tend to them.  They had to call air ambulance to get them to the BEST care possible (both fractured skulls).  It was 13 hours away by ambulance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoudiniObama LMFAO SO LOUD RIGHT NOW!  Can you not even see the irony in your weak tweets?  This all started with "you Canadians mind your own business". Now here YOU are telling ME how our health system works!  I am fucking dead! #magamorons Ha ha ha ha ha ha HAH!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GlassButterfly9 @mamba_bad I've had the odd reaction also.  I dont trust ANYONES weed even dispencery stuff.  My trick...NO BUDS.  HUBBY N I grew 2 plants the day it became legal and we only smoke the leaves.  We use buds for medicinal oil- topical only<|endoftext|>
