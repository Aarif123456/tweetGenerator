<|startoftext|>This isn’t fighting @foxandfriends - it’s #sedition. The majority of the country wants #Trump gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No problem. Withhold #BlueStateTaxRevenue from #RedStates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #riot by #DomesticTerrorists. Where’s the #NationalGuard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump has been reduced to an ever decreasing #vocabulary to encourage #Insurrection by his base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m only seeing #ProudBoys violence. But yes - the #NationalGuard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the #NationalGuard? @realDonaldTrump MUST be called out for #sedition and calling for #insurrection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who protest against #ProudBoys aren’t #Antifa - they’re against #fascism. #Antifa is being used as an other by a wannabe dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one has ever canceled #Christmas #GymnasiumJordan. #Sedition #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - Isn’t this #vandalism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call out the #NationalGuard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s the #NationalGuard? #Police? #TrumpsSecretPolice? Or are these the official #GOPBrownshirts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ - I am disgusted by this editorial by #JosephEpstein. #PharmD is addressed as Dr. #Cardiologists don’t deliver children. #Misogynist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ - How do you feel about #DrShiva?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I pay a premium per year for @amazonprimenow but they make sure I have to rent beloved #classics. #FU @JeffBezos and #AmazonPrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got 7 million votes LESS than #JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank-you #Pfizer #Moderna and #DrFauci! @realDonaldTrump FAILED to buy enough #vaccine. #Masks best to decrease cases while you #demonize!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You already packed the court @realDonaldTrump. You’re gone in 40 days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. Maybe we should start wearing #RepublicanSnowflakeTears t-shirts!  https://t.co/lC3J10VOPF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I knew that an #election could be overturned then I would have sued to declare #HillaryClinton president! #TyrannyOfTheMinority<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Way to go #asshole. #FDA poised to approve #vaccine but you had to threaten the head anyway to look tough. #LoserOfTheYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMichaelWaltz - #Seditious #POS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t support #ApartheidIsrael. Fun fact - they get free healthcare. That 2.2 billion would go a long way for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention that there were witness with #BrandonBernard at a gathering at the time of the murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm - wonder what the difference is? #BrandonBernard is just the latest casualty in #TrumpsMassMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still less than 81 million!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GymnasiumJordan is one of the #Seditious106 who wants #VoterSuppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see #Trump is now retweeting #Newsmax. These guys are even more virulent than #Fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screwed over multiple #allies, praised #dictators, interfered in other countries’ affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could have furthered the effort but refused the offer of more #vaccines @realDonaldTrump. #Masks save lives yet you’re against.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want a #POTUS who won’t kill the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @Twitter should block @realDonaldTrump. He really is a #ClearAndPresentDanger to #America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow - 71 million people support the #LoserOfTheYear and the #BiggestBaby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations on your win @realDonaldTrump! #LoserOfTheYear #DerSpiegel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone of these people should be awarded the #PresidentialMedalOfFreedim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s how we achieve #HerdImmunity without killing hundreds of thousands more #Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why #Trump MST be prosecuted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These #Pennsylvania reps want to take away your #vote. #Treason #Sedition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah by inappropriately recognizing that #Morocco owns #WestSahara. When he proclaim that #Palestine owns #WestBank and #Gaza?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepBuddyCarter and @RepRickAllen of #Georgia want to take their own #constituents right to vote away. @staceyabrams<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DarwinEffect - unfortunately he’s going to kill #Granny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonus @KenPaxtonTX is under #FBI investigation AND #indictment for #SecuritiesFraud and wants a #pardon. Fu*k @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter - #Trump is inciting an #insurrection with his lies. What are you going to do about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the #SeditiousSeventeen and 104 @HouseGOP signed on. #Trump is the symptom. @GOP is the #disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovin’ You by Minnie Ripperton. #WorstSongEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all #heroes wear #capes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone of these #mfr’s should be indicted for #deities and supporting a #coup.  @GOP is against the #Constitution. #FU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. And pardon everyone in #prison convicted of non-violent #marijuana offenses. It should have never been #illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorriseyWV So you’re concerned about #FederalOverreach and #StatesRights yet you want to take away #VotingRights of 4 states. #Sedition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so #AdverseEffects for the #COVID-19 can be tracked more easily. (Normal procedure for all new drugs).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a reminder, it’s also #FluSeason. Everyone needs to get their #FluShot. As a #pharmacist I’m hearing not to give #COVID &amp; #flu together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 qualities you lack along with most of the @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree @realDonaldTrump. They must throw out this #lawsuit. #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve had an illegitimate “president” for 4 years. No - @realDonaldTrump won due to antiquated #ElectoralCollege. He is #incompetent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lies and #BS. You’re just pissed he’s not participating in the #coup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter - False<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Threats of #violence because of @realDonaldTrump   @Twitter - please flag. Or suspend @realDonaldTrump. He’s going to get someone killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>81 million of us agree. Stop the #coup and the #sedition @realDonaldTrump. Stop inciting violence.  @Twitter - please flag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IvankaTrump received #Chinese #trademarks for #VotingMachines. Was that ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FACT: #Trump has lost 50 lawsuits including in courts with #Republican judges Multiple recounts showed no #fraud Why 4 swing states only?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JoeBidens #AG can dismiss. Just more waste of #taxpayer $! @alexbruesewitz should b investigated 2 see why he’s trying 2 #subvert #election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is stealing 81 million #votes not #sedition? @realDonaldTrump has NO respect for the #Constitution. How much #taxpayer $ is being wasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s not for you to do. Are we selling arms to #Morocco?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re doing their job. You’re not @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Votes have been #certified. It’s over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMoBrooks should be censured for #sedition along with @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debunked! #BS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter - please flag this. It has been debunked multiple times. #Trumps lies are leading to threats against public officials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did you run away?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lies and #BS. #NativeAmericans hate you with good reason. Despite @GOP attempted #disenfranchisement they turned out big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe or not @realDonaldTrump - people live in #RV’s. #Sedition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time to recognize #Palestinian #sovereignty over the #WestBank. Fair question - are we selling arms to #Morocco now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations @MassGovernor and @NYGovCuomo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Including #DrFauci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellemalkin BTW - We are learning and will be as more people get #vaccinated. Just as we do when ANY drug comes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellemalkin - Why do you fake “pro-life” people spout this nonsense? These trials are not just fast but ultra stringent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellemalkin - I’m a #pharmacist who just finished a week of education on the #COVID19 #vaccines through #ASHP (#pharmacists).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah - OUR money. #Trump and #Giuliani don’t deserve special treatment. We’re all equal under the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for the #Pro-Life president and party. They’re about #power #money and #death. #BrandonBernard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SherlockW_H 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were witnesses who were with #BrandonBernard at the time of the shooting. The world saw #KyleRittenhouse murder 2 people in cold blood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the account. #BrandonBernard didn’t kill anyone. He was brought in to help cover it up. His lawyers were incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s that about #socialism @GOP ? Oh right - it’s #GrandTheft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @GOP is about free markets - not Main Street #Americans. You are filth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @GOP - #American dream right now is putting food on the table &amp; not #evicted while #KellyLoeffler profits from deaths of #Georgians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday! 🎉🎁🎊🎈🎂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a #SuperSpreader event disguised as a #coup. Or vice versa. These guys should all be tried for #sedition and fomenting #violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another #CatMeme nails it! #CryBabyTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP is the new #Nazi party. Hey @SenThomTillis - start with #Trumps unauthorized use of #TomPetty #RollingStones and #VillagePeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KellyCantLead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #fake just like @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you trying to call for #insurrection  @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren’t you doing your job? Over 3000 dead today and it’s all about you promoting #sedition  @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is #sedition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Massachusetts and #NewYork and all the states that #PresidentElectBiden won should join in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mabh1832 - Thank-you for agreeing with me BTW. I think I was a flippant in my previous reply. Sorry - long day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Still waiting on #Trump’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mabh1832 ????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s fine. What’s not ok is when I force my views on you - and vice-versa. Congratulations BTW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s making hundreds of million$ off his supporters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC viewers would like to know why #Trump hasn’t released his #taxes. We’ll know soon enough! #PresidentElectBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My theory is that #Rethugs are focused on the #2020Agenda for the #CouncilForNationalPolucy. Essentially setting up a #TheocraticAutocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeChatfield -You #racist pig! You are punishing #RepCynthiaJohnson 4 pushing against a #racist #lynching threat! #RepublicansAreUnAmerican<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A mass of cells until that mass is viable outside Mom. My belief which is protected under the #1stAmendment. #WomensRightsAreHumanRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree - @CocaineDonny IS hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are recordings of #JeffSessions talking about separation as policy to deter border crossings. Hundreds of children #traumatized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So 2 #assholes get into a limousine -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadAccount150 Not at all. You have every right to disagree and have your own beliefs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/kg1ycIhGdm  After 4 years of doing the least of any #1stLady, #MelaniaTrump inquired about post-presidential funding and staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lost @realDonaldTrump by 7 million votes. Get over it and stop committing #sedition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good one! #crybabyTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you believe in caging actual #babies in cages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #1stAmendment protects us FROM #religion. I don’t believe that life begins at #conception. Majority of #Americans don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #zygote #blastocyst and #embryo is not a #baby. A #fetus may be viable at 6 months. It’s a baby once #born.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong. My ancestors the #Pilgrims survived bc #Wampanoags evacuated #Plymouth because of disease from #Europeans. They left farms behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Global numbers. That’s why #MMR &amp; other #vaccines are so important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP is allowing #Trump to screw #America. The party is dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you know #Trump is lying? He’s talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t be an #American and be against the #1stAmendment. Majority of #Americans don’t believe life begins at #conception. It’s our right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CollinsforGA - How’s the #COVID19 relief going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a #1stAmendment issue. U don’t believe in a womeans right 2 choose, I do. This #Baptist is pro-choice. Life doesn’t begin @ #conception<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany - yes. Quote verse where #Jesus came out against #abortion. Majority of #Americans don’t believe life begins @ #conception.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re not Pro-Choice then you’re against #WomensRightsAreHumanRights #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. For the people screaming about #ReligiousFreedom - #ProChoice is a #1stAmendment issue. I believe life doesn’t begin @ #conception<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump failed to purchase enough #vaccine to #immunize all #Americans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler - You profited from dead #Georgians. You’re an empty #InsideTraitor who isn’t fit for office. You have nothing to offer #Georgia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shame on you @GOP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMoBrooks - What date did @realDonaldTrump vote on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMoBrooks wants to throw out #ballots cast outside a 24 hour window. In a #pandemic. #Polling places closed. #USPS sabotaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction - @RepMoBrooks IS the #steal. The people have spoken! #Congress does NOT select a #President!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What is ur proof @RepMoBrooks? #Republican #governors &amp; #SecretariesOfState have done due diligence. Why do u want 2 #disenfranchise voters?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YOU LOST #LOSER! @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then #America will be screwed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone tweeted that #Trumps merry band of #Pentagon sycophants have contracted with war criminal #ErikPrince for an operation in #Africa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well - there ARE some newly fired DoD employees that know a shitload more than these clowns do there’s that... 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this where #ErikPrince is going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ErikPrince is a war criminal. What the hell is going on? Is this why #Biden is being blocked from #NSA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talk to @senatemajldr - he and the @SenateGOP don’t care about #Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I got out of that is that #Biden will be putting forth a bigger stimulus after being sworn in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice try @SteveScalise - #Rethugs have been sitting on the #HeroesAct since May. You just care about #corporations<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love the pic. #Sherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - You have no right to see those names. #Voting is private!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must be very afraid of what’s going to come out @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t you vote in #Florida while in #Washington @realDonaldTrump ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The widdlwist President. And a real one. #Trump #PresidentBarackObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So calling out @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump is grounds not to confirm #Tanden? Waaahhh!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So who was #bribing you for a #pardon @realDonaldTrump ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering your claims were #bogus @realDonaldTrump - this was the responsible thing to do. BTW - how’s the pardons going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump believes in the #DeathPenalty for mass murderers. Let’s start with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going with #LevParnas with #RudyGiuliani as the lawyer. My guess is Ghislaine Maxwell silence is enough for a #pardon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonDeSantisFL is a mass murderer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I - any guesses on the #PayToPlay #pardon ID’s? I’m guessing #RudyGiuliani on behalf of #LevParnas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this legal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to #AdamSchiff the new AG can end this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenAG needs to end this sham action by #JohnDurham and #BillBarr. I also want a full accounting of #taxpayer $ used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP is complicit in this. This is clearly #sedition and encouraging violence. #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BetseyDevos thinks that all money should go to her instead. Waaahhh!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Socialist? How many BILLION$ of #taxpayer money went to rich corporations? End the #oligarchy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKempGA - Are you planning to steal an election again? You’re up against #StaceyAbrams pal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure @MarshaBlackburn - he’ll takes back to the Democratic Republic that I love instead of being a #shithole country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Come on @realDonaldTrump - it’s time for #OperationWarpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so done with @GOP. They are undermining our #Republic. #Pigs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VeteransDay -And my Mom’s Dad who built ships 4 #USNavy during #WWII. My Dad’s Mom who was a #GrayLady. Compare that w/ #ShitstainTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this #VeteransDay - thank-you to my Dad who served in the #USNavy my uncle who served in the #USArmy my dad’s Dad who served in #WW1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably because #Trump doesn’t want to look like the #baby he was when he skipped out on #VeteransDay in France<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why was he late?  @WhiteHouse ? Rage tweeting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume - #HillaryClinton conceded on election night. Time for #TrumpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @Mike_Pence @KarenPence I was sick at the sight of #traitors at this event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone else get sick that a #traitor laid the wreath on the #TombOfTheUnknownSoldier?  #VeteransDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/u6pE66tqfF  Time to #tax #PaulaWhite and the rest of the frauds. At the very least she needs to return our #taxpayer money!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s beyond time for #FoxNews to be rebranded as #FoxHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump must be tried for #sedition along with anyone supporting him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WTF? @SecPompeo needs to refund #American #taxpayers for his #donor dinners!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - The #oligarchs love their corporate #socialism though. How muc #COVID19 bailout money did they receive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be clear - this ISN’T the Queen Landscaping Company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yayyyy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump - Don’t you have something better to do? I hear there’s a #virus going around &amp; you’re trying 2 end #healthcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bless her heart! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again #GrifterInChief is using #taxpayer money for his #campaign. Endorse the #HatchAct!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh - and #SDNY will still get his ass!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Each day #LameDuckDonald and  #MitchMcConnell pulls these #shenanigans is worth @ least 1000 votes for #RevRaphaelWarnock &amp; #JonOssof<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LouDobbs @RudyGiuliani @TomFitton @jasoninthehouse @RepVernonJones Because #Pfizer is a #pharmaceutical company not a #propaganda site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza #Lies. #Pfizer distanced itself from #Trump. Government is buying doses thru #OperationWarpSpeed. 2 totally different things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @pfizer @realDonaldTrump #Pfizer funded their own research. You’re just buying it. Stop taking credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts on #MarkEsper quitting: 1-#Trump wants to send troops to seize #ballots in #PA #WI #GA #AZ #MI 2-#Putins going to invade #Baltic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ResurrectTheRoseGarden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump - you must be so proud. #TrumpLost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - #Trump has nothing to do with this. #OperationWarpSpeed did NOT fund research. It IS buying #vaccine. What’s the plan 4 distribution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It failed in 2000 @SenatorCollins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr - You are a lying evil person. The ability for you to twist facts is breathtaking. #BidenWon. The world wants #Trump gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @HHSGov @DrLindaMD PURCHASING and funding research are 2 different things.  @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do w/the #vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle #Pfizer did not receive #OperationWarpSpeed funding for #research. They didn’t want anything to do with #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateGOP  @senatemajldr hate #Americans - unless they’re rich and powerful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump / You are a #cruel #incompetent clown. Do your job which is NOT trying to overturn an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr - Ur filth. U get world class healthcare 4 free while plotting 2 take #insurance from 7milllion #COVID19 pts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump What is an illegal vote? Are #military votes #legal? Only if for #Trump? YOU LOST!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump Here’s someone who can help you with this counting thing-   https://t.co/WifsVeWvRm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump - Eric -71 million less than 75 million. 279 electoral votes more than 214.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VoterFraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump knew he was going to lose in #October.  @GSAEmily needs to be subpoenaed ASAP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does #Trump have on you @GSAEmily ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PURCHASING #vaccine is different than receiving #funding 4 research. #Pfizer did this independently. @GOP &amp; #Trump r taking unearned credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump @dagenmcdowell #Lie. #Pfizer was not part of #OperationWarpSpeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @ewarren @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff - don’t allow #Trump 2 use #AirForceOne 4 rallies. How much of OUR money has he spent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HillaryClinton conceded on election night in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #MarkEsper quit. R u planning 2 send troops in 2 steal the #election? Let #Russia invade #BalticStates? #China &amp; #Taiwan?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump - #Liar. #Pfizer was not part of #WarpSpeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No voicemail @GSAEmily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle - #Pfizer was NOT part of #OperationWarpSpeed. Just another pathetic attempt by #Trump to take credit for work he didn’t do.  https://t.co/Ks6U3XXGWe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pfizer was NOT part of #OperationWarpSpeed. They stayed away from the #TrumpShitShow. As a RPh I will await the studies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The picture on the right reminds me of #ShaunOfTheLivingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #TrumpConcede<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SeparationOfChurchAndState<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaxTheChurch #TaxKennethCopeland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KennethCopeland needs to have his finances investigated. He’s the poster child for why #MegaChurches should be #taxed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank-you for posting this. You’re #unhinged. Now millions get to see it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m more interested in your #SecretChineseBankAccount and the fact you paid $187,000 more in #taxes to #China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump releases his version so he can spread lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The unedited version shows what a bumbling #idiot @realDonaldTrump is @DevinNunes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP - tell @senatemajldr to pass the #HeroesAct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP - You’re investigating #JoeBidens use of #Amtrack? How many taxpayer dollar$ r being burned up by @realDonaldTrump &amp; #AirForceOne?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We’re YOU wearing a #mask @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought it was $18,000 per month? That would be $216,000 per year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddsmoyer @ewarren Also - I prefer my real name to Twitter name. I’d rather my Twitter remains anonymous. Thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump taps the worst because he’s insecure. He’s no leader.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the 2nd time @GOPChairwoman has tried to spread this lie. @GOP is desperate and screaming for help from the #oligarchy &amp; #plutocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman - Didn’t your #UncleMitt teach you not to lie. #Taxes will go up for #corporations and income &gt; $400,000 as they should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman - You’re sadly our of touch. #JoeBiden pledged not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000. NOT 82%!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is right out of the #SovietUnion. #Putin probably suggested it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Most #COVID19 cases came from #Europe. You know they paused one #vaccine #trial?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #ObamaBiden inherited a #RepublicanRecession which was the worst since #depression until YOU tanked the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump wants #students to die so he can watch #college #football. #SELFISH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I’m watching u  #lie about ur disgracefully #incompetent actions. Forcing states 2 bid against each other then #FEMA stole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Laughable - @realDonaldTrump and the #TrumpCrimeFamily along with #Russian colluding @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is YOUR #America @realDonaldTrump. I also see you’ve included #BoogalooBois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - Shame on you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve always thought @realDonaldTrump approved if not ordered the #murder of #JamalKhashoggi (he was investigating #JaredKushner )<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well done to you and the #patriot who took down the #Trump bully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul - Why do you hate #Americans? Billions for #conmen posing as #religious figures even though they don’t pay #taxes? #FU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlRove - I expect #competence. Especially as #GrifterInChief has stolen hundreds of millions of #taxpayer $.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods - Who was #President? Not @JoeBiden. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied PS - stop embarrassing #RhodeIsland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KarlRove is responsible for the #ThrillaFromWasilla that sank #JohnMcCain’s presidential bid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#KarlRove has been irrelevant since he stormed down the halls of #FauxNews when #PresidentBarackObama was re-elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably more #BoogalooBois.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - What are you doing for #Americans being devastated by #fires? #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“The likes of which has never been seen” “It’s a disgrace” “No 1’s ever been able 2 do this”-same tired phrases from 80’s @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How about those #governors are more interested in #American lives? We know you aren’t!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump - You have presided over #Americas greatest decline. #BidenHarrisToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Stealing #American money.  We need a full investigation under #BidenHarris leadership and make him and his family pay it back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love the 3rd one. Complete #Cumberbitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget #cowardice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Louisville police only deploy their officers against sleeping women in their own homes? Time for the #Guard to kick #militia out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct me if I’m wrong but where in the #Gospel does #Jesus say #selfishness is a virtue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant! #Dumbkirk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Going all in on #racism I see. Because a #DraftDodging #pimp is more important than the #slaves who actually built #USA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Taxpayer money like #RoseGardenMassacre for a #campaign photo-op.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pathetic loser @realDonaldTrump is whining about the #Atlantic again and a private citizen. How many #Americans died today from #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - You prove again and again to the world what a #coward you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #cowardice.  @realDonaldTrump really needs to let go of #TheApprentice. It was as #fake as him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Last night I tweeted multiple times that for such a “Christian” #MikePence hates that #9thCommandment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m concerned that #HHS is manipulating data on #COVID19 cases and deaths. I hope someone is keeping track of the real numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought #Trump was going to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain in 2016? He failed. Why should we give him 4 more years? To fully #bankrupt #USA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a real #President. Now he needs to refute the lies from last night’s #lielapalooza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @Mike_Pence Freedom to discriminate. #Freedom to impose religious beliefs on others. Just like the #Taliban.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @realDonaldTrump - That’s 3 #murders due to #BoogalooBois. Are you going to designate them a #terrorist #Organization?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VP - YOU #LIE! #Trump locks #children in #cages. #Abortion is a #1stAmendment issue. #Fetus not viable until 20-24 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - #ChineseTradeWars are hurting #farmers. #Tariffs are taxes on #AMERICANS. #Publicschools should get #taxpayer money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VP - #Liar.  @JoeBiden specifically said he did NOT support #DefundPolice. You sir are a #FakeChristian.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BidenHarris2020 - That’s who I trust @VP. You screwed up the first 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - I wonder how accurate #COVID19 numbers are seeing as #CDC out of the loop. Don’t trust #JaredKushner #HHS database.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - Stop #lying about testing. Turn around time too long. Not enough #tests due to lack of supplies. Also #Trump wants #tests stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikePence - #JoeBiden is right. There’s no #miracle drug. Still not enough N95 #PPE’s. Millions stolen by #FEMA. No jobs saved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikePence - Stopping flights from #China did bupkus because #Trump ignored virus until #April. All your #COVID stories are lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikePence - Thou shalt not lie. Shame on you for lying. #TaxReform - benefited rich. Stop lying about jobs. 40 million lost their jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikePence - #VeteransChoice was signed by #PresidentBarackObama in 2014. Why do you &amp; #Trump keep trying to take credit? #Disgusting #Lies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MikePence just gave a pity shout-out to @realDonaldTrump for suffering so many attacks. Seriously? #Trump spent 8 years attacking #Obama<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Obama and #Biden tried to help with #transition - #Trump not interested. Ripped up #pandemic playbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell is lying about #Obama and #Biden. #Taxpayer owned #USPS #assets trashed? Cash to #Iran was theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell says with no irony he wants to protect #taxpayers. $150million + for #golf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump is live #tweeting the #RNC2020Convention. Not one tweet on #HurricaneLaura. But yeah - keeping #Americans safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every positive comment about #Trump and his #accomplishments are laughably false. The opposite is true. #RNC2020Convention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of self-awareness with the #RNC2020Convention is breathtaking. Every charge against #BidenHarris2020 is really #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are the #RevolutionaryAirports?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joniernst should remember that @GOP controlled #Senate vowed stymie #PresidentBarackObama 6 out of 8 years. Take up lack of action w/them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JoniErnst is speaking. She has plans to end #SocialSecurity and #Medicare. Just like @SenateGOP and #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not necessarily - #preexisting conditions could be available for #rich and #friends.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump -Are you going to denounce this outside #agitator? Are you going to label #BoogalooBois a #terrorist Organization?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Unfortunately the input varied from inaccurate to #racist and #classist. Just like you and your #CrimeFamily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The better to kill vulnerable people. #CDC #TrumpVirus #MassMurderer #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Replace #BrettKavanaugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Botox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I find it hysterical that all of the glowing reviews are from your toadies. How many books did @GOP buy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can’t wait to read it. #BoltonBook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screwdrivers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #detective and the #soldier. Nice! #Sherlock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump By putting your buddies #campaign donors and #MarALago club members in charge? #VetChoice under #PresidentObama<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This #despicable woman, identified by others as #LindsayClark, spewing racist shit. Seems like a real #disgusting human (alleged).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>24/7 on #Fox. I’m sick of seeing #attack ads accusing #JoeBiden of being soft on #China on #MSNBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_wycoff Also - #VoteOutTheGOP especially #RacistInChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_wycoff Take your phone everywhere. Public shaming leads to loss of #jobs and other negative effects. These #animals need to pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimguilfoyle @senatemajldr @FoxNews At $18,000 per month you should be excited!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So #FranklinGraham #PaulaWhite #JerryFalwellJr #KennethCopeland #RobertJeffress eat al #endorse this. Some “Christians”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @Franklin_Graham. The #1stAmendment protects us from your #phoney “Christianity” based on #discrimination. #SeparationOfChurchAndState<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham   This is a REAL #Christian Church. You’re a #grifter&amp; #conman trading on #fear #hatred and #discrimination. #1stAmendment  https://t.co/WB26UoE6xt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham - Stop pretending to be #Christian. It’s an insult to my #religion. You’re a #fraud making money off your dad’s name. 🛑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ur #ExecutiveOrder means nothing. The #LifeInDanger excuse is meaningless w/out #objective #metrics. Go back 2 ur #bunker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least #MSNBC cut away. Not soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JaredKushner is in their pocket #Trump owes them $30million and #Ivanka’s #trademarks. Of course #China wants #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Guess you shouldn’t have dismantled #policereforms from #PresidentBarackObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is #BunkerBoy jealous of #PresidentBarackObama he is also trying to smear #JoeBiden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump All children deserve excellent #publicschools which is tough when money is stolen for #private.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump No - we are made equal by the #Constitution. Stop using my #religion for #political purposes. #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaytonCountyPD - You really endorse frisking #black teens for cutting through yards? #Racist MFr’s. #BLM #DefundThePolice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#COVID19 may have come from #China but YOU are responsible for #Trumpandemic. There is no #AIDSVaccine @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WallStreet is NOT economy. Record number #family farm #foreclosures. #Retail and #mall closures. Fuck the #StockMarkets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now #Trump is on the #ChinaVirus then #pivots to #economy. Must be #rally practice. #Taxpayer funded. #Salary increases for rich?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SchoolChoice is stealing money from #public schools and giving them to private. ALL children deserve excellent #PUBLIC education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - As usual you are completely tone deaf. No leadership. #OpportunityZones enriching #JaredKushner. PS - What #drugs r u on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump is holding a #campaign rally disguised as a press conference. Same old #BS.Trump signals base #cops don’t have 2 change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Blaming #Obama and #Biden? Really??? Pretty sure that #Obama and #Biden never tear gassed #Americans for a #photo-op.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump After falling 25%. #Malls and stores closing all around me BEFORE #COVID19. #StockMarket NOT #economy for most #Americans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to include the full picture @realDonaldTrump. #Propaganda goes only so far. Meanwhile #retail was devastated even before #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes It was @SpeakerPelosi. You added a #signingstatement removing #oversight. How much did you steal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #AdamDiSabato shoul take #GymJordan seat @Jim_Jordan?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump @NoahShachtman That’s been out there for a while and STILL didn’t move a dial. Maybe an ad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah and venue holds 19,000. How many from #Craigslist ad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yours and #Ivanka’s crappy goods made in #China. How bout #American workers? How much do u owe #China? @TheRickWilson -ad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just saw your #China ad. Rich. You bought $380million of #ChineseSteel in 80’s gutting #OHSteel. @TheRickWilson ad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Trans CAN serve in the #Military. This is also a #1stAmendment victory - freedom FROM “some” people’s “religion”. 🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe that’s why I can’t find the ad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this where the #tickets were “purchased” as reported by @parscale?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best part - they assume #minority actors would have to provide #CommunityService.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump I can’t find this. Was it taken down? #Craigslist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz - Has the state of the @SenateGOP sunk so low that you’re in a #twitter war with an #actor? Isn’t there a #pandemic &amp; #CivilUnrest?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC should #sue you for #libel @realDonaldTrump. Don’t you have a #Trumpandemic to deal with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @realDonaldTrump. You need 2 b fully investigated once out of office for #collusion and #obstruction. #ReleaseMuellerGrandJuryTranscripts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Way to go @GOP @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. @realDonaldTrump responses to #Trumpandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m more worried about the actual #Vets and #Americans that @realDonaldTrump #disrepects every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKStahlUSA @realDonaldTrump @PamelaGeller Nice try. We get it. #RepubliCONS are #scared. As you should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I see you have a new #sexist and #racist #playmate - @JohnKStahlUSA (not to be confused with #JohnStahl actor).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is #afraid of strong women. They should all give back in kind.Trump is #disintegrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that @JoeNBC should seriously consider #suing @realDonaldTrump for #slander. Time to hold this #asshole accountable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Not sure what #polls you’re watching. #JoeBidenForPresident2020 is creaming #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so powerful. @realDonaldTrump @GOP - Read EVERY name! You did this! You are responsible! #Trumpandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFsportschick @eugenegu Thanks for the update. #SanLeandro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder that @scottdstone is no longer in #office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#JoeBiden #apologized for misspeaking. Still waiting for #Trump to apologize for anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump truly believes he is a #king. My #ancestors died kicking out #monarchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden - Call this #SOB out on this! #Trump golfed while #Americans died and went #bankrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Nero! #Caligula is the guy who made his horse a #Senator and married his sister. #Nero was also a failed #entertainer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump definitely has his priorities in order - #golf over #Americans. Got it. I admit I just practiced #pitching in my back yard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This reminds me of the #TwilightZone episode where everyone looks alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t need to be in a building. #God wants you to be safe - not handing in #money to #church heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All - read this thread. @realDonaldTrump and @GOP complicit in #Trumpandemic disaster. @FoxNews needs to get educated. #TuckerCarlson wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of acknowledging #American pain @GOP like #LindseyGraham fretted about spoiling low income people w/ 2 much money while 💰 2 donors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #government used #taxpayer money 4 the rich instead of #taxpayers. #Billions to #cruise ships who don’t pay #taxes; well off #airlines 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASlavitt Great thread. What @GOP and @realDonaldTrump don’t want #Americans to think about is that #bailouts went to big #corporations. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a former #PharmacyDirector I made a living of erring on the #alarmist side. Which is why I was ready and had #drugs when others didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah but it’s #TuckerCarlson - lacking a single #brain cell. He has to keep the #DailyCaller crowd happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These devout people don’t need no stickin building to #pray!  https://t.co/pXoq9jCwmh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only essential for collecting $$$. My #pastor friend’s #church and local #churches still closed. Don’t need a building for #faith!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec #Trump also wants to pretend that he cares about religion. He doesn’t. Only #re-election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec - #MurdererInChief wants to kill #Americans because #evangelical leaders (aka #grifters) want their #revenue stream (tithes) back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec - You might want to watch a real news program - #RachelMaddow just did a #segment on #COVID19 cases and #deaths linked 2 churches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #10thAmendment. You have no say in this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My best friend is a #Pastor - they’re not opening their #church. Cos they’re smart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I see the #MAGAt crowd has shown up. No @CharlieBakerMA - Don’t reopen. #Lives more important than #economy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity - I’m watching Top10Scandals of #BarackObama. Do you think it’s ok that @realDonaldTrump blew hundreds of millions $ for golf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve got a better idea. States with #sanctuary cities should stop sending money to #WashingtonDC. Also don’t allow #Trump #rallies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrissyDezoma @Ih8peoplemostly @AndrewHClark @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Sure. Meanwhile #Trump wants to #sacrifice #Americans for #ratings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not #persecution. It’s a #pandemic with #emergency #rules to protect ALL #Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #1stAmendment protects us from religion. Packing together w/no masks puts the rest of us at risk. Other countries r delaying #funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is this #persecution? I live in #MA and we have to wait to go into stores. 6 ft spacing and #masks are mandatory. This is a #pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @townhallcom Damn free and fair #elections! #Republicons can’t win!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got it. Forget #COVID19. Focus on the #campaign #commercial. @GOP wants cos to force people to work with 0 #liability. Ready to be #serfs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RanchoCordovaPD - is it your #policy to bully and #beat 14 yo children with #heart conditions? That #cop is really brave - not. #FIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingsrush @SenKamalaHarris Exactly. Actually the 14 yo was chosen because he was smaller and easier to #beat up. Fire this guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#China would be right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VP - You can do that with a mask and probably keep them healthy at the same time. We can’t keep electing stupid to the #WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - This is a private business. It is NOT essential. People are sick. You screwed up again. #WhereAreTheTests<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinamash Please stay out. We can’t afford another 4 years of @realDonaldTrump. You can’t win but #America can lose.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If that was my mom, or daughter, we would have been at the police dept - NOT calling #LarryKing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my - the #smear campaign is laughable. People are listening to #RapistInChief and drinking cleaners and we’re talking about a phone call?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is incredibly weak stuff. I do not believe #TaraReade. She was a #Putin fan who scrubbed her #twitter just before @JoeBiden got #nom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are #cruiseship #bailouts a way for #Trump family to steal #bailout money and hide it? #cruiseship cos pay no taxes. They’re #foreign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Taxpayer money should support #USPS NOT #cruiseship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi #ImpeachTrump for attempting o shut down #USPostalService and impede #VoteByMail2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meganamram SELFISH! And stupid. How do you think we got rid of #smallpox?? #Vaccination IS herd immunity without risk. Signed-a #pharmacist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump No #bailouts for #cruiseships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cruiseships are registered in other countries and pay no #taxes. No #bailout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@santiagomayer_  Very interesting article -    https://t.co/Nb6gCnjytI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Nb6gCnjytI This article does a good job articulating why I need more info before believing #TaraReade’s #accusations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m seeing talk about @JoeBiden being a #rapist. Story changed. Huge #Putin fan. #Biden vetted by #Obama. I’m worried bout the real #rapist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rekastner So you prefer all out #Fascism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hollygolitely_ @Alyssa_Milano Not proven and suspect. Changing stories. #Biden thoroughly vetted by #Obama. Why now? Hmm—-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canna_mimi @hobbitj @HanxFingers #Smear or #Bot. Watch #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/11SkDQW8YI Great new spot from #LogCabinRepublicans that totally exposes #BS claims that #impeachment to blame 4 slow response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trish_regan @realDonaldTrump @nypost Uh - that’s @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP. Read the #MuellerReport. We know #BillBarr didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not true. I voted for #ElizabethWarren. So much more #competent than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz @SenFeinstein Correction - #Trump has stolen #millions from #SmallBusinesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett #F*ckTheAirlines. #USPS is #Federal and belongs to the people. Not #JaredKushner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump is a #BS artist. I am offended that #Jesus is being used as a #marketing #campaign. Shame on you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - Will this be investigated? This is OUR #taxpayer money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever since I was a kid I knew I wanted to be a gangster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FrankLuntz #Liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett No we don’t! And NO money to foreign based #CruiseShips who pay no taxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC - Are you ready to do your #patriotic duty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we sure don’t put our trust in @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s get #DonaldTrumpMassMurderer trending. I mean - not testing to save a dubious re-election? Stealing supplies purchased by states?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Do you believe your #lies? Are you #demented or #evil? Or both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AccurateTrump2020Slogans - You’re lives for my good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember #Colorado voters that #CoryGardner is playing with your lives for #re-election. As is #Trump. #AccurateTrump2020Slogans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember voters - #Trump’s #FEMA is stealing #taxpayer and privately purchased #emergency supplies so #JaredKushner can sell at #profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/JZ3x3eKJe7 #Governor of #CO asked 4 10,000 #ventilators; bought 500; #STOLEN by #FEMA; given 100 as #favor to @CoryGardner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - How are you letting this happen? Withold the money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or do you want #Jared to take over and profit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - You really ARE afraid of #Mail-in voting aren’t you? You’d rather park $ in off-shore accounts via $ to foreign Co’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But hey - maybe those $ saving #cruise lines can be parked offshore by #Trump. #SaveTheUSPS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not 1 #CruiseLine should receive #bailout money. They aren’t #American companies and don’t pay #taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look up #CouncilOnNationalPolicy. They want to establish an #authoritarian #theocracy THIS YEAR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillBarr also belongs to the #CouncilOnNationalPolicy. Their #2020 agenda is to make #America an #authoritarian #theocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah - an #AttorneyGeneral who spun a credible report on #Russian interference and #Trump complicity. The minor #FISA goofs are nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Face it @attorneygeneral #BillBarr is a. Trying to cover up @realDonaldTrump botched #COVID-19 response and the #MuellerReport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And leave everyone holding the bag. #AccurateTrump2020Slogans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah - the #TanSuitOfTreason! Don’t forget the #DijonMustard of #elitism! #AccurateTrump2020Slogans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who also made fun of me and hurt my feelings. Not fair! #AccurateTrump2020Slogans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the #SteveMiller reference.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bernnotice2 I’m hoping for @SenDuckworth coz she scares the shit outta Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bernnotice2  I’m totally on board w/that. But anti-Biden sentiment &amp; #smears are ticking up. #Trump is floundering - time to take him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DropOutBernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders - I thought you dropped out. Instead you sow #division. Nice going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieOrElse @SusanSarandon Ask yourself what the end game is. That’s all that matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purplequestions Most #Americans don’t want #Socialism. #Trump will run the fear ticket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purplequestions You have to look at the end game. #Bernie bowed out then didn’t. A #Bernie ticket = #Red #House &amp; #Senate &amp; #SCOTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders needs 2 stop this nonsense. #Convention is in #July. Only 4 months until #July. Meanwhile #Berners post crap about @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BernieOnTheBallot By staying on the #ballot  @BernieSanders continues to sow division. Now is the time to strike #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BernieOnTheBallot - @BernieSanders needs to get behind @JoeBiden now to defeat the real enemy - @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Profiteering and #piracy are punishable by #death #JaredKushner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #taxpayer money being used to purchase #supplies for #JaredKushner to have his buds buy and sell at a #profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! #RobertKraft paid $2million for #3millionmasks for #MA that we’re seized by #FEMA. I call #piracy so #JaredKushner could #profiteer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like his hero #KimJungUn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - NO MORE TAXPAYER MONEY UNTIL SLUSH FUND ACCOUNTED FOR!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Use the $500billion #slush fund for small businesses and workers. That’s OUR money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not if you lose @senatemajldr @SenateGOP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Attention: @realDonaldTrump has a $500billion #slushfund of OUR #taxpayer $ with no oversight. Let’s see where that goes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Glad to see you’re taking this seriously @JudgeJeanine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You must be REALLY nervous to have #FauxNews ramp up the #propaganda to #11. There’s #video that contradicts all of this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greendeb999 @DebBRVA Just watched #Contagion. There’s a point between invoking #panic &amp; calling all hands. #USA has also been covering up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleyGWinter I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrEricDing @jasonwasfy @SeemaCMS No it’s not. It’s taking away r #privacy. #Telemedicine has been around fo a while. This is a #power grab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anish_koka #HIPAA should NEVER be waved. That’s basic #patient #confidentiality. Sales of patient info? #Government #database? No thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely! #Telemedicine has been available for a while with #HIPAA protections. This smells like #government #surveillance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobAnderson2018 To be fair this was #MittRomney’s idea but they’ll just lie about that. It’ll turn into a #bribe like the #farmers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CouponHater Sure. People change and grow. #Bernie has been the same for 30+ years - unable to enact #legislation bc most ppl disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater #Republicans will run against #socialist #Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater wow! Give a vote h t I #Trump if you don’t get your way?? #Senate will not flip #blue if #Bernie is nominee - my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater I have researched both people btw. Just reached a different conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater I disagree. That’s my right as is yours. So far majority of voters want #JoeBiden. If #Bernie is the nominee I’ll vote 4 him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @TrumpWarRoom #Lies as usual. @GOP is #fa  I’ll long #America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley YeH- when profits are to be made! #TrumpPressConference #CEO’s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump - Don’t even THINK of using OUR tax dollars to prop up #millionaires. You are SCUM!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction- white #grifters soon to make a handsome profit with #Federal (#taxpayer) dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Trump wouldn’t accept free #coronavirus test kits from WHO but is now funnelling #federal dollars to a company he has stock in???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait - this WASN’T SNL?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s all about the #donors and #oligarchs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes Please tell me this is #sarcasm. Today’s #Trumpspeech was #pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now #Google is coordinating our #healthcare? At least we’re catching up with #SouthKorea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Did you know that you’re behind #MA and other states? #ThanksGovernorBaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumpspeech: #HHS can lift laws so what we already do can b done (but I’ll take credit) I listened to #JoeBiden’s speech &amp; am stealing it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Liz_Wheeler @CamannRoxanne Are you aware of the #HydeAmendment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater I wanted #ElizabethWarren but will vote for the eventual nominee. More voters are voting for #JoeBiden. Respect them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater Please remember - if you don’t get your nominee, then #Trump and the #Republicans will destroy this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater I absolutely agree with you. We need a #Democratic #House and #Senate to make this happen. That’s why I support #JoeBiden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater As the #Republicans will campaign against #socialism. Then NOTHING will be done. Just being #pragmatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater I actually agree with programs you list, but don’t think #Bernie can get it done. Also think #House and #Senate will be lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouponHater According to #Wikipedia (and 2 #Senators) #Bernie has a low number of #bills (high amendments) because most do not agree w/him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Lar.WHO offered tests. U refused. U said #millions of #tests. People can’t be tested. Is it because someone wants profit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @TrumpWarRoom Shame on you! @realDonaldTrump and @GOP r politicizing #coronavirus! #Biden said NO #politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Cut #revenue in the middle of a #pandemic? This benefits #corporations more and cuts funding to #SS and #Medicare! #Bad!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#USA is no longer #1 in the world. @GOP is destroying it. #JoeBiden has experience in addressing #pandemics. We need #PresidentBiden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenAlexander - You shouldn’t have your job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Explain what the problem is @GOP @senatemajldr @GOPLeader? Why can’t $1.5 trillion from #Fed go towards this? I don’t care about #investors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It keeps hovering around 8% down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #incompetence #ignorance &amp; hatred of #PresidentObama is turning us into #USSR. #PresidentBiden will fix this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @pnjaban Obviously you did not watch excellent #PresidentialAddress by @JoeBiden. @GOP @realDonaldTrump keep trying 2 #politicize this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany - #JoeBiden just #bitchslapped #Trump on TV. Oh - and he spoke for more than 7 minutes. But then he’s done this before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader - How about taking a rush because we’re in a #pandemic we’re behind the eight ball and our markets are #tanking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Do you mean the rich?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Agreed. Why are you, #Fox, @VP, etc trying to #politicize this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How many #tests do we have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the #StockMarket has dropped 20% and is now a #BearMarket @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of you saying #WriteInBernie and #ByeByeBiden - remember who the #voters are voting for. You have a choice- #sulk or save #USA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichardAngwin @BernieSanders Then why is #Biden winning? Would you rather have #Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How about restoring #NationalMonument status 2 previous levels @ #BearsEars &amp; #Escalante staircase? Get off #Native lands!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Probably the same as #JillStein and #TulsiGabbard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Lies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need to protect #Mexico!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More importantly what about my friend and donor in the #ShaleOil industry that lost #billions? We need to bail him out!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what happens when #loyalty to #Trump is more important than #science. Just like #Chernobyl and the #USSR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein Aren’t you concerned about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump A #payroll tax reduction is a stupid response 2 a #pandemic. Losing #trillions in #tax revenue is stupid. Like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein You screwed up the last election. How much is #Russia paying you? #Anti-vaxxer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disagree. #Trump slurs his words and doesn’t make sense. This is a #GOP #Russian and #Bernie smear campaign. #Trump’s afraid of #Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is also why I support @JoeBiden and not @BernieSanders. Thank-you for this video and thank-you to the #eloquent young lady who made it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #ShaleOil should receive $0 #taxpayer dollars. The #$8.5billion MUST be used for #Coronavirus. NO #TAXCUTS! @GOP @DNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sums up our #Coronavirus fears. 3 of these people worship #Trump and puts his pleasure before the #American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenmnuchin1 - Are you colluding with #Russia for help in the #2020 election?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - How is a reduction in #tax revenues help with #Coronavirus? You’re pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov - This is #malpractice. #Trump is #incompetent and forcing people around him to be as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2ndResponderret Many #dentists don’t have #admitting privileges despite risk for serious effects from local anesthesia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ndResponderret An #emergency could be dealt with via #EMS and an #ER. I’ve seen enough MD’s with admitting privileges who were bad actors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ndResponderret I’ve thought about this a great deal. I’m a hospital pharmacist who grew up with a GP with no admitting privileges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatTheBerner @robdelaney How will #Trump destroy #Biden? He’s scared of him. #Bernie is good at yelling-not so much #legislation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein Pretty sure @JoeBiden has #dyslexia like #Dubya did. At least he is #coherent and isn’t slurring his words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein R u planning 2 run again so #Trump can destroy r #democracy? I’d rather have a mis-speaker (I do that too) than an #anti-vaxxer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders could accomplish loss of #House &amp; #Presidency to the #Repubs &amp; loss of our #democracy. The #Republicans are afraid of #Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NSC is loyal to #USA. #Trump is it’s biggest danger!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If course #CrookedTrump wants #LTCVindman gone. Less witnesses. #Trump still hasn’t released the full aid package to #Ukraine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - A liar of epic proportions coming after OUR money coz the #rich don’t have enough. #Trump is stealing #taxpayer $.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is a #whiny spoiled little rich boy born with a golden spoon in his mouth which is now firmly lodged in his #butt. The ultimate #con.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #JohnLewis has Stage IV #pancreatic #cancer. He’s more deserving of a #PMOH than a #bigoted #misogynist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @GOP are trying to rig #impeachment rules. Pathetic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SuperBowl #Congratulations to #PatrickMahomes and the #KansasCityChiefs. Thrilling game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing as #MarALago is the #WinterWhiteHouse, I think we the people should go visit. Especially as #taxpayers paid for a #campaign #event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump @PressSec - I agree. No more #entitlements. #Trump should pay for his own #golf outings. I refuse to pay 1 more cent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all of their #tax returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joniernst is #scum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP also threatened immediate #impeachment of #HillaryClinton if elected. They are in-American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #criminal behavior is a must for @GOP? I wonder what your #Uncle feels about that? @MittRomney voted for #evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @realDonaldTrump - no excuse why we can’t take on #infrastructure!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill @SenJoniErnst There was. But #Trump was concerned about his election- not #Ukraine’s issues. Get it now? Why no #witnesses?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Women must exercise their vote to keep us safe from #anti-choices.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump #AdamSchiffROCKS is pointing out that #Trump has been corrupt from the start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump  You’re not paying #attention. There r MANY witnesses, documents, texts etc that corroborate the complaint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnBarrasso @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @SpeakerPelosi Actually, @SenateGOP are showing that they’re trying to give #Trump a pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepRonWright @realDonaldTrump Tell @senatemajldr to vote on the #400bills that have been sitting on his desk!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichLowry @realDonaldTrump #PresidentObama wasn’t making his decision based on an #election. #Trump was #extorting #Ukraine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MoscowMitch needs to be #investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty funny! Sadly probably not far from the truth!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli @Liz_Cheney #America started to support #Iranians after hurting them with #sanctions. This is about #TrumpImpeachment. Shameless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey but the #rich are happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss @Tocqueville001 Don’t forget #military. He’s selling them to allies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GStephanopoulos #ReleaseTheTranscripts. The summary already shows your #guilt. Release the witnesses! #ImpeachedTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you going to employ the same #compassion to our #ConcentrationCamps #inmates? You don’t give a crap about #Iranians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump is trying to divert attention from his #impeachment. He’s also #extorting #Iraq in plain sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the shirt! #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you see the vid of 2 men scaling #Trump’sWall in about 10 seconds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent article on #Rwanda. #NatGeo had a special several years ago that proved we all started in #Africa. #Racists should watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mskirkga -Nobody believes #Trump’s lies. They’re all over the place. #Iranians were wrong in shooting down the plane, but acknowledged it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t that #extortion? Reopen the #impeachment articles @SpeakerPelosi!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #MoscowMitch or anyone else swears a false #oath then they should be locked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyMail is the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The #TrumpAdministration must allow #human rights groups and #ACLU monitor the #ConcentrationCamps where #refugees r held!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah coz nothing says u respect #Iranian people like canceling a #multinational treaty and imposing crippling #sanctions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @SarahHuckabee The #JCPOA was working. #International treaty that gave #Iran’s money back to them and lifted #sanctions. #Trump blew it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you do know that #Nixon couldn’t claim #ExecutivePrivilege? Too bad #MoscowMitchMcConnell is #complicit with your #crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - PLEASE reopen #impeachment hearings and #subpoena #JohnBolton #MickMulvaney #RudyGiuliani #MikePimpeo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is that why you want to prevent witnesses from testifying? #ImpeachedTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Ruined? Like #PaulManafirt colluding with foreign powers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Naughty #Sherlock!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnBoyega @TheLastRealGen1 You have achieved much in 27 years! I am 63 and am #impressed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Nice try blaming your messes on #PresidentObama. BTW- under #JCPOA #Iran agreed no #nuclear until 2030! #LiftSanctions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump has no business telling #allies to get involved with HIS manufactured crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #Sulaimani and #Kurds defeated #ISIL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - If we have $2.5trillion for #weapons, then why are you trying to cut #SS and #Medicare? #HealthcareForAll #Infrastructure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump broke the #JCPOA treaty. Why should #NATO or other countries help him out?? He just wants a deal with his name on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Lies! We did NOT give #Iran money-we gave their own money back that we seized in 1979. The #JCPOA was in place until 2030<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #Iran the biggest threat when it was #Saudis &amp; #Palestinians who attacked on us on 9/11? Why can #SaudiArabia have #nuclear? #NKorea?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney #Trump was #golfing while he #assassinated #Suleimani. If not for your dad then we wouldn’t even be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Have you briefed #Congress and our #allies yet????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sanctions &amp; #Trump’s withdrawal from #JCPOA is the #catalyst 4 #IranianCrisis. Let’s face it - @realDonaldTrump just wanted HIS name on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely sums up my views on the #MiddleEast conflict. This was 31 years ago. #Trump promised #infrastructure - instead he feeds the #MIC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikePrysner is a #hero. This is what #protest and the #1stAmendment looks like. Let’s dial it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruel piggy eyes. #TrumpsWarOfMassDistraction<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank-you #PresidentObama!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me guess - #ExecutiveTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 2 bad we have a #weak &amp; #incompetent #president who caused this by pulling out of an #international #treaty d/t #arrogance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump started this by canceling the #Iranian treaty and reinstating #sanctions, sending #warships and #drones. He owns this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @LindseyGrahamSC - Is it #blackmail or #bribery that ur responding 2? #Iranians aren’t #anti-Semites. Stop confusing #Israel w/ #Judaism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CES - Seriously #IvankaTrump? Because she played #Minecraft? #Lame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CES - as a female #STEM professional I am outraged that you let this #entitled #grifter be the keynote speaker at CS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget #Reagan supplying weapons to #Iraq which helped fuel anti-American sentiment in #Iran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Do your f*cking job and help #American #citizens!!! #BillClinton continued to do hi job during his #impeachment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pass the #400bills @senatemajldr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kbsalsaud How much are they paying u for our #troops? #SaudiArabia is a large #sponsor of #terrorism - why no #sanctions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Are you ready to step down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi That’s before she realized how #complicit #Senate #Republicans we’re w/ #Trumps #crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump We have killed hundreds of thousands of #Iraqis #Afghans #Yemenis and #Kurds. #Introspection is #vital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi The last thing we need is a #dictator bypassing #Congress. Shame on you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Bankrupt: Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Castle, Trump Plaza Casino, Trump Plaza Hotel, Trump Hotels &amp; Casinos Resorts, Trump Entertainment Resorts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill - Why are you #complicit in #Republicans’ attempt to allow #Trump to get away with his #BS? #House should #impeach him again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s tough @senatemajldr when you won’t vote on the #400bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump has 3 goals: -Nullify #impeachment -Get #reelected -Stay out of #prison He’s hijacked our #foreign policy for his own gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @NikkiHaley on the Board at #Boeing? What are her qualifications? What does she know about #aeronautics? Should this b #investigated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump is a #grifter making money off her dad’s presidency (#trademarks from #China?) @ChelseaClinton has earned her way in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley That’s a lie. We mourn the #incompetence of @realDonaldTrump that will lead to #war with #Iran.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump - This mess belongs to #Trump. He canceled the #IranDeal and reimposed #sanctions. We had peace w/#Iran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the #WhiteHouse doesn’t want #Bolton to testify?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read that his #undocumented workers didn’t even get paid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls - The #US #tortured #prisoners. We’ve killed hundreds of thousands of #Iranians #Afghans #Yemenis and #Kurds. We #bomb them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jack_Burkman These countries are not our #colonies. Once again #Trump breaks a #campaign promise. This is ALL on him starting w/ #sanctions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Burkman #ElizabethWarren is way too intelligent to do something this #stupid. #Suleimani was supposed to meet w/ #PresidentSalih.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nice try @ #deflection #ImpeachedTrump. #JohnBolton is ready 2 testify. You are trying to #extort #Iraq. #Iraq wants u out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it interesting that the #Iranian govt let this #tweet out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WeirdTimesToApplaud Anytime #CadetBoneSpurs speaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi Well ifTrump hadn’t refused to hand over documents and #witnesses thereby leading to a lengthy court battle-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They already have #extortion of #Iraq and #AbuseOfPower in the #political #assassination of #Suleimani.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #Senate and #MoscowMitchMcConnell refuses #JohnBolton’s #testimony then kick it back to the #House. Add #Iraq’s #extortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure #JohnBolton has had enough of #Trump’s #incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank-you for bringing up the #1stAmendment #MichelleWilliams. We are all allowed to believe in our own #faith. #GoldenGlobes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially since #JohnWatson was going to be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that’s called #extortion. @SpeakerPelosi - reopen those #ImpeachmentHearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met #AndrewScott at the 2016 #SherlockConvention. He was absolutely the sweetest and kindest person. (Actually they all were).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - #Trump is saying that #Iraq has to pay for an #airbase before #US will leave. We invaded. Isn’t that #extortion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And sold #troops to #SaudiArabia for protection. And just sent 3500 troops to #MiddleEast despite #Iraq asking us to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #ReleaseTheTranscripts. Let #DonMcGahn #WilliamBarr #RudyGiulani #MickMulvaney #JohnBolton #WilliamBarr testify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo No - the #House has done its job. It is making sure the #Senate does theirs. #Impeached<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How about they investigate you for #WarCrimes? Tell #MoscowMitchMcConnell to pass the #400bills!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LivingLifeonth3 Like what we are doing in #Yemen. So #Trump is responsible for the death of thousands there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivingLifeonth3 As opposed 2 everyone else doing the same? #Sulaimani didn’t kill these people directly-he trained #militias &amp; gave weapons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Time to take the power to declare #war or take unilateral actions away from the #presidency. #Trump is using it for personal means. #Corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MAGA - #Trump only cares about rich people. He lies 2 you for your #vote. He has failed to deliver on his #campaign promises. #Vote him out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - You’re #lying. It was primarily the #Saudis yet #Trump has hired out our #troops to them as #mercenaries. #Traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi #Soleimani trained people 2 kill #Americans over 16 years. How many #Iraqis #Yemenis &amp; #Afghans did we kill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will this include #mosques?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @ewarren at what point do we #investigate this and nail #Trump for #domestic #emoluments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so cool. #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - So what’s going on? Still #colluding @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudicialWatch Focus on the #criminal #impeached for #AbuseOfPower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - #SaddamHussein used #Sarin #MustardGas and other #WMD’s against the #Iranians in the 80’s. Where’s your #outrage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr #MoscowMitch - We know you’ve #abdicated your responsibility. #Congress still needs to do its job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is #incompetent. #Congress must remove his #war powers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another #lie by @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is @realDonaldTrump making a payment? Getting more cash? Planning #DeutscheBank strategy? #Golf? Is #LeningradLindsey and #MoscowMitch there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - is this why now declare #Florida as your residence? Must be pretty bad-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an #idiot. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump has refused to work with courts for decades. Let’s hold him accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duskybatfishgrl That’s very nice of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - There were no #Iranians or #Afghans responsible. There were plenty of #Saudi’s though , including #OsamaBinLaden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve already shown that #allies can’t trust us. #Kurds #NATO #G7 #Ukraine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikepompeo - Our #allies no longer #trust or #respect #CadetBoneSpurs and by extension us. This is all on #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good read from a #MiddleEastern perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi? @senatemajldr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - In my 63 years I never stopped saying #MerryChristmas. Are you really promoting that as a major accomplishment? #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priceless! #EmotionalIntelligence #ThinSkinTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mschlapp Attitudes like that are dangerous for our security. #Trump is deflecting attention from his #impeachment and new proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedState @streiffredstate Maybe #MoscowMitchMcConnell shouldn’t be #colluding with an #impeached #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harp4Jammin The true enemies are #Trump and his merry band of #Traitor #Republicans. #KingTrump told his family and club goers. #Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASavageNation This is about #American #imperialism. And #Trump IS weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aedibari Totally different conversation. This was an act of war against #Iran. Different country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepLeeZeldin How many #Iraqis, #Kurds, #Aghans, #Yemenis have we killed? We need to get out of the #ME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikepompeo - #Europe knows you’re full of s*it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even #Russia sees the #impeachment connection. The others, are of course, also reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These #FakeChristians are no different than #ISIS and the #Taliban.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Trump was #impeached &amp; facing a #Senate trial while proof of #Ukraine #extortion came out so he created a #diversion. Fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CNNPolitics I want proof. I don’t believe anything the #TrumpAdministration says. I call #BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They recognize a fellow #grifter and #conman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#presidents can only bypass #Congress in emergencies. It’s not like this was #topsecret? Does #Trump think #MarALago is his #court?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More to investigate. #SEC should start with #Trump. He has a long history of manipulating the stock market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to start jailing anyone who doesn’t comply with #subpoenas. The #House should reopen #impeachment and make it impossible for #Senate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the usual #grifters are pulling the #prayer BS. These guys just care about #money and #power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG- @TuckerCarlson is actually right. Pigs are flying-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time to recognize that #evangelicals want to overthrow the #Constitution and turn #USA into a #theocracy. #F*ckThem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump #FreedomOfReligion means I have the right to believe #science over your #superstitions over when life begins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump I believe #reproductive rights is more important than non-viable intra-uterine growth. Stay out of #women’s rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump So you’re going 2 release #children in #cages? Stop #anti-Semitism &amp; #anti-Muslim hate crimes? Respect #1stAmendment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeleeb50 He was probably skulking around the #blackmail section.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP But #ClimateChange is a hoax - right? #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump has flouted the law for decades. Time to hold this #corrupt man accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump   #Iran is a #theocracy. This must apply to them as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump   John Adams: "The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the #Christian #Religion."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had no business going to #Iraq. #GWB fouled up the #ME. #CadetBonesturs is going to make it worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Says the #morally #bankrupt #BS artist desperate not to go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump You do know that the #FoundingFathers specifically left #religion out of government? We are not a #theocracy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pro- #Democracy #1stAmendment  Anti- #Corruption #Grifting #Treason #Greed #Dictatorship #Incompetence #Cruelty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How many #Iraqis, #Afghans, and #Yemenis have we killed? #Hypocrisy - thy name is #Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouDobbs is #delusional. #Trump is a lazy, #corrupt, #incompetent #grifter who is sparking #WWIII just because he’s #impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No #MoscowMitchMcConnell - your #treason and refusal to follow the #Constitution that has put this #nation at risk. #Bribery or #blackmail?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WWIII “Preventing a war” is @realDonaldTrump #yellowcake. #BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - You lack #leadership skills. See you’re reading the #script. Get out of #ME. You’re still #impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #USA is trying to hold #Iran responsible for 603 deaths in #Iraq. How many #Yemeni deaths are we responsible for??? #Iraqi?? #Afghan???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump loves looking strong then #retreating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 @brhodes Ben Rhodes is right. #Impeached45 can’t be trusted to do the right thing. He’ll do anything to get re-elected &amp; #lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump How many #Iraqis and #Afghans have we killed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wine_slash @JoeBiden As opposed to #USA doing the same thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFarahani @EmmaVigeland What’s your reference? How many #Iraqis and #Afghans have #Americans killed??? How about in #Yemen????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dollemore @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @benshapiro @charliekirk11 @kilmeade  #Cowards all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/zeW68lt7cD  Bombshell reading. #Putin owns #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought I’d see the day when I agreed with @GeraldoRivera. #FoxNews has officially jumped the shark. Nothing more than #propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TrumpFamilySyndicate needs to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another reminder that @realDonaldTrump considers himself a #king. Or #MafiaDon abusing his power for personal gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PompeoPropaganda shows how unreliable our government has become. #Impeached #Trump is officially the worst president ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don’t I believe @mikepompeo? #Pompeo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’ve never even served you #chicken hawk! You’re risking lives because you were #impeached!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - The #assassination of #Soleimani was stupid and reckless. But hey-it deflects from the #impeachment news, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@RealDonaldTrump needs to have his war powers removed. He’s #incompetent and #impeached!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s even more gorgeous! #BenedictCumberbatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time to see #IvankaTrump and #JaredKushner #taxreturns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when the idiots at #FoxNews went ballistic about a tan suit? But #bribery #corruption #incompetence is all cool?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Holmes brothers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth watching! #BenedictCumberbatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is outrageous! Not only is #Trump breaking the law, he’s trying to deflect blame. The #House should reopen #impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @QUBelfast Congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It also protects us from #religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Waaahhh!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to you @LindseyGrahamSC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Do you ever work???? You #grifter- you’re sucking us dry!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StateDept @SecPompeo I call #BS. They were #Iraqis who want us out. @realDonaldTrump is trying to manufacture a war due to his #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BS. The #Iraqis want us out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MoscowMitch is crooked as hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is frightening. #America is #secular for a reason. All #faiths are welcome here. #WilliamBarr has no business being #AG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Uh-these are #Iraqi protesters. Stop trying to start a war with #Iran. You’re still #impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They didn’t want us there either. #Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This little guy is so cute! I may have to do this next year! #LemonPig<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Liar! You were #golfing as usual! Do you EVER do your job?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - If #MarALago is the “southern White House” then we the people are allowed to visit at no charge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump RELEASE THE #TRANSCRIPTS! AND YOUR #TAXRETURNS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo - You are a disgrace to this country. You should never be in office again! #Traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CadetBoneSpurs is #incompetent. He should have any powers to attack another country removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You’ll do anything to deflect from your #impeachment. War with #Iran is a bad idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump As opposed to @senatemajldr protecting you? How much money has he gotten from #Russia? #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr - The #House is doing its job. Why aren’t you doing yours? #PassThe400Bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden - Some good advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO this is as moving as the ending in #Casablanca. #Sherlock knowing that he is going to a certain death makes it that much more poignant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Yeah - the #world is sure respecting us again! #Europe-we #Americans feel the same way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett @FoxNews When @senatemajldr says he will collude with #TraitorTrump then there is cause for concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump More like a daily reminder that #Trumpsters lie and spread #propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi That can be fixed by having @RudyGiuliani #JohnBolton @SecPompeo &amp; @MickMulvaneyOMB testify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer - Do you have this ad on #Facebook and TV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably because his base are vile #Muslim and #racist a**hats. #Gallagher will fit right in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. And is cleaner than #FoxNews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like Trumpledumb and Trumpledumber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @attorneygeneral @senatemajldr to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely! Not only is #WilliamBarr blatantly lying, but he’s apparently the only guy who can’t be investigated by the #IG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera No they didn’t. Stop lying!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump Thank-you @RepSwalwell for laying out the evidence so well. #ImpeachAndConvictTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump - this is not ok for a president to do. It’s OUR money and OUR security. You aren’t #king. #ImpeachAndRemove<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepArrington @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi There were many #amendments that the #Dems needed to add because original bill was weak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How dare you call #Judaism a race or nation you stupid old man? Did you get the idea from #MeinKampf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #BS. Where’s our #infrastructure plan? You are truly the #EmperorWithNoClothes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is about suppressing #freespeech against #apartheid #Israel. We boycotted #SouthAfrica in the 90’s for the same and ended #apartheid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#alt-right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve read somewhere that #Republicans love #Israel and hate #Jews. The rise in #anti-semitism is due to the malt-right, not #BDS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BDS movement is not #Anti-Semitic. It is anti #apartheid and #1stAmendment just like w/#SouthAfrica in the 90’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the ultimate disgrace. #Israeli is a #nationality. #Judaism is a #religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to #ImpeachWilliamBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mansoortshams Thank-you for your service. More than #CadetBoneSpurs did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump You have proof?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh-this includes #stealing #Texan land under #eminentdomain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Glad to hear it. #ReleaseTheDocuments and let @MickMulvaneyOMB @SecPompeo @RudyGiuliani and @AmbJohnBolton #testify<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting. I saw a clip from #Russian TV where #Lavrov said #Russia would fix the elections. In #English.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WilliamBarr must be #impeached. He’s worse than #JohnMitchell. His #OpusDei beliefs are clouding his #oath to the #Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad but true. #ImpeachBarrNow #BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why not? He discussed #electionsecurity with the guy who said that #Russia will fix the #US elections on #Russian TV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They talked about #electionsecurity. I bet they talked about #Ukraine and the #blackmail of their government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for #LisaPage. She should sue the crap out of @RodRosenstein @realDonaldTrump and #WilliamBarr for #defamation and #libel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Deflection #lies. How about you release the #full transcripts of the #Ukraine call? Allow #MickMulvaney to testify!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with @GOPLeader. #VoteRepublicansOut #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader - Do you not understand #treason? We are a nation of laws which #TraitorTrump is ignoring! Trying to steal American votes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader - Read the #IG report. You are willfully misinformed. #AlexanderHamilton and #BenjaminFranklin warned us about #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity @GreggJarrett Nice try. Read the real #IG report, not #WilliamBarr cliff notes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BriberyOrBlackmail #LeningradLindsay ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a #preview at a #HouseImpeachmentHearing @AmbJohnBolton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a press secretary is pushing a #demented pres #ageism claims? @PressSec - nice try. It’s nothing to retrieve a #password. I’m 63 #bitch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Dogs are the most amazing creatures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LIAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting that we have a #DraftDodger in the #WhiteHouse while we deport #veterans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But they have @realDonaldTrump. Tell #MoscowMitch to pass the #300bills!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waaaahhhh!!!!! #DevinNunes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brycetache As a recovering #hoarder I wish you the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JimBakker is a fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun fact - the #Puritans and early #Yankees did not celebrate #Christmas coz it took a day away from work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More like until a $50,000 #bounty was put on his head @TeamTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The #economy is so good that the #Taunton #OliveGarden is closing. #HouseOfCards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep spinning @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One #conartists recognizes another. #EricWalker #Pharisee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samrohrer - I hate to tell you but our country specifically removed religion from #government. We’re #secular. #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A quick reminder that #JimBakker was convicted of #fraud. Typical #televangelist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it. @DevinNunes is a #loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold @SecPompeo in #contempt of Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold @VP @MickMulvaneyOMB @SecPompeo @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump in #contemptofcongress. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not #religiousfreedom @VP. It’s state sanctioned #bigotry and is #unconstitutional. #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waaaahhhh!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bullets? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. @DevinNunes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes #HunterBiden isn’t getting #impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m hearing @DevinNunes carrying #TraitorTrump’s water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see if @realDonaldTrump deletes any tweets —-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik I’m donating big to @TedraCobb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @EddieRispone BS. #LA taxes not even close to other states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump #Waaaaahhhhh!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump So you’re ok with #shadow foreign policy and smears? Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is mentally ill. I’m convinced #torture #degradation and #cruelty excites him. This is a guy that threw rocks at a baby when a kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepStefanik didn’t even participate until the #cameras were on. She was so desperate to talk with other reps when hearing over but ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She uses her time to paint #TraitorTrump as the hero of #Ukraine. She just wants the spotlight and this was her role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell @gianabanan Gee @Jim_Jordan @GOP @foxandfriends - Guess #impeachment isn’t boring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @GOPLeader Kind of hard when @real storms out of #bipartisan meetings and #MoscowMitch refuses to pass the #300bills. #Propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder 2 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @Jim_Jordan etc- #diplomats serve @ pleasure of a president but r loyal 2 the #Constitution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #RodRosenstein was part of the resistance #WilliamBarr? #TraitorTrump hosed himself when he fired #JamesComey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget that the latter group thinks #Trump is a #king<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FreeRealityWinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#President is not a #King #WilliamBarr. You need to re-read the #Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget #GeorgeMitchell did jail time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RacistInChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is amazing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best explanation of #Trump government and how he and the #Repukes are fighting #impeachment. #Trump was schooled by #RoyCohn don’t forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @ErinMPerrine Tell #MoscowMitch to pass the #300bills.  Meanwhile @TeamPelosi has been working on #USMCA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Russia over #Crimea and #Ukraine. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to investigate the #TrumpServers that we’re directly linked to #Russian #AlfaBank. Heightened traffic when #Trump sided with 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan - Be careful what you wish for. #ImpeachingHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @thehill @Jim_Jordan @RepStefanik eat al would do well to respect the rules instead of lying to #Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WilliamBarr believes in the #unitaryexecutive theory that essentially establishes a #monarchy. Time to kick it to the curb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s legislated stupidity and violation of #1stAmendment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lived in #Ohio for 14 years. Shame it’s going stupid. This will only hurt students in the end. And no-this is NOT #religiousfreedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Behind every #bully is a #whiny #sniveling #coward. #ExhibitA - @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that @TheRealPWM should ask for $666. More in line with her belief in #maman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the very least @RepStefanik should know and follow the rules for the #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all now that only white men are real #victims. The rest of us are #snowflakes. #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #America surrendered to #Turkey and #Russia. Wonder how our #troops feel about that? #TraitorTrump is selling us out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG #RepLeeZeldin is still whining about a #parody!!!! #Waaaahhh @realDonaldTrump has to fight back! Unfair! #Waaaaahhhh!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP tears are painful. Follow the process guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik - Of course threatening tweets count. Why do you think the #Whistleblower doesn’t want to testify in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @Jim_Jordan is painful. He obviously only knows the #propaganda talking points. Release all #documents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have the right to free speech. The #American people have a right to the truth. You answer to #US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CongressmanHice @realDonaldTrump @GOPoversight @RepAdamSchiff @HouseDemocrats @nypost #Impeachment about #bribery. Definitely pertains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump @RepStefanik Ehy can’t #GOP reps follow #House rules????????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @RepStefanik We get it. Credit where it’s due. #Accountability where it’s due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rep_Watkins @realDonaldTrump I was unhappy about #GWB and #Reagan. No #ImpeachmentHearings. Wonder what’s different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Waiting on documents from #WhiteHouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @RepAdamSchiff is an #AmericanHero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Maybe #ObamaAdministration was being cautious? Unlike the #TrumpGrifter family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearing AND when the #TrumpTowerServer connection to #AlfaBank (Russia) was reported. #TraitorTrump bought &amp; paid 4 by #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearing while he was running for president. Comments made when he was supporting #Russia’s takeover of #Crimea. 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearing @Jim_Jordan srsly suggested that #AmbassadorYovanovitch should have told #Ukraine 2 🛑 being mean to @realDonaldTrump 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - Is it #blackmail or #bribery that forces you to carry out #Trump’s agenda instead of the #country’s? My ancestors kicked out a #king.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MikeConaway suggests that #GeorgeKent was paid to praise #AmbassadorYovanovitch. The only #bribe recipients is #GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @RepMikeTurner Not why they were called as witnesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMikeTurner #EUAmbassador from #US different than #ambassadors from other #EU countries. Nice try though. Waiting for #Sondland testimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMikeTurner Thank God you don’t rep #SummitCounty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMikeTurner Cutting off an answer then lying about said answer is not a good look. But that’s all @GOP has. @JohnKerry has no place here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmazonHelp Website<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time 2 #subpoena #TrumpTowerServers that were tied 2 #AlphaBank in #Russia. The 1 active when #Trump’s stance on #Crimea changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously? The party of #LittleRocketMan is questioning why the #Ukrainians were mean to him? @realDonaldTrump @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik - If you don’t understand rules of #impeachment then you shouldn’t be part of the hearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go #ChrisWallace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazon @JeffBezos - I had to return 3 products due to damage clearly at time of shipping. Address or I will no longer use #Amazon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes Tell @senatemajldr to pass the #300bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Irrelevant and contradicts the #April transcript. Nice try @DevinNunes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - That does NOT mean putting a president above the #Nation’s national security and interests. YOU SERVE #AMERICA!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Let’s hear from @SecPompeo @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump #JohnBolton and other pertinent witnesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You forgot #Whistleblower complaint 9/9.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t get to say that #Donald. #ReleaseTheTaxes #ReleaseAllDocuments Remove restrictions on testifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Tell #MoscowMassacreMitch @senatemajldr to pass the #300bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All you have is #attack and name calling. You are a #stain on our country. #Nazioso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #LIAR She stood in your way. #StateDept officials are loyal to the #Constitution. Must make you crazy to come 2nd.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So @JoeBiden is doing what’s best for #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your lies mean nothing @realDonaldTrump. Release all the documents #recordings and #taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealPWM You are a liar #blasphemer #Pharisee. #Jesus would throw you out of the temple. You have officially stained my beloved #faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulawhite is a #conman on a level with @realDonaldTrump. She is a #Pharisee and #blasphemer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sex dick crabs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we take a moment 2 reflect @realDonaldTrump is asking @SCOTUS to upend the #Constitution and declare a president above the law &amp; #king?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Nothing #triggers me. I do find it amusing when you #whine about #unfair treatment and smears. Poor #snowflake!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls is smoking #crack, I swear. @realDonaldTrump making sacrifices? Not making $$$???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump who cares about #Walmart? What about #American families?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn’t their job @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU forced this issue @realDonaldTrump by trying to get #Ukraine to interfere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump is now asking #SCOTUS to shield his #tax returns. There must be something REALLY #incriminating in them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@generalrvl - Sorry. Thought the bot comment was aimed at me. Still a #patriot though! 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just like the #Nazis and #Soviets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC - so was it #bribery or #blackmail???? Disgusting #POS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxBusiness That wasn’t their job and they knew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer - shame on you. The witnesses were there to relay what they knew - NOT #opinion. They were very clear about that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @RepAdamSchiff @washingtonpost  @realDonaldTrump and others threatened #whistleblower’s life which is illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan #Subpoena the direct contacts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan #Ukraine was already vetted by #SecretaryOfDefense. This was #extortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @FoxFriends @FoxNews There’s a way to fix that. #Subpoena @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @RudyGiuliani.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction @Jim_Jordan - aid was released 2 days after the #whistleblower complaint reached #Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #GOP has is lies. #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s official - @realDonaldTrump is selling out #America at #profit to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes is #despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bribes and #blackmail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is truly #delusional. The journalist asking #Erdogan about treating #Kurds well proves we’re in #1984.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan - not everyone ignores wrongdoing like you did at #OSU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The witnesses were there to share what they know, not reach #conclusions. @RepRatcliffe was #showboating- the only thing #Repukes know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterWelch is a #Boss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP worries about cost of healthcare of our #vets- NOT T #toys from our #MilitaryIndustrialComplex<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I thought it was too stupid to be guilty? #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how many copies @GOP  bought? 6 notes? Really?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @EliseStefanik No problem- let @MickMulvaneyOMB #williambarr @realDonaldTrump @DonaldMcgahn et al testify!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik @NicolleDWallace @NikkiHaley @GOP @MSNBC It’s not a compliment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes  That’s troubling. Both witnesses gave damning testimony and you guys lie and insult. #SAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearings #GeorgeKent just knocked it out of the park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearings @DevinNunes - #Trump is NOT serving the people. #StateDept employees serve #Constitution first- not #NaziosoTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I definitely think someone should stick a wad of cash in the empty hand. #MinneapolisTrumpRally<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@junnuravikumar Please cite your reference. I guarantee you it has nothing to do with the #Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junnuravikumar Since becoming #US we have never had an official #religion. The only #theocracy was #PlymouthBayColony/#MA &amp; the #Puritans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - You are #scum. #KurdishGenocide #MayGodProtectTheKurds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is no longer competent to be #CommanderInChief and should have his powers #revoked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. But you have @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenCoryGardner - I take it your answer is yes? #Republicans - the party of #treason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - your attacks are pathetically predictable. Your treasonous ass needs to be thrown out of the #OvalOffice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No problem @TulsiGabbard. I won’t miss you. I thought you were gone already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if #Congressman-1 is #LeningradLindsey or #MoscowMitch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@facebook - This is why I don’t use #Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a #Traitor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote EVERY #Republican out of office! @GOP is the party of #treason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junnuravikumar You might want to read the #Constitution especially the #1stAmendment. #Religion was specifically left out of govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Corruption  #MassMurder #Treason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @realDonaldTrump - you are. #FILTH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good argument for #Civics tests ft #presidential candidates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - Did you miss the #Nixon impeachment? You are on the wrong side of history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump- #ObstructionOfJustice is what brought down #Nixon you #twit. What is depressing is that #Republicans no longer have honor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the letter from the event organiser. It states that #SecretService pays for security. #Taxpayer money for campaigns? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aren’t there also security concerns with #What’sApp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at what #hedge fund managers did to #Sears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m happy for #Mahalet. However, this country was built on #humanist principles. The #FoundingFathers purposely left #religion out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is committing #ObstructionOfJustice. This is what brought down #RichardNixon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz - Your #ignorance is breathtaking. #CaptainKangaroo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The infamous dancing feet. #Sherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many conveniently forget that there are twin #TrumpTowers in #Instabul. #Trump puts himself and 💰 before #allies. #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re trying to keep him/her safe from #TraitorTrump @SteveScalise. Unfortunately #Republicans have shown they can’t be trusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BS @PressSec. @realDonaldTrump didn’t even discuss #Syria pull out with ANYONE (except #Erdogan).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this letter mean that the #campaign wants #SecretService (taxpayer money) to pay for expenses? Isn’t that illegal @SpeakerPelosi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So-#GrifterInChief is obfuscating to try to weasel out of paying #Mineapolis again. @realDonaldTrump should pay his bills! By the way - why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddstarnes - #GrifterInChief owes #Minneapolis hundreds of thousands of $$$. Tell him to pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mayor of #Minneapolis wants you to pay your outstanding bill and pay up front. You can’t keep stuffing people @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So was it: #TrumpTowersIstanbul #BirthdayGift to #Putin You got scared when #Erdogan yelled at you New #bromance with another #dictator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re full of it @realDonaldTrump. You’re scared to death. How are #Republicans rights impaired except by their own #corruption?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 hours after #Taylor’s tweet. Pretty damning @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let #Sondland testify @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU OWE #MINNEAPOLIS MONEY YOU #GRIFTER! @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try paying #Minneapolis for your last #rally  @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe he wants #Erdogan’s guards to quell protests here. They have diplomatic immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraitorTrump doesn’t want anyone telling on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #Iran has to step in to protect #America’s allies because our “president” is too #corrupt to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a #traitor, a #coward who puts himself first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @GOP is the party of #traitors and #cowards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stuff nightmares are made of- #HowNotToPickAPumpkin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SecretaryClinton was smeared for almost 30 years. #Benghazi was #Republicans’ fault for not funding security requested by #StateDept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - at what point do you realize that #Trump is #betraying his country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraitorTrump is a SHITSTAIN on the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lock him up for #ContemptOfCongress!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraitorTrump didn’t just betray the #Kurds - he #betrayed #America. No one will trust us. Except #Putin, #Kim, and #MBS. He’s their #idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SUBWAY - I was there at 755.  Unacceptable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SUBWAY - Disgusted. Went to #Subway on 79 in Berkley/Taunton. Closes at 8. “Megan” closed station early 2 customers not able to buy food!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are we in #SaudiArabia again @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s like #TraitorTrump knows the end is near and he needs to finish #Putin’s to do list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does seem that #TraitorTrump is ramping up on his promises to #Putin. Time to take his power away. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can this happen @SpeakerPelosi. Doesn’t #Congress have a say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Erdogan is probably going to make something up about #JoeBiden. Or just inked a deal for another #TrumpTower. #ImpeachTraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #phone #traitor has not been elected before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lack intelligence, let alone #wisdom @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KenStarr -The guy who pursued #PresidentClinton for 7 years to get him on a #bj! #PATHETIC @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Agribusiness helped-NOT #familyfarms! #Perdue says they will go under! #F**kTheOligarchs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That $28billion is from #taxpayer Money @realDonaldTrump. #Tariffs are paid for by #consumers! #FamilyFarms are going #bankrupt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - I thought #Congress made these decisions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump - you POS- your dad just ok’d #Erdogan invasion of #Syria. #ReleaseTheTaxReturns #ImpeachTrump #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump and @RudyGiuliani are trying to shake down #Ukraine AND using #TraitorTrump ‘s #Russian #Mobster friends. Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #TrickyDick-4 seasons. Breathtaking - this is absolutely mirroring #Ukrainegate. Chilling @ the end re: Will this happen again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at the roll-up on his jeans! Sorry-couldn’t resist. #BenedictCumberbatch #MG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basic #human rights include #health and #education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At what point do the #Republicans get sick of him embarrassing us? #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many questions- do I want #seaweed with my #whisky? Where’s the fun with no bar #accoutrements? Won’t people get drunk faster?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MattBaish must be a really sucky #science teacher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrrrrgh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you know what’s a drain on our healthcare? #Warcriminals who have heart transplants. #DickCheney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way - @SpeakerPelosi - is this legal? Why are we letting a #traitorous #tyrant ruin our country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most #green card applicants don’t have #healthcare yet. I guess only the rich need apply?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess that #KanyeWest doesn’t know that the party of #Lincoln became #Democrats in the 60’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun story - my brother had 1 lemonade stand when we were kids. My Dad charged us for rent and supplies. We made nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do your damn job @senatemajldr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What DOES #Trump or #Putin have on you #LeningradLindsey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully I’ll see this one day. I’ve seen the #SherlockHolmes statue on #BakerSt. #ArthurConanDoyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention possibly got #Ukraine to agree to #capitulating to #Russia. A dark day for #American #allies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this man ever have any down time? #BenedictCumberbatch #MG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #AttorneyGeneral, head of #DOJ, is asking foreign govts to investigate #FBI and #CIA? #Traitor? Or didn’t read #MuellerReport?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SecretaryClinton - “Hold my beer”. Funny how all these #Republican white men are the real #snowflakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenRickScott - No one wants #socialism. We just want our #taxes to help #Americans instead of locking up and killing #innocent children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even worse- all of these countries are laughing at #Trump. Oh-and we had a deal with #Ukraine that #Trump tore up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - #TraitorTrump is desperate not to lose. He knows he’s going to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader wants to nick pit over common processes instead of focusing on #TrumpTreason. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone say sir? #MittRomney is a #patriot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP - @realDonaldTrump is corrupt. U r aiding &amp; abetting a #traitor. What more do you need than the public #declaration on the #SouthLawn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HillaryClinton didn’t commit #treason. You did @realDonaldTrump. Added to the #MuellerReport - you’re a #traitor and need to be #impeached<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskTarget Taunton MA on Moozone Blvd. I’ve already talked with a manager there. Thank-you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Party has nothing to do with #integrity. Unless you’re a #Republican- then all bets are off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As opposed to #propaganda wing #FauxNews ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As opposed to the fake #GOP protesters telling #ElizabethWarren to drop #impeachment and calling her #Pocahontas? #Racist losers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IvankaTrump wants to keep getting #trademarks from #China!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t have to @realDonaldTrump. That’s normal process. I’m more worried about you threatening #whistleblower life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So are you now going to call #Ukraine and #China on #ElizabethWarren? #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s the #WordForWord transcript?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both were #treason @realDonaldTrump. Your present obstruction on #documents and #taxes will add to your #ArticlesOfImpeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well when you owe hundreds of millions - #ReleaseTheTaxReturns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless and until #Israel ends it’s #apartheid against the #Palestinians, there will be no peace @DavidHarrisAJC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only families put first is the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember @seanhannity railing against #HillaryClinton because she dared 2 work on #healthcare instead of picking out #OvalOffice drapes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they will find themselves in #ArticlesOfImpeachment as it shows a pattern of #obstruction that is now in plain sight. #Checkmate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MoscowMitchTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #Poland agree to dig up dirt on #JoeBiden? #TrumpTower in #Warsaw? Do they have to show they have #healthcare? @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waaaahhhh!!!! @RepAdamSchiff made me sound like the #mob boss I am! Unfair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many #Chinese #trademarks is #Ivanka up to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio - the ultimate #weasel. Remember when #Fox and #Republicans were outraged by a #tan suit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you committed #treason publicly on the #SouthLawn. You’re asking our rival to investigate our #intelligence? #TRAITOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’re just clearing our throats @realDonaldTrump! #ImpeachmentTaskForce #ReleaseTheWordForWordTranscripts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spinning? Lying? Did you even read the testimony @seanhannity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering that #MoscowMitchTraitor is raising money from promising to stop #impeachment, I would say #Trump is more important than #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/HhFhRoUOTw Good if not frightening article. Read the comment by Tracy Edwards-well thought out and right on. #ImpeachTrump!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When #China is more patriotic than #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a lie @GOP. #Democrats were clear that they would support until he revealed his true colors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait! #1917<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #senior wants an end to the #Oligarchy @GOP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What about YOUR #corruption @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump put himself before everyone. #ImpeachTheMFTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr - Do you seriously believe that a bj is worse than #treason? #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr - DO YOUR JOBS! #MoscowMitchHatesAmerica #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hundreds of millions @ElayneBoosler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so perfect @SeanDylan13! Thanks for the laugh! (Though I’d prefer that it included the other usual suspects).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well he DID cancel #veteran’s dental benefits and locked #children in #cages and refuse to #vaccinate them so there’s that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not 2 mention #infrastructure, #guncontrol &amp; over #300bills. Or is it @senatemajldr? Unlike #Republicans the #Democrats can walk &amp; chew gum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do in the #US but in the #UK that’s what they call #suspenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody seems to be ignoring that #Ukraine is standing down in #Donbas region. Another triumph for #Putin. Wonder if that was on the call?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WTF? Not only is #Barr not doing his job, he’s wasting our money. Disgraceful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Putin’s long term strategy. Reform the #USSR wit #Trump’s approval. See #Putin’s #Helsinki speech about the #Baltic states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably the reason for the urgent hearing. #ImpeachBarrAndTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sharks said no. They have their standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting. Wonder if #Trump’s loyalty to #Putin comes into play! #Ukraine must not give in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrifying! #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually liked the braces until the Veuve Cliquot affair! 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump has a LONG history of destroying records and no respect for rule of law. All records must be locked down NOW!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The things that #Jesus cared about and #Trumpsters don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Grifts. Looks stupid at international meetings. Gets #trademarks in #China and #Japan. Parties with #Putin’s daughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waaaahhh!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry #Barr. Go read your #Constitution. It’s called #obstruction. #ImpeachBarrAndTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if #Barr is going to try to block that. #ImpeachBarrAndTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredFleitz -you are #repugnant. Your characterisation of the #whistleblower was purely #partisan. #Trump threatens him, bounty on head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please. #TraitorTrump is waging war on 300 million of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would #FBI &amp; #DNC try a #coup? They’re not. They’re doing their job. As opposed 2 #Trump asking #foreign gives 2 investigate #FBI &amp; #CIA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says the guy who led an #impeachment over an #affair-something you were doing as well. Slither away #Newt - you’re irrelevant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FakeNews! So in the history of our country he’s the only one with a #coup? Yeah right. He’s scared that he’s going to #prison.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The absolute #arrogance of the entire #Trump administration is breathtaking.  #MikePompeo needs to be charged with #obstruction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He was good. #BenedictCumberbatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>☹️ The feeling you get when you click on #NewtGingrich and it isn’t an #obit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give it up @GOP! #Trump is a #crook and he’s taking you down with him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So - this is the only time an election wasn’t honored? Really????? Maybe #Trump is a #criminal?????? @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You forgot # Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were both jokes @seanhannity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Waaaahhhh!!!!! #Snowflake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was summarizing @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Democratic House passed 395 bills including #GunControl and lowering #PrescriptionPrices. Talk to #MassacreMitchMcConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s sad to realize what might have been- #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Failed on a reality show. #LoserTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The investigation is just beginning @KrisKobach1787. Or are you just going to declare #Trump innocent no matter what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice #propaganda @GOPChairwoman. No one is trying to negate an #election or votes. It’s just the majority of us are sick of #corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How demented #Trump is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gorgeous! #BenedictCumberbatch #LouisWain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP- #Trump betrayed our nation. All #Americans need to witness the hearings. We can no longer trust the #Republicans especially Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #CivilRights. #NARAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The turning point has started- #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh the irony!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you lost your credibility in the 80’s! Tick tock-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you’ve been layy#siege to the #Constitution since you got elected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s about time @IngrahamAngle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>11. #GretaThunberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Waaaahhh!!! It’s supposed to be all about MEEE!!! Well @realDonaldTrump -it is. #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does @realDonaldTrump turn everything into a #campaign commercial? And are we paying for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - So what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump -We aren’t a nation of God. Our #FoundingFathers removed #religion FROM #government. We are a #secular nation of #laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously- who dresses like this for the #U.N.? And forgets a piece of foundation wear? #IvankaTrump - you Shame #US.  https://t.co/J13iuttwWq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ImpeachmentInquiry does away with all those pesky cover-ups and stonewalling. #Subpoenas now have a new bite. Buckle your seatbelts-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how you’re the only president in history to be #harassed @realDonaldTrump. #Birther movement anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does this matter? Hint - it doesn’t. Just a #smear tactic @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How poetic! #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank-you #PresidentObama!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don’t forget the #whistleblower complaint @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much you want to bet it’s been doctored?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Threatening #Ukraine to get them to smear a #presidential candidate is not ok @BillOReilly. Neither is obstructing #justice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He looks like a cornered #rat here. #ImpeachTrumpNowNANCY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #Trump included in the picture?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto the rest of us @realDonaldTrump. Although I prefer #PresidentElizabethWarren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By wiping out #Kashmir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or being provided by #JeffreyEpstein<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cool hat @scottderrickson #Marvel #DrStrange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looks the great #unifier is #pissed. Great empathy @realDonaldTrump. No good #photo-ops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget that he complained about #SherrodBrown and #NanWhaley because they didn’t acknowledge his “rock star” treatment. #Trump’s nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ICEIsTheNewSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump told us he was going to get rid of #MS-13. Instead he’s #caging #children and taking away their parents. #AbolishICE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How is this a threat @IngrahamAngle? It’s time for @senatemajldr to stop stonewalling #House bills!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You built your whole campaign on #racism! You &amp; the #MAGA crowd won’t acknowledge it because you’re too busy squealing about white genocide!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So true. A legend in his own mind. #LoserTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #Trump was dictating after he saw @SenSherrodBrown and @nanwhaley share concerns (even though they were positive about him)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So #Trump is changing his game plan @GOP? Is he just going to go with full on #corruption?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad but true. Imagine a president who fans #hate for political purposes. That’s #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a #loser<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #ElPaso shooter quoted your #racist #rhetoric. That doesn’t scream #unity @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP-and they can continue trying to spread the lie. Meanwhile #Mueller has given enough #data to start #ImpeachmentInquiry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #KimKardashian didyadvocate for #OttoWarmbier or #JamalKhashoggi. Truly ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t this #illegal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we know why #TraitorTrump is attacking #ElijahCumminga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do these #lobbyists work for the #Russian company who bought the voting machines #MoscowMitch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You #despicable #POS. Ev n @VP visit showed dangerous crowding. I believe @ewarren and @AOC before you and any #lying #Republican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you NO decency? Calling out a #rep who disagrees with you? The #Nazis had a show #concentration camp as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packing the #SupremeCourt to do your bidding is a disgrace. #Congress controls the purse - not you! You are #bankrupting this country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong @TomiLahren. It’s the bosses HIRING the #illegals 4 less that’s suppressing #wages. Put blame where it belongs! On the ruling class!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major loss for the country. The #SupremeCourt took another power away from #Congress in the move to make #Trump a #dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read that #Trump can steal $2.5billion from #military budget for wall that #Congress voted against. #WTF is wrong with my country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THANK-YOU @HouseJudiciary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You missed it @FoxNews @TeamTrump. #RobertMueller may have been slow and deliberate, but it showed without question that #Trump is #guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a 62 yo white woman &amp; I agree w/all statements @Liz_Wheeler. Oh-and #ImpeachmentInquiryNow #VoteRethuglicansOut Investigate #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe @FLOTUS should go back to #Slovenia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AbolishICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What @realDonaldTrump has done to our country should never be allowed to happen again! #ImpeachmentInquiryNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a disgrace! #AbolishICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryFalwellJr - bad enough u own a #stake in a weapons mfgr. #Jesus would #smite you up the head if he was here &amp; tell you to pay #taxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryFalwellJr -I’ve just read that u have turned #tax exempt #LibertyUniversity into a #TrumpCult organisation. Bad enough about #pool boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much worse than #lethal #chokeholds, shooting children &amp; unarmed #adults who happen to be #black and #brown. #Police must be #accountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #NancyGoodman shouldn’t dine out in public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember @seanhannity criticizing #HillaryClinton coz she was too busy w/health care 2 pick out #drapes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans &amp; #FoxNews have attacked #HillaryClinton since 1992.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also visited #Mar-A-Lago AND there’s an #child #rape complaint against #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah-keep trying guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinCow would do better #California. Signed, A #Patriot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr - are you blocking #election security laws to ensure you get #re-elected with #Russian and #Chinese $$$ and #meddling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr - #Voting security is not a #state issue - not when it’s #Federal elections. #VotingRights is in the #Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cindyhydesmith Shame on you for blocking #voting security. Let me guess-you want a way to block #voter rights as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately the #coal miners are finding out that @senatemajldr cares only about the #rich and their #tax cuts on your backs (or lungs)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC doesn’t care about #USA. Only #Trump, #golf, and #Russian money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So - now #SteveMnuchin is helping the #Russians steal the election by allowing them to buy the voting machines?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Override the #veto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RobertMueller isn’t a showboated. He’s still more coherent than @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMFlint At least he got his message across- #Trump is not innocent.Trump’s #campaign worked with #Russians #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMFlint I disagree w/your assessment of #RobertMuellerTestimony. Having been there myself, I can say that he was careful &amp; principled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes @Jim_Jordan we’re clearly in damage control mode. @realDonaldTrump &amp; co must’ve been pretty scared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually I think #WilliamBarr is just starting. Thank-you #RobertMueller for exposing #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC - Time will tell whatTrump &amp; #Russians have on you. Meanwhile- shame on you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong. #RobertMueller made it clear that uvcan b #indicted 4 your actions &amp;!could not be #exonerated despite all the BS from your #minions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which you seem incapable of speaking @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holding #Trump accountable will keep our country safe @GOP. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has never been a more #corrupt #administration than #Trump. There. Fixed it for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. #Trump is now consorting with #Chinese spies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh - and how many #guilty charges?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was eligible for #indictment. The other #BS is purely #red herrings from an unhinged @GOP. Can’t wait for this dark time to be over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @JaySekulow. I know the #TrumpTurds will fall in line but the rest of us saw a #reticent but #honorable man say that @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait for the day #WilliamBarr and @realDonaldTrump are #impeached. I’m patient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @GOP valued #free speech? No?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice try @replouiegohmert . #Orwell would be proud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenmnuchin1 uh - YOU helped with the demise of #Sears along with your #hedge fund friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um - I don’t think that’s appropriate or correct. @DonaldJTrumpJr however is doing a splendid impersonation of the #villageidiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi - can we #ImpeachTrumpNow ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Republicans and #FoxNews are spinning this faster than a #tornado. Unfortunately people will believe them. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes - Please abdicate your seat to @DevinCow you #ignorant mass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They certainly are trying to #deflect from the core message - @realDonaldTrump should be #indicted. Worse part is he’ll do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad part is that @realDonaldTrump just sees them as marks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So? #RobertMueller is testifying truthfully about 3 years of data. He doesn’t make stuff up - unlike you @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh - coz #HillaryClinton didn’t accept help from #Russians  @BillOReilly ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP -I don’t consider forcing “Christianity” (aka #hypocrisy) &amp; bigotry against diff colors, religions, or #genders “religious liberty”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aging’s a bitch hon. Especially when you realize that our #Republic has been hijacked by soulless losers led by a #Russian #asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don’t know about u but #RobertMueller is being very deliberate and careful with his #testimony. Something u prob don’t get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not sure #ChristopherSteele was lying. You’re talking about an #MI6 agent who is an expert on #Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah @realDonaldTrump - keep saying that. #RobertMueller just called you out for lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don’t know #ChristopherSteele lied. We do know that #Trump worked w/ #Wikileaks &amp; #obstructed the investigation. Nice try @RepMattGaetz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How exactly would #RobertMueller determine that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-coz they did nothing wrong @realDonaldTrump? Also - wasn’t in the scope of his investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real question is why Republicans are hammering on the #Steele Dossier #Deflection. Deflection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep wishing @KatiePavlich. Take home message - #RobertMueller did not #exonerate @realDonaldTrump. Boo yah! Read the damn report!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera -disappointing that ur back defending #RacistTrump. You are wrong however-it’s #Trump and the #GOP that are sabotaging #aUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We didn’t agree to you using #WilliamBarr to #obstruct #justice @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting! This is why the #police distrust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry @RandPaul - I’m sure #GrifterTrump will still invite you to #golf with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They didn’t have papers. So the #Nazis are ignoring the #Constitution?  Of course they are! They’re locking up #citizens. #AbolishICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or less men @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No - we’re in a #Trumpism nightmare @GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad thing is that he and the #TrumpTurds believe it. Time to burst that bubble!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing - looks like the #armbands are starting to show up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit @realDonaldTrump! It gives great victories to #arms manufacturers and their #stockholders like @JerryFalwellJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage is a lying #weasel. He should be shot for lying about #Brexit then lying about his lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only #rigging is by you and your #criminal #AG. #ReleaseTrumpsTaxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The addition was in response to your and #WilliamBarr’s disgraceful attempt to #obstruct justice again @realDonaldTrump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OUR money you tear @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off @RandPaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Asshole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump promised to defend the #Constitution when he took office. He has failed at every turn. Time to fire his ass! #Emoluments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this is why many of us have issues with #Israel? #Apartheid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is wrong. What is wrong with #Israel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe #Israel is an #apartheid state &amp; should be treated like #SouthAfrica. That does not make me #anti-Semitic - just pro human rights!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarding #IlhanOmar - she’s right. #SheldonAdelson gives millions to advance #Israel’s interests. We give #Israel #$38billion per yr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I disagree. @RashidaTlaib spoke about the calming feeling she had about her relatives helping #Jews during the #Holocaust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @realDonaldTrump -these women love r country as do the rest of us who despise your policies. Why did @RandPaul go against #1stResponders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul - We send #Israel $38billion a year. Shouldn’t we spend that on our #1stResponders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Israel is a booming economy, then why do we send them #$38billion a yr @realDonaldTrump? Certainly this could pay 4 the #1stResponders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it does. You screwed up @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is running scared. Funny how the #MainstreamMedia matches #foreign reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get #FoxNews off the air! At least @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle and @foxandfriends! Totally misleading the public. #Propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seem awfully nervous @realDonaldTrump. #MuellerTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the #Squad is racist @realDonaldTrump? Nice deflection! Keep digging that hole!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s next? #kidsincages? Oh - wait- #WyomingValleyWestSchoolDistrict<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans? Every Dirtbag in #WyomingValleyWestSchool that had a hand in this needs to be publicly named, shamed, and FIRED!!!! #FU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ElectoralCollege was set up so wealthy #slaveowners would equalise their vote with Northeners. Time to end it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #KanyeWest and #KimKardashian could advocate for them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re afraid that the #TrumpTurds will see the truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C’mon @natasharothwrll - he’s white!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AnnaWintour once again proves herself the #Queen of the fashion world. She’s absolutely right about @MichelleObama being best #FirstLady!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not luck @realDonaldTrump - strong work. She represents the best of #immigration and #America. You represent the worst of #entitlement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a time when we have #TraitorTrump, a criminally complicit @GOP, I am outraged that an actual #patriot is locked up. #RealityWinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair enough. But-if it occurred, then this guy needs to be publicly shamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise - what about the #150bills   @senatemajldr is holding up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsericathomas - too bad you didn’t record the mfker so he could be publicly shamed. #IStandwithErica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually #ATrumpNeverPaysHisDebts #MuellerIsComing #GameOfImpeachments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought u loved the military @GOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump? Oh-I guess it’s just #arms manufacturers. #Trump’s a master in not paying his bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GameOfImpeachments #MuellerIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #RacistInChief underline those passages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about male trainees?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The image of #KellyanneConway on #bathsalts is truly terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much from #Russia? #MitchMcConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lay the rise of #racism squarely at the feet of @realDonaldTrump and the do nothing #GOP. #IStandwithErica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizwheeler_  -There’s still gray states. The2 worst #presidents in history lost #popular vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arothmanhistory - we need to eliminate #ElectoralCollege. Someone in a #subsidised #red state should not have more power than #blue states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump didn’t pay #taxes. #Trump bankrupted his #casinos. #Pequot r still going strong 26 yrs later. He makes excuses about being a #loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A liar and fake person. And she teaches kids. No wonder #Trump loves the #uneducated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These street paintings are amazing! #SignsYourHouseIsHaunted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls -as a #RPh x38 yrs I say it’s time 2 cut out middle man. Better buying power w/ 345 million subscribers. #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Insurance companies and their #CEO’s make money off denying care, high coats, forcypts into specific physicians and #facilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the bigger problem is #rightwing rich people &amp; #corporations, including r so called “president” not paying their fair share of #tax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #anti-semitism is the new #dogwhistle? You do know #Semites include #Arabs????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RashidaTilab and the #WashingtonPost is correct. Read unbiased history of the #MiddleEast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #DailyCaller? Seriously? A #Nazi publication?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Semite” includes #Jews &amp; #Arabs. #IlhanOmar is suggesting #BDS 4 #Israeli #apartheid against #Palestinians. We did this with #SouthAfrica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foul mouthed? That’s rich coming from you @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way - where are the #mining proceeds going for OUR land? In your pocket. @TeamPelosi  @ewarren please watch this. #Corrupt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are delusional and getting worse. #IlhanOmar loves our country- she hates your policies. We the people owe you 0. You work for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re a pathetic #blowhard @realDonaldTrump. only thing you’re responsible for is your #racist rallies &amp; #disrespect for the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t understand why #SteveMiller is so racist. Weren’t his grandparents in #concentration camps? They should beat the crap out of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What #NadiaMurad doesn’t realize is that she’s talking to the #RapistInChief. Her experience means nothing to him. #22accusers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/nqDVg94BJf I thought it was only #Christians that were being #persecuted? LikeTrump cares. Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never happen. Thank-you #PresidentObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AngelaMerkel rocks! But then -her country is going through what we are now. #NaziGermany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - stop embarrassing #US!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HappyBirthdayBenedictCumberbatch! Wishing you a very happy 43rd!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul obviously didn’t feel ok talking w/out the #propaganda machine. #DISGRACEFUL! BTW- how was ur million $ golf game w/ #Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No hurt. Disappointment maybe. Maybe even disgust. Like the poop emoji!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpTurds are destroying #America. There. Fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simplygrace75 - I love my country. I hate that we’re becoming a #Nazi state. #1stAmendment #IStandWithIlhanOmar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheConservati19 - #Trump has done a great job fooling you. You can love your country and hate its policies like I do. Remember #VietNam?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why does she have to @w_terrence? Coz she’s #Muslim? How about the #GOP condemn #Trump. Or better yet have #Trump condemn #Epstein.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The sad part is that dirty #Europeans brought #smallpox #flu #commoncold &amp; #measles. Only reason we’re still here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New name for #Trumpsters - #TrumpTurds. Can someone figure out an armband with 2 T’s? Something historic perhaps? #IStandWithIlhanOmar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately @realDonaldTrump doesn’t understand history. Neither do his #minions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyannaPressley hits the nail on the head. Make no mistake- this is the rise of #Fascism disguised as #patriotism and #Christianity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They have nothing to apologize for @realDonaldTrump. Now apologize to the #Palestinians #Syrians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or set up a #theocracy in the name of #religious freedom that resulted in 20  #colonists being murdered along w/untold number of #1stNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @LindseyGrahamSC and @VP. These guys are #ConcentrationCamp guards. And you look like the #SS doing an inspection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much #Russian money. @LindseyGrahamSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/nTnyLCwWJL  #LenBlavatnik #OlegDeripaska #Viktor Vekselberg FOLLOW THE MONEY! @LindseyGrahamSC is dirty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC - That’s the term #Hitler used to divide #Germany. #migrant guards #concentration camp guards. You are a disgrace to #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with the #Squad. R country used 2 b great before u profaned the office of the presidency @realDonaldTrump My ancestors here in 1620<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenAttiah - let’s keep the attention where it belongs  on #RacistInChief. The #Republicans and #Trump would love to divert attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s face it- #Trump is here because his own grandfather was kicked out of #Bavaria. They were smarter than us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lying POS @realDonaldTrump. Those #tariffs? Are increased costs to #Americans. #Farmers going bankrupt and committing suicide. maga?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #Israel is an #apartheid state. No one owes you an apology. You should apologize for being the worst president in history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - obviously you’re not familiar with our #Constitution esp the #1stAmendment. #USA was built on #protest and #dissent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what are you going to do about it @RepJerryNadler? Every day without an #impeachment is one day closer to #NaziGermany. Time to stop this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I prefer to think how much better it will be under #PresidentElizabethWarren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheGreatestThreatIn4Words I’m only following orders<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good one! #LiveFromWhiteHouseSpyCam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frightening! #Trump mad he doesn’t have more followers &amp; likes so he wants 2 control #Twitter? M/b ppl are sick of ur sh*t @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop blaming my #religion 4 your #misogyny. If you can’t control yourself around women then you shouldn’t be #governor. #MS deserves better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have disdain for the wannabe #Dictator in the #WH and the #ICE and #CBP who are “following orders”. Nothing more #American than dissent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At what point do you determine #Trump is too big a danger to our country to not #impeach? He’s the enemy, not the #squad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And wore a tan suit @bryanbehar. Don’t forget the #tan suit of wrath! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re a legend in your own mind @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s sad that ANYONE would believe you. You are single handedly destroying the #environment by removing protections. @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - Everything you touch dies. Not satisfied with #democratic process you’re now playing with people’s lives. #Loser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @realDonaldTrump - you’re not our #king. #SCOTUS is correct- the #citizenship question is #racist and anti-immigrant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh but it’s the #Honduran’s fault right @realDonaldTrump? Was #CBP just following orders? The new #AbuGhraib #TrumpCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that the reason you kiss #Putin’s, Kim’s, and ABS’s asses @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SupremeCourt said no. Your job is 2 respect #ConstitutionalSeparationOfPowers. U have a lot of nerve acting like a #king during #July4th<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All #gerrymandering must end @chiproytx. And I do not believe in the citizen question. Doesn’t take into account #green card and #refugees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So much for carrying out the people’s wishes. #Republicans want to rule and return us back to some #theocratic #feudal system,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Trump decided to make it more #cruel @GOP? #Dubya and #Cheney had 8 years as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crisis is what #Trump is doing. @GOP. We do not need a wall!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He always looks so pleased with himself when not having a #tantrum. The ultimate #brat. NOT presidential. #DonnyDiaperPants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @realDonaldTrump -law is the law. You’ve got your #gerrymandering!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #Republicans are making a killing in the stock market and don’t want to pay! How about the #MiddleClass tax cut @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It means #Congress has to authorise the law. #Trump can’t do it on his own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC - I’m not radical left. I’m a #patriot. And I can’t believe the way you’re sucking up to a #traitorous #tyrant w/ no morals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quake with fear #Mitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s depressing 2 read @realDonaldTrump constant assault on truth &amp; realize that people believe him. Now #Biden did what #Trump is doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Zygotes and #embryos are not children. I respect your beliefs and per the #1stAmendment you have to respect mine @frfrankpavone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanetMorana - 0. Stop trying to equate #zygotes and #embryos to #children. I’m more worried about the #children in #TrumpCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did not GIVE cash to the #Iranians. We sent them their OWN DAMN MONEY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just go to any #mall. The retail sector is dying a slow painful death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! The #immigrants aren’t stealing jobs-the people in charge choose to hire them. As usual the #Trumpers are blaming the wrong people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CFR45 already allows a path for #asylum. #Trump and the #ICE goon squad keep breaking it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cite your reference. Then tell me how many #children died in detention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer is much more nuanced. Late term #abortion may be necessary for any number of medical reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the #Republicans screwed it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crisis is real. You caused it @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #DemocraticHouse also passed a bill @realDonaldTrump. Guess it was too warm and fuzzy for @senatemajldr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re delusional @realDonaldTrump. Hope everyone coughs at G20. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great read. These so called “Christians” are anything but. They also want to undermine our #Constitution and #freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I urge everyone to watch this. #Trump is telling the #ChristianRight that he supports undermining our #Constitution. Check #ProjectBlitz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How? By locking people up in #TrumpCamps @GOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure that #Jesus never made a #payroll @JerryFalwellJr. You’ve done a good job of exposing yourself as a hypocritical #Pharisee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure #Jesus never made a #payroll @JerryFalwellJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly to think that I wasted so much time watching your show. Dude- you’re #irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh @BillOReilly - that’s absolutely correct. My ancestors came over in the #Mayflower and they screwed anyone who wasn’t like them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And illegal. #CFR45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lie @GOP @KellyannePolls. #Trump vetoed a #bipartisan proposal 4 #immigration because he didn’t get money 4 the wall. He owns #TrumpCamps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was an agreement @KellyannePolls. Your boss ripped it up and caused this mess. Wouldn’t be surprised if this is 4 the #Saudis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Traitor is posing as president @IngrahamAngle #SenatorHarris is correct. Why are we even provoking #Iran? #Saudis orders to #Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know ur job is #propaganda 4 #Trump but #SenatorHarris is right.This is #Trump’s mess. Meanwhile he’s in bed w/the #Saudis @IngrahamAngle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2 best #FirstLadies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP - What about that religious freedom then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Throwing #refugees into #TrumpCamps is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - you do not represent what’s good about #America. Congrats for destroying my country. #TrumpCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumpsters are the true #snowflakes.  The #border crisis is as phoney as the #Iran one-mfgrd solely by #Trump. #TrumpCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good read with an excellent observation on #CNN’s ongoing inability to focus on important news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a renotiation @GOP - just a slightly revised version. But of course #Trump’s signature is on it instead of #PresidentObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re the one who caused this crisis @realDonaldTrump by pulling out of the #Iran treaty. Why are you giving #nuclear tech to #Saudis? $$?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cute! #Johnlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that there should be mass protests and an appearance by the #TrumpBabyBlimp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the script for #BuildingTheWall @realTrumpClone. It’s available on #Amazon. The play is chilling, and happening before our eyes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#LouiseLinton is such a smug c**t. Where’s @realDonaldTrump taxes? Why isn’t #SteveMnuchin in jail for #contempt?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>God. @realDonaldTrump’s pose resembles #Hitler. Goes w/ #ConcentrationCamps r turning 2 #DeathCamps &amp; the #ICE starts mass p/ups 2morrow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think it was the #Saudis who attacked those ships. They want #Iran gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #hypocrisy of #FauxNews is breathtaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a #liar @realDonaldTrump. I’ve seen your cover. Are you going to arrest them if they don’t change to this one? @TeamPelosi? #IMPEACH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add this to the #impeachment charges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t #Congress supposed to authorise this? Ready to #impeach now @TeamPelosi?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So sorry for your loss @LucianRandolph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fuckers. Guess they’re just following orders - like the #Nazis. #CBP #ICE #ConcentrationCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s the average salary? I think that metric is important @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No #RoyMoore - it’s because you’re an accused #pedophile wrapping yourself in a #flag and waving the #bible. No one buys your lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah coz cancelling a treaty, forcing other countries 2 honor #sanctions, #troop buildup in the region’s responsible. We’ve become #bullies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it! #HarrietTubman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You caused this by pulling out of the #IranDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better idea - honor the treaty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL. #Iran is not the problem. #Trump #Bolton and #Pompeo are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#America is being the aggressor here. #Trump screwing up yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit @SenTomCotton. We shouldn’t b selling arms 2 #SaudiArabia. Whole “crisis” is providing cover 4 #Trump. We’re the #dangerous ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a crisis manufactured by #Trump to help his buddies the #Saudis. God help you if you start a war @LindseyGrahamSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @DonaldJTrumpJr - concrete floors, no soap or toothbrushes, overcrowding. They’re #ConcentrationCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SERIOUSLY @TeamPelosi? When are you going to get rid of this #grifter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And make it easier for #Trump to ignore #Congress’ ban on #nuclear weapons to #SaudiArabia. And shut down #House investigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Waahhh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecOfState7O is yet another shill for #SaudiArabia. All because we want to sell them #nuclear technology. Oh-they execute #teenagers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What do you expect for #concentrationcamps. Are we going to continue to sit back like the #Germans in the 30’s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - It takes a special kind of #loser 4. a #coward like you 2 demand a #militaryparade and US pay for your rally. #IMPEACH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are full of shit. For those of us not in the stock market- our #retailers are disappearing and #infrastructure crumbling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe #Iran. #Trump needs a war to end the #investigation. Remove his war powers now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps the #antichrist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we have #Trump’s taxes yet @SenSchumer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately @TeamPelosi is playing old politics. She needs to pull out the #hydrogen bomb for this crowd or be labelled weak!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t be surprised if #Trump had #Kompromat compliments of the #Russians for the whole damn gang (including bribes).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I highly recommend reading the #script for #BuildingTheWall. Our #Republic is as in serious trouble as the #WeimarRepublic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting nervous @realDonaldTrump ? #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders - Seriously? #ElizabethWarren has policies ready to go. The #banks fear her as much as they do you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better idea-stop taking #refugee children away from their parents. Close the #ConcentrationCamps. Stop paying for #Trumps weekly vacations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BS. #Trump supports a murderous country that gives him money. He stirred up this pot, not #Iran. War privileges must be removed from him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also discussed integrity of #FBI &amp; all in #investigation despite ur smears. Unfortunately ur #base will just read your tweets, not report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re right @realDonaldTrump. #Mueller couldn’t #exonerate you, couldn’t #indict coz of #DOJ policies, and didn’t work with #Barr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/pnl0ThpUHn So #Mueller is now a private citizen. Acknowledged #integrity of his team. Didn’t have anything to do w/ #Barr BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - explain why #binLaden raid wrong-are #Saudis upset? #IraqWar was #DickCheney, #Halliburton, and #GeorgeWBush. Nice try.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good luck with @senatemajldr blocking legislation. Guess he doesn’t want @ElaineChao to lose her #cabinet position. #VoteRethugsOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have more sympathy for the people that #Trump is screwing over @LindseyGrahamSC. Is it true that only white males get to be #victims?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is subverting the #Constitution. His powers must be curtailed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how much $ #Saudis r giving him personally? #Trump needs 2 b stripped of all unilateral power til we see #taxes &amp; hear from #Mueller.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Proving once again that these guys’ “religion” is a sham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump MUST be barred from doing any further business, including provoking #Iran, due to his conflicts of interest! #Emoluments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump and #MikePompeo- lying about #SaudiArabia being an important ally is BS. They spend a lot of $ at #Trump properties!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s all #Trump has. #NameCalling and #bullying. He’s #incompetent at everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly #Trump has decided to piss on his pledge to uphold the #Constitution. #1stAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #TraitorTrump and #Barr are now #colluding in plain sight? What’s the word for that again? #Congress needs to stop this now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know what’s worse-#Trump disrespecting our country by running as a publicity stunt or people who voted for him. Worse-still w/him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting! Shades of #ValeriePlame!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It really IS #treason to out a #CIA informant as you are asking #Barr to do, unlike your little #tempertantrum about #Comey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When do #criminals get 2 publish #confidential information that’ll harm #intelligence community? You’re going from #incompetent 2 #dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you’re ok with outing undercover agents in #Russia. Is that your own skin you’re saving or #Vlad’s? #TraitorTrump #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would say that the #JamalKhashogghi murder qualifies for 4.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Take him down @SpeakerPelosi! #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump - #RobertMueller laid out a case for #Congress to pursue and #Impeach for #ObstructionOfJustice. Your #lies won’t save you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because @senatemajldr needs the #Russians to get re-elected @SenSchumer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today is the day that #WhiteHouse counsel gave a big middle finger to #Congress. #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When they go low we should be down there waiting for them. This fight is not for the faint of heart. #RoeVWade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that #Republican men r on a march to make everyone who is not a white, “Christian”, male into a #subservient class. Bonus if rich!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caught the blue scarf! Always fun to see #TowerBridge as well. #MGHector #BenedictCumberbatch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am curious as to where the #revolution is @SusanSarandon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>White “Christian” males are not the majority of people in this country. They need to stop acting like they get to tell everyone what to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And yet #Republicans do nothing. #Graham says he's not calling #Mueller and #McCahn to testify. Says #WilliamBarr slandered. DISGRACEFUL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are a #liar and #traitor. #MuellerReport was clear that you were dirty and #Congress should #impeach!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MayThe4thBeWithYou #Chewbacca and #PrincessLeia #StarWarsDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Trump is supporting Freedom Of Speech, then why is he attacking the media and #SNL @CarmineSabia? Why won't he let #McGahn testify?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are a pathetic #Putin lapdog and #traitor. Too bad there are people who support you. #IMPEACHDONALDTRUMPNOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DonaldTrump is bankrupting &amp; destroying this country the same way that he did with all his businesses. #Taxpayers will be stuck w/the bill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was open news years ago. Why isn't the #MSM hammering on this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a total #loser and an embarrassment to our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he's calling for #Obama and #Clinton along with #FBI and #CIA to be investigated. He is out of control and the #Trumpsters don't GAS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hitler used the unions in #Germany to gain power. Then he abolished them. #ImpeachDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ImpeachDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't worry @IngrahamAngle - #NancyPelosi will take care of #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whole #Trump sham investigation is a giant smokescreen to drown out the #MuellerReport. #Trump MUST be #impeached before we sink further<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump can discuss the #MuellerReport with #Putin but doesn't want #Mueller &amp; #McCahn to discuss with #Congress? This is wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a mean? Is this the #CEO's driving up the numbers? How come there are so many #homeless and #hungry???? @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah-thanks to #Trump suck up #LindseyGraham and #WilliamBarr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DaveDaubenmire has a lot of nerve calling himself a #patriot &amp; #Christian &amp; wearing a cross on his hat. This is out of the #Nazi playbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader - #Congress must conduct its investigation first. Saying #nocollusionduetostupidity does not warrant an apology!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember also that we can #indict #TraitorTrump once he's out of office. The bigger prize, in my opinion, is getting rid of #MitchMcConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waaahhh! What a friggin baby! #TraitorTrump is unfit for office!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Face it - #TraitorTrump knows he's f**ked. He's just delaying the inevitable, or waiting 4 #MitchMcConnell 2 figure out how to rig elections<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So #WilliamBarr admitted that there were signs of #obstruction and he chose to disagree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction - #RobertMueller left the decision to others. Still shows differing opinions between independent counsel and #Trump'sBitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which mean 60% believed that #MuellerInvestigation succeeded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full on BS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraitorTrump did not testify. That's not fully cooperating @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there's a legal way to disseminate hacked emails? #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called cover-up. I'm sure #Congress is just clearing their throat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WilliamBarr tried to exonerate #TraitorTrump. He failed. Trump showed #obstructionofjustice repeatedly. He didn't even testify!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow mstevano_b. Curious as to your background. Can you please give examples of your claim? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're a pathological #liar @realDonaldTrump. No one believes you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unfortunately the real problem is his base. #Trumpsters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hitler also controlled the journalistic narrative w/endless rallies &amp; complained about unfair opposition &amp; press. 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything @realDonaldTrump does is 2 control the conversation and keep himself in the news so he can keep his base riled. Just like #Hitler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about we start tracking #WhiteSupremacists. They're much more dangerous than #Muslims.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan turned a blind eye to sexual assault at his college. No wonder he doesn't want transparency!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews would report a book burning as a blow for truth. #JosefGoebbels would head the network. #MikeWallace and #ShepSmith only good ones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Time to get this monster out of office. He must not be allowed to destroy our country. #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  @LouDobbs It's 55% DISAPPROVAL rating, Donald. As usual #Fox is the bearer of #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men like #TonyTinderholt desperately need to control women either due to unwarranted ego or low self esteem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you doing about this @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit. @realDonaldTrump. We know your main objective is helping #Putin weaken #EU. #Brexit is bad for #U.K. in addition to #EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remove #ICE &amp; #CBP from #Trumps direction immediately. Trump's not upholding the #Constitution so is guilty of #dereliction of duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not #open borders to allow #refugees to apply for #asylum. It's #Federal and #InternationalLaw. #Trump wants to be above the law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like #Hitler and #Germany in the 30's.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry @MollyJongFast - had to. #TrumpTaxReturns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a coup going on and treason led by @senatemajldr with @realDonaldTrump as its face.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump is outing himself more every day as a #dictator in waiting. He's openly using #Hitler's bag of tricks. Sadly, his cult still follows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump doesn't care. He's never had to pay for his actions. He loves making others suffer. He wants to stay prez so he won't go to jail!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eff #Republicans. I'm a real #American, white, #middleclass, #Protestant, and don't believe one thing #Trump and his enablers are selling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong @realDonaldTrump. She's calling out #Netanyahu &amp; #Israel on their #Apartheid policies. Ur hiding behind #Jews to hide your #Nazi self!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi @SenSchumer @SenWarren @senatemajldr WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS??? #Trump is following #HitlersPlaybook!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Release the full #MuellerReport and we'll talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why his businesses went bankrupt-no attention to important matters while focusing on flash. We're next. #Trump is incompetent. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump wants 2 end #ACA, cut back #Medicare, #SocialSecurity, &amp; #Medicaid while spending billions on a #SpaceForce &amp; #wall. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Stay warm my #midwestern friends. I still remember when #NarragansettBay froze (-50) and my -50 degree sojourn in #Cleveland. Stay warm!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillCassidy The way to give patients power is to take it away from the insurance companies. #MedicareForAll  https://t.co/xvAP0H8A3p<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For #MedicareForAll. I work in healthcare and have seen how insurance co's work. Time to make them extinct. Also-absolutely no action should  https://t.co/gdLcFNq9U4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All of you senators and reps should get exactly the same insurance as the people who pay your salaries Next-we should remove insurance  https://t.co/gdLcFNq9U4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Excuse for a human being. Do you really believe that blue states should give up funding to red states who don't care about their people?  https://t.co/gdLcFNq9U4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chose to let their people suffer while withdrawing billions from states that have been successful in insuring people. You are a pathetic  https://t.co/gdLcFNq9U4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan Hint-it was based on unspeakable acts in the name of religion. Just like you fake Americans/Christians are trying to do today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan Separation of Church and State is what we were based on. Rethugs need to go back and read history and why that came about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan Here's an idea-start taxing them like corporations. They sure aren't houses of God but rather a perversion of my religion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan It is disgusting that you are trying to force your beliefs down my throats by allowing rich churches to donate to campaigns.<|endoftext|>
