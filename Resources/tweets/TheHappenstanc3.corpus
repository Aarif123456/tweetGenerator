<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots If a casino is going to steal $75 away from a player who deposits regularly that means their net loss would be $1,000 a year minimum. Get a bad reputation in the gambling circuit the casinos losses are in the millions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots There is when it comes to too much bull. This casino made a deal with me then they reneged and gave me the money back. Then I played and one more money and they stole that too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots Don't believe any offers you get from this casino it's all a trap they have ambiguous terms so if you take any bonus they will be able to steal your jackpot if you win. Casinos in Canada in the US are not allowed to do this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots This casinos management is so stupid they actually think it's better to rip a player off for $100 then to keep a repetitive and repeat customer who plays with them for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots This casino first ripped me off for $75 then offered to give it back to me with bizarre conditions. That's called coercion and it's illegal in Canada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildJackpots responsible and respectable gamblers stay far away from casinos that use ambiguous terms just so they can find a way to steal your they will give you free spins but in their terms and conditions there's a way for them to take your jackpot if you win.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Casinomeister A friend let me log into his #casinomeister account cowards go on talking about me knowing I can't respond and they're feeding gamblers misinformation about the truth behind bet versus cost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Casinomeister A respin is called a cost  because there is no risk on the money paid for each respin, you cannot get it back there is no money placed against the respin fee therefore it cannot be called a bet the bet is the amount on the slot machine is outlined in the menu  #KnowTheFacts  https://t.co/dJg8awnsro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Casinomeister Scammers would like you to disregard contract law and believe that a cost is the same thing as a bet and that scam casinos are allowed to use ambiguity to trick you into their trap nowhere in the BET menu or game info does it Define a respin cost as a bat #playamo  https://t.co/qGkYKMFjup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nowhere in the game info from #pragmaticplay or #microgaming does it mention the word bet for every spend it says that it is a cost and separate from the bet #casinomeister support scam casinos that use ambiguity to rip off players #playamo #law<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Casinomeister The cost you pay every time you come into the racetrack it's different and the bet you place on the horse do you understand now?

<|startoftext|>A bet has a reward to it the cost to get into the racetrack did not. A cost does not have a reward to it but the horse /fixed bet does #casinomiester  #playamo  a respin cost is a fee paid to get your fix bet to come in #GetTheFacts  https://t.co/Av6XRgxPeT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#casinomeister Canadian laws do not allow ambiguity to be used to scam gamblers a cost to purchase an event like a respin or early bonus it's not a bet #Playamo must say both are the same in the terms or it's #ambiguous #LCB #Canadianlaw  https://t.co/zek8AkUkY1<|endoftext|>
