<|startoftext|>@LLinWood @GaSecofState  https://t.co/wBD9YYI0Hv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, absolutely agree with @LLinWood that that Gates &amp; CCP connections are very concerning. I’m not taking it &amp; am praying for those who do. Not worth the risk. Everyone taking it is a test subject. There are no prior #vaccines like this. New technology. DO RESEARCH!!! #vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be prudent. Be cautious. Do research. Ask questions &amp; talk at length with your medical doctor. #vaccine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Both these governors stink. So does the throttling of free speech. Hello? @realDonaldTrump is the President of the United States of America.

<|startoftext|>Mr. Raffensperger would have been far more convincing if he’d attended the #GeorgiaHearing today, rather than holding this #PressConference. Slippery. #WeThePeople do not trust you.   https://t.co/I1fmuwl74m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So curious about this meeting! 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity #WeThePeople have concerns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree about the trains. We need to promote small businesses that people genuinely need. Covid has changed priorities. Not sure if actual paper books will ever again be as popular as ebooks but there needs to be realistic competition with amazon + other options for authors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DLoesch An ‘esteemed reporter’  lulz 😁🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller @GOPLeader So...she’s afraid of people who do research &amp; think for themselves?  Funny how she kept her eyes down after saying that.   Deep down she’s gotta know that #WeThePeople are done with the 🐑💩.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Well she’s wrong. This is about national security. Obviously they need background checks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSBNetwork Thank you!!! You’re juggling a lot &amp; doing a great job! ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 @marklevinshow @MariaBartiromo @GenFlynn @KrakenWood @LLinWood The fact that nothing happened after we learned she was being driven around by a #ChineseSpy for YEARS is completely baffling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was just reading a Seth Rich tweet with a doc pic &amp; it literally vanished when I opened the pic. Might have been one of yours but maybe someone else. Dang. I want to know what was in the doc! 🤨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@catturd2 Unless ur #Spywell...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr #DRAINTHESWAMP So ridiculous that these compromised individuals are serving in high places. #WeThePeople want better! TRUTH, TRANSPARENCY, and HONESTY PLEASE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav He should also be removed. Just saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoniTheDon_ @Lrod49 Her spin is she got death threats on her voicemail. Seems contrived or fabricated. Hopefully someone is looking at the phone data so we’ll know for sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GenFlynn @BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RudyGiuliani @JennaEllisEsq @SidneyPowell1 Why are they so determined to silence the questioners? Why do they refuse to have conversations about information found by citizen researchers?

<|startoftext|>@Johnheretohelp I have to believe they’ll be true to the Constitution &amp; their ethics. 🇺🇸🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I first saw the Chinese professor video I thought it had to be fake. I was wrong &amp; it’s real. Seeing this, my reaction is similar.  Real but unreal. Safe Harbor was meaningless so why beat the dead horse? #WeThePeople want the #TRUTH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RSBNetwork Hearing the LIE that the case (which is not Trump’s) is dead repeated on legacy tv &amp; radio is INCREDIBLY DISTURBING. #WeThePeople know the truth. MSM needs to REPORT it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodeMonkeyZ @ibcricket Gifts cultivate guanxi, which is an important part of Chinese culture (especially business). Give money to make money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang @CodeMonkeyZ! You’ve been busy!!! Thank you! #WeThePeople 🇺🇸 #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the comments. This doc came out September 23, 2020. That’s 11 weeks ago if anyone’s counting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is interesting:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@We_Have_Risen This particular individual (EIias) appears to spread a lot of lies &amp; disinformation. He tweeted about the PA case being denied / lost but that is untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LLinWood Apparently China has financial stakes in many of the DNA ancestry companies used by Americans.  It’s like the land &amp; other American businesses they’ve purchased. Crazy that we allowed this to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datavibe_io @redpillx2 Not sure if it was actually denied. It sounds like expediting was denied OR it was possibly denied because it’s being combined with other cases. Still looking into what’s really going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LLinWood @KLoeffler @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Question: Did none of the candidates get enough votes because of the fraud? Are we having the runoff because votes were stolen?  (Two questions...)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mareq16 Really good point. ❤️🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnheretohelp No. Just no. People were manipulated to believe they were being empowered. If the dems throw these low-level workers under the bus? Utterly despicable.

<|startoftext|>@zullo70 @OcrazioCornPop This meeting is a full display of dishonest swamp creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way this Georgia group is conducting themselves is also disgraceful. #SwampCreatures #DrainTheSwamp  #KrakensEatSwampCreatures #WeThePeople 🇺🇸 #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoClutchTruth @vazr00 @SCGalforLiberty @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Watch this. The meeting in Georgia is illustrating what @LLinWood &amp; @SidneyPowell1 said yesterday. #FightBack &amp; make it FAIR &amp; FREE OF FRAUD!!! #Georgia #WeThePeople 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN Stonewalling &amp; lies on full display. Last night we saw evidence of bullying &amp; threats in Michigan. Today in Georgia we’re seeing what @LLinWood &amp; @SidneyPowell1 spoke of at yesterday’s presser. #WeThePeople 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EnriqueTaylorr Watch this. It’s not about boycotting. It’s about fixing a broken corrupt system before voting. @LLinWood &amp; @SidneyPowell1 told us how corrupt Georgia is. Watch this &amp; see for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This meeting is a lie-fest. People denying evidence we’ve all seen. Sounding so perfectly reasonable as they LIE LIE LIE. Sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz Are you listening to the Georgia hearing?  This is a messed up state. They’re going to continue cheating. @LLinWood is asking for the system to be fixed. It’s not about boycotting the election it’s about making the process FAIR and FREE OF LYING. #WeThePeople 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #GeorgiaHearing seems like stonewalling.  Some of what I’m hearing doesn’t match the evidence we’ve seen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This was a shocking part of Wednesday’s hearing in #Gettysburg. Many people are aware of the pre-election theft of USB drives in PA. Coincidence that a suspicious baggie of drives was spotted on election day?  Doubtful. #StopTheSteaI #Evidence #KeepAmericaGreat #AmericaFirst 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I’m warned before liking my President’s tweet &amp; again before retweeting it. That disturbing. #censorship #TrumpWon #HoldTheLine #FightBack #KeepAmericaGreat #AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Truth! They’re loud &amp; the involvement of the MSM is disturbing but as @realDonaldTrump said, don’t let them intimidate you. At the same time, live your own truth because arguing &amp; fighting with crazies is what they want. Stay strong &amp; be kind, but mostly stay strong. #WeThePeople<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pepesgrandma It’s lawyer stuff. The tweet that got her suspended is a fairly dense article about Domin &amp; possible connections to other businesses &amp; VCs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might not be tomorrow. Possibly Wednesday, but maybe Friday. Tomorrow we may see PA move to SCOTUS + @RudyGiuliani’s crew may be filing some things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As more evidence is gathered &amp; the full situation comes into focus it’s apparent that the cases need to be split. What @SidneyPowell1 will file is bigger than the 2020 election. #DrainTheSwamp 🇺🇸 #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WeThePeople 🇺🇸 #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 #DrainTheSwamp 🇺🇸 THANK YOU @SidneyPowell1!  https://t.co/Qm6opmmHGe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh...this statement...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What statement?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s hard, but there’s a ton of evidence &amp; @SidneyPowell1’s team will be filing the fraud suits maybe Wednesday or probably Friday. Feeling hopeful tbh!  Try to smile if you can - maybe go for a walk. #HoldTheLine because #TheBestIsYetToCome ❤️ #WeThePeople 🇺🇸 #KrakenReleased 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or at least made an appearance at the fact-finding meeting in PA, rather than blowing it off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow.  This is surprising and not in a good way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to the cases that are being filed for #Thanksgiving 🇺🇸 @SidneyPowell1 &amp; @RudyGiuliani are doing an incredible job!  #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 #DrainTheSwamp 🇺🇸 #StopTheSteaI 🇺🇸  #WeThePeople 🇺🇸 #SaveAmerica 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did you skip the fact-finding meeting in PA last week? Why do your machines allow fractional votes? What was Eric Coomer’s role in your company? Why did your Toronto office suddenly close?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud cases might be ready for filing on Wednesday or maybe Friday. #Thanksgiving #Thankful Will be filed in multiple states! #StopTheSteaI 🇺🇸 #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 #Kraken 🇺🇸#DrainTheSwamp 🇺🇸 #KeepFighting 🇺🇸⛳️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going forward, things WILL change. Corruption is being exposed &amp; #WeThePeople  are demanding better.   Voting systems = made in the USA. @pepesgrandma has a great idea about tracking numbers. We need CURRENT voter lists + voter ID. Reimagine &amp; redesign.  https://t.co/6qSwKYalID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People telling Republicans to boycott elections or not pay taxes as a form of protest need to sit down. Yes, there’s fraud BUT MASSIVE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE VOTING FOR FREEDOM EXPOSED THE FRAUD!!! #vote #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 #Kraken #KrakenReleased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CiceroConsulta1 Huge turnout for @realDonaldTrump!  They were more prepared in 2020 than 2016 but an even larger response has resulted in the crazy we are seeing. Theft derailed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did you want to say? @JackPosobiec shared a pic of seated observers far away from the plexi. Very different from how it looked yesterday!!! #KeepAmericaGreat 🇺🇸 #StopTheSteal 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While she was presenting evidence!!! The ‘reporters’ who were there shouted about evidence BUT THE TEAM JUST PRESENTED EVIDENCE &amp; THE ‘REPORTERS’ WERE NOT EVEN LISTENING!!! They are so focused on their own agenda they can’t function. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greta The responsible thing is to wait - especially when everyone knows what the tension has been like since the 2016 election.  Investigate the claims.

<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec President Trump definitely does this. He’s here for US!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are trolls, right?  Crazy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimRenacci They want answers?  Most Americans don’t want socialism! Also, many Americans love President Trump.

<|startoftext|>If you haven’t listened to the whole thing yet you should. Be informed. Parts of this speech would have been powerful as a concession speech. Parts are concerning (think socialism). The idea that people ‘chose change over more of the same’ is laughable.    https://t.co/8q4HWAxLbf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_terrence But...the system is corrupt &amp; unAmerican &amp; ignores / disenfranchises us.  Where is the evidence that it is worthy of our trust?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheyCallMeTomO1 @GCando1 Seriously!  So many of these leftists are like spoiled kids. The contrast between them and @realDonaldTrump’s administration has always been very striking.

<|startoftext|>@Wizard_Predicts Yes please.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@P8R1OT There is no plan...unless you’re looking at the leftists. They had a plan. Conservatives can trust @TeamTrump to litigate &amp; fight. That’s the plan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Wait...didn’t Biden say no enemies?  Everyone’s friends?  Did someone miss that memo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Their hate isn’t going away. It’ll just be redirected. They have no clue what love &amp; acceptance are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially if the winners love America. Unfortunately, quite a few politicians love power more than country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec So strange! Cannot imagine why this would happen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sherwood_de @atkerr @DavidBegnaud Oui.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenimanon @DLoesch The language in the tweet from the Seattle Times is clearly biased and inflammatory. Really don’t think you can dispute that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He has done SO MUCH GOOD for America (&amp; the world) that it’s difficult to pick ONE best thing 😁 However, exposing government &amp; media rot is definitely a very significant one!!! 🇺🇸❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO All the MSM owned by a very small group. It’s no longer a large &amp; independent industry. No diversity of opinion + a huge platform = propaganda &amp; disinformation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So much “there’s no evidence” &amp; “Trump didn’t back it up with details” from the media!  Like if they keep insisting it’ll somehow become true.  It’s absolute 🐑💩!!! But they have the platform &amp; they keep insisting.  They’re comfortable &amp; confident in their reality. Disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually @realDonaldTrump will still be President of the United States.  The inauguration isn’t until January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We see the videos &amp; hear the anecdotes but don’t see the investigations (which ARE happening). @EricTrump &amp; @DonaldJTrumpJr have announced investigations + lawsuits filed for @realDonaldTrump. It’ll take time. The relentless noise &amp; bias from MSM is wearing. So obnoxious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hunh. No bias here at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp...more litigation &amp; recounting. People who think this will be resolved quickly need to take a breath &amp; think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElaineElle3 @DannyBaJa1000 @VanRothnRoll Unless someone adds random zeros to numbers so they’re multiplied by ten...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whaaat?!  NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Mayhem not of Trump’s creation but yes, he will navigate it. Pivotal time in American history. #TheBestIsYetToCome #Trump2020 #TrumpPence2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redwins3_first @SBelle1950 No... it’s totally believable. Kinda predictable tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joonyk1 @_Makada_ Not magic. Fraud. The legit votes need to be identified &amp; counted. Unfortunate that the leftists had to fabricate but the legit votes will be counted eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unscriptedmike @mouse458 Is that what the media is saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACTforAmerica @realDonaldTrump Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshdcaplan Will tune in! Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairBrandt It would be JUSTICE!!! ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What are the odds that there are more votes than registered voters in PA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav They added a zero. Crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler So many strong Republican victories!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionelMedia Yeah...scary good. It’s more subtle than expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking like legit votes are being rescued &amp; @POTUS is absolutely in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier We actually already have.  There’s just a lot of cheating &amp; obstruction going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @BillStepien @realDonaldTrump Thank you. 🇺🇸❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairBrandt We need all the LEGITIMATE ballots counted. Not just ‘all the ballots.’ Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who ultimately makes the calls?  Lawyers?  Courts?  It’s NOT up to media groups to decide (the New York Times said it was but then deleted, right?!)  Where is the REAL decision made?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairBrandt They haven’t called Alaska?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouse458 God, I love you &amp; I’m grateful for your blessings &amp; guidance. 🙏💛✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler Just need to count the legitimate votes &amp; remove the fraudulent ones. It’ll take time. There are other governments laughing right now. This is damaging America...after four years of BS investigations. Is the laptop investigation continuing?! What about covid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real destruction is the division &amp; distrust in our nation. It’s been planned &amp; coordinated for more than four years. @realDonaldTrump has done SO MUCH GOOD for America despite the attacks on him but the attacks are on America now. What is happening to our nation is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s about throwing a lot of mud in the water. It is further damaging our nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NapkinsJimmy @LevequeThots @EmeraldRobinson @atensnut All legal votes should be counted. It will take time to determine which are real &amp; which are fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The court will need to determine what’s real &amp; what’s fraud. Ridiculous. #Trump2020 #TrumpWon #Winning #DrainTheSwamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LevequeThots @EmeraldRobinson @atensnut True...sadly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We knew this was coming.  We knew the gaslighting would continue. We knew it would take time to sort out the real from the fraud. The reality of it is like jumping in an icy lake that we KNEW would be cold but until actually feeling it? It was just a hypothetical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec It will take time to sort out which votes are real &amp; which are fake. We all knew this would happen. Experiencing it is still rough. Prayers up for our nation. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much yes. This is the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairBrandt Fake news gets the last laugh. That’s power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our @POTUS will be speaking soon!!! 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d say you’re correct. Look at the data &amp; do the math.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Bill usually has the correct view of things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill If you look at the actual data &amp; do the math, @realDonaldTrump is clearly ahead with electoral votes. Super disturbing that it’s being distorted &amp; suppressed to look like Biden has an ‘edge.’  He doesn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionelMedia Suppression of electoral votes by google &amp; tv networks. Incredibly disturbing &amp; absolute 🐑💩<|endoftext|>
