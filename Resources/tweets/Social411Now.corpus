<|startoftext|>According to #CNN the remaining #Votes in #Pennsylvania have been BIGLY in favour of #BidenHarris2020 - the most recent batch of #MaiInBallots were 79.2% FOR #Biden! This is looking REALLY promising for #Biden2020!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet So very true - all the qualified experts have been replaced by #Trump sycophants and #Republican loyalists who value #Power and #Money over #American lives. #Putin got EXACTLY what he paid for with #CorruptGOP.   #PutinsPuppets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because it's leading the world in #Covid_19 infections.😨  "Coronavirus: #US leads in global recoveries" #coronavirus  https://t.co/cST5C6ZTTj #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronavirusPandemic  #pandemic #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously! THIS is what #Trump and all #PutinsPuppets have been wanting to do - ruin #America so all the idiots with big guns and no dicks can feel worthy - bunch of morons - they probably went home to beat their wives too after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one should feel pressured to go to work without proper #PPENow. It's not ok to ask someone to put their life on the line while the rest of us sit at home. This is especially hitting communities that are predominately #POC as most are #EssentialWorkers and low to middle income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't do it - they know there's #ClassAction #Lawsuits coming due to their #negligence. I believe there's groups around the world that are organizing against these criminals. Ask your local democratic representative AND speak to a lawyer for elderly and disabled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomthunkitsMind 100% Agree! 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ANYONE that tells you it's SAFE to open up the economy is lying to you - because it's only safe for THEM!

<|startoftext|>😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this will be a wake up call for world leaders that we CAN do more to keep our planet and citizens safer and healthier but only if we stop destroying everything in pursuit of money and power. #ClimateCrisis #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How's everyone doing today? If you're feeling down just remember you're #NotAlone and there's #Help available. Don't pressure yourself with #NegativeThoughts.
