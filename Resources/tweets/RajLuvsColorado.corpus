<|startoftext|>@shereenskee I want to say reform because it is the right term. Court have become political and GOP did it so. We would need to add more justices to ensure it becomes non political<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinDam @AJW_SP @burgessev @marianne_levine Sure Jan! May be you want to sit down for this one. Court is already packed by GOP who have put in 6 seats without winning majority of votes for presidential or senate campaigns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Basically all justices who would make majority (5) would soon be voted by less than 60 votes in senate, representing minority of Americans.

<|startoftext|>@Dangchick1 I am shocked that it took you that long to identify a MAGAt. I am sure there must be many signs abt that. You just gave her tons of money in commission so she can support her racist agenda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrookedHalo This deserves a follow ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Kim is on to something. Popcorn was just code word for VP spot which Nimrata (@NikkiHaley) didn‚Äôt get from tRump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @MarthaMcSally @Tiffany_Shedd @PathForFreedom @realDonaldTrump Mother doesn‚Äôt want you debating a woman alone on stage. How about you drop off from GOP VP ticket ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wonder if mother will allow Pence to debate #KamalaHarris alone on stage or if she will join in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ButchRahman @insidepolling1 Yes that is what I was saying. So much for being ‚Äúinside polling‚Äù Get the facts right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insidepolling1 You are wrong. GOP has more state delegates and it wouldn‚Äôt change after election. So it‚Äôs Biden who needs to get to 270 and not trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nimrata spends her time whining about one thing to another. Bad Nimrata  No wonder no one wants to give you popcorns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump today admitted publicly that he trusts Vladimir Putin more than American intelligence. This is akin to him shooting someone on 5th ave in broad daylight. Yet #MAGA will continue to support him   Cult is real ppl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkondik Amen to that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@t_sensei @OliverGoldie1 @Nate_Cohn True! But Trump will only challenge if the polls are closer and the final results are close too.

<|startoftext|>@OliverGoldie1 @Nate_Cohn I hope RCP continues to underrepresented Dem leaning polls so that more Dems will be motivated to come out and vote.

<|startoftext|>@JasonJabnnc Large business supports larger workforce but ‚Äútrue small businesses‚Äù supports Main Street &amp; larger tot workforce for each $ of loan/grant.

<|startoftext|>@JasonJabnnc Dude, I know! I work in financials services and know a bit abt this. These so called small businesses are actually big firms owned by Wall Street who could afford to pay their people for two months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvidCommentator @lisaabramowicz1 I was going to say exactly that. It‚Äôs the bigger firms who ran away with $5 millions loans to just 4000 firm accounting 10% of all the cash. This could have helped another 50% more small businesses with loans under $150k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @SBAgov What shocked me is 48% went to $1 million and above loan size but even more just 4000 loans accounted for 10% of all dollars. These were big big businesses<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ordinary1World I am a big slick dealer who gets high from finding super good deal (even though I don‚Äôt need to financially). Like I have a brand new Weber grill which I purchased for net $40 out of the pocket. Retails $400 and seldom goes below $300<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordinary1World Nah. Shiping cost kills any profit. It will cost like $30 to ship one pack of rolls. We use them a bit and these will last for year +. But again only reason I purchased to begin with is because target sent a very very compelling coupon my way and I had nothing to buy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ordinary1World I actually have like 10 packs I purchased from target 3 months ago when it was on really awesome sale. Funny is we have bidet so we hardly use it too. Time to cash in????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MediaWatch_2020 @snowmanomics @SteveKornacki ‚ÄúSaying there is a proof‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it true. I have no reason to look up a fantasy hypothesis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaWatch_2020 @snowmanomics @SteveKornacki There is absolutely no proof of that. There is a direct correlation of age and voter turn out.

<|startoftext|>@MediaWatch_2020 @snowmanomics @SteveKornacki I think it‚Äôs the older electorate coming out in larger numbers while keeping younger at same levels (denominator up). Reason I say that is because turn out is much higher in 20 compared to 16<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@z9bill Florida is never gonna vote Dem, especially with DT moving there. All those retirees and Cubans are part of cult.

<|startoftext|>@BeckyBunzy Honestly I am exhausted, not by #PABPresident but by @SpeakerPelosi . Remember, 45 has no power if no one enables him.

<|startoftext|>@StephenKing I humbly disagree. Only David Koch‚Äôs body has left. He soul which was his cash and bank accounts are still alive and kicking American democracy to curbs. üò¢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenlilheis @sarahkendzior @TheBoxingFan21 Also gracious of you Sarah to respond a nobody on Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenlilheis @sarahkendzior @TheBoxingFan21 Above fraudulent steps would add ~5% to GOP Talley. Add in another 2-3% due to electoral college. This means Dem nominee would need to best DT by abt 8% to win the 2020 election. My calcs are based on all the reading I have done on the topic and meant to be ballpark estimate 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenlilheis @sarahkendzior @TheBoxingFan21 What makes me think that Biden can win is because margin he is showing against Trump is higher than other candidates showing right now. We need as much gap as possible to counter election fraud, Russian propaganda, voter suppression etc. I believe (naively) that above steps 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahkendzior @TheBoxingFan21 Correct! Warren can win free &amp; fair elections. Unfortunately US elections are neither free nor fair. If they were free &amp; fair then we would have HRC as Pres &amp; Stacey Abrams for GA govern. So let‚Äôs accept the fact that since we don‚Äôt have fair elections, we prob need Biden to win<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BeckyBunzy Some more info on this Rakshasa concept. They weren‚Äôt so much demon, but rather ruthless leaders who did all kinds of atrocities on helpless ppl. That‚Äôs when someone killed them &amp; they were declared god. Example: Lord Ram killing Rakshasa Raavan to free ppl from his brutal rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyBunzy He is the kind of person which fits the description of ‚ÄúRakshasa‚Äù in Hindu mythology. A mythological figure our mom used to scare us to drink milk or go to sleep. I can‚Äôt imagine it has come in life üò±  https://t.co/mjNSF5fIx8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyBunzy Actually 45 is one true god. Don‚Äôt believe me now, wait till churches open up worshiping him<|endoftext|>

They will justify with his pro-life stance to make them feel them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skenigsberg Here is what I wrote abt it  https://t.co/YkzaiFoxEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>45 says we need to start building ‚Äúmental institutions‚Äù! We agree. We propose to build one right next to White House and invite him to be inaugural guest and then never let him off #DerangedDonald #impeachment #ImpeachmentInquiryNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ Bad timing considering 45 #tarrifs on appliances means u gonna pay more to replace it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crampell Also my favorite @billmaher show are the ones where he has recurring champion Catherine Rampell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crampell I don‚Äôt think 45 needs anything. He is the genius who manage to go bankrupt 6 times and still stay billionaire. He will make America rich even if it means America has to file for bankruptcy first. 45 plays a 3D chess which our puny brains can‚Äôt fathom üôÑ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Al16795801 @elle_desylva Q has zillion followers. The reason 45 came in the office in the first  is because ppl believe everything they see online. If you can‚Äôt question what you seeing on twitter then you deserve ppl like 45 in office. So ask questions. It leads to Ans, sometimes right sometimes wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5838Lex @elle_desylva Wish I could sleep 10 years  do that to get away from 45‚Äôs shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elle_desylva I am not being rude. I must ask the question. I have watched you tweet many many times about ‚Äúraise hands‚Äù. A classic tactic used to rouse an emotional response and create divisions. I hardly ever see you post something thoughtful or meaningful. Hence checking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elle_desylva Is this a troll account? I don‚Äôt get why an Australian no body is so interested in US affairs and has 50k + followers?

<|startoftext|>So all this time tariff talk of ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù was really meant to be ‚ÄúRussia First‚Äù. Duh, we should have known better  #MAGAts #Maga #MoscowMitch #MoscowMitchTraitor #rMakeRussiaGreatAgain   https://t.co/0WUwepXth3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GundyGirl She also doesn‚Äôt support impeachment and she had aspirations to be on Trump Cabinet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VodkaMuse @Gregwald66 The only reason Gabbard continues to get 1-2% support is because she is hot and there are ppl who want to see hot President on TV instead of another old white dude<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn #MoscowJohn joined in to defend #MoscowMitch . What a surprise. The bills you mention doesn‚Äôt do anything to stop the interference, only makes it punishable later if you can ever get your hands on them. Support ‚ÄúReal‚Äù bills which are being introduced by @MarkWarner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyewalter I thought  Gov Bullock did<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanRather @GovernorBullock is actually looking good and making a lot more sense. It seems that it actually helped him to be not in first debate.

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Don‚Äôt Trust polls Dem voters. Just go and vote. We don‚Äôt want another 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Oh btw, if all above wasn‚Äôt enough then #MoscoMitch is getting Russian help from 2016 onwards to win. Forget about playing fair. Let‚Äôs fight fire with üî•<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @NikkiHaley is angling for running as Trump‚Äôs 2020 Running-mate. Notice all the DT 2020 signs do not have Pence. It‚Äôs by design. T campaign knows that T has woman voter problem and they are going bring Haley to solve it. Hopefully voters should see the scam &amp; defeat him #Traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 And yet gerrymandering, voter suppression and vote taxing does exactly that. I understand need to play fair but if other side(#corrruptGOP) has been cheating for so long, it‚Äôs time Dems match them otherwise they would never win anything ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GypsySpirit63 @raycastor2 Trump crowd will believe it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BowlingGreen357 @debbiedonothing @NateSilver538 But his hardcore base is the racist wing of the party and they were the one who were cheering lock her up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr #MoscowMitch is supporting bipartisan legislation but he won‚Äôt support other bipartisan legislation which is to stop Russian meddling in elections. #MoscowMich is #TraitorMcConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debbiedonothing @NateSilver538 You are comparing apples to oranges. Moderates aren‚Äôt passionate voters and hence unlikely to migrate like passionate left wing or right wings. In Trunps case, he had passionate right wing support so dropping moderates didn‚Äôt help the cause for consolidation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peebsnjay @MrsRota1 What a weirdo. Glad he is your ex. Good riddance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Your analysis assumes that all these candidates will stay the entire race. It‚Äôs unlikely, which means whoever is left will likely consolidate leftish vote. For the record I am more in the middle<|endoftext|>
