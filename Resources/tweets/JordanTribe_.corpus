<|startoftext|>@Mahomes2Helaire True. I just want some retribution from the past. We’re good enough to make that happen. I know we won the SB but I’d still like to see us on the other side of that matchup for once. It would be pretty intense though<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kevo_Bevo Im all curve all the time. I used to put my hats in cups to get the perfect curve.  I think I’m gonna keep this one flat though.  You keep one curved, and I’ll keep one flat and we can keep perfect balance to the world 🤙🏽  Deal?  https://t.co/XmUoAlT3Ri<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How awesome is it that we get to have both?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@troll4kc I’m not sure there’s a right or wrong answer to this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPatJesus @jaketlarsen He’s closer to Tyreek than Keizer or Yelder are to Kelce. We have a better backup for Tyreek than we do with Kelce... just another way to look at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think about it like this. You could get away not doubling Kelce every now and then, but I don’t think you can get away with that with Hill.  Just ask Tampa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhereYaSoulAt It’s an interesting question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen That’s where I’m at. But someone brought up a good point, Mecole can step into Tyreeks role right now, but no one is getting close to wearing Kelces shoes.  Lots of ways to think about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen  https://t.co/xCp3Lmt6qr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sanixon123 @Alex_R_Scherer There’s definitely a lot of ways to look at it. I wasn’t even figuring what it’d look like if one went out of the lineup! We’ve been lucky enough to have a healthy Kelce for a while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_R_Scherer It’s a tough question for sure. I’m glad we have both 😎  I’m kinda with you. I feel like you could replace Kelce with another player not as good and could get similar result overall from a team standpoint, but you can’t find someone like Tyreek 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s more important to the #Chiefs offense??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s more important to the #Chiefs offense??                #ChiefsKingdom  Travis Kelce                   Tyreek Hill  https://t.co/GqYhBKnjkf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Squidward155532 I appreciate the insight. What determines when they are discharged??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSmarlos @ByRyanEdwards @Brian_LaFevre_ 👍🏽  Just curious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByRyanEdwards I was hoping someone on the front lines can help with an answer.  Are people getting admitted that don’t need to be there?  I know some cases are serious, but the 10 cases with my family &amp; friends recently, 3 days of sniffles and mild body aches, loss of taste and that’s it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mtn_Man_Mike What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByRyanEdwards I mean, if you don’t need a ventilator, what else is being done that you couldn’t do at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByRyanEdwards I’m curious as to what type of treatment they are receiving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is being done at hospitals for people admitted with COVID??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4th_and_Butker Give me the black pill.  It’d be sick having a Marino Chiefs jersey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelUphaus Kirk, Edmonds &amp; Hopkins?? Thats scary for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cale_holder The Fournette split scares me with Jones.  I hope Drake is out, then I can just plug in Edmonds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cale_holder I’ve had every one of your thoughts in my head! Pretty tough decision. It’s gonna be a close game too so I need all the angles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HardEarnedYard The Drake question mark is the only reason he’s on the bench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cale_holder You wouldn’t be worried about Kirk &amp; Hopkins in together ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m all screwed now! Carson has been ruled out. What should I do!! #FantasyFootball #fantasy #FantasyFootballAdvice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcwolfpac79 Luckily I have decent receivers and Herbert to fill in, which doesn’t hurt too much. Those bye weeks can be killers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIzBeezy We’ll see. Hopkins &amp; Kirk in together....😬 I want to see what the speedy rookie can do though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsFan2020 I’m in a dynasty league, so we can keep players each year. I had it made when Hopkins was on the Texans &amp; Kirk was a Cardinal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKO8226 So true. I’m in a Dynasty league, where we can keep players each season so it’s hard to let him go!! So inconsistent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcwolfpac79 That split RB situation is hard to manage. You don’t know how many touches Chubb gets off of injury too this game.   Hunt’s your only option to drop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcwolfpac79 That’s a tough one. The handcuff is always tough for me to do. I’m sure you could build depth using that spot on someone else. You’d keep Hunt in case something happens to Chubb. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Chubb is the dude for sure going forward.  Trade him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsFan2020 I put Reagor in because of the ceiling. Kid could go off. Plus, having Kirk and Hopkins in together scares me.  Your squad is set!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PFF_Sam What kind of grade/breakdown does Mahomes get on a play like this?  A play Tom Brady could NEVER make   https://t.co/bZ563dtBbw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Mahomes has 788 passing yards and 9 touchdowns in the last 2 games.  He’s also averaging 33.76 fantasy points for me 😎 #FantasyFootball  #fantasy #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/dH1o8uQyZE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mahomes scored anyway 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haters gonna be pissed with this take! 😂  #ThePatrickMahomesMVPAward🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripseahawks Gordon Hayward, Next question....  https://t.co/X1ybFKfVDp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dwoverdrive Yep. It all worked out perfectly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clyde4pres Yep. It was all so perfect. LB clear out... freakin Andy Reid 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This play is pretty awesome. Look at the CB, Douglas, just after snap. Mahomes has him all confused from the movement pre snap (and post snap), allowing Demarcus Robinson to run freely and catch an easy TD.   https://t.co/VOvfwqfsCV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RutledgeA_A_Ron I don’t remember that. I guess it’s up to the ref 🤷🏽‍♂️ That ref was right there with Jones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always wondered if this would draw a flag... now I know.  Thank you Chris Jones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ty_B_7 I went with Dobbins. I figured he would take this opportunity as a rookie and run with it... he didn’t run with it. 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_DQ I started the dude’s that got the least amount of points 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we have a new leader in the #NFL #MVP race, and his name is  Patrick Mahomes                      1️⃣5️⃣ #MVPat #ChiefsKingdom #Chiefs  https://t.co/Lgfr9HspN8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Y0KE_ 😎  The down ass homies will understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williams fumbles at the  goalline, Mahomes recovers and dives in for a TD. Then he throws a pass at the goalline, its tipped, he catches it &amp; dives in at the pylon. A dumb forward progress call, then Texans pick off Mahomes to seal the win, but J J Watt was offsides, we win in OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrizzyIsMe @Y0KE_ That’s the funniest thing I’ve seen all day 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSmarlos @Brian_LaFevre_ Glacier Bay. The ad said it can flush 7 billiard balls at once. I said, "Hey, if i ever drop a load like that, I guess I don’t want it to clog” 💩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Don’t say that!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 I hear you. I think it continues if Trump gets re-elected too. Dems don’t want any sort of win for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 My bad. Sometimes I just gotta get some stuff out. Especially when I hear or see some crap that sets me off, and we know how twisted the elite Democrats can be to<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Daily Case Rate” that’s the reason the Denver mayor imposed thee stricter mandate.  https://t.co/bCNUT7Q85y  https://t.co/IHrP2dLVDR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared I never see anything about a positive "rate” here.... it’s just the totals. I fear if we test more, we get more positives. I’ve never seen any numbers like you’re describing being used to make the decisions in CO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared I totally get that, but they literally put more restrictions in place in Denver, because of the number of POSITIVE results we got over a 2 week period. Nothing about percentages, just the increased number of positive ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CL_257 @heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared I don’t know the answer, but the thinking/results in CA seems to be different than CO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared At least in CO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared If everyone tested, there would be a ton of positive tests, then the state would shut down. The positive tests is what’s determining the decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared That doesn’t make sense.  I never see stats like that or percentages.  In Denver, they recently mandated masks at outdoor events, changed the max group from 10 to 5, all because of the NUMBER of positive tests in the last 2 weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @JpChiefs @AlphaSuace @OShowKCJared Door to door testing.... quarantine the bad.  That might work, but that ain’t happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @JpChiefs @AlphaSuace @OShowKCJared I disagree. You never hear about negative tests, only positive. The more positive tests, the more people their going to count as a positive COVID death even if it didn’t play a part in their death... then...the more people get scared and pass mandates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @JpChiefs @AlphaSuace @OShowKCJared How do you measure understanding and cooperation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared That’s fantastic. We have it inside in CO, just chairs totally separated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @AlphaSuace @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared You need to trust Americans to protect themselves. We do it everyday with all the stuff out there that can hurt us. The more tests taken, the more people positive, the more people will be reported as aCOVID death even if had no part in their death.  It’s a slippery slope we’re on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @AlphaSuace @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared So what’s the magic number to open back up??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlphaSuace @JpChiefs @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared You can’t allow football and basketball and not church and work and school.... that’s just freaking ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared I have elderly parents, and I was cautious, but not as cautious as I am now. You can always be MORE careful, really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared Hopefully this is the craziest thing we ever experience on this earth!! 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared That’s tough. I gives you a totally a different perspective once someone you know gets hit hard or dies. A lot of people haven’t experienced that. I was one of them  up until about July. I took it more serious when a friend got hit hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @JpChiefs @OShowKCJared I think some people think of the government is forcing me to wear a mask, what else can they force me to do, which is scary to think about if we just take orders. I’m not there, but I get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JpChiefs @OShowKCJared @heavenlyKC I think most people are doing what’s right, but if I see a friend in a store and I haven’t seen him in 3 years.... I’m probably hugging them if they’re cool with it 🤷🏽‍♂️ Sorry, love will always win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @HandlingBizness @KCJonathan15 If the media communicated more effectively, he wouldn’t have so many people tagging on him so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @OShowKCJared Oh, I know, and I do... all the time. But I also hug my mom, and people I love, and give handshakes to people that I meet if they’re ok with it. I understand the risks, and some risks I’m ok taking. It’s my choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @HandlingBizness @KCJonathan15 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OShowKCJared @heavenlyKC You could catch any virus from people breathing, but we can’t stop breathing, and we shouldn’t stop living<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BayBoyTank Most wear masks. I don’t like them at all, but I wear them. I think most are like that.  Some have them pulled down, there’s a few in Walmart not wearing it on their face. Overall, I think most people are trying to do the right thing 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC @KCJonathan15 There’s some bad Trumpers out there too!  Makes you appreciate the ones who avoid the personal attacks and name calling... there’s GOOD ones on both sides too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I appreciate the civil exchanges &amp; opinions 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnderRatedFool  https://t.co/WiwqfkcArH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @KCJonathan15 @HandlingBizness That is exactly how it should be. A lost art of conversation, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What more do you think should be done to help control COVID??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC There is no cooperation that’s happening. The left doesn’t want a Trump win over the virus even if it helps the country, especially before next Tuesday.  This will remain true after the election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_MrMinnesota_ It was just a question. Why so butthurt??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC @HandlingBizness What more can Biden do that Trump isn’t already doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC You know the deal. You do your research    🤜🏽🤛🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC It’d flip in a heartbeat...and probably just fade away and stuff will reopen in  in January and it’ll be the first win for Biden. I’ll take my chances on how it’ll play out when Trump wins 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC All the left has is COVID to pin on Trump.  They’d have nothing to talk about if there was no worldwide pandemic to blame 1 man for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @heavenlyKC I’m not sure it will. If Biden wins, I see it going away quickly. If Trump wins, we’re going to hear about it for a while 🤷🏽‍♂️ That’s just the world we live in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlyKC Any argument that can be made for COVID deaths can be made for accidents. I know the risks of dying in an accident, and I can take the info I have and make a educated decision on how to best protect myself. I could not drive for instance. 🤷🏽‍♂️ My business shouldn’t have to suffer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Y0KE_ There it is!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ty_B_7 Did you see them split both for 5 wide later in the game?? That’s tricky. I’m pretty sure it was in the 4th<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trsimmons58 Poll question coming......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trsimmons58 He is the closet thing I’ve seen to him. I wonder who’s faster 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OManSteveO Indeed. Pringle seems to make plays in the little time he’s in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psst...I follow back #Chiefs fans #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell His drops are the thing I think about with him now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arrowheadgirl95 I’m honored to make the cut!  https://t.co/Jg0Ni9DTrn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AD400WoodBlk Tough to argue that pick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sKwafo44 That’s hilarious! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobOxler That was great. lol’d You’re good. God don’t make any mistakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobOxler "I could agree more”  https://t.co/qVx9ATSepw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really didn’t think about Patrick Mahomes much tonight, and we won  26-17.  Love how we showed another side to this team... and we can add Le’Veon Bell next week 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelStrand6 We need all different kinds of wins. This was a different one for sure. Andy Reid going all Jim Harbaugh on us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelStrand6 Beat up Online. That’s really encouraging. Get everyone snaps and win... that’s about as good as it gets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit  https://t.co/a3uMciAFVH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clyde Edwards-Helaire had 26 carries, and averaged 6.19 yards per carry. Dude was a beast 🤙🏽  https://t.co/A1HwhJaZPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyler Murray might be the fastest QB I’ve seen. No disrespect Michael Vick &amp; Lamar Jackson.... but your boy is quick #Cardinals  https://t.co/PNCYC76f7G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the correct answer for sure 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DynastyChiefs A very good choice indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCChiefs007 That’s a really good one for sure. His clean trash talk is legendary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going with Larry Fitzgerald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you could give a Super Bowl win/ring to any current player in the league who doesn’t have one, who would you give it to??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdogj Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCJonathan15 You &amp; me both brother. He’ll figure it out. It’s like his leg is too big for the mat distance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldC35185049 @CKingdom101 He does seem to get better when the moment gets bigger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCJonathan15 Incorrect. He’s one of the best kickers in the league. Come get me when he’s missing field goals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBaBy_TGOD He doesn’t always catch the ball. He’s been suspect going back to last years playoffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit Great emoji usage 🥇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done, sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Gh0st___ Yep. Andy is already drawing up plays for that package<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrylFranke He was the Derrick Henry of the late  80’s &amp; early 90’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dirty Freakin Dan!!!  https://t.co/4o9ylhqnER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Gh0st___ I agree 💯  A talent like Bell can only help. Can’t let Clyde get burnt out.... he ain’t never played an NFL schedule. Let’s abuse Bell so Clyde is fresh. That’s how I feel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We gotta get Clyde in the end zone                           🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLeVeon I used to crap my pants every time he would run. Surprisingly, McCoy’s career fumble numbers aren’t too crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m loving @Clydro_22 taking all the carries and still going strong. We know we can lean on him when we need to. What a great game for the rookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Y0KE_ I’m just glad he caught it 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JacobTupua Not just politics, but the influence of politics on social media. Media &amp; social media make it tough for people to know what stories they can believe without quadruple checking things<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s exactly right.  Their not concerned about the positive changes that could result from it.

<|startoftext|>@JacobTupua Amazing how quickly they can turn on you for an opinion or idea<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ice Cube is not a Trump supporter from what I’ve seen, but he is someone who wants to see progress and is getting drilled by Democrats because the Trump campaign showed they cared  about something important to him, more than the Left did. ❤️me some Ice Cube🤙🏽  Predator is still🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icecube Love that you spit facts and people that don’t agree with your opinion tell you to kick rocks. Dems have had plenty of opportunities to help blacks and what do they have to show for it? A Democratic candidate that said  "We ain’t black” unless we vote Democrat.  Who’s the racist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MahomesToClyde @PrimeAnukobe This is the one 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatorGonnaGitYa @ian101nai @AdamSchefter I’m not a big sarcasm guy. Robinson is one of the best WR blockers the Chiefs have. That could definitely be the reason he gets more opportunities than Pringle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatorGonnaGitYa @ian101nai @AdamSchefter He can definitely block. So important in Reid’s offense too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statams I’d expect nothing less from Smith. True pro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian101nai @GatorGonnaGitYa @AdamSchefter He has dropped a bunch over the past year it seems. Demetrius Robinson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian101nai @AdamSchefter The coaches know best. I’m with everyone here, I like what Pringle does when he’s on the field. I think Robinson does well on the "off script” plays, maybe he just knows multiple positions better than Pringle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chiefs need losses like this and wins like the #Chargers game to help them through the season. This loss will make them better. Thats what good teams do. #Raiders played fantastic though, and as a  #Chiefs fan, it’s comforting to see it takes a exceptional game to beat them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Alex Smith needs to give  Dak Prescott a phone call.  Praying for the best 🙏🏽  https://t.co/fTqNRXxBUQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>September 18th, 2️⃣0️⃣1️⃣6️⃣ is the last loss the #Chiefs had in September.  Cairo Santos hit 4 field goals for our only points.  A loss to Brock Osweiler and the  Houston #Texans 19-12 🤦🏽‍♂️  https://t.co/f5MfRUSVZu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dai_sca @arrowhead_one @Laddiemorse @MichaelTRose @ranger_chief I agree! Rogers is the ONLY one I think of when I see these ridiculous throws. Rogers has a lot of his own I’d like to see Mahomes attempt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellen_quick I think Rogers &amp; Mahomes have cannons that separate them a little from Wilson, even though Wilson has a gun.  They definitely "sling” it more than Wilson like these plays, but your right, athletically, with accuracy &amp; consistency ....  these are the 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mallord39 @cheetah  https://t.co/LbwkI2we8j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mahomes makes the most ridiculous throws in the league routinely, but Aaron Rogers is the only QB that can probably make all the throws Patrick Mahomes makes. #ArmTalent 💪🏽  #Mahomes #Rogers #Packers #Chiefs                #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/hoa6UAOqZa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UnexpectedAggie @Chiefs @ParkUniversity @DannySorensen49 It was all him too, I guess that’s why I put it on top. Tough to put this 2nd though if that’s a big part of my criteria though!   https://t.co/dDmRakvLZT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnexpectedAggie @Chiefs @ParkUniversity @DannySorensen49 He showed up big in the playoffs, no doubt.  Who knows where the season ends up if he misses that tackle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who’s going to put up the first points for the #Chiefs tonight aOne of these 4 or someone else?? (Mahomes counts only if he runs it in 😁)  https://t.co/jWOnzdr1qy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tear it up gentlemen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackThanos22 Because he wasnt a politician. He didn’t come from the corrupt background of Washington politics, and he ended up creating a great economy with the lowest unemployment rate... which is important.

<|startoftext|>@hotchman I love being on boats, I just know nothing about them. Sailboat would be a fantastic experience!! As long as I’m not the one in charge of keeping us afloat! I’d love to spend a night or 2 on a boat like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsladeofficial That’s what I’ve heard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Notre_Josh I wouldn’t either!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, you know the love will eventually come to a end, which is tough, but you wouldn’t trade the time you had for anything. Looks like a stud.  Snoop... that’s awesome. Did the music video inspire that at all?!?! 😁  https://t.co/JSYQX5y4ih<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of "Best in the game” players around you, including you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This makes me H - H - H - Happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuck_dc @wpence21 It has nothing to do with respect for the medical people battling on the front lines.  It has to do with the fact that people face bankruptcy &amp; lost their American Dream of owning their own business, mass unemployment for 0.000003442424242%.  I think that’s a bad trade off IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuck_dc @wpence21 Wow, that’s 0.000003442424242% of Americans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsWire Haven’t thought about this in a while.  Gotta be the 2018 AFC Championship.  After years of heartbreak, we get a small taste of redemption and the Super Bowl by intercepting Tom Brady, but in classic Chiefs fashion once again... 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Solo__Fly I hear you, but  I think me &amp; you both represent the exact problem here.  People don’t respect authority enough and cops are quick to defend themselves..... sometimes much too quick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnieLester16 No I get it... bad choice of gif by me I guess ... 😂 should have used this...  https://t.co/SA7bbBtw7J<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RonnieLester16  https://t.co/4km0XRWV2m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealistKingdom Just some things I saw today regarding the other shooting. Cops get a really bad rap, basically  For every negative video you see, there’s hundreds more positive stories to be told.  This one is an example of what could  happen if you DON’T decide to use lethal force. 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Help me understand the powers that are at play.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefskc23 Tough gig. I don’t know, dudes crazy. I give cops the benefit of the doubt in most situations. I don’t know how Id react with my life possibly on the line. I saw all these quotes today about the other shooting and thought, "Dang, no one sees the danger from a cops point of view?”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You don’t like cops, I get it, but your IQ has dropped far enough already if you really think all cops are shit. That’s my family you’re talking about bro. General statements like that only fuel hate. I’m more of a love guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it would make people appreciate the 92% of cops that do it right EVERY SINGLE DAY risking their lives for me &amp; you, instead of the 8% bad ones that get all the attention 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 You like how I put "paid” just to trigger a certain few 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would mean you think ALL cops are shit at their jobs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 I know, I know 😕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMike816 It was a serious question I was posing, just to let you know. Seems like the same argument could be made for either.... not that I’m comparing them in any way, but all backgrounds are different. There’s gay people that have/haven’t been abused,  there’s pedos that have/haven’t 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMike816 I believe all your wants and desires are created through everything you experience and process as individuals. It isn’t something you’re born with. Acquired tastes if you will.  If people ARE born gay, then can people be  born as pedophiles? 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness Only the left would impeach for "abuse of power” and then nominate a man to represent their party, who is on video doing the exact same thing they accused/impeached the president for doing🤦🏽‍♂️ they cant get more power Im confident the people know this  https://t.co/pdvMkt44x0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness this might be 100% accurate. But just like 2016, people will see through the MSM BS and speak at the polls. The Democrats the last 4 years have done nothing but attempt to remove our elected president and had no problems at all, quickly shutting down the great economy he built up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness Thank you. He’s pretty awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCBUKU51 Moses is extremely smart, fierce looking but a teddy bear. Great dog/dogs.  I love when people move WAY outta the way when they see him coming.... I smile on the inside, if they only knew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bruce_OxCity Yep. Don’t threaten him or anything he loves, or business is open<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who’s the best QB in the league....... after Patrick Mahomes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie Haha!! Well, makes me feel good knowing I was right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie Hills was UGLY!! I’m thinking it might have been against Denver... can’t remember. I don’t want to cheat and Google it either 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie Kielce &amp; Hill both had one. Kielce threw a pick, but that was 2017 with Smith. Not sure when Hill’s was but it was a pick in the end zone. Feels like it was before Kelce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/VI6sKP49vR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can speak for the entire #ChiefsKingdom when I say  Thank you Rick for all that you do for the greatest team in pro sports!! 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonesypower1 @cheetah Dang!! Tyreek is fast!!  https://t.co/XRud7zcPRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie Cause he can I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️ A good point. You know Reid loves showing off that creativity. He’s got so much stuff in his head!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison I dunno... he had his shot!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellen_quick I like it. Kielce &amp; Hill has their shot, I think it’s gotta be someone different. Watkins has that play in the playoffs he was looking to throw but didn’t.... it really could be anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_BSM Can’t debate the logic 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_BSM Whoa! Not a bad guess though. Sounds like he’s always pushing for some  O  time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bigs1226 @pringle_byron He’s fun to watch on special teams too. Him &amp; @MarcusDKemp. I hope that guy is doing well. He’s a beast on ST as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCFansCorner I blind it at that. That last shot he wasn’t ready for and he still almost broke through it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dan_florie @RIFICA Remember, they have Brandin Cooks &amp; Randall Cobb to help out now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie @RIFICA He’s not on their level but he’s still a top 3 QB in the AFC and that’ll keep them relevant. They know they have their guy and can build around him... but that O’Brien thing again 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie @RIFICA Yep. Too much on his plate. They have talent though, and Watson will keep them in the AFC mix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIFICA  😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_florie @RIFICA I feel the exact same way about him. Not to mention they got rid of maybe the best WR in the league<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red88G No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIFICA That means you think the Texans will get by KC somehow. I dunno. I’m not a big fan of Bill O’Brien.  I’ll take 2 out of 3 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIFICA Haha! That’s funny. I honestly haven’t seen a lot of you on the TL. You know how it goes. I just thought it was dope you had all that... yeah, I checked it out 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIFICA *Saved tweet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🚨 BREAKING NEWS!! Brett Veach, in maybe the best move of the week, signed KC Wolfe to a team friendly deal that’ll keep the crowd favorite in Kansas City for a long time. #InVeachWeTrust  https://t.co/bNw5Wb4X0C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylerlansdown @RealBirdLawyer @Taylor_Witt @dantheamerican @RaiderCody  https://t.co/NmFE4EbhBg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanAnguiano86 Veach has delivered literally everything that KC has needed. Sorry about tour luck 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A 10 year deal allows much more flexibility regarding the cap. If you look at Mahomes cap number for the next 5 years, its similar Russell Wilson who gets paid less overall.Mahomes wanted Veach to be able to still sign players. The Jones deal is a good example of that flexibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pimpinken139 @QuickestTempa Haha.... right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoneColdJones I had my doubts, glad I was wrong.  Time to dominate teams<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m rarely ever pessimistic, but I was in regards to Jones signing.  So glad it got done, he’s a BIG piece to the #Chiefs success.  Whew!! #RunItBack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LowLipMcGee1 @theredkingdomkc @Chiefs_Kingdom_ That’s good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper  https://t.co/plIIpS9lEG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BayBoyTank @WhereYaSoulAt @hotchman @Royalfan83 That’s good gold right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 Maybe. I’ve never been blocked by a Jacksonville Jaguar before 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 Veach: "How bout 6 years to help our cap number?” Jones: "3” Veach: "5 years, Chris?” Jones:  “3” Veach: "ok, Chris, we can make 4 years work” Jones: "2 years”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 He probably only wanting like 3 years too, so he cAn get another payday contract before he’s out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 That just might be the transcript! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 He does hang with Leveon. It would leave a big void on the line, but oh well. #InVeachWeTrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 He’ll probably end up with Chris Conley in Jacksonville 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 Will he sit out or be there week 1? That becomes the question. I’d love to be in the room to hear the negotiations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 That post kinda pissed me off. Like the Chiefs are really offering “$5”.... the tag guarantees he’s getting top dollar for the year. He’s basically sitting out over $5,000,000. I get it, but Hopefully he’s there week 1 regardless. What a letdown to teammates trying to Run It Back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 Some dudes are in it for the dough 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 (Had to make sure there were 21. 1 for each million he wants)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigmak2015 Dude will sit out because he’ll get $16,000,000 this year, instead of the $21,000,000 he wants. I love the dude, but I can do without the petty posts 🤷🏽‍♂️ It’s just looking more &amp; more like he’s gonna chase the money. I’m setting myself up for the worst case scenario 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 That’s pretty much where I’m at. The money is the most important thing to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good riddance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 Glad to be a small % of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kansasj81 @The_DQ @MahomeSZN Mine was a blacked version of this.... I still have the matching hat though! I want the white Starter jacket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336 @cheetah That’s a great video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad 😞  "She was a, bright beautiful and loving soul.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Very cool @cheetah is out there with these kids. 🤙🏽  Your career highlight reel of Mossin’ fools is pretty loaded... but this was nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to happen eventually.  You good, just stick to WR. 😏 Sick catch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_DQ @kansasj81 @MahomeSZN I was there too!! In the very VERY back<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes Wow... that’s scary. Dude is working on everything he needs to continue improving. I love me som 1️⃣5️⃣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes Better show them wheels this year to get that number up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066 That’s how you do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaFeTow I’m forever optimistic 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Washington George’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison Absolutely. I think it’s worked out for the good most times for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet @supergoose816 White Men Can’t Jump is an all-timer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison I think I watched the 1st 2 and never watched any more. I could see it all going downhill. Sometimes smoking makes it an incredibly fantastic movie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NrmlAvGuy I’m honestly still thinking of what my answer is. A lot of the ones people posted are on the list, but I haven’t actually made a final decision!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PDeSanChief I thought it was really good. I want to see it again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCRoyalFan I’m sorry to hear that 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PDeSanChief I remember that movie.  Have you seen Knives Out?? Pretty entertaining whodunnit movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NrmlAvGuy One I never finished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamUinKC I haven’t seen it. I thought it was Failure To Launch with Matthew McConaughey at first... that was pretty good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red88G @vitamin_j Just diggin that armpit love  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet @vitamin_j That is my wife... always<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vitamin_j Dogs bruh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCRoyalFan Is that the Bill Cosby movie??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCJH1987 I never had a desire to watch that. Just looked dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know how you are comfortable, Moses.  https://t.co/0IbsHtuQ7L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuck_dc 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supergoose816 Haha! That’s funny. I think Money Train might be the best movie I’ve seen with her in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I Turned that one off pretty quickly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoShady @Christraint @merryjurph That’s what I heard from many people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattfromKC I didn’t like that either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigmak2015 @Christraint @merryjurph Gotta be sarcasm I’m not picking up in his voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christraint @merryjurph Really?! I haven’t seen any of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merryjurph Cmon man, I’m cooler than that 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoffa1978 I’m pretty sure I only rented it from Blockbuster 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merryjurph It’s a fantastic movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2011_Rhonda I wasn’t a big fan of it either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100prcentGringo  https://t.co/bWp5K4vzCr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoffa1978 I didn’t like that at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI Dumb &amp; Dumber is a great movie 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 I love Dumb &amp; Dumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_DQ That was a fantastic movie. I was hoping people didn’t think I was saying it was terrible. Classic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s the WORST movie you’ve ever seen??  https://t.co/BTbtAII90x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdrh8 My teenage daughter is all about this "fashion”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, I can’t spend money on clothes that are already ripped.  I could just wear my yard shorts everywhere  https://t.co/EJBoIj40R0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Mahomes highlight reel in 2 years is better than most 19 year vets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s hilarious 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just feels like an epic, record breaking type season is coming for #Showtime Mahomes  https://t.co/MMGSDQXQqm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thirdssecond @volumeKC It makes me wonder how this game turns out if they convert there... glad we never found out! #DirtyDan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigChiefShawn Dang!! Congratulations!! Hope it’s the best day of your life  (at least top 2. 2/2/20😉)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs @SNFonNBC Here’s a legendary #ChiefsKingdom video:  https://t.co/sseww8UYvE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsChannel It took me a while to decide, but I said yes. Still on the fence honestly, could be 3 rd string somewhere so I said yes 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOUR #SaturdayLimerick News of the week was a heck of a deal I’m talking Mahomes, not Matt Moore, lets be real Chiefs offense is regal  Kelce with an eagle Signing 1️⃣5️⃣ for 10 years was a steal   ~#LordChiefRocka   https://t.co/5GuVUJNhAm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AcresMo I can’t answer that yet. I’m still thinking about it. He DEFINITELY aint getting a 10 year contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a good poll question 💭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ardattack He’s gotta beat Mahomes to get a Super Bowl 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchLubin  https://t.co/F39j2EFF8y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmi5ty Still sharkin people my dear 😉  That’s pretty killer mind blending we’re doing with each other  https://t.co/HZ09K3t53Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwoverdrive and the moment when the smell of previous disappointment started to dissipate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@16_johnny3 My thoughts exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was my favorite play of the entire playoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AD400WoodBlk Yes sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anonymo12869076 I feel you pain on that one too. If a lot of people just freakin slows down while talking, a lot of that would go away.  You can’t talk as fast as you think 💭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KC_Honey_ It will be... in The Springs though. You’ll have to keep me filled me in on what’s poppin in KC 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was tough to type!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s like, the most like annoying thing people like, do, like when they’re like talking like to you??  https://t.co/lfDHvYyje3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhereYaSoulAt RGIII? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anonymo12869076 That’s around the range I’m at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhereYaSoulAt Good way to put it. I see a 5 year deal. Maybe 200M ish. He’s good, but he’s not Mahomes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you think Lamar Jackson’s contract will look like?? 🤔  Something tells me I won’t see 10 years coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryan_pdrph That looks fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anonymo12869076 Are we counting auto racing? Cuz I play that every day on the streets but don’t ever turn it on the tv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealFrankC_ Tough. Sorry to hear. stay up 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is real, please don’t be THAT naive.  Sorry when I hear these stories....                            🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KC_Honey_ Maybe a 6 pack, games with the lady &amp; maybe some friends, movie, then sleep in as long as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSmoke15 I think we’ll see some good stuff the first few weeks of the new season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSHER_13 That’s the best thing I’ve seen all day 😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The completion that started it all. One of Mahomes best IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best skill position players at each position in the NFL  QB: Patrick Mahomes WR:Tyreek Hill TE: Travis Kelce RB: Christian McCaffrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We signed 2 quarterbacks in a week for a little over $500,000,000 for both.... what a DEAL!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m ready for Super Bow LV introductions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Harms19 Nice. Will do. Alerts are set 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Harms19 Should be about an hour long 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comparing cap hits to the 2 highest paid QB’s currently. For half a billion, not a huge difference the early years, hopefully the cap goes up for the later years of Mahomes contract.    R. Wilson                P. Mahomes  https://t.co/FC7ybNBlKW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GiffinJones @El_RayII @PatrickMahomes Chiefs Twitter is a different animal than FB.  I came to Twitter just to get real time updates. No better place to get breaking news. It’s now turned into more 😁  https://t.co/cbH5r549xq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@El_RayII @GiffinJones @PatrickMahomes Congratulations!! My oldest is almost 16, so I’m not there just yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Me either. I try not to pay attention to all the media reports... who knows what to believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Aside from the biblical stuff, the point she’s making to me is basically if we continue to "JUST” let things happen, they’ll continue pushing the envelope,moving the needle on morality and what’s right &amp; wrong 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@El_RayII @GiffinJones @PatrickMahomes I appreciate that 🤙🏽  Anyone who has 3 daughters like I do AND is a Chiefs fan gets an immediate follow!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@El_RayII @GiffinJones @PatrickMahomes  https://t.co/nsgUaOdhp9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 I think that her line of thinking is the way the world is destined to go. A lot of people won’t realize the biblical points she has imbedded in her message, but I do. Mark of the beast, 1 world currency... it’s all coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never a bad time for this reminder 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer Ok, so we score on 4th &amp; inches 🤷🏽‍♂️ Chiefs win 31-20<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 Deal. Christopher Nolan directed it... he’s directed a lot of movies I really like.  Sci-Fi action.... pretty stellar if you like that genre 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 I can guarantee that I won’t watch Wall -E either 😂  My kids don’t have it, don’t push to watch it, so Oh Well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 I’m gonna go ahead and guarantee Inception is better than Wall-E 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>49ers lose on 2/2/2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 Great movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 YOU HAVENT SEEN INCEPTION??  😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 Sorry 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffEisenband Chiefs 31 49ers 20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OShowKCJared You’re probably right. There’s some fantastic movies at the top though 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Mahomes wanted to say at his press conference  https://t.co/oG9CYo00v2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulner27 Christopher Nolan is fantastic. I’ll have to watch it again. Memento is my all time favorite movie and that’s Nolan as well. I’m waiting for Tenet to come out now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen everything but Wall-E.  Interstellar at 13?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066  https://t.co/o8LlnzgauX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man!! I forgot so much crap now that I’m rewatching them all.  There’s too much stuff jammed into 8 seasons, and too much into the last 2 seasons.  How could I forget that Brienne finally got some Lannister ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnieLester16 I totally forgot! I’m rewatching it from the beginning... so much I forgot!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayhawk_v1 That might be the correct answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer @dablueguy Good *<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re not the only one  https://t.co/9w1J29ODIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnybkc2 That’s a long time to ask him to wait in line... but that would be ideal!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@__Keevo I was laid up paralyzed in the hospital with Gillian Barre Syndrome for 35 days when Reid got hired as the Chiefs next coach. I needed that happiness in my life at that time, I’ll never forget that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pretty much, or until Patrick says so 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BungaHead 3 more trophies?!?! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Keevo Philly fired him though, or else he might still be there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Keevo Dude has been around the block. Been I. The game for a lonnnnng time. He might not quit until his wife or Clark make him leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how long you think Andy Reid has in KC if Mahomes will be for 10+ ??  https://t.co/GNC6q0t4vo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066 Great scene. Great movie. So many interesting plot lines throughout it, and in the end.....he’s just a quack 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066 It’s probably my #1 movie. Thes 5 area all pretty close, but Memento &amp; Star Wars are probably top 2. Screw everybody!! They don’t know anything about Leonard Shelby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_tonyjefferson One led the league in interceptions, one can’t jump on a fumble in the Super Bowl and is a moody cry baby, one has been a successful backup for years and worth a 3 year deal as opposed to the 1 year "prove it" deals by the other 2.  Compare apples to apples Makes perfect sense<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kcsith88 He did beat up the Chiefs a few times 🤦🏽‍♂️  That was then..... 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit Drew’s uncertainty and the coaching staff is why I put them behind LV. Raiders have been together a little longer too which is why I gave them the edge. I really don’t think there’s a wrong order as long as you have KC at 1.  And I hope Tyrod does well actually... I like the guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the content..... 👇🏽❤️   @RexChapman you know what’s up                              🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceTHESPOKEN Does that mask have you breathing so hard Or is it that much work keeping that amazing beard wonderfully luxurious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish we could have seen that promising career 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritChiefUK Haha!! No kidding. He’s so emotional and it affects the entire team. When it’s good, it’s great, when it’s bad, it’s terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda how I feel. This is a big year for Lock to prove himself. Raiders have a decent thing going and some good pieces, I like Tyrod, but Rivers to Tyrod is such a big difference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefBeef4Life Nuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefBeef4Life Look at the situation too. Down 6, 3rd down 4 minutes &amp; change... He basically gave up the Super Bowl on that play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s your predictions for the AFC West standings for the 2020 season? Here’s Mine:  1) Kansas City #Chiefs 2) Las Vegas #Raiders 3) Denver #Broncos 4) Los Angeles #Chargers  Tough to sort out the bottom 3 but the LA QB Change &amp; an irregular off season had an impact on my choice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SmooveBooze I bet. He’s made some.... "questionable” decisions running sometimes too. He’s a strong guy though, just hope he’s working on his slide this offseason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, that’s very odd 🤔   5️⃣           1️⃣7️⃣    6️⃣9️⃣         1️⃣     3️⃣3️⃣      2️⃣5️⃣  2️⃣1️⃣     5️⃣5️⃣    1️⃣9️⃣        7️⃣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@productions_dre Haha! No kidding. He kinda runs scared, he’s even said that, but I think he’s going to get more &amp; more confident scrambling in the right situations.  I’d much rather see a bomb though 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⚠️Bold Prediction   Mahomes makes another juke move on a scramble sometime this upcoming season             #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/dDmRakNmRr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer I think they’ve earned the right to be in the convo just from past success. BB is still calling the shots. Once they miss the playoffs (especially if it’s like a 5-11 type season) we can stop including them 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kalexander1012 He knows we pay attention and give him the clicks &amp; comments &amp; RTs all while saying how completely stupid he is 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekReed64 I let him outside so he could bury it, but he looked around and came right back in!! Funny dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swaggedout420 😂  That’s hilarious because that’s exactly what it seems like. He did stuff it in some chair cushions for a bit. I let him out and he didn’t want to bury it, he just ran back inside!! Freakin Dogs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes Haha!! No kidding.  I’d pay $9.50 for Mahomes 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveKreczko I think their probably content paying him the 16mil or so on the franchise tag with this number out there now. It’d be extremely tough to get him signed for that as well as Mahomes and everyone else already getin paid....But they technically don’t HAVE to sign 55 or 15 this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Mahomes is clearly in a superior class to everyone, all on his own, that has to be the reasoning... right? 😦<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BoltsxShai @mack_mvp1 Yeah, pretty much. Tyrod beat up the Chiefs a few times when he was with the Bills. Hope he does well... except against KC 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta fuel what they’re into. I love basketball, played a bunch, but my girls don’t... kinda bummed, but watching them excel at the things they DO enjoy is pretty awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoltsxShai @mack_mvp1 You won’t see those 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 int games with him, he takes pretty good care of the ball. You won’t alder the 350 yard games either though. Kind of a drastic change from 1️⃣7️⃣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoltsxShai @mack_mvp1 Of course.. you never really know for sure though. I like Taylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoltsxShai @mack_mvp1 I think Tyrod is a perfect place holder to see what you got with your rookie. I’m glad Taylor is getting another shot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Patrick22835248 You may be 100% correct on that thinking.  We ain’t losing after the bye week<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336 I’m a 79er.... so 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KashAktive He’s a tough dude. I was wondering if someone was gonna put his name in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Burns20Randy Tough to argue that. He’s a great player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryMidwestern He’s still a beast. Fisher plays well against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sprtjnkie @KyleBrandt He’s a good receiver. AFC West has some good pass catchers out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sprtjnkie Him*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sprtjnkie Ha! I don’t remember that. I remember home saying something about our secondary... he wasn’t entirely wrong at the time 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hate to say it, but Keenan Allen is up there   too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit Wrong Turn, The Devils rejects &amp; The Shining I’ve never seen.... I know, I need to see The Shining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet I fell asleep 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSmarlos @paulner27 Haha. Too many to choose from, but I want to see Lock Stock &amp; 2 smoking Barrels and The Way is the Gun to start.  My wife actually said I needed to watch  Black &amp; Blue, so I did, and it was really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066 I don’t think I’ve heard of that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussMendo @JRT2006 I definitely haven’t seen it if it has an epic opening scene... I’d remember for sure. I’m looking forward to watching this one now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 BloodSport would be watched whenever it was on tv  https://t.co/LgIcUIu4rJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RussMendo ✅ The Usual Suspects ❎ The way of the Gun  I can’t remember the way of the gun 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrimeBallard You spend WAY too much time focused on Chiefs fans if you find ones that actually think this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 I get the dragons confused 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 Haha!! That’s right. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyTa2u ❎ Never heard of that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fazzymom That’s a great flick. I haven’t watched it on a while either<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen I hear you 👴🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classic ✈️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They call it, The Love Pole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid ideas seem to spread like wildfire 🔥 🔥 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h8rproof82 Here we go 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 At least it’s not San Diego again.  Click bait is comical sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitchRustyXBL @ForeignYoubii @dcthadon21 @MahomesToKelce @jusbooin Tell me where he loses his footing? Is it where Brown jukes him? 😂 😂  He got smoked like a $3 joint... it happens to even the best sometimes 🙅🏾‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgathaChocolats Offered food and died by panda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitchRustyXBL @ForeignYoubii @dcthadon21 @MahomesToKelce @jusbooin Sorry, I don’t see him messing up his footing. I see him standing flat footed and letting Brown run into him, then Brown running right by him  https://t.co/iDcqLPzmOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magic_Mahomes Great movie, great acting too. Seven Pounds has to be mentioned for sure as one of his best.   No one gonna mention Hancock?? 😏  https://t.co/qWoCTFxall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I’ve listened and still not heard anything as stupid as what Biden said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JO26A Mitchell....you are correct 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far, this is the dumbest thing I’ve heard all year so far....                         🥴                         🥇   https://t.co/6wLRWAc7EC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuapantoja58 Definitely. That thing was a laser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefN_620 Yep. No way he was losing that game. The look of defeat in the body language of some of the Titan defenders is pretty awesome too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pure adrenaline coming out! this was my favorite Mahomes celebration. Threw a bomb on 3rd &amp; long to Hardman, then did this to the Raider bench... Cold Blooded 🥶  https://t.co/OLPq8rNNtq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very similar to the play at Arrowhead vs. San Fran.  Loved both 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blueheartedly 41% 55%  Yeah... and Trump is a Russian agent  https://t.co/sQ6PGVtmlh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is actually my favorite play. The no look is my favorite throw 🙂  https://t.co/mI9qD1dK20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveKreczko What some people call fashion... 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This made me laugh 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Day16 @Aksala07273193 Great memories at Arrowhead! I get to see the ones in Denver in person each year 🙂Hopefully I’ll see Mahomes in KC this season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jc_playmakerWNY  https://t.co/ovFIl0qJ9E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell There are agendas being pushed by multiple outlets. Washington Post... no thanks 🤢  There are definitely a few bad cops out there. It’s a shame they get all the media attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell I did eat pretty good just now 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell Sounds like the same Koolaid I hear that if you support Donald Trump, you’re a racist.  I think there are people that say #BlackLivesMatter because they actually believe Black Lives Matter and don’t care what agenda the actual organization is trying to push<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a pretty broad brush you’re using to paint your picture of every single person that supports BLM and speaks out. Have you talked to Patrick about it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntruderTimmy It is a tough one, even with the playoff significance of some of them, there’s still plenty that are just down right filthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScooterDaniels0 Yes. There’s plenty of passes in his highlight reel that could only be in a few QBs reel if any other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@housestarkkc I was wondering if this would make an appearance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abyrne44 20 yards downfield too. He’s Breaking the mold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@21ForLifeHOF @PatrickMahomes Thanks. Great stuff in here. Just 2seasons worth is highlights too. Can’t wait for the next thread with all new ones to marvel over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imavictimtoo No kidding. Demetrius "All or Nothing“ Harris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said 👊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buildomaha That was an amazing play! Great catch by D Rob too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardedBthymane @Ravens @Chiefs This, the 4th &amp; 9, the OT loss and Jackson 0-2 vs KC... that’ll do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PowercatRyan @camden_veit This is his signature play for me so far. The moment, the toughness, the head fake... his highlight reel is fantastic and we’re only 2 years of highlights in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToHaveAHome That was emotional. That was the moment you knew we were definitely going to the Super Bowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krush430  https://t.co/8cz1VkOULS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complete truth... and not many wrong answers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_UncleBud_ The Run is my favorite play... I’ve changed my mind during this thread 😁 It may change to 4th &amp; 9 vs Baltimore by the end of the night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldyneDicke1 There’s a lot to choose from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTTJKC I like the look at the Ravens bench... like he just hit a 3 in their eye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKO8226 Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKO8226 @JLinnick 40 yard line AKA Chiefs RedZone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKO8226 @camden_veit Won’t be the last time 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefCardinalkc @jmull_adkins @tonyromo Yep. We’re used to losing those games, now we expect to win everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sflaw99 @JLinnick Great game to be at.... at least for a Chiefs fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abyrne44 Love this angle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jc_playmakerWNY Haha...so many. didn’t even mention  The Run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisplacedChief His top 20 are better than mosts top 5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WiseManOrHerb @osborn_caleb Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylertomlen Popular choice...so many great plays in 1 game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YosemiteSully 😎 We’re 2 years in to him starting and he already has so many memorable plays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ulmedas @Aksala07273193 @Jumpshotbroke @PatrickMahomes I’m pretty sure @RealMNchiefsfan put one together a while back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayhawkfan222 @Aksala07273193 Haha, that’s classic. "No no no no... swish”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of 3 amazing throws that game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonhallPE Oh, the classic lefty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelMOCards @brittanylynne8 Best playa ever 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison Haha. Wouldn’t doubt it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camden_veit This might actually be my favorite play... the no look is my favorite throw... there, no I can have both! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewschiefs That might be the best throw of his entire career. He had so many great throws in this game 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theashhole317 Next year is going to be epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdogger @jmull_adkins @tonyromo No one makes this play but Mahomes&amp; maybe Rodgers &amp; Wilson...he leaped those 2 after this game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kc_fun The run is already iconic and the throw to Watkins was the play that let all of #ChiefsKingdom know we were going to the  Super Bowl. Love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kailkolby77 @Aksala07273193 Yeah, this was him letting KC know he was the real deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DieselSoar WASP.... legendary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nod_Anep You could make quite a few strong arguments with all the plays he’s had tbh. This thread is great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dockery_ii It was al or nothing with Demetrius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SammyTuTimez This was fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefCheefin Here you go. I remember watching that drive just shaking my head in awe   https://t.co/Hoyoz96OgT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelStrand6 I mean, you just don’t ever see that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCdrewb05 Man, I didn’t expect that one to take so long to show up! That was the play of the playoffs for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan_C_Craig Oh man, that would drive me bonkers... it’s the shot of milk left in the container when I want a big bowl of cereal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcappskc @Jumpingspider4 Yeah. Von has the utmost respect for the dude, which is cool for him being so young. Denver has already gotta be sick of the dude... I love it 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekReed64 He’s had some amazing misses! I remember a drop in the end zone in Denver, he scrambled around, took a shot as he threw it and I think Robinson dropped it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPatJesus @Aksala07273193 Was that the 1st one at Arrowhead??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF The old one is the only one I’ve seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlaskanRoyal  https://t.co/cRPvmj7EAd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aksala07273193 Well, then the swagger celebration after the score... we new we had something special<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coop_step1 I gotta get on some Hulu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgraf Yes.. exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 @Aksala07273193 Ha! Enter the Raider guy 😁 I honestly don’t remember that play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a perfectly view at MileHigh of his first completion. What a throw on 3rd down.  This was the start of something beautiful  😁  https://t.co/hgn16miRP5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a lot of people remember this sneaky no look from start #1 in Denver 2017  https://t.co/6mPi5OrRzf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coop_step1 Yeah. If you’re a fan of football, you gotta love watching the kid. He really is "Showtime” Good call on the ticket. You don’t get to see half of the amazing things he does that just don’t get shown. He’s had some drops that were incredible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aksala07273193 We were just talking about this play on the thread somewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aksala07273193  https://t.co/XEcq9KvnOg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmull_adkins @tonyromo Sign me up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coop_step1 Hopefully we see some more jaw droppers this season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmull_adkins @tonyromo I’m right there with you. Wilson is my 2nd favorite too.  That’d be a great Super Bowl matchup for 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinnick Complete confidence... 3rd &amp; 20  https://t.co/XnlQ6CHWSw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goody424_ I love the ones against Denver 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillGroner1 From game 1 2017 in Denver, really. Even though he didn’t throw a td (how odd now thinking back) He was close to great in that game with his backups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinnick That was good! This was better for me. Against the Raiders... at Oakland... he did what i was thinking after he threw that TD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinnick As Chiefs fans, we’ve never seen swagger &amp; confidence like his at the QB position... I love seeing that come out on the field.  When he did this looking at the Raiders bench.... man 😎  https://t.co/dX0wKjZchs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinnick Bullet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinnick That was kind of the start of it all wasnt it??  https://t.co/XEcq9KvnOg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmull_adkins @tonyromo I put this one in. A tweet earlier.... crazy.  Can’t believe we lost that game! RUSSELL WILSON was a stud that game too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmull_adkins @tonyromo This was huge. The first game I thought, "man, we had that one”  and then this happened. It’s never over with 1️⃣5️⃣ Romo is the best... no doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KcchiefsF Closest comparison I can see.  Once he wins another his popularity will grow like MJ did. MJ is on another level as far as popularity goes, but Mahomes can get in the conversation for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KcchiefsF He’s on another level for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit That has the chance to build into something historic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asal1876 No more needs to be said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jumpshotbroke This one is up there for sure 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet An amazing game to be at. Couldn’t really ask for more in a regular season game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s your favorite Patrick Mahomes play?  Here’s mine...   https://t.co/ZJOZeDtpDy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this 👇🏽  https://t.co/Di1fR3skuX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anonymo12869076 Can’t wait to see the media coverage/spin on that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ion_chiefs @bizgangsmitty That is definitely worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsportsfan84 @Mathieu_Era I’ll be there. I ain’t missed Mahomes in Denver yet. Hit a brotha up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsportsfan84 @Mathieu_Era Next season is going to be too much fun 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CelsoJessRodrg1  https://t.co/HVLwV1PGe6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@volumeKC Respecting different opinions has become a lost piece of casual conversation.  It’s ok to disagree and be respectful, and having a different opinion shouldn’t automatically put you into a specific category chosen by the person who disagrees with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkSports13 Haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsilky10 Yeah, they don’t wanna hear that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit People I’ve never met before at last years game in Denver recognized me from that video &amp; that bucket hat. Pretty cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsilky10 👊🏽I’m in Colorado Springs... no one wants that more than me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsilky10 I hate when I reply with another tweet on the thread 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garret1Garrett Simply &amp; perfectly stated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ppflumm Very True. Winning it all is no easy task. It seems like KC will be in the mix for a while though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drstuck Right. Everything violent happening is because of a select group of idiots not protesting anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magic_Mahomes I’m also filled with compassion 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magic_Mahomes Even....    sorry, dropped my phone 😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@K_Wiechman Sad.  Love the movie though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit Yeah. I’m definitely not falling for that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_Wiechman So hard. Even looking up info online, you can’t just flippantly trust the 1st source of info you see. I unplugged for a while, because of this specifically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_Wiechman ...and the media has so much power &amp; influence.... kinda scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness Haha! Donald is a beast, no doubt, but how many teams are taking 99 over 15?? I can’t think too many are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF Yeah. Too easy to point fingers &amp; blame.... especially on Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kc_megs I haven’t thought of that. That’s sad that your answer is right 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whitney_Hartman 👍🏽 Hard to argue that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness I opened the flood gates! All good, thanks. Hope all is well your way 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHighlight No doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s the biggest lie in America currently??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting seeing all the Covid19 masks at these protests and people shoulder to shoulder with one another 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love everyone.... The End.                   🤎🖤🤍💙<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/aMc9FnvG0G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re wrong. He didn’t have the same opinion as you. You should study the great Dr. Martin Luther King jr a little more before throwing out his quotes that seem to fit your narrative  https://t.co/H5EWaRgzDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOFginger @gersjon17 You’re right, Dr. King can speak for himself  https://t.co/1uwRYGSw4C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF Haha! Finally! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. People are justifying their actions by saying they are "protesting”. They have their own agendas and seem too concerned about the root issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOFginger Ahh.... The "Purge” theory.... gotcha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOFginger Karpernicks protest prompted the NFL to act and make changes to help support his  cause. 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOFginger All the talk is all about riots and looting now, not much about George and the root problem anymore.  Peaceful protests can help make a difference....... crime cannot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aksala07273193 @PatrickMahomes Im a big Jordan fan and I see some of that same drive in 15 that 23 had. We’re in for a fun 10-15 years of ball in KC.  When he scored in the Super Bowl and went screaming to the other end of the field, not every has that. Knowing when to run. That he’ll improve on. Sliding too😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aksala07273193 @PatrickMahomes Yeah, I was looking for this play for a while because I felt the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The memory of George Floyd gets tarnished with every act of vandalism, looting and violence and it’s just sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magic_Mahomes ...I was looking on milk cartons, checking my phone for every amber alert....  https://t.co/wc7eDAK1OA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@D_Harms19 Freakin great play. Glad you posted it because I couldn’t remember what game it emend from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those Covid19 masks are coming in handy for these looters &amp; rioters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Harms19 I was looking for this play. You remember the down &amp; distance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was one of my favorite throws of the year from @PatrickMahomes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelsoJessRodrg1 Yes sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOUR #SaturdayLimerick  Crazy week, I just don’t know what to write  cop kneels on a man’s neck taking his life?

<|startoftext|>@Arkutec I’ve never spent much time on Pinterest but I will now after your post 👊🏽 It does seem like it’s a hub for creativity and that makes me want to explore it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J58King That would be a real tight squeeze💰💰💰 The price isn’t worth the slight improvement. Thornhill will be hungry next year and the next 2 years on his rookie deal. That safety tandem has a chance to be historic in KC for the years left Mathieu has in his prime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impressive..... most impressive  (Darth Vader voice)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KG_Chief I’m with you. Thornhill  is the real deal too. I wouldn’t give him up on a rookie deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who on the #Chiefs would you be willing to give up to go along with a future 1st round pick &amp; a future 3rd or 4th to get Jamal Adams next to Tyrann Mathieu?? Would you??   https://t.co/j3ZIbLAQJt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NuttreeTv @AntonDelFresco @jstoner44 @bighurtrocks I hear you. Just a dumb thing to say, either way<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NuttreeTv @232Msgta @JoeBiden It definitely doesn’t take much to criticize Jemele Hill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit Haha! I’m in! I’m sure the NFL does t want to promote that.... I’d love to see it. They should have something in there for players to get unsportsmanlike penalties after tds... certain players, OBJ, Hill.... their ratings will be in the 90’s!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah. Saw the popularity and piggybacked me 😉  @chiefsdaily15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefsdaily15 I’m gonna try it.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefsdaily15 Such a basic tweet too. They probably look at yours and think, "Hmm, this is all I need put to get 3,000 likes!”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow @JoeBiden.  Just wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvJakevI Yep I think about that too... or pumping gas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zackychan26 I think it moght have been the no look or the pass to Ware right afterwards! So many great plays from him in this game 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit He had an ugly pick, but so many iconic plays in his career in just this game alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Chiefs are going to crush some teams next season. Just a feeling   https://t.co/jDPGcQ2zOi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do moths spend all daytime flying towards the sun☀️because it’s the brightest thing out there??  https://t.co/RlXrJrtQBF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit I rewatched this recently and it was a fantastic game... Mahomes was spectacular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerBeesDad They have a tough job and it’s only gonna get tougher next season 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😎 This makes me warm &amp; gooey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dread_the_Red I’m over it. I get it. My parents are almost 80, but I’m gonna hug the people i see that I love.. sorry. (If they want a hug 😁)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shagrax5 Haha... right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s funny to see the people shopping at Walmart that choose to wear masks, but don’t care too much about the 6 foot rule because they really need celery &amp; turnips 🙄  https://t.co/Ud2TEUPlPV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs new punter @tommy_townsend has a big shoe to fill, but he can definitely help the #Chiefs defend their title.  Time for some fakes Dave Toub!  https://t.co/jkYMczKeXU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@systomburner Good one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdogj @MBSiMMENS No, I agree. The running game would be better with a guy like Hunt back there, I’m just not sure he would have been enough to overcome a Bob Sutton led D that season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdogj @MBSiMMENS That’s always going to be a question. The problem was Bob Sutton and the defense that year. Williams filled in well once Hunt was gone. He definitely would have helped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MBSiMMENS And his party ended coming out into that hotel hallway       😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corydroe That was such a big game. Kick off the season like that... fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I’ll trust anything a guy with this in his bio has to say...... 🙄  https://t.co/feUddUImXD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again....  they’re already in the right order 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomoJ24 That is definitely an acceptable answer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NuttreeTv I missed it! You can tell him there’s 1 more happy birthday wish from someone you’ve actually met 😉  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  https://t.co/evBD6AprSZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen And in convincing fashion. 30-0... and Davis going 100+ yards on the opening kickoff!  That game was crazy because it was a blowout... I wasn’t used to that at the time! Even this year we couldn’t get a win in the playoffs without giving Chiefs fans heart attacks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayhawk_v1 I was saying excluding last year basically.  Mahomes against the Colts was fantastic. If you go back and watch that game, he was in complete control and didn’t waver. Checking to the right plays, using the hard count..... MVP type game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs_Brazil I’m sure Gay will make a big impact, especially if he starts day 1. I love Queens energy though, and the fact that energy is on the Ravens....  https://t.co/SNrZrjgu5S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraAndrews16 I knew it wouldn’t take long for this one to pop up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB Ravens did well, not enough though 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bdred88 @BrizzzyyyB I have no doubt we got the right pieces that were available.... still didn’t want Queen in a  rival 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m still pissed the Ravens got  Patrick Queen 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides the recent playoff run, what’s your favorite #Chiefs game only going back to when Alex Smith arrived?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Doing it right 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@btsportsman Gotta have that🧂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corydroe @ChiefsHighlight ...and a healthy Mahomes. He wasn’t 100% for a good portion of the regular season between his ankle and his knee. I can’t think he’s going to be anything less than unstoppable in year 3 of this offense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattfromKC Hot McDonald’s fries may be the best, but cold McDonald’s fries are definitely the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All day... perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHighlight @stuper_hero_ It’s been a bit since Reid has needed to put in a lot of 2 TE sets with the weapons we have. Reid will make some plays for RSJ 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nacho fries are no joke tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHighlight Reid* 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHighlight Yeah. Veach will utilize both well. Throw in Edwards Helaire and we’re gonna be tough to stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Proctor7 @TSEKansasCity Yep. I was kinda shocked when we didn’t get a TE in the draft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PawsnPalsnyc @TSEKansasCity Tyreek is a must to double. Teams have to account for Hill first. Kelce is no picnic to plan for either<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_real_EKJ You’re right, he was the best. All respect to Jim Brown &amp; Walter Payton.... this guy was just so electric<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ClintMcKenzie1 That is it exactly. That’s what sparked the tweet  https://t.co/bR1q9Q6X2S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LightSkinnedBrothers #HalfricansUnite 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefstalk1 I hear you. Ive gotten that exact explanation from complete strangers before, which is flattering. But those who ask without any follow up questions or without purpose... those are the ones who I’m left thinking, "What was behind they’re curiosity.” I’m a very positive person too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9 out of 10 times I’m sure it’s innocent, and your exactly right, curiosity is fueling it... but my answer will do SOMETHING in their head. Subconsciously even. Maybe its a girl who thinks I’m cute, now maybe she looks for more Halfrican men 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClintMcKenzie1 It’s not a thing I get bent out of shape about when it happens, and it happens a lot, but it does make me think about that person’s intentions asking it. 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2k15hawk That’s an interesting perspective. Kinda feel that way sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefinCarolina Bosa is great. Great in the Super Bowl too. The answer should be a defensive player IMO 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @RonnieLester16 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @RonnieLester16  https://t.co/HkCcAVxWUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2k15hawk Right! If there’s a base behind the question like you mentioned that’s awesome. I’ll go into my background if you want to get to know me.  The "What are you” with no futher curiosity is what gets me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vitamin_j I hear you and you’re right, depends on the individual. It also does create a "category” to put you in though, which is the thing I have an issue with. Does me telling you my race have an impact on how you view me? It shouldn’t.... but I know it sometimes does. Not too big a deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @RonnieLester16 2... now 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnieLester16 No doubt. It’s just funny cause I get asked a ton what I am, and I always think to myself what is motivating the question...🤷🏽‍♂️  When I was young, My answer would change based on the ladies asking 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhereYaSoulAt Broncos in the top 10?? 😬 Is Skip Bayless helping Ray Charles put this together??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people say they’re "just curious” and I get it, but WHY are you curious? When I tell you will that change how you perceive me?? Am I now put into a category that I wasn’t previously in?  If you treat everyone the same, race should never be an issue or a topic of conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you get offended when people ask what race/ethnicity you are??   As a mixed race individual,  I kinda do, because... really, why does it matter??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project_Veritas @realDonaldTrump @jack @Twitter Couldn’t it be figuring in tweets people undo? It has to account for those somewhere, which would be a decrease.  Shadiness is out there, I’ve had tweets just randomly disappear... all political ones<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robdogj @AlexLee67 286 yards, 3 TDs 2 int’s.... That’s pretty much average for Mahomes though 😂... especially 47 minutes into the game he hadn’t done too much.  He spoils us bro. What a stud. I can’t wait for a new season with these guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdogj @AlexLee67 Gotcha. Good call. Chiefs are tough bro. If we can drop 30 on SF with Mahomes playing average , next year with all these starters returning....im calling it....we gonna hit 40 a few times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdogj @AlexLee67 Chiefs scoring 30.... Not the hottest take ever 😉  Lets drop 40 on them in Vegas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs Well, it feels good knowing the Ravens have a losing record all time against such an impoverished franchise 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacksUpNext Wish you could have made it past the #6 seed this year 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs The truth is, #Chiefs are Super Bowl Champions 🏆 and the Ravens were the #1 seed and lost to the #6 seed.  Lamar Jackson’s 2 career playoff games were gross, and Mahomes is 2 for 2 making it to the AFC Championship.  See you next season ✌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to worry about Jackson owning a single win in the playoffs bro. Way to earn that 1 seed 😂  And piss it away to the Titans  https://t.co/kZi8t68Mdz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs Ok. Ravens are 4-6 lifetime against the Chiefs. How’s that for a ratio?? I’ll just put that there since the past is so important &amp; relevant for you to bring up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs I see no point you were trying to prove. If it’s that Jackson hasn’t beaten the Chiefs... point made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs Sucks for you, because Lamar Jackson is good and he has to go through Mahomes every single year to get that ring... and so far he hasn’t faired well 0️⃣➖2️⃣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NineYearOld_ @JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs Well, I’ll let you figure out the ratio for me when we win the next 2 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 you know, the last time the Raiders beat the Chiefs, was Oct 2017... I was in Hawaii and it ruined my night in Hawaii... thought you might get some pleasure out of that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 Just not Kelce, and Hardman, and Watkins 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jplazak They may still be Pooh... but Hopkins will bring it no doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWMOSOONER I have been there. I’m so sorry to hear this. Stay strong 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Chiefs won the Lombardi trophy with a defense in their 1st year under  STEVE SPAGNUOLO.  Now, returning almost everyone on D, I have no doubt the Chiefs will have one of the better defensive groups from start to finish in the NFL in year 2.  #RunItBack #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/3PkSSmiYjG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsith88 @KevinSa56801702 So true. Now the defense is coming back for year 2... KC is going to be extremely difficult to slow down, let alone beat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmull_adkins I hear you. Ravens are good too. I don’t enjoy the fans that always try to predict the future and say what’s GOING to happen. Raiders fans seem to do it the most 😆 .... just not my thing 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacksUpNext @chiefsfan413 @NineYearOld_ @Swirlzdon56 @DrakeCursedUs 1 every year if you start counting now 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’ll just use that ratio, it’s easier and more relevant since Len Dawson isn’t helping win any titles anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacksUpNext Mahomes has never lost a game by more than a score..... so don’t hold your breath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know, cause its never happened since 15 showed up 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 Raiders got Riggs... he looks pretty exciting. Jacobs is the real deal too. You need 2 people to keep up with Hill though!  1 on 1 that guy is gonna win 95% of the time. You good with Carr??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 Boy, Chiefs are tough to stop, especially going into year 3 with a bunch of starters returning. I’m a Chiefs fan, but they are definitely tough.  Raiders have a chance to competitive for sure. You know they want to make an impression the first year in Vegas too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andy definitely can get too cute. Hopefully having their pick at any RB they wanted in the draft makes us more of a threat on the ground next year 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSa56801702 Should be a fun season in the AFC West!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Awesome 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Harms19 This is probably true. I think he would have carved out more of a role last season especially after Shady stopped seeing touches. That should tell us something<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1Black_Guru It’s still an entertaining game. I’m good watching it now that we got that 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt. It’s no accident #DirtyDan has been in KC for 7 years now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cursahge @kent_swanson Shoot, Veach got Ward from Dallas for Parker Ehinger... who’s played 8 NFL games in 4 years. Even if we don’t draft a CB, they’ll be some undrafted names he has tucked away I’m sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m just hoping he can start<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_DaWaun No doubt. Check out his days at UCONN too if you haven’t. Dude was bad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_DaWaun He also looks like he’s 30! Dude has always had that baby face 👶🏾  I watched him like I watched Allen Iverson. Never wanted to miss a play because some crazy was bound to happen at any moment.  Dude is dope<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The dive at :45.... Priestesque He’s gonna catch some passes out the backfield.  The spin move is going to be a crowd favorite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs_Brazil The kid fits KC perfectly. He’ll be productive. Maybe not next year, but once he’s "the guy”, he’s going to be great in Reid’s offense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀  I know it,  @cheetah is going to be amazing next season, even being doubled 90% of the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flybaby014563 Hope you make it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could end up having a top 5 offense and defense next year with all the studs returning to #RunItBack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whitney_Hartman That was my draft dream!! Then he goes to the Ravens to pour salt in the wound 😒 We got even scarier on offense though 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clyde Edwards-Helaire: #LSU RB 5-7, 210bs 39.5” vertical 2019 season: National Champion 1,290 rush yards/16 TD’s 50 receptions for 399 yards/ 1TD  #Chiefs 1st round pick at #32  https://t.co/3GF30OKMRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damien Williams, and now  Clyde Edwards-Helaire. Next years offense could be legendary #RunItBack   https://t.co/45cRJiInHm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring the dive back to the #Chiefs Clyde!! This offense is going to get even better with this addition.... watch out NFL 👀  Next level coming soon....  https://t.co/ph1pfxbEyb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJeremyS16 Swift is talented as well. All the top guys are pretty good. Swift fits the Chiefs pretty darn well too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>McKinney would be a good piece for Spags to play with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck He goes to the freaking Ravens too 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck I’m definitely not disagreeing with it if they did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck McKinney would be a good piece for Spags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck Oh well. We need the picks too. 5 picks isn’t a lot. No RB’s off the board. 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad he didn’t last just a few more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Close 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sli003 Too good to be true. I was hoping!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s still going to be a really good player at 32 if Veach opts to stay there.  #Ravens have a pretty good D..... On paper  https://t.co/h5nZvaMURh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How can the Ravens pass on Queen 😬 I hope they do, that is a very possible get for Baltimore though 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J58King Could have been<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many more pics before the #Chiefs, Kobe???  https://t.co/HZHhz9YlZT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CF4E Theres gonna be a good player at 32<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers on the clock! I dont see LB 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CF4E Queen flies to the ball. I like the intensity he seems to bring at that 2nd level. I trust Veach whatever he does..... I don’t know how disappointed I’ll be if he passes on Queen though!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CF4E Wouldn’t take much now to trade up with the Seahawks.... I think I’d be ok with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CF4E I can’t even keep track of the dudes Baltimore has picked up already this off season. 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHighlight 5 picks just ain’t enough with all the free agents coming at the end of this upcoming season 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’d make a bet we move back.  Although, there’s gonna be some really good players available at 32, no doubt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 Gotta include Dirty Dan. We wouldn't have had a Super Bowl without him and the plays he made in the playoffs. The image of him on the 4th down stop is priceless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoffschwartz I'm always down for a good comedy ! !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsith88 He did. I was trying to think of other guys like that. Alstott definitely had some thickness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen  https://t.co/eWXgfRmIEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KC_Football_Guy @ChiefsReporter Agreed 🤜🏽🤛🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieMo94035296 @itslilmooney Yep. The confidence is real 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaGillette1 He’s a big reason I’m a #Chiefs fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_Mallett @vinkeith @AlphaGalaxy1772 @house4dsoul @AshBasH8852 @PatrickMahomes Coaches don’t teach to throw across your body either, but if it helps win the game...... Haters gonna hate though 🤷🏽‍♂️  https://t.co/VqFr1LnXql<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerezPaylor Only 5 picks to keep the Chiefs streak going!! 😬 I’m thinking they’ll come out with more than 5 picks though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck I hear you. All the low WR numbers get me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@16_johnny3 Looks weird to me for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck Doubt it. Fuller switched to wearing Berry’s number all last year 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charvarius Ward doesn’t quite fill up the #35 like Christian Okoye did 😆  https://t.co/WfrwQbnuSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corydroe @Marshall__ck I was excited for Darrel Williams this season, but he got hurt. I’d like to see him more this year for sure. Is he the next back after Damien.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marshall__ck It’d be nice to have a 3rd &amp; 2 guy that we know will pound it for 3 yards, but if that’s all they’re on the roster for, I’d rather have that spot for someone who can do more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I 100% definitely DO want for this to possibly happen. It might be the coolest thing ever, maybe not, I’m 50/50....leaning against it 60% of the time it works every time  https://t.co/fVH2f6tiPy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs_Brazil That would be amazing!  https://t.co/6tlx1ioMpf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>◻️True ☑️False<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_sexton @tkelce @Chiefs It’s definitely going to be a great year!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_sexton @tkelce I hope he ends up having a better play, because hey, that’d be pretty spectacular.... playoffs will create come big opportunities to surpass this one 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is going to be great #LastDance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @tkelce  https://t.co/iHnxTFjTIS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @tkelce I’m the forever optimistic one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @tkelce I’m telling you, it’s not too early to think 3 peat!! That would be the most amazing thing that could happen IMO. 3 in a row to give us 4.... 😎  https://t.co/qNcx3d93xh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PrimeTimeTVBen @tkelce That’s awesome  https://t.co/tbMsYncfle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrjones1985 @tkelce Totally. It’s just a fun play to watch and then the effort just puts it over the top. Freakin awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleMSuter @tkelce ...and hops!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samhoarddddd @tkelce It is. He jumps over 15 feet too! Nothing was going to stop him from scoring... I love that about the play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit @tkelce ...add in the confidence of finally completing the mission and this team can do a lot of damage for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much says it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs_jones @tkelce There’s an engraved memory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d like to know what @tkelce thinks is his favorite play of himself as a Chief. You have a plethora to think back on.  This is my favorite dance though.....  https://t.co/PWZ2bv2Kvx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet It actually looks better because he has such a long neck!!  https://t.co/rRKFjkvdsZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet So..... I bought one, he lost it. Then I bought another... and then I found the first one he lost. So now he wears both and has the nickname 2 Chainz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet @tkelce Same. I was up flying around like Kelce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet He does have some bling  https://t.co/DSnNQdF41i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet Haha!! That’s hilarious.  That looks pretty good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet I’ll spread the word 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet That’s pretty slick. I’ve always wanted a minpin that looks like Moses. Cute crew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet Lol. Thanks. My daughters would love the opportunity though! Is that your site?  https://t.co/WZ3HflbDDa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is my favorite @tkelce play so far.   https://t.co/bk87WCX08N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kcwolfpac79 @ChiefsChannel Me too. I had an amazing squad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrick22835248 Bro, that was the cheat code of the 90’s  https://t.co/bTvs4kD7ST<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Broncos fans showed the most class I’ve ever seen out of them when Mahomes went down that game. Loudest cheer I’ve ever heard in that stadium for an opposing player when he got up &amp; walked ✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs I was there... I’ll be there. I’ll be unavailable when Mahomes goes down though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jw4zou @ChiefsChannel Yes. The game play was pretty great too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vitamin_j May?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jtfawver No doubt. Made you play more to get more. It was fantastic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HandlingBizness @ArrowheadTom Speaks was drafted for the 4-3 I have no doubt. I’m excited to see him get some time in Spags D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsChannel One of my most played games. Played so much to get those elite players with 90’s ! ! Game was so solid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bordanjuff That seems like a shot at Lenny &amp; Bell &amp; especially Derrick Thomas giving him that title already. I have no problem calling him the most talented Chiefs player of all time right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 Haha!! I didn’t even realize it was from the Switch. Bro, I’m a Star Wars junkie no doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 What screen shot??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopeschool22 You’re definitely not the first person to say that. Just one of them things.   Now I know what the guy who’s never seen Star Wars feels like<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B_Schek @ChiefsHighlight No argument here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaysonschwinn @cheetah He has.... I wanna see how fast he can go on this thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true! 😂  #TikTok  https://t.co/qG9AfUtJ5w<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@catcherntheflyz I feel your pain  https://t.co/Kxe5RlLjiu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope we don’t get a post of  "The Kicker Who Shall Not Be Named”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RathUSN @PatrickMahomes Me neither. It’s always great getting depth across the front line. Picking up Mike Remmers helps that too. This draft is going to be all about depth now that we’ve kept some key guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaminrawk Yep. Chester is up there on that list for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RathUSN @PatrickMahomes Gives us that depth that lets us use a draft pick for somewhere else 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2FIVESPORTS We’re in!! I love watching him run fast. It’s like watching a thoroughbred.  It’s fun in general watching dogs chase each other. Hope all is well,Mark 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priest Holmes. It was a treat watching this guy jump over the line to score every week.                          3️⃣1️⃣  https://t.co/rsF3PLhUTd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blacktank22 @Young_Day16 He was a draft pick, but maybe my biggest letdown I can remember 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Day16 That is a fantastic one. Totally spaced him. I thought he was a great get at the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csbutcher7696 @MBSiMMENS It was a heart attack every time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @DocJHurn21 Sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @DocJHurn21 Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes he was. The little pose when he scored... diving over the line... Priest was the truth 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Day16 We should get a great contributor no matter who it is. Veach has my trust 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @DocJHurn21 How you put that mask on your pic??  😂  That’s fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @DocJHurn21 Indeed 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefsace Imagining Priest on this current squad...  https://t.co/YM5RjFfZDK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @DocJHurn21 This is the correct answer  https://t.co/NYVnuYnMzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iiSaidSo Yep. I’m thinking 25-35 years old, most probably dig Charles, 35+ probably leaning Priest. Your right though, both were awesome players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAMINO_CHANCE I’m with you. Best available player really. You never know how that board is going to fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, God’s got this 🤷🏽‍♂️ I just pray for those that don’t have him ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Generation X’ers for sure love them some Priest 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xx_ronin Best available player. It’s what they should be doing 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KC_Mahomes I’m hoping they move back, honestly... come out with like 8 picks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to see some really FAST animals... especially dogs if you have some vids to drop #FastDogs #Cheetah #MosesTheDoberman  https://t.co/UiDkLxfEE0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep. The confidence boost that a Super Bowl win must provide for a GM could translate into continued success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Mahomes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect way of putting it. That first pick is a depth builder that will make an impact somewhere needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoachJeffHardin 😂  That’s awesome.  Throw Rudy in there too before the race<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoachJeffHardin Updated odds: Moses: -210 😉  https://t.co/iuaxAheEqF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catcherntheflyz Seems like more than Mother Nature conjured this series of events. Impeccable timing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EddieZipperer  https://t.co/fWmZFP1ImH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would you be cool with the #Chiefs drafting a RB with the 32nd pick??  https://t.co/GtTkUSUxF6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daddyfixxit No doubt. We just need to draft a rookie, (like we did with Kareem) he starts day 1 and plays 12 years for only KC... end the debate 😁 We have been spoiled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s the dudes that jump over the line at the goal line?? Lost art. Something that stands out in Holmes career to me. I miss that in the NFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Priest Holmes vs Jamaal Charles debate for best #Chiefs running back ever is real. I was around for both and both were great. I listen to all arguments. I get the whole O line thing, but man.... Preist was freakin fantastic.  https://t.co/toAJ5pUndm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think I could trust a #COVID19 vaccine if one comes out. I’ll just take my chances thank you very much.  Somethings not right with all this. Something is missing.  I know better than to trust the news anyway 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kokorisj I’m hoping we use a high pick on a stud LB 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kcsportsfan84 @cheezit I’ve never had em. I’ll have to add them to my "ways to get fatter” list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesleyPeel I trust Veach. He’s given us no reason not to.  We can’t keep everyone, but we can try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesleyPeel 8/10. I love that we’re trying to keep guys. Sammy restructuring was bigger than just cap space. It keeps our WR room as maybe the most talented in the league and no one has to fill Sammys shoes. Maybe frees up a draft spot a WR may have taken up 🤷🏽‍♂️ Breeland is the next big piece<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like a great move to replace Bell, making the most of that cap space Watkins restructure created.  I like it 👍🏽  Terry on top of everything #Chiefs as usual 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer Sneaky good 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesleyPeel Yep. Was surprised there weren’t more saying that... WR &amp; DL is no joke though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsLet That’s so funny for some reason  https://t.co/G85sBNLFof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think you can go wrong with DL or WRi don’t think you can go wrong picking the DL, but man... that WR room is packed!!  #CheetahGang  https://t.co/csjonBzQET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB Yep. Still got a lot of studs in that room. I’m excited for Speaks &amp; Okafor to get in the mix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What position group currently has the best depth for the #Chiefs??                           🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsKorean @ChiefsandChill @MecoleHardman4 @ogxfactor82 I see no reason to think he won’t make that leap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsKorean @ChiefsandChill @MecoleHardman4 @ogxfactor82 Reid’s system takes time to learn and Hardman had similar numbers to Hill his rookie year on about half the catches.  Remember how much Reid lined Hill up as a RB back in 2016?! I miss that a little 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KC_Sass @Dope_Fresh23 The most under appreciated job in the country... no doubt. They don’t do it for the pay, and a lot of them couldn’t care less. Keep up the good fight!! 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here’s a fantastic #Chiefs Monday Night Football overtime memory from 1995....  https://t.co/eJULNs6XCZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnn is terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB 😂 I know, I could have been clearer, but I don’t think I needed to be. Maybe people aren’t familiar with what was involved in the Mahomes deal to move up 🤷🏽‍♂️ It’s kind of entertaining too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcmoLEW I just watched the Lions game again! That was very exciting, the turnovers, Chris Jones domination, Breeland fumble return TD... great game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet, if anything, has shown me that a lot of people don’t pay attent  ⚠️NO ONE SAID "TRADE MAHOMES”!⚠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeJeff1957 Read it again, there’s no mention of trading Mahomes...it’s trading up to get to #10.... Like we did...... When we traded up to get Mahomes in 2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsith88  https://t.co/QPvDym0g6W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsith88  https://t.co/blyiF1ZCZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsith88 I guess adequately would mean, we don’t notice Watkins is gone if it gets to that point, and we’re still the offensive juggernaut we’re used to seeing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocJHurn21 Yeah. Hardman will be the one with the most pressure to improve. Hopefully he knows multiple positions!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntwaunZeno Read it again, no one said trade Pat. I’m talking about what the #Chiefs gave up to move to the 10 spot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corydroe @Kcchiefs58dt I agree. He’s got some good movies now that I think about it... 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, World War Z, I like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith too. That movie is funny<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KCBUKU51  https://t.co/9RFH7vMGrO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCBUKU51 Very true. I expect that to happen at least once. Probably trade 32 to get away from those guaranteed contracts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocJHurn21 Read it again my friend.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DomoJ24 Yeah. Might be a different answer next year. Either one of the 3 can dominate. Jones did dominate a few games. I was just watching the Detroit game.. dude wrecked it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corydroe He ended every. Single. Playoff game. With a huge sack.... thought he’d get at least 1 freakin vote!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefHighlights Thank you. I worked all night on this list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I got it......  1) Jerry Rice 2) Randy Moss 3) Terrell Owens 4) Larry Fitzgerald  5) Jon Baldwin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chuckbait Haha I was a tecno bowl junkie!! Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m good with the shocker 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THR With a "Space” Mountain renovation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2006NBAFinalMVP @stefondiggs Combined with superb tracking ability, good route running, and the ability to high point and come down with a ball in traffic... that’s a pretty good start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time seeing this in its entirety. Rare to see this emotion from the most iconic figure the sports world has ever seen. Great speech                  2️⃣4️⃣&amp;2️⃣3️⃣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketlarsen I love golf. Thanks for the heads up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 There’s exactly 💯 regular season victories to choose from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 I hear you. I would never take it that serious. Thanks for the follow though 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stefondiggs A lot of attributes this dude has  https://t.co/8p6d6LsIcH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatInfluence5 I try!! Sometimes I’ll get on someone’s page who followed me and see nada Chiefs! So I sometimes don’t follow back... and then I get called out 😞 and sometimes I just freakin miss entirely                                    🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pssst.... I follow back #Chiefs fans.... Pass it on.......  https://t.co/6LRbQC67B2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsportsfan84 @Kevo_Bevo Yeah, thats what I mean.... there’s a chance! The team might be bigger than the check. 🤷🏽‍♂️DRob always seemed to be making bigger plays than Conley but Conley always got the nod. Must have been a knowledge thing. I know Conley knew every position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336  https://t.co/HU0NsxuIv5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcsportsfan84 @Kevo_Bevo Seems like it. He’s not out as quickly as Conley was... maybe there’s a chance. 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’m overly optimistic sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevo_Bevo Yep.... Simmons &amp; Okudah.....lets trade our 2022 7th and a 2025 6th and go get em<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@supergoose816 a funny story Me &amp; my mom in law (Bronco fan) were at Mile High watching Chiefs/Broncos years ago. Well, Chiefs lost, like they always did at Mile High back then, and walking out, a Bronco fan comes up to me "feeling sorry” for me and gives me this jersey! My mom in law kept it😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cfan67K @cheeboso @rdrh8 @MySportsUpdate I ♥️ Matt Moore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither did Foles or Mcnabb or any other QB else Reid has coached. It’s ok to admit Mahomes is magically sexy.  You look foolish to not give him the credit he deserves and credit his success to the coaching behind it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker Not having a QB makes everything else tough. He hasn’t gotten the QB right since Manning until now.... maybe.  Big, telling year coming up for Denver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker I meant, Elway as the GM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImDavidSisneros @MySportsUpdate Alex Smith never blew up for 50 &amp; 5000 either 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImDavidSisneros @MySportsUpdate Broncos have beat Andy Reid a few times.... But they’ve never beat the 2018 NFL MVP, Super Bowl Champion &amp; Super Bowl MVP.... Patrick Lavon Mahomes  https://t.co/S7zRsFgX1w<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker What about Elway?? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker I’m sure. Imagine how KC fans felt after finally drafting a good QB after decades of hand me downs &amp; leftovers. You guys have had 2 of the best in your lifetime alone. I cant say Im rooting for you, but I like Lock and hope he does well... just not at the expense of the #Chiefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magic_Mahomes  https://t.co/pGmFnYzVo7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker I live in Colorado Springs, and it seems like most people feel the same way you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicole_Chiefs1 😯  Well done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian101nai @sheabooskyy This is the correct answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker I disagree. I think this start helped confirm the decision to trade Alex Smith and give Mahomes the team.  I like Lock, you’ve seen more of him than me, do you think he’s the guy for the next. 10 years??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 @SgtMoneymaker Mahomes is the Chiefs franchise QB and Lock is unproven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 .... and Mahomes played great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroncoFanatic97 You said: "Like a rookie making his third career start, with a limited supporting cast was gonna win that game? Be real with yourself.🙄” Your D was still good(#3)your offense sucked. Mahomes still won his 1st start.... In Denver... against the "No Fly Zone”..... With backups 🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azwids4 I snort laughed watching it 😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefHighlights Gotta give a shoutout to that O Line ✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An unbelievable stretch for # 3️⃣1️⃣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emceereach I haven’t in a few weeks, IM gonna need to get on that now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB I’m not a fan of using a first round pick on a RB, but if some of these dudes slide, how can you not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCra67723066 Man... sounds pretty refreshing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azwids4 Taking the fam... I’ll squeeze in some alone time for sure though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattConnerAA They probably tried, but it’s his choice 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahomesToKelce He was. Part of some great teams too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MahomesToKelce 🚨 UPDATE: Eric Bieniemy is putting down the clipboard and suiting up for the #Chiefs in 2020 to bolster the backfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s some weekend destination ideas I’m looking at....  #QuarantineLife #quarantine #Covid #coronavirus  https://t.co/6AHjuBKEi1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- 0-9 vs the Chiefs in their last 9 matchups  -off season paper champions never   become real champions  -Still in the AFC West with the defending  Super Bowl champions, the #Chiefs  -Mahomes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MySportsUpdate - 0-9 vs the Chiefs in their last 9 matchups  -off season paper champions never   become real champions  -Still in the AFC West with the defending  Super Bowl champions, the #Chiefs  -Mahomes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STL_Cards_nut Pat Tillman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s everybody doing this weekend??  Oh wait......                      😷😷😷😷  https://t.co/NNWiBeOSdh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB Yeah??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrizzzyyyB Hmm... strange how that played out 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rebthree I’m surprised more aren’t leaning this route with a rookie. I’m not sure about Darwin Thompson, he didn’t get a lot of looks last season. I’m excited for Darrell Williams healthy too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelsoJessRodrg1 February 2nd, 2020 @ 4:30pm EST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Earl_Hoy Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KG_Chief @ArtbyCaitlyn She is! I love when I come across talented artists on this app 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtbyCaitlyn You have an amazing talent! ❤️💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christraint i said the same thing when he scored.  I dont think you could have gone wrong either way. My argument for Williams would be that he played great all game, with few if any mistakes and Mahomes admitted he didn’t play well early. Its better for the #Chiefs &amp; the NFL this way 🤷🏽‍♂️😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see most are picking Williams. Dude has played hard from the jump, and was a beast in the playoffs. Strong argument he should have been the Super Bowl MVP too.  The Williams, Williams &amp; Thompson lawfirm   should lay down some law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraNTooCold314 Hope so. I was looking forward to seeing him get more touches. Not an easy position to learn for a rookie in Reid’s system. Hope you’re right, he can cause major matchup issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christraint Damien is the choice to start though, he’s more than earned it. Probably should have been the Super Bowl MVP, honestly... he ran hard all game and blocked great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamUinKC That’s why I’m surprised a lot of people aren’t picking a rookie!! That’d mean he DID beat out Dame and that would be en extremely sexy backfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christraint I would have put Darrel Williams as an option over Thompson. Thompson didn’t get a ton of work at all last year, I thought he would have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you had to choose, who do you want to be the starting RB, week 1, for the #Chiefs this season??  🔴 Damien Williams  🟣 Melvin Gordon  🔵 Todd Gurley  🟡 Rookie RB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Best tweet of the day 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336 If he could talk, he’d say...  https://t.co/8Jk8gQSyhy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCBUKU51 Thanks dude, he really is. One of the many quirky things he does on the daily<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You know... you could get a flight to KCMO for nothing right now @_bigplayslay23 ✈️😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deezylowe Can’t really question him after last season. I’m excited I see the next chapter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deezylowe We’ll see what Veach can do. Nothing so far makes me think he can’t put together another squad to repeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deezylowe We did and did it without a bunch of household names, besides Mathieu, which makes last year even more impressive, not to mention a new D coordinator.  Teams that spend big dough and get a bunch of big names never seem to work out in the end IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deezylowe Frank was a trade, not a free agent. I’m talking about teams like the Browns, signing like 5 dudes, great on paper, but doesn’t translate into success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WichitaChiefSam CB is going to be the tough position going into the new season. Even though Fuller was playing Safety at the end, he still was depth at the corner spot. Depth is important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CKingdom101 That’s where my mind goes every year this happens. That team &amp; the current Browns off seasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you’re good, you’re good!!                       🤷🏽‍♂️😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes Mid season moves are equally important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GetReady88 @TheRealFrankC_ @Mathieu_Era I’m talking more about teams signing a lot of free agents in the of season...they look good in the Summer, but don’t make the big difference in the Winter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GetReady88 @TheRealFrankC_ @Mathieu_Era Clark was a trade, not a free agent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or does it seem like the teams that make the biggest splashes/pickups in free agency during the off season are never really contenders at the end of the season?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336 @Willie_Roaf No thanks needed...Your a good follow partna 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefs1336 @Willie_Roaf I already got you 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MahomesToKelce Seems like a logical answer 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicole_Chiefs1 @Rigg3rd No doubt. The higher the new cap number comes in at, the more likely that happens. Tagging him means a $16,500,000 cap unless we can resign him. Tough to keep both Jones &amp; then Watkins at his $21,000,000 cap number.  I have COMPLETE faith Veach will make it work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arrowheadgirl95 I wish I had talent like that. I’m creative, just not artistic. 🤷🏽‍♂️ I have mad respect for artists ✊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKThaFather Even the Peters move had underlying stuff. They wanted him out, but Imagine his distractions in THIS locker room. I can’t blame Beach for getting something for him knowing he wasn’t resigning 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What trade, other than Peters, would make you think otherwise? 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrooklynNets made that 4th quarter freakin fun to watch. I turned this game on at the right time. LeVert  wants this win bad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rigg3rd If you take Chris Jones, no character issues like Peters had. Peters also didn’t have many suitors. I can’t imagine a team the wouldn’t want a talent like Jones. Production, leadership.... I think Veach controls this one IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Jordan Love will be moving further up draft boards because of Patrick Mahomes success<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattBishoff Double fisting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMike816 🤢  Can’t do it boss. Unless I got called out, then I’d have to 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsFocus  https://t.co/hOEnz066Qx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@URSure816 I’d fit in that category. Just the emotion of it never happening in my lifetime and the years &amp; years of crazy heartbreak coming together in 1 moment.  I always said, once we make it to the Super Bowl, we ain’t losing after everything we’ve been through!! Glad I was right! 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Look at that cool little dude in the middle......  In the back.... In the red jacket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnPomaski .. the PA announcer faintly in the background, it’s pretty awesome.  It’s awesome any way I see it actually 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aactivatedMO I’m sorry about all that. As a fan, that really had to stink. I was watching the draft thinking WTF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnPomaski Nope. I love this view and the crowd with it as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregReddell @PatrickMahomes He also could have just ran out at the same spot he dropped it... it wasn’t intentional at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iiSaidSo @The2ndMorrison @PinkLily36 @ScramblingThe @MGII_ That is a wonderful thing.  Emotions are still coming out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cfan67K @Kevo_Bevo Do I get a prize if it was me??  If not, it was definitely @Kevo_Bevo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoToRiOuSJT_48 Thanks for the info 🙏  It’s been too long since I watched a boxing match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahomesToKelce This is fantastic. Well done. Months &amp; months of research finally showing it’s fruit 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What time will this #WilderFury2 fight start tonight??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aactivatedMO But only 2 teams passed on Jordan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gator_Mouth_  https://t.co/PPUhw2tzha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@habananahh No joke. This view is great with the crowds energy building ❤️💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison Right. You’d think a #2 pick would be in there more. Good problem to have though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison I was wondering about him. Is he gonna be able to contribute??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes @JaTHURM1 That’s pouring salt, lemon juice and acid in the wounds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes @JaTHURM1 Lol.. no kidding, who is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaTHURM1 @Redbirdfan17Wes That*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaTHURM1 @Redbirdfan17Wes ... then there’s the teams just have no chance 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that’s a great memory to have. I bet it was electric. Such a big play to end the half and change the momentum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndMorrison McCaffrey is fantastic. Love watching him play. Adams &amp; Garret are good too, but I was surprised looking back at how mediocre overall the top 10 were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes It’s only gonna get worse for teams 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kalexander1012 @ChiefsFan013 Happy birthday!!!🎉🎊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redbirdfan17Wes It is pretty awesome how teams go away from their gameplans when they play the Chiefs. The SuperBowl is another example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMNchiefsfan That’s a pretty ball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryan_pdrph I didn’t even see that bobble until the replay, I think I lost my voice shortly after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#3: The Run.  All I wanted Mahomes to improve on from the 2018 season was his running...and he exceeded my expectations, no better example than this tough run. The toughness and confidence it provided the team at that moment carried over to the Super Bowl   https://t.co/3EB40Gupqg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2: Wasp... nothing more needs to be said  #3.....  https://t.co/xnHn019pGu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s my 3 favorite plays of the season for the #Chiefs. Momentum seems to be a big factor in my choices.   #1:  Dirty Dan’s 4th down stop. Unbelievable tackle and recognition and without it, there’s a chance the other 2 don’t even happen.    #2......  https://t.co/j8kl81VfGQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigspence4 1 spot 😂 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe 3, average at best, WR’s went in the top 9 prior to Mahomes 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wpence21 You’re right. I got the one on the right and it makes me feel like my head is massive.  I got this 9Forty flexfit SnapBack at the pro shop and it fits great. It’s the only snap back I’ve seen like it, but I hope there’s more  https://t.co/A5XhrGNBRV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theashhole317 @Nike @Chiefs Not according to the message Nike just sent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got this from @nikestore No word on when that collection will hit our site at the moment.

<|startoftext|>Why hasn’t @Nike released any @Chiefs Super Bowl champions gear?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SportsTalkofKC You like wasp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCForestDarlo @sticksgod 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCCHIEFanatics All depends on the $$$. I think someone will overpay him. CB depth is my worry going into next season. He helps there and with safety depth which is cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarge_AC @RealistKingdom 31 year old Chris Harris?? You want to spend big money on a 31 year old CB?? CB depth will be the biggest issue this offseason. Depending on how much it’ll cost, I think Fuller is worth a spot. He may get offered a ton from someone else, if so, then let him walk. Draft a CB too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealistKingdom He didnt lose his spot to Fenton, Mathieu was playing the slot mostly at the end of the regular season allowing Spagnuolo to put players in spots to succeed, so he put Fuller at safety. Then Thornhill goes down and Fuller continued to play well at the shorthanded safety spot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarge_AC @ChiefsTroll @ArrowheadPride A brother can still dream though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigchiefB That’s what I’m afraid of. Good CB’s don’t hit the market often 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBMvpMahomes He is fantastic, and only gonna get better. If we got anything less than that, we’re getting fleeced. Hope we find a way to keep him... at least tagged for the Super Bowl title defense season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dblanchard78 I could probably do the hair ok 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 Tough decisions all over. Chris Harris jr. is already being talked about coming over... get yo popcorn ready!  https://t.co/swg80s313m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealistKingdom Had the thumb injury early, but finished strong, not to mention playing CB &amp; Safety.  Frank Clark didn’t start out too hot either 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where does this throw by @PatrickMahomes rank amongst all-time Super Bowl throws? (Try hard to answer objectively!)  https://t.co/xnHn00ROOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UCITYGJones32 @StoneColdJones I agree. I want him. Veach gotta do his thing!!  Draft picks are unproven too... gotta find a way 🤞🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs I’m all in on Pennell. He probably gets a nice offer from someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs I think he’s a big piece for letting Mathieu roam &amp; do his thing IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs Pen Nell is the type of player that gets overpaid @ChiefsfanCHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs What you think about Fuller?  I want him back. CB/Safety don’t come around too often<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 I gotta think he’s gonna get some pretty lucrative offers.  #Discount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs There’s a lot to watch 👀  Gonna be some very tough decisions  #InVeachWeTrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeJeremiah1 @2PAC 🎶 Classic 🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gyptsea1962 @ChiefsfanCHI @ChiefsReporter @TerezPaylor @Chiefs 💯 Can’t wait to watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsChannel No kidding. 🙄 Maybe he’ll resign with us for only that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 I agree. He’s young too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffEvens  https://t.co/YB2LtqaCKQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sissychiefsfan @citadelchief I love the confidence 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsTroll Probably. He’s pretty good all over the field.  and let’s Mathieu roam. I really think KC tries hard to keep him. After Jones, he’s the one player im very interested in what happens.  #SuperBowlDiscount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Kendall Fuller is one of the top priorities to resign this off season. A slot CB who was playing a lot of snaps at safety for the #Chiefs... we won’t get the same production from whoever replaces him IMO.   https://t.co/ykLc4ESeow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sissychiefsfan @citadelchief How do you know it makes us better when we haven’t even drafted the players, or if they’ll contribute right away??  1 things for sure, it makes THEM better... immediately.  Nothing about being scared, it’s just stupid 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally get to use this gif!!  https://t.co/eJBF9sFGIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This really did blow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sissychiefsfan @citadelchief Why would a team intentionally make a divisional rival better, for unproven draft picks??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes @brittanylynne8 Happy Valentines Day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF Belichick saves a challenge flag for this play, maybe all that BS you mentioned happens..... but he didn’t     🤷🏽‍♂️  https://t.co/V721FrmtAo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vitamin_J_ @kent_swanson @barleyhop @ChiefinCarolina 😂   https://t.co/A3ATE116O9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sissychiefsfan @citadelchief He definitely isn’t getting traded within the division..... I’d bet that hard.   We don’t want Mahomes seeing that beast twice a year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vitamin_J_ @kent_swanson @barleyhop @ChiefinCarolina I wanted to see him in Spags defense last season. Seems like he was drafted for it 🤷🏽‍♂️ I still want to see what he can do in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchwinn I like your style 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statmuse @WashWizards @RealDealBeal23 All I get from this list is.... Kelly Tripucka averaged 28?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how @Bspeaks9 is doing...                              🤔    https://t.co/aXQuEfkWYD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoDude___ You’re right. Hope so 🤞🏽 I’d hate to lose the big fella. Veach gotta show out this offseason. Tough decisions coming #InVeachWeTrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanfilti Still gotta move the chains running the ball, you’re assuming the Chiefs D doesn’t stop them.... you’re right though, Kyle reminded me a little of old school Reid with that clock management with the lead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sucks, but everything he said is right. Keeping Jones as well as locking up Mahomes will be tough. You get some draft picks from trading JONES and replace him with young (cheaper) talent.  Jones about to get paid though.  https://t.co/fRbuCvEalJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Uti3QHI4EQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwoverdrive @volumeKC No doubt. I’m excited to see how this offseason plays out. Lots of interesting decisions with free agents &amp; contract situations. I’ll post the free agents list here too.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@volumeKC @dwoverdrive Hitchens getting extended or restructured are the only ways to save cap space with his contract according to OTC.  A Mahomes deal most likely makes these numbers ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2020 salary cap will increase to between $196.8 million and $201.2 million  From @TomPelissero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chiefs top 6 cap numbers for 2020: Frank Clark-$22,700,000 Sammy Watkins-$21,000,000 Tyreek Hill-$17,650,000 Tyrann Mathieu-$16,333,333 Eric Fisher-$15,231,666 Anthony Hitchens-$12,598,750   💰💰TOTAL: $105,513,749💰💰                           🤐  From  https://t.co/4Q7jWlOvdr  https://t.co/WkvVi69vwX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanfilti Easier said than done &amp;  Mahomes doesn’t need much time.  https://t.co/ABPdCltE3W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Chiefs D ended up taking on the role the Niners were supposed to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can see that. I’ve felt that way many times  Probably the same exact feeling when Mahomes throws the 4th quarter pick for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsraelBissell Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeJeremiah1 49ers were the best in the NFC and the Chiefs were the best in the AFC. Made for a pretty exciting Super Bowl. Good luck next year  https://t.co/jWPurHv1au<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeJeremiah1 I hear you bro, I’m sorry. Chiefs fans have had an incredible amount of heartbreak over the past 50 years though, and you had prime Joe Montana &amp; young getting championships like they were on sale at the thrift store.  I’d love to see a rematch though 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juanmpachecoa Yes we do.... time to defend 💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thats__shack I’ve gone from "Crap, we’re gonna lose” to  "There’s 20seconds left with 0 timeouts....WE GOT THIS!” The dude is fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexLex 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth... Mahomes = Confidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bambi_Saav I was tired of hearing the other take from some of the national media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You and all of #ChiefsKingdom 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope.... thousands agree with you 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpence21 Lotta people thinking like me I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth 👇🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll never know since Garappolo choked 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JKolchak Maybe if it was catchable 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c5mover Ain’t that the truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lancemb1 😂  That’s hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ballz_is Nope. Just makes Chiefs fans clench their butt cheeks a little longer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudleyadamsiv @MattBishoff No joke. It was pretty tight but doable for an MVP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsJayAshleigh Gotta give your parents props... they spelled your name right 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsJayAshleigh Haha!! No kidding. He has to throw more than 8 times in a game and we see what happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Egotript 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsJayAshleigh Don’t get me started 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hanfster1 As a Chiefs fan, it’s the greatest Super Bowl ever.  I still think it was very entertaining without bias, especially the 2nd half. Many others with no stake in the game have said that to me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_winning Lots believe it. Can’t believe the National people don’t say it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMrDoggity For sure. I think Mahomes makes that throw work 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@surftorture No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reebmarktterb @artsmiller @volumeKC Absolutely.... he’d have to be Mahomes to drop it in there 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveJo93220734 I’m not even sure that one was on Mahomes... D  Will just didn’t see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bc744 I wouldn’t mind a rematch 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattBishoff I mean, he could have went all Patrick Mahomes and dropped it in there 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelherring No doubt. Especially the way they finished the game... still gut wrenching though, especially if they picked up a 3rd &amp; 10! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelherring How gut wrenching would it have been if we go to OT.... &amp; lose the coin flip?!?!  Glad we didn’t go there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alex_R_Scherer @LarueBell76<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYchiefsfan15 Man...if he’s done playing, I don’t think there’s a better answer 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who should bang the drum for the #Chiefs opening night of the 2020 NFL season?? 🤔  https://t.co/bGeEQ5Nxmz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankCaliendo It’s my birthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flipsidegetwatr 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha!! Might be to old to party like @tkelce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsimps913 Hahahaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_mxyplyzyk @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump If you wanna call patriots a cult you are the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Red looking like Sammy Watkins out here!   https://t.co/noDJZjV8CV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT’S MY BIRTHDAY !!  How old am I today??  🤔  https://t.co/VMTKi9w7tc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strandjoel1 😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheifsh8radrs happy birthday!! Mine’s in a few hours!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminDFoss Thanks 🤙🏽  I thought it was a pretty good comparison 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraNTooCold314 I was rolling 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked my daughter if she knew who this was. My daughter said,   "It’s John Elway” 😂  #EltonJohn #Oscar2020 #Oscars     https://t.co/wXLAd90D1X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdrh8 I can. Here’s my point being made here... Brady’s BEST 2 years are comparable to Mahomes 1st 2, with Pat even missing a few games in there too. I have no doubts Mahomes will have better years to come... and I can’t wait to watch them all 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here are stats that people should be using to compare Brady &amp; Mahomes.  (Howd I get wrapped up in this🤦🏽‍♂️) Mahomes (2018, 2019) and arguably Brady’s 2 best seasons(2007, 2010) Brady’s 2017 was great too  Brady has been great and Mahomes is fantastic  Not hard to admit either way🤷🏽‍♂️  https://t.co/pijm6Qq943<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope it works out!! Make the lady happy @MecoleHardman4 ...  she’s pretty too 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMichaelRey @Chiefs @mitchholthus @Demarcus I bet Robinson DOES run it in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerStyle4Life Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnybkc2 @Chiefs That’s cool, not a lot of people can say that!! I’m right there with you though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@41actionnews Colorado Springs, CO  https://t.co/lxn19nPbNU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChukD99 @Chiefs @mitchholthus @Demarcus Would have been pretty awesome to catch that pass and run it in with no time left! Can’t wait to defend the title!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FACT:  Harrison Butker @buttkicker7 has never missed a kick in a #SuperBowl 💯  😏  https://t.co/s60I7ENrIU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsScottish Nicely done 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TBfckn12 Stay shook homeboy  https://t.co/s4Cz4IHj7n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TBfckn12 Just a fact, you need to be the greatest AND have a contract in place for your own table<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chiefskingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TBfckn12 I don’t think you get your own table when you’re set to become an unrestricted free agent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellow815 I’m in I like them all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah Boiii!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinalFenwayFict @RepAdamSchiff Congratulations, you’ve received the dumbest tweet award for February 🏆  https://t.co/w3O1Egy7Vg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff How much was the Mueller investigation again, Adam?? How much did this impeachment sham cost tax payers, Adam??  Do something else with your limited time in Washington D.C. other than disparage YOUR president... you were elected for more than this 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs @mitchholthus Had @Demarcus too... just sayin 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fitting that Mahomes launches the ball on the final play to end it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes gotta give homeboy @LarueBell76 another shot!! The pass was short &amp; off, and he still got knocked out!! What do you say??            #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarueBell76  Gotta follow you big dog!! Glad you’re good. I’m on the campaign for you to get another shot at catching that ball from @PatrickMahomes 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsfanCHI @strandjoel1 @RealBirdLawyer He’s pretty "politically correct “ too.... I’m surprised he gave an answer. That means he really respects KC, really dislikes San Fran or both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer I missed that. That’s really cool though, tells you what he though the organization. He was in KC less time than San Fran too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone ever ask Alex Smith who he was rooting for in the #SuperBowl? 🤔   Or Elvis Grbac.... Or Steve Bono.... Or Steve DeBerg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"That’s the Tyreek factor”  @cheetah speed ✌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Acquitted.... I think that’s the word you’re looking for, Adam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for that first, sick Super Bowl Champions jacket for drop like.....               #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/DhfqntElOI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iiSaidSo Kinda like, "I’ll be ready in 5 minutes.”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelStrand6 If there’s a @Fathead made, I’m getting one!!  That’s a pretty iconic shot. I’m not sure if there’s a better one from the actual game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellow815 He was elite prior to #SuperBowlLIV, now he is the standard at which quarterback excellence is set<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the emotion!! ❤️💛❤️💛   https://t.co/Ew7hd8E1Yv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman Cat nipped him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would make a pretty sick @Fathead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KcWeedologists @iiSaidSo Nice subtle request. We’ll played 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iiSaidSo I got that same shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strandjoel1 I remember seeing that. Chiefs fans were QUICK to point that out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iiSaidSo Check out them red Chucks in the back 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strandjoel1 It does, refs saw it a little different 🤫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⚠️ PLEASE USE CHALLENGE FLAGS SPARINGLY ⚠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF Who?? Me?? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s your king of #ChiefsKingdom and the NFL ... crowned Super Bowl MVP and undefeated in his career vs Denver.  Now bow down and show your king some respect  https://t.co/40M6pbArSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kc_ranger NFL MVP  is an award that seems to go to the best player that year.  Jackson was great this year. Mahomes should get a few more... Reid, probably not 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kc_ranger This is the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pumpkin34214727 True. They did well given their QB situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RicknMo @Sidelinecreepin Unfortunately, I can’t see that happening until Belichick is out of the picture. That dude does more with less talent than any other coach I’ve ever seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember this great tackle by Anthony Hitchens helping the #Chiefs beat the #Patriots and lock up the all important tiebreaker?? 😛              #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/gn1Axgf3ss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sidelinecreepin ....Or lack of challenge flags 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FitzyGFY @NFL Probably still waiting for that challenge flag Belichick wasted too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How crazy will it be if the #Chiefs can pull off the 1st 3-peat in NFL history?! That would make 4 Super Bowl Championships... more than any other team in the AFC West too.  Well, we’re 1/3 of the way there 😎                 #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/kRgXyR4CaM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anonymo12869076 He don’t need an award to say he’s a great coach. 1 coach of the year award back in 2002 just seems crazy. Like @RealBirdLawyer said, he’s too consistent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer True, but with all the injuries and he still pulls off the #2 seed, I was hoping that would...poke his head out of the long grass a little.  You’re right about the consistency thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn’t Andy Reid ever get mentioned in the Coach of the year conversation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KC it was real. I love y’all.......  I’m talking about the parade if you’re wondering<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love these 2 ! ! Congratulations!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF Mangini just bothers me when he speaks 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffMiller_SPF That’s probably it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking the same thing. Maybe it’s lack of confidence/dislike of Andy Reid? 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tone006 @Alex_PorterEnt @_ericdavis_ @Chiefs Yes, TD no way to overturn that. Thank you homeboy!! I’ll be enjoying this for a while and the parade Wednesday is going to be phenomenal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NFL @PatrickMahomes @Chiefs Loving the shirt 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettLink12 @ltsCamo He also made the decision to cut the designed inside run outside and took it to the house. He converted 2 4th downs... he was good all game, but Patrick won the game....Not worth an argument, Chiefs are #SuperBowlLIV Champs 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnieLester16 @Taylor_Witt Much cooler.... 🤙🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taylor_Witt I’m just waiting for the 3-peat 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltsCamo This ended it. His 3rd &amp; goal TD took the lead too... he ran hard all game, had a huge chip block on Bosa then got a 1st down in the flat making people miss... he just had a great overall game. Getting 100 yards against the Niners D is not an easy task<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Housy_Boy01236 You don’t need to explain yourself to me, I really don’t care... the Chiefs are Super Bowl champs. I’ll send you a pic from the parade... just load it up on your X Box one night bro<|endoftext|>
