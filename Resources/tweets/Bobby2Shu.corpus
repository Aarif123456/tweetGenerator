<|startoftext|>I now live in darkness from what I used to see. No one leads me any more I am lost among the trees. @ChieftanMews @radiohead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice I feel like a knob stretching in the gym. I do them surreptitiously, then play the rowing machine like a drumkit at a gig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice I did that, the Gym is now my Nemesis, known only for making me ache after visiting, it is addictive though. do it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NIMMO_GAUNTLETT I live down here now.. but going to see some friends play at the Albert tonight. have to catch up another time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedrummerben it gets me going. Happyness is a warm goat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedrummerben oh, I meant AFTER the gig, before I like to hula-hoop, bench press midgets, and shoot goats with an mp5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judging by recent events, I think we should remember that we do have a voice as a collective force<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedrummerben no, a blowjob, some cake and a thai massage is what I put on the rider usually..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smoked haddock chowder from jamie's 30 min meals. Took me an hour to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice maybe I am being hopeful because I was somewhat disappointed with the quantity of tunes, but I do think there will be more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice does it not strike you that it feels like 2 quarters of a pie, with the last track titled 'seperator' hmmm..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice and besides, I suspect they have more up their sleevies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice you need to listen to it more...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedrummerben oops I retweeted instead of wishing you a happy birthday. Oh well, have a good one! I will figure this thing out someday..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NedReardon @Rumshebeen are currently "on Ice"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedReardon I have been thinking this for the last year or so. We need a breakthough live band that sells shiteloads. @Rumshebeen? ha ha, no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedReardon The PJ Harvey Album is great, freaked the shit out of me on the first track when she sings "Bobby" Thought I'd lost it....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedReardon I hope Josh Homme releases something this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedReardon maybe the strokes and foo fighters albums will be decent enough to promote live band music in the mainstream?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedReardon Start as you mean to go on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniejoice are they edible?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Following @DerrenBrown painting his father today is a real joy. He's a quick worker. Puts me to shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tate the process of creating is more important, as it leads to an out come not necessarily expected from planned ideas in most cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been giggling at a fart app. Itoot. Purile, but cheered me up no end.<|endoftext|>
