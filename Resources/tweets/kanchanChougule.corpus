<|startoftext|>I am a proud Mumbaikar who has seen a Hindu and musalman family living in harmony in a 100sq feet land. I have seen every Mumbaikar welcoming a south, north and an east Indian into his world warmly. NOT BY PROTESTING #KarnatakaBandh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is your diversity? Diversity doesn't come by just appreciating a folk dance and the various saree styles each state women wears. Diversity too comes by accepting your brothers and growing WITH THEM. You cannot grow WITHOUT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweeters are now outraged as to what Maharashtra has given to 'Kannadis'. Its a pitiful sight to know that you are unaware of the GOLDEN opportunities Mumbai gives you. If Mumbaikars decide to contract, there's a big blow. Give us a chance to protest too!🙂  #KarnatakaBandh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Belgaavi after being your part, how selfish you will grow to protest against your own Maratha brothers and sisters. Settle down! Protest for a cause👍 #KarnatakaBandh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kannada outfits are enraged by JUST the decision of MARATHA corporation setup? . . How are you as an Indian now expecting peace between our neighbours Pakistan and China when you cannot accept such small step to strengthen the diversity? #KarnatakaBandh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With the not-slowing-down crackers this diwali, all once-in-a-blue-moon patriots have rose from death . . Tell me, how do you survive the last stage cancer, after feeding it with all plastics, stress, smoke, trauma and whatnot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Din me kitne crore cigg jalte h, that's acceptable. Ek din ki diwali se pollution hota h? . . I request every egoistic Hindu to keep their ego aside and be considerable to our mother earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People:- Dude! you are a Tcser. Bade log bada swag. Iss diwali what's in your bag? Me:- Excluding my belongings I have a homemade chocolate that was distributed by another collegue to make herself and others feel content with the heaviness of bags their frnds enjoy this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect it's a universal decision to ban crackers this diwali. Rain God demands!  #rainydiwali #pollutionfreediwali<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give me one good reason how citizens today hold the greatest power by voting. A beggar needs bread . A common man needs a pack and the rich wants a factory. Building a factory does not always do justice. #NOTA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I grew up seeing #ArunJaitley as my mentor who unknowingly sharpened my oratory skills. Unlike any politician that I barely take interest in he had that charm. Apart from his governing tactics he didn't let the 'Neta' word get tainted. May ur soul #RIPArunJaitley<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@priyankagandhi Recently I have developed a liking for sardar jokes and Gandhi tweets. Keep us entertained. #PChidambaramflees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonamakapoor Also more than 'the struggles' of Bollywood industry to entertain people we are concerned for the well being of our individuals. Please be on point. We want you to get life. P.S- Not a lavish ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonamakapoor When lives are at stake on the borders of our country, we are least bothered of your 'good friends' count dear Sonam. You owe something to this nation as a celebrity. Be worthy of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This day will give our brothers and sisters of JnK the first feel of being a part of independent India although it should have been years back. We look forward that the Kashmiris not only live in heaven but like heaven in their mainland #Independentkashmir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy 73rd independence day to all. Still a long way to go, to get rid from the shackles of corruption, terrorism, insecurity racism and castism. #73rdIndependenceDay #Modistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents:- Do you know how many yrs of independence are we enjoying? What is the significance of our flag, its colours and the chakra?  90s parents:- Today is Sacred Games release date. Kid I am excited. Lets take a Netflix subscription pack #IndependenceDay2019 #SacredGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is sad to find that Sacred games posters are parading all over Mumbai city on the upcoming patriotic eve of Independence day. With the plague of JnK mess, terrorism n politics we need some flashback to its roots and not any Gaitonde's history. #beworthyfirst #independentindia<|endoftext|>
