<|startoftext|>Did @kayleighmcenany aka Barbie really say that #Trump didn’t get an orderly transition? Lol that’s pure lies cause #Trump thanked Obama during his inauguration for a peaceful transition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember @DonaldJTrumpJr also said the following “Why aren't they talking about deaths? The number's almost nothing because we've gotten control and we understand how it works. We have the therapeutics to be able to deal with this." #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Michell22301183 @nessaabarrett Lol Michelle I’m sorry but people need to respect others, she has a right to go out and have dinner like everyone else. She shouldn’t be forced to stay indoors because people can’t respect personal space<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching what’s happening and I hope everyone is staying safe. #LosAngelesProtest #LARiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the @GOP’s making with the help of their leader #Trump. #RacismInAmerica #riots2020 #protest2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously are the @NYPDChiefofDept running over protesters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night and be safe everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are these cops just trigger happy? Clearly cops don’t want reporters to expose their brutality against the protesters. #Louisvilleprotests #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your suppose to bring the country together not divide it. Why on earth would you tweet such ignorant comments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoJusticeNoPeace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #Minnesotastatepolice initially arrested the black reporter only proves #RacismInAmerica is still very much a thing. Then after been caught been a racist you arrest the rest of the crew who are white to cover up that ur a #racist. #cnnarrest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is been a racist a hiring requirement for @MnDPS_MSP? We aren’t stupid this reporter had his credentials on. There was no need for an arrest. Also why were white reporters not arrested? #RacismInAmerica #minneapolisriots #cnncrewarrested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are cops seriously trained to shoot first instead of trying to deescalate the situation. He was clearly following orders and he was scared. Seriously how many guns need to be pointed at one person. #RacismInAmerica   https://t.co/JUnqmvLxe0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RacismInAmerica is real and pervasive. We need to do better for future generations. #racism #EndTheHate #EndTheViolence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t be serious.. There’s no rush to judgement cause it’s clear as day. This officer used excessive force and which resulted in a mans death. #GeorgeFloyd #racism #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cops involved in the death should also be charged with murder. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I not surprised! Maybe if the president took #COVID19 serious from the start they would have had a better handle on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad news<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnselElgort what a genius way to raise money for charity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CoronaWillEndSoon is the dumbest hashtag right now. People &amp; governments continue to think that #coronavirus is not that serious. Numbers of confirmed cases continue to rise. Now is not the time to end #SocialDistancing #StayHome #selfquarantine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s safe to say the Chinese government lied. They recently revised the number of people who died which increased. #China hide this virus from the world &amp; it’s people. Evidence shows it started late November to early December 2019. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The @GOP continues to support a man who is unfit to hold the office of the president of the United States. The GOP needs to stop the #GenocideOfKurds. The Kurds helped with the fight against #ISIS &amp; now we have abandoned them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier Last time I checked Obama wasn’t inciting violence towards immigrants &amp; spreading hate with every tweet. Let’s be honest Trump is literally giving everyone a free pass to be racist &amp; commit hate crimes. Maybe just maybe that’s why trump is getting the blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill These undocumented workers are doing the jobs that Americans refuse to do because they think it’s beneath them &amp; the amount of physical work they have to put in. I wonder how many Mississippians will apply to fill these jobs?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman We love and support you stay strong and ignore this ignorant &amp; hateful person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s apparent that @senatemajldr refuses to do what the majority of Americans want which is better #GunControl laws. The fact that he refuses to do his job it’s time he’s  voted out of office next election. #GunReformNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America wake up and realize that in order to get real #GunReform in this country you need to vote the @GOP out of the government. They are controlled by the @NRA. The #NRABloodMoney lines every #Republicans pocket. #GunControl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Walmart you do realize millions of people around the world play these games &amp; they don’t kill people. How about you stop the selling of guns in all your stores would make more sense... No?? #GunControl #walmartwalkout #BanAssaultWeapons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @GOP will never support #GunReform because their master @NRA says so. #GunControlNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1lilvince I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pugable @1lilvince I disagree... it deals with bullying, assault and how if someone doesn’t have to the proper support/tools to deal wit it. Which could lead to very tragic events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WARNING: If you’re going to watch 13 Reason Why, I recommend to everyone to be mentally and emotionally prepared for the graphic scenes and topics especially the last episode... It’s intense..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never stay silent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@missycomm @NRA Maybe ones that actually work. Clearly the current laws in place don’t work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello to all the joes out there!!  #NationalJoeDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What shall we do today??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @NRA probably got #repealthesecondamendment trending. Great job using fear mongering. However let’s speak the truth. We aren’t infringing on anyone’s rights we just want #sensiblegunreform the currents laws in place aren’t working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The solution isn’t to repeal the second amendment. Instead we need to look at current laws and amend the ones that aren’t working. Some of the laws just don’t wrk anymore. No ones rights are above anyone else’s, we are equals. #SecondAmendment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love apple pie. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So happy summer is just around the corner. Can’t wait some good things happening this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then maybe there wouldn’t be so many abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are so worried about what’s taught in #sexEd class. Let’s stop been naive. If teens wanna have #sex they’re gonna find away with or without ur knowledge. It’s better to have them #educated and safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People upset about #abortions. We can lower the abortion rate if our kids were better educated. There should be free access to #birthcontrol and teach the young adults in high school about safe sex and how important protection is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BradMorris83 Reasonable gun control laws can be made that both sides find acceptable but unfortunately @NRA continues to stop that from happening and Americans are tried especially the youth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradMorris83 I don’t think it’s misdirected. They are tired of soft gun laws, they want politicians to do their jobs and think of American lives. They just want safer schools and certain guns (not all guns) to be banned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To anyone who try’s to take these students rights away to protest peacefully. You are on the wrong side of history.  #NationalWalkoutDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The things people say on social media amazes me! Do people not think before they post? Please get off social and stop spreading nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Claiming some of the students on tv after #ParklandShooting are actors is disgusting. How can people be so ignorant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We seriously listening to ourselves? They wants armed guards/teachers, metal detectors and checkpoints in schools. It’s not a prison it’s a place of learning. Why can’t we understand that.    #ParklandStudentsSpeak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasMHern You know what other institution has armed guards? That’s right a prison. We shouldn’t turn our schools into prisons. Teachers are educators not cops. We need better funding for mental health and better gun control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Students of #StonemanDouglas say “we are going to be the last mass shooting.” They demand better gun control and reform on existing laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to their stories is heart breaking. These kids demand that things change so that this kind of tragedy never happens again. #ParklandStudentsSpeak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoseResists214 Exactly.. Thoughts and prayers only go so far. It’s time congress take action. They can no longer just sit on their hands and do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who are so self absorbed. Think about others not just yourself.  #ThingsICantAccept<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This isn’t about political sides! It’s not about pro guns vs anti guns! It’s about protecting people. It’s about keeping weapons out of those who would use the weapons to harm others. #GunContolNow #GunReform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many more lives have to be cut short? How many more families need to be shattered? Before you commit to real change? We demand you take action now! #GunReform #GunContolNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were elected to do a job, one of which is to keep us safe. Time and time again you have failed to do your job. #GunReform #GunContolNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politicians we are tired of your thoughts and prayers. We are tired of in inaction and your unwillingness to make real changes to prevent future tragedies. #GunReform #GunContolNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Spain it’s a beautiful country.  #traveltheworld #travelphotography #traveller #tbphotos…  https://t.co/V75xpbHcue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to start taking #mentalhealth serious. To many times people slip through the cracks and don’t get the proper treatment. Then we find out some have done terrible things. #mentalillness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePaulButcher Happy Birthday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will we see real change..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a sad reality to know nothing will come out of the tragedy in #Florida. If 20 first graders couldn’t change the minds of politicians then this won’t. #GunControlNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m done. Today I’ve seen some really idiotic comments and I don’t have to energy to fight uneducated people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenRoseUltra @MarkDice Seriously please just stop and step away from the keyboard. Idiotic comments are not needed at this time. Look back at history and the past generations that took pics of bodies and posted them in newspapers and magazines.. congrats on been an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice Wow I’ve seen some idiotic comments before but yours top of the list. Please think before you say or do anything. This garbage is not needed at this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErikaMcdougall Are you serious? Didn’t anyone teach you to think before u speak or in this case think before you write.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad reality is thoughts and prayers can only get us so far. It’s time for real change and the time for political talk is over. #gunviolence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many more lives need to be cut short due to #gunviolence before we actually take it serious and demand real actions from our politicians?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one is trying to step on your #SecondAmendment right. We are just asking for better laws to be put in place and certain guns and clips/magazines to be banned from sale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other half of the solution to stop future mass shootings is better #guncontrol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s good to see people talk about better funding for #mentalhealth in hopes to stop future mass shootings. However it’s only half of a solution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People are quick to to judge the teaser video of #loganpaul but then are quick to forget about the bigger things happening around the world. Like genocide and famine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Undercover videos of animals been tortured and killed for their fur, that you so happily wear as a coat or hat. Where is the outcry? #loganpaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are been killed cuz of their sexual orientation, religion and yet where’s the outcry? I’ve seen a vid where a teen boy has a rope tied around his neck and then pushed off the roof of a building. Yet that’s still on the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women are been murdered around the world, they are been stoned to death, burned alive, executed by a gun or beheaded. Yet where’s the outcry? #loganpaul<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano Laws are meant to be changed if they no longer work in today’s society..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano Now we don’t need that because of the population, the armed forces and the local police.  We are living in different times....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano To come to their aid and he fact that villages were spread apart no one would be close enough to come to their aid....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano To army themselves for protection form invading forces like the British, French, Spanish and native Americans, cuz no one would be able....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3. How many more lives need to be cut short,how many innocent people must we lose,for the government to make a real change? #GunControlLaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. The current laws aren't working we aren't seening any real change. It's time we take a serious look at our laws... #GunControlLaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. We aren't trying to take your guns away, I support your 2nd amendment right however something has to change... #GunControlLaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRANKBISHOP2 @dpete85 @TheMarkPantano We aren't trying to take guns way,I support the 2nd amendment. But clearly the current laws aren't working &amp; need to be changed. #GunContol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRANKBISHOP2 @dpete85 @TheMarkPantano Nobody should be able to buy a high powered gun and the amount of bullets some of these clips hold is unbelievable. #GunContol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRANKBISHOP2 @dpete85 @TheMarkPantano Pete the kind of #GunContol we r asking for is a ban on certain clip sizes and guns...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m gonna be #naive go 2 bed &amp; believe that when I wake up there will be no more #violence or #hate.That we will be #civilized to each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBURRRRprint @imjustbetter93 @TheMarkPantano Ya no side is innocent.. hopefully one day change will come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbetter93 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano And no good comes out of it and we are back at square one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbetter93 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Always left vs right or liberals vs conservatives. When that happens a intellectual conversation becomes a yelling match...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s start a conversation and keep politics out of it. We can have different opinions but let’s be civilized. #Politics #diffopinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbetter93 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano To be completely honest we need to but politics aside and talk to eachother like human begins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbetter93 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Yes I agree not a total ban just a limit on clip sizes be sold and certain guns not be sold to the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbetter93 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Lmao please don't be ridiculous, be smart and have a serious conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano They can't grasp the point cuz they're living life wit blinders on. They don't wanna have a intellectual conversation and be civilized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hard to have intellectual conversation with someone who doesn't wanna listen to the other side. @BJCalvillo they like wearing blinders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatePatton20 @TheMarkPantano God bless you.. Have a wonderful night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatePatton20 @TheMarkPantano Lol I'm an ass.. taking responsibility after the fact won't bring the loved one back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatePatton20 @TheMarkPantano Ya and irresponsible gun owners who don't secure their guns. U hear it in the news how kids cud easily get hold of guns in the homes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatePatton20 @TheMarkPantano Well clearly they aren't tough enough if the rate is high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Foghorn @nate_coe21 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano The current solution isn't working that well and there's clearly lots of proof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Foghorn @nate_coe21 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Revise the punishments for breaking the laws.. it's not gonna always work there's no doubt in that. But we gotta try something different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Foghorn @nate_coe21 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Obviously they won't obey the law, but u can work on prevention and do all sorts of community work and such..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_nealon Happy Birthday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatePatton20 @TheMarkPantano There are no "tough gun laws". If there were certain guns would be banned from been sold &amp; a ban on certain clip sizes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattycathy317 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano No ones trying to infringe on 2nd amendment right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattycathy317 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Also tougher regulations. Better background checks.. certain clip size bans and certain bans on guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattycathy317 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Yes we do... Need more funding for mental Health services &amp; tougher border control to prevent illegal guns from coming into the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattycathy317 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano Control what kind of gun clips are sold and types of guns sold. Public doesn't need high power guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chattycathy317 @TheBURRRRprint @TheMarkPantano They're not asking to outlaw guns. Just tougher gun control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano When will it be enough... How many more lives have to be cut short before real action is taken?  #texasshooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano Please don’t make this political and blame the left side or the right side... To many lives have been lose due to gun violence....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarkPantano If there were tougher gun control laws maybe he wouldn’t have had access to that gun and no lives would have been loss......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sickens me too see all this evil in the world. My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to the victims &amp; their families in #Texas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Lol disadvantaged. U sir are the one that's funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Lol they never came to America legally from Europe only later when it was an established country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm done arguing with the uneducated bigots. #America &amp; most of the world was built on #immigration. People discovering new lands. #explores<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Without immigrants North America would be undiscovered and still covered with forests. Learn the history of America. #DACA #immigration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS No one is truly American. America was built by immigrants. Ur family immigrated from another country at one point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Lol hypocrite. Last time I checked this is a country for equal opportunity &amp; to be from oppression &amp; provide for ur family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Lol I never avoided the question. U can't put everyone under one umbrella doesn't wrk that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS No he needs to reform &amp; fix it.Can't deport everyone that's already living here.Most of the people are trying to live a better life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodStryker Lol isn't urs either.Founding fathers murdered Native Americans and raped Native American women.Natives lost cuz whites had better weapons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Troylatiolais2 @President1Trump @POTUS Lol the amount committing murders is far smaller then the ones actually making a legit life for themselves and their families.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuanMThompson I've study history and MLK. He doesn't want a police state but he also doesn't want rioting. He wants peaceful protesting.n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlemon watching the news unfold. Wondering what's taking the national guard so long and why there's still people out there. #Baltimore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmartBlackMan then maybe the protesters shudnt burn buildings like a pharmacy &amp; seniors home.Then the media will cover the peaceful protest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhs_xo however when u start burning buildings and burning cars then all respect for you is lost.. There's better ways 2 have ur voice heard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhs_xo I'm sure ur "smart" but not every cop is bad.. I know you'd like to believe that they're evil. There are good cops out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH @gunformer those are not good people. They are dumb asses who high jacked a peaceful protest.. Again wit ur b.s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH even the mayor and police chief who are both black used the term thug.. So please don't give me ur b.s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH I've heard white people been called thugs so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNIsSilent_ @arkanciscan yes that's not cool it's only fuelling the fire.. Racism isn't okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNIsSilent_ @arkanciscan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH @williamcson @ajplus for all u know there's white people joining in on the looting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH oh please. That's a joke..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyoko_solomon @WhatIzAnime trust we all want change for the better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLSFRESH @gunformer the thugs.  mr. Grey's family never called for riots looting and burning of buildings and vehicles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIzAnime @kyoko_solomon I agree peaceful protests all for it.. But once the rocks and bottles fly the message gets tainted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyoko_solomon try ferguson.. buildings were also destroyed and the national guard was also called during that riot..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyoko_solomon that's a lie there's been many violent protests.This shit ain't helping ur cause it's only hurting!God gave u brains use em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryHogan about time after buildings setting buildings on fire and cutting hose lines of the fire dept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNationalGuard stay safe well u bring order back to #Baltimore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorSRB I think it's time to call in the  national guard! It's time to get ur people under control! @BaltimorePolice @BarackObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obama and City of #Baltimore it's time to call in the national guard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the thugs have decided to set fire to cvs pharmacy in #Baltimore way to honour mr. Grey and his family #FreddieGray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyLeone19 I agree Freddie was miss treated and died because of a few idiots. not every cop was there. Show restraint on both sides<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointing to see what's going down in #Baltimore I pray for the locals who are in the thick of this BOTH SIDES need to show #RESTRAINT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunformer these people shouldn't be rioting epically when the family said no violence.. Respect the wishes of his family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyLeone19 so I'll tell the injured cops and the private business that they had this coming. There where respectful protesters until now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamcson @ajplus will doesn't matter who started this riot. The police have a right to protect themselves &amp; community from thugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyLeone19 the protests have no respect for private property and are now destroying cars. The mob doesn't deserve respect from cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyLeone19 they have to bring outside help cuz gangs are threatening to kill cops.. There's bottles and bricks been thrown at cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These punks that are throwing bricks and bottles at cops way to taint the message which is #JusticeForFreddieGray  #Baltimore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Respect the wishes of Freddie's family and have a peaceful protest in #Baltimore Freddie's family doesn't want violence #FreddieGray @CNN<|endoftext|>
