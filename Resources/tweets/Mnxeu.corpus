<|startoftext|>@DomiDemonic You’re absolutely right! I hope this is the case, it’ll be nice to try and see him become “human” again. He deserves it after all he’s been through, and it’s nice that it’s Sam that’s gonna be by his side to help. I’m sure that’s what Steve would’ve wanted too. 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomiDemonic Ooo you’re totally right! I didn’t think about it like that, perhaps that’s the case. It certainly will be interesting to see then. Poor Buck though, gotta re-learn how the world works. He’s never really had time to “settle in” before obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomiDemonic Exactly! It’s such a different dynamic from what he’s experienced before back when he used to take girls out and stuff. 😂 I feel like it might be somewhat intimidating, but at least Sam’s there by his side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so flipping adorable 🥺<|endoftext|>

Newsflash, you can be friends after a divorce/break-up. #Delena #NinaDobrev #IanSomerhalder #NikkiReed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overanalysing the fact that Ian has been viewing some delena fan pages?? Right? And?? TVD was a massive part of his career, he’s allowed to support fan edits and creators regardless of the content. He’s being kind. Nina and Ian have said on many occasions they’re friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because Nina posted a picture of her, Ian, and Paul together from a “delena fanpage” means absolutely nothing. She literally accidentally posted a picture from The Hillywood Show TVD parody thinking it was herself before. She could’ve seen the picture and just liked it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delena fans are really toxic asf. Overanalysing the fact that apparently Nikki Reed removed “wife” from her bio which means her and Ian Somerhalder are getting a divorce and he’s gonna get back with Nina Dobrev. Shut up and grow up. #Delena #IanSomerhalder #NikkiReed #NinaDobrev<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Re-watching Glee. Season 4, Episode 4. Miss you guys. ❤  #NayaRivera #CoryMonteith #Glee  https://t.co/7q8kkZgvSN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for all the hard work @discord! Things are slowly coming back and working again. 🥰 #discorddown  https://t.co/sSbV7MuO1g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was wondering why my discord wasn't loading after looking away for two minutes. Tried their status checker website, that was also down. Come to twitter and see #discorddown. Glad I'm not the only one having the issue. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsAartByHeart You're absolutely right 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cevansbowtie HELL TO DA YES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDuckCow Hey! Sorry for a late response, I've been messing around with the Blender plug-in and having a bunch of fun with it all, haha. But, thought I'd share the edited version of the white horse skin incase you needed it. Thanks for all the help! 😊  https://t.co/5lRvYtaxUg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and it was on that day chris was ready to kill someone 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok listen the hell up. I get that y’all are mad at Sebastian Stan... but, leaking his address? That’s too far. Grow the hell up. #SebastianStan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS MAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDuckCow Haha, I've just noticed this too. I opened up both textures in photoshop to see what was going wrong. I was indeed using a texture from 1.16 which is why it went all strange. Thanks for letting me know though! I'll see about editing it. What version is the original texture from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDuckCow That's fine! Thanks for the quick tweets back, much appriciated. I'll see if any older versions of the skin work &amp; if not I'll look into editing the original skin. Thanks again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the MUSCLES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDuckCow Hey, thanks for the reply! I've just tried this method and this is what happens... 🤔  https://t.co/7OWNJTruQi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @TheDuckCow! I'm pretty new to the McPrep add-on for Blender and I was wondering if there's a way to change mob skins? I'm trying to get a white horse but when I spawn in the mob it's the brown horse by default. I've tried changing it, but the texture breaks. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fnerjnghyjn so CUTE 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwww Dodge!! 🥺🥰❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who's been a fan of Sebastian Stan for years and watched all his movies... to see him defending his girlfriend at a time like this is deeply saddening. As well as him breaking social distancing rules when he's enforced them in the past. #sebastianstanisoverparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 really is just a big ball of never ending crap ain't it? jeez man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh lawd  https://t.co/iKJtJNtIrI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just read something that said “Bucky’s relationship with Steve might be the only thing stopping him from killing him self.” And there’s a rumour that they’re killing him in TFATWS at end of Season 2 by Zemo. I WILL RIOT!! #FalconandtheWinterSoldier #BuckyBarnes #WinterSoldier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insert that’s hot meme<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m so happy they’re happy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🙏🏻❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaframos Yeah I just heard after tweeting this which is unfortunate. I really hope she's alright. They've already wasted too much time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her son deserves to have his mother by his side. She deserves to see her son grow old and live out his life. The fact that media have been bringing up old news about her is beyond me. If you're in the area and can help the search; please do in any way you can. #NayaRivera<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sincerely hope Naya Rivera is found safe &amp; well. It's absolutely insane that they waited so long to continue the search for her. The first 24hrs in a missing persons case are CRITICAL. Even more so if it's in open waters. She is a human being, treat her like one. #NayaRivera<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small thread on how The Vampire Diaries should've ended (In my opinion). More so just random thoughts tbh. 🥴 #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries  https://t.co/3e2DqcbZjG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Klaus &amp; Caroline staying vampires for a while, maybe eventually taking the cure after a few centuries along with Elijah &amp; Hayley and then starting their human lives together.  Random ideas &amp; thoughts, I probably have a few more but that's all I can think of rn. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Enzo taking the cure to be human with Bonnie even though he'd want their relationship to last forever. • The humans living out their lives. Dying when they're old after getting married, having children, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Human Elena with Human Damon. • Human Stefan finding another epic love because he deserves it. • Lexi alive &amp; still visiting Stefan. • Caroline with Klaus. • Bonnie with Enzo. • Penny alive and with Matt. • Alaric finding a girlfriend/wife that doesn't get killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How The Vampire Diaries should've ended (IMO); #TVD #TheVampireDiaries #VampireDiaries  • Enzo alive, living the life he deserves with Bonnie. • Stefan &amp; Damon BOTH alive. • Tyler alive until finale, he sacrifices himself to kill Katherine (I think he'd want to step up).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heycapsicle Yessssssss loss of a teardrop diamonddd!! 🥵🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell?? This is not the kinda news I thought I’d be waking up to. I really hope she’s okay. 🙏🏻 #NayaRivera #Glee  https://t.co/CTM0RzZhXk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one of the main reasons as to why I stopped going to therapy after like 3 sessions. I realized just how expensive it is and couldn't afford it at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BethSlaterr @EmmzzLF They’re not in a relationship. They’re merely friends who’re both in London because they’re filming a movie together (I’m pretty sure).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to clarify, they’re friends. I’m pretty sure they’re both in London because they’re filming a project together! 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Two years ago today I watched Infinity War for the first time in a cinema with my brother. Cried my eyes out, &amp; my life was changed forever. Thankyou for everything Marvel. Can't wait to share these films and this experience with my kids in the future. #Marvel #InfinityWar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>god damnnnn 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JusticeForAhmaud #AhmaudArbery #JusticeForAhmaudArbery   This is absolutely disgusting and beyond heartbreaking to see what happened. Give this man justice, give his family justice. The men that did this to him are scum on earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute FACTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sebastian Stan has a Spotify playlist named "Steve..." with the songs; 'Just the way u are', 'No more I love yous', 'love on a real train', 'i think we're alone now', &amp; 'this guys in love with u'. YA'LL- #SebastianStan #ChrisEvans #Stucky #BuckyBarnes #WinterSoldier #Evansstan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, the fact that Sebastian Stan has a whole spotify playlist called "Steve..." and also several playlists after many of the characters he's played. MY HEART!!  #SebastianStan #Spotify #WinterSoldier #BuckyBarnes #Stucky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instagram user ImSebastianStan has great music taste and his Spotify proves it. I love listening to his playlists when I need to relax and stuff, literally such good taste.

<|startoftext|>Don't get me wrong, Karen Gillan would do great and I love her to bits. But, Johnny Depp is what made Pirates of the Carribean as great as it was. He deserves to have his role back. He IS Captain Jack Sparrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pls don't think that Bucky isn't important or that you're not important in the Marvel Universe, because you 100% are. I hope you're doing okay, and I wish we could all hug you and tell you it's okay and that you're loved. Pls stay safe, we miss you. 🥺 #SebastianStan #BuckyBarnes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insta user ImSebastianStan. You are loved. You are important. You are amazing. Bucky Barnes is loved, and he is so incredibly important to the Marvel Universe.

<|startoftext|>Just joined in on #clapforourcarers/#clapforNHS, was so amazing to hear the entire estate erupt with clapping noises. Well done everyone, that warmed my heart to hear. ❤️👏🏻 #Coronavirus #Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discordapp To keep in contact with friends and other awesome people from around the world during this difficult and nerve-wracking time. Being in lockdown/self-isolation can be lonesome and boring, but Discord is certainly helping me beat that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also can we talk about the description for "Endings, Beginnings", because I absolutely love it. 😂I wish I could relate, because god damn. Sebastian Stan, Jamie Dornan and Shailene Woodley in one film... 😍 #EndingsBeginnings #SebastianStan #JamieDornan #ShaileneWoodley  https://t.co/Fu2qdMlyJU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I genuinely can't wait to see this film, it looks like it's gonna be so good, and the soundtrack for it is so great. Listen to the SONG FROM THE TRAILER IT'S SO GOOOOOD. #EndingsBeginnings #SebastianStan #JamieDornan #ShaileneWoodley  https://t.co/mKKC3gBF11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If ya'll are like me and watched the #EndingsBeginnings trailer with #SebastianStan, #JamieDornan, and #ShaileneWoodley and immediately became addicted to that one song near the end. I'm here to tell you, it's called "Mecca" and is by Wild Beasts. IT'S SO GOOD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ITS CHRIS AS A DAD HELP 🥺 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I literally just realized that one of my tweets is on George Takei's website about Chris Pratt getting engaged to Katherine. 😂 Odd discovery to say the least, but yay because it was in support of their engagement! #ChrisPratt #KatherineSchwarzenegger #GeorgeTakei<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 🥺 Evans brothers strikes again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris helped Scott with shaving his head, my heart! 🥺 I’m so glad they’re all able to be together at their family home, hope all the Evans family are doing well. ❤️ #ScottEvans #ChrisEvans  https://t.co/NbZfwtfYCu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could sit here and tag a bunch of amazing creators on YouTube who actually educate people about DID, but then this thread would be huge. But considering DissociaDID was dragged into this, please support her and her system at this difficult time. She is a lovely person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering this tweet blew up for some reason, please go and support creators with DID, who're constantly having to fight against the stigma created because of people like Trisha. For starters, you should go check out DissociaDID (@DissociaDID), who educates people on DID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh my GODDDDD 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New picture of Chris Evans in defending Jacob! Look at him!! 👏🏻🥺 I’m so proud. 😍❤️ Can’t wait you see him in this. #ChrisEvans #DefendingJacob  https://t.co/wXqBP1WScB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlieggseeggs You're seriously still supporting her after this? Also, we have never denied she has mental issues, infact we've been encouraging her to get help from a mental health professional because she needs it. But that's not an excuse for her horrid and offensive actions. Check yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSS SCOTT!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Send this guy, and everyone else effected some love. My heart goes out to all the families, friends, and everyone in between who're suffering from this, or who know someone who's suffering from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No waaaaaaaaaay! This is INCREDIBLE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can y’all stop ignoring global health advice and start social distancing yourself, washing your hands, and NOT panic buying? You think this’d be common sense, but here we are... #Coronavirus #Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CHRIS EVANS! Hell yes. Finally one of these things does me justice. I can chill with him and Dodger 😍  If only I could be born in 2 months so I’d get Sebastian Stan too. 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're still a fan of #TrishaPaytas after this absolute bullshit she keeps pulling about having DID, get the fuck off my timeline. She's done absolute fucked up things in the past, but this has just pushed it beyond the line of messed up. So disgustingly offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same honestly because damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TO ME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pmsl 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Twitter "Sebastian Stan"  Honestly, I'd do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who has difficulty with hearing and having ADHD, subtitles help A LOT. More than people realise, I know a lot of people find them annoying, but I need them to know what's going on and to see dialogue I can't hear properly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wouldn't blame him if he went for the food, but at the same time I don't blame him for looking annoyed because didn't someone make a racist/sexist comment during it or something and he was like so done?

<|startoftext|>YouTube is made up of creators, so ask your CREATORS what they want. And your audience. Rewind was awesome back in like 2012, and ever since it just went down-hill. This years just seemed so half-assed. #YouTubeRewind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An #Earthquake in UK? Uh oh. 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's kinda sad that #YouTube thinks that this years #YouTubeRewind is an improvement from last years, when in reality it's just a bunch of other peoples videos smashed together like some "Top 10" video. That's not a rewind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@antanddec &amp; Also don't fully know the history behind it all, so again, it's a possibility, but not sure if it's actually true. If not it's just a creepy coincidence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you haven't yet already please go and watch #PaulRudd's "Living With Yourself" on Netflix. It's an absolute rollercoaster of emotions but was so wonderfully good.

I'm so glad Louis got a happy ending, I'm so glad Harvey's going to work with Mike. I'm just glad about EVERYTHING. #SuitsUSA #Suits #SuitsFinale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might try watching the final ever episode of #SuitsUSA live if I can find a decent stream of it. But that's like 12am for me. Ugh, I'm not ready. I'm gonna need tissues.💔If not I might be avoiding social media because of spoilers until I've watched it. #Suits #SuitsFinale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSS CHRISSS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably going to be avoiding social media tonight seeing as #SuitsUSA airs earlier in USA than it does in UK. Don’t want spoilers!! 😩 #Suits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 more days until the final ever episode of #SuitsUSA. I can't. I don't want to. Go back, please. I don't want this to be over. 😫 #Suits #SuitsFinale<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need all the sweet Mike and Harvey moments in the final episode. We need #Darvey moments. I WISH with all my heart that Rachel could come back. I HOPE Jessica comes back. I just want this to be perfect. This has been a huge part of my life. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Marvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That final episode better be like a 2hr special and we better get EVERYTHING WE WANT. I don't want this to end. I can't believe it's THIS CLOSE. What the hecccck NOOOO. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT. IS EPISODE 10 THE LAST EVER EPISODE? NO WAY. NO WAYYYY. I SWEAAAAAAAR. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is exactly what I wanted. Mike to be there for Harvey at one of the hardest times of his life. Thankyou for this #Suits. They needed this, we needed this. Well, until the end... #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THERE'S NO WAY FAYE JUST FIRED KATRINA. NO. C'MON MAN. Harvey better kick some flippin' ass. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessss, Donna getting the iconic Harvey and Mike to hang out together again like the brothers they are. I need this. They need this. We need more Mike and Harvey content. #Marvey #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HARVEY'S GOT A RING FROM HIS MOM. I REPEAT, A RING FROM HIS MOM. USE IT HARVEY. USE ITTTTTTTT. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like Samantha and Robert's friendship. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwh, Harvey and Louis making references and having a heart to heart and Harvey saying he's the best lawyer and an even better friend. Oh my god. I really love this friendship. They work best when they're not at each other's throats. 😂 #SuitsUSA #Suits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harvey saying to Faye "If you come after someone I love" and referencing to Louis, and Louis looks up in suprise is the NICEST MOMENT EVER. I'm really liking the friendship they've formed between one another. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoooooo, Donna threatening Faye is badass. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watchin the new ep of #Suits and I kept saying "Where's Mike?" during the funeral and wondering where he is, BUT THEN HE SHOWED UP AT THE BACK AND HARVEY SAW HIM AND THEY SHARED A MOMENT. OH MY GOD. I'm so glad they brought Mike back. Regardless of the situation. #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#CivilWar's #BlackPanther stunt man said that #SebastianStan actually did that motorbike stunt where he swings the bike around and sits on it. OFC, it's on wires.

<|startoftext|>WHAT THEY JUST KILLED OFF HARVEY'S MOTHER LIKE THAT? WHAT?! There's legit no need for this. WTF? I'm so confused. Gabriel's acting though. That hit me in the feels.  I hope Mike comes back to comfort him during this. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Marvey #HarveySpecter #MikeRoss #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I want to get married before the baby." "Are you sure? I look like a house." "I don't care what you look like, I want us to be a family."  LOUIS THAT WAS SO CUTE. AWWWH. I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.  #Suits #SuitsUSA #LouisLitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad they're giving Louis some happy nice moments. Especially with his sister. That was really sweet that he helped her, and I love the friendship he has with Katrina. #Suits #SuitsUSA #LouisLitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Harvey &amp; Sean work together and aren't constantly against each other they can actually kick ass. #Suits #SuitsUSA #HarveySpecter #SeanCahill<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can we talk about how Mackie grabs Chris' chair so smoothly? Like, he grabs it legit just straight away. Like he KNOWS Chris is about to fall before Chris even begins falling. I love this so much. It's hilarious. 😂 I love them. Evans, Mackie, and Sebastian are the iconic trio.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DonnaPaulsen got #HarveySpecter the ORIGINAL painting and then they joked and got all cute and then said I love you and Harvey got emotional and called Donna perfect. MY HEART. THIS IS SO SWEET. OFEJRHNKFEKWMD THIS IS TOO SWEET. #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also really like that they gave Louis a happy moment in the latest episode too. Despite him pretending to be Harvey it all turned out to be okay and just an adorable thing for him. I'm glad. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, this whole Harvey helping Sam through her meeting her biological father and stuff is absolutely one of the cutest storylines that #SuitsUSA has done. The laughs, the advice, everything. This is such a sweet friendship. I love this. I love Harvey. #Suits #HarveySpecter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THE LITTLE PROUD SMILE #HARVEYSPECTER GAVE SAM WHEN SHE WALKED UP TO HER BIO PARENTS HOUSE AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR WHILST HARVEY WAS WAITING IN THE CAR FOR HER IS THE CUTEST THING JENRFEKRJNF #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harvey telling Samantha "I'll be right here." and waiting in the car for her whilst she meets her bio parents Is the CUTEST thing. Such a simple sentence and gesture and yet it's so adorable. He's so different and just happier now. Ugh. I love this. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the latest episode of #SuitsUSA and I LOVE all these happy moments Harvey and Samantha are having together on the road trip. (Until it messes up). Like, them messing with Louis but Harvey actually being nice about it. Also #Darvey said I love you. This is cute. ❤ #Suits<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bruh I love Sebastian’s short hair. 😍🤤 Also, the fact that they both miss Evans... 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Christ they’re hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not gonna understand and I just ifhghfhueuajwjjw ugh. I fûcking hate this. I’m rambling and venting, I don’t even know where Im going anymore. I just needed to get this out somewhere. I can’t avoid tomorrow either way. It’s too late to cancel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fûcking hate this. I hate my anxiety. It’s so mentally draining and exhausting. I know once I’m in there and have seen her teach me a few times I’ll be okay-ish, but everything before that just freaks me out. But even then when she’s shown me a few times I still feel like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I’m gonna screw everything up because I’m gonna be tired. I’m hard of hearing, so I’m scared I might not hear a customer properly, I’m literally worrying about every damn thing and I hate it. I wish I could get rid of my anxiety and how bad it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The register does all that for you. Or so I’ve heard. But I’m still freaking out. My mums dropping me off because she knows the woman that runs it and is going to introduce us, but from there on it’s just me alone for 6hrs with her. 10am to 4pm. Lunch at 12pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im legit freaking out and now it’s gonna be ruined because I’ve got barely any sleep. It’s too late to cancel, although I don’t wanna cancel because it’s for a really good cause and I want to do this. I’m just overthinking as usual. I’m TERRIBLE at maths, although<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no idea how a cash register works, but she’s a good family friend of my mothers and understands I’m anxious and she said she’ll stay by my side the entire day if she has to. I have no idea how to work a card machine, I have no idea what I’m gonna talk to her about for 6hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds dumb, but newsflash I have severe anxiety and I overthink. I can’t hold a conversation, I’m meeting a woman I’ve never met before in my life to stay in a small room with her for 6 hours. I’m scared I’m gonna screw up, badly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so it’s almost 5am and I’m supposed to be waking up at 8am to set off around 10am for a volunteering job and my anxiety is SKY HIGH. I’ve never worked behind a cash register before? I’ve no idea how that stuff works. I’m literally feeling sick with anxiety and panicking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You know what? That #AvengersEndgame deleted scene where they all take a knee during Tony's final moments. Steve didn't take a knee, he basically collapsed onto his knee out of heart-break. My poor heart. 💔 #Endgame #SteveRogers #TonyStark #CaptainAmerica #IronMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They better figure something out or fix this. Spider-Man can’t leave the MCU. He belongs in the MCU. He’s great and the movies are great. Don’t do this. #marvel #marvelstudios #sony #mcu #marvelcinematicuniverse #spiderman  #disney #marveluniverse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spider-Man is leaving the MCU..? Excuse me, WHAT?! Come again? Let’s rethink that, thanks. #Spiderman #MarvelStudios #Marvel #Disney #MCU #MarvelCinematicUniverse #MarvelUniverse #Sony<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also, can I just say Mike &amp; Louis hugging and Mike giving Louis the "You just got Litt up" baby grow because Rachel saved it. Oh my god, that was so wholesome. I miss them ALL. They need to stop this fighting. sjnfkernf #Suits #SuitsUSA #MikeRoss #RachelZane #LouisLitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, this might be where I saw that spoiler coming in soon. Oh god, it's going to get HEATED/SPICY SOON if it's true. 😬 But, it'll be really awesome to see how it all goes down and how things get solved and that. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Marvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I don't care about her, I care about you!" Mike saying that 2 Harvey omg. CAN MIKE AND HARVEY PLS STOP FIGHTING. I HATE THIS. THEY'RE BROTHERS. GOD DAMMIT. Also Sam calling Mike Harvey's adopted son. #Suits #SuitsUSA #HarveySpecter #MikeRoss #Marvey #GabrielMacht #PatrickJAdams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Benjamin is finally getting the recognition he deserves!!! I wish we saw more of him in honesty, he's really great. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AWWWH. Mike &amp; Katrina's reaction was so adorable. The hug, the shieeeet. THE MEMORIES! Gah, I love all these wholesome friendships and throwbacks. #Suits #SuitsUSA #MikeRoss #KatrinaBennett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing #MikeRoss in his and #RachelZane's old apartment is so strange yet so cool to see. I miss the whole cast together like it used to be but this is still awesome at the same time. BUT WHY IS EVERYONE AT EACH OTHERS THROATS. BE FRIENDSSSS. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bunch of hunks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love how they're all like "Don't underestimate Mike Ross" because true. He's hecking good. 😂 #Suits #SuitsUSA #PatrickJAdams #MikeRoss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE this old time banter between #MikeRoss &amp; #HarveySpecter. Both of them talking about #Darvey, both of them mentioning the briefcase moment that Harvey won't let go. Just everything. I've missed THIS BROTHERHOOOOD! #Marvey #Suits #SuitsUSA #GabrielMacht #PatrickJAdams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched the new #SuitsUSA episode where Harvey &amp; Mike reunite for the first time and I literally squealed upon seeing Mike. That was SO CUTE. I miss them together! Glad Mike is back. Missed this duo!!! I need more! ❤❤❤ #Suits #Marvey #MikeRoss #HarveySpecter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There’s so many and even more. 🥵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BUT, I love you. We all love you, so much it's un-real. Have a fantastically awesome amazing day because you really freakin' deserve it. I love you. Happy Birthday! #HappyBirthdaySebastianStan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you have a fantastic birthday. You of all people deserve it 100%. You're always there for everyone when you can be, you're honest, you're real, you're the cutest bean ever. You're so kind-hearted, funny, and everything else good. Like I said, I could go on for days. +<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday to the one and only #SebastianStan. Man, I can't put into words how much you mean to me and how much you've done for every single one of us. You're real, you're genuine, you're just... so lovely. I could go on for days saying how wonderful you are. +<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theamericasass YOU'RE WELCOMEEEE  https://t.co/65igCze4sR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>dang what a hottie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love this cutie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was never invested in #LiamHemsworth &amp; #MileyCyrus’ marriage. I just thought they were actually cute together. It’s sad to hear them split up. Even sadder that people have been pressuring Liam to speak out since Miley was ‘caught’ kissing a girl. He’s hurting. Leave him be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>leave. 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS IS SO CUTE AND WHOLESOME KERJNFKJERN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, some days I just sit down and do my thing whilst listening to one of #SebastianStan's spotify playlists and honestly it's the most relaxing thing ever. He has such a good taste in music it's un-real. Gawwd. #Spotify<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PREACH IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH MY GOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AAAA CUTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @chrishemsworth, hope you have a great day however you decide to spend it. 😊🎉 #HappyBirthdayChrisHemsworth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"No matter what I do, I keep ending up in between Black Widow's legs." - Sebastian Stan talking about Bucky/Winter Soldier.  OK BUT LOOOOL IT'S TRUE. 😂😂😂😂  #SebastianStan #ScarlettJohansson #BlackWidow #BuckyBarnes #NatashaRomanoff #WinterSoldier #Marvel #BuckyNat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daryastarkjr Honestly, mood though... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daryastarkjr ME TOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donna: "So does that mean we're engaged now?" Harvey: "I- Uh... I-" Donna: "Who's stuttering now?"  THAT WAS SO CUUUUUUUUUUUUTE. Mike Ross is gona be hella happy his ship is sailing. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey #DonnaPaulsen #HarveySpecter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THAT SCENE WITH HARVEY AND DONNA IN 9X4 WAS THE CUTEST THING EVER. HARVEY MAKING HER STUMBLE HER WORDS AND THEN SHE DID THE SAME TO HARVEY AND THEN HARVEY INTRODUCED HER TO HIS MOM. THEY'RE SO SOFT. I LOVE THEM. 🥺 THAT WHOLE END SCENE WAS SO CUTE. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Her name is Donna. I haven't told her yet, but she's the one." - Harvey Specter.  When I say I squealed, I squealed. AAAAAAAAAH. FINALLLYYYYYYY.  #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey #HarveySpecter #DonnaPaulsen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I don't know, never say never. I think that I've definitely thought about marriage. I'd like to have kids one day.. not a prority necessarily right now, but at some point. I feel that spending the rest of your life with someone married or not is a priority." - #SebastianStan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a human of any gender, any race, anything... and are feeling insecure, need to cry, need to yell, or scream. That's perfectly VALID. Please do not feel ashamed. Emotions are normal, emotions are healthy. Someone will listen to you when you need it the most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so so so proud of him for gaining the confidence to do something like this. It takes a lot, and it can be so nerve wrecking. Gosh, I literally teared up when I first read this. I'm so proud of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how about you come off your anonymity and say it to the world, because boy oh boy will you have hell rained down on you. Not just from 'Sebastian fans', but from everyone who has their head screwed on properly. People with this attitude are toxic and disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the fact that this is about Sebastian just angers me even more. A man who's been fighting with insecurity for years and is a fairly anxious person, someone who finally builds up the courage to post a picture of their body and then this happens. You're actually disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any man who has emotions has a right to express them just the same as any other human being. They have a right to cry and feel insecure and when they tell someone about it they should be LISTENED TO. Not insulted, not mocked, not told to 'man up'. Those feelings are VALID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why men are afraid to speak up, they just get told to 'man up', and it's disgusting and yet you see all these people posting about guys like "I wish men showed emotions". They can't, because you don't fucking let them without shooting them down. It's disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caniffixated @lillseb leave. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, it's confirmed that when #SteveRogers gave his shield to #SamWilson, Sam looked over to #BuckyBarnes for his approval. He looked over to Bucky, and Buck nodded in approval to let him know it was okay to take the shield. MY HEART-  #AvengersEndgame #CaptainAmerica #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve: "After I put the stones back, I thought... maybe I'll try some of that life Tony's always telling me to get."  Sam: "How'd that work out for you?"  Steve: "It was beautiful."  #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #Endgame #AvengersEndgame #Marvel #TonyStark #IronMan #SamWilson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so proud of Sebastian for building his confidence back up to post something like this. Self-confidence is such a hard thing to battle and overcome. I’m so proud of him! ❤️ #SebastianStan  https://t.co/GfmsvofXGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>stop kskskkskssksk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How dare you even attempt to make us choose from these iconic looks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ the endgame writers confirming that Steve Rogers is the father of Peggy’s kids. KAKAKSNSHBWVE baby Captain America’s!!! Aaaah! #SteveRogers  #CaptainAmerica  #PeggyCarter #Steggy #AvengersEndgame  #Endgame  #Marvel #MarvelStudios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SebastianStan straight up went to #JakeGyllenhaal’s play and then #TomHiddleston was also there and they both watched the entire thing. LEGENDS SUPPORTING LEGENDS. I love them. 🥺😍❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ITS OK GUYS TOM ACCOMPANIED HIM 🥺🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90sretroboi no thank u 😤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desiredlx People are mad about his Red Sea Diving Resort character and the story of the film and the fact that he still took the role. It's understandable as it's contraversal and whatnot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nataliascap 22nd of Feb. ♓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Filming Avengers: Endgame #2  https://t.co/Rn8oEbEfgu It's so cool to see all this. They're so badass. #Avengers #TheAvengers #Endgame #AvengersEndgame #Marvel #MarvelStudios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SKSKSKSSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKKSKSKS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJGriffith1509 Him taking the role was the mistake is what everyone's saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love how sebs being genuine and anthonys just like FALCON FALCON FALCON FALCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shawnobrjen I read this too quick and thought it said "I'm pregnant which means I'm getting another sibling" and I was like WAIT WHAT LMFAOOOOO. But, in all seriousness, Congrats to your mom!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Professor_BEE Agreed. 😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Professor_BEE Agreed, I hope he doesn't see the worst of the worst to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ouch this hurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Professor_BEE Yeah, whether or not Chris decides to speak out about this we'll have to find out I suppose. But right now I don't blame him if he's just taking a semi-break from twitter. The amount of disgusting stuff I've read about him from people would make me wanna do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if you're one of those people who's sending hate towards #ChrisEvans &amp; his family, cancelling/unstanning him, doing this 'ChrisEvansIsOverParty', sending toxic and horrid slander his way because of ONE mistake. Gladly unfollow me too and send me ur @ so I can do the same. Ty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If ya'll are really gonna unstan/unfollow/cancel/send disgusting toxic stuff his way because he took on one bad/controversial role then ya'll better start un-stanning half of Hollywood actors because most of them have had that one "bad/controversial" role in their career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Professor_BEE Absolutely agreed! People can dislike the film all they want and what it stands for, but that gives them no right to treat Chris the way they are. It’s honestly horrid. He took a bad role, most actors have. He’ll learn from his mistakes just like anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>slslsmsksmksmsnwbbabrg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relatable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Professor_BEE He in no way deserves the amount of hate he’s getting from people or any hate for that matter. He’s made a mistake and he can learn from that. We’ve all been in his shoes. No-ones a perfect saint. Plus, attacking his parents is one step too far. That’s disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evrythingevans Honestly it’s horrible some of the stuff I’ve read already. 🙄 Guess some people don’t understand that people can make mistakes and learn from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evrythingevans ❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s still a fucking human and has emotions and feelings. If you’re apart of this “cancelling culture” and are saying all this disgusting crap about Chris Evans, you’re just as bad. Move the fuck on instead if you’re really gonna unstan him after one mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t tell you what to do, but this whole “cancelling culture” is toxic asf and needs to be stopped immediately. Instead of making some big unnecessary fuss about it and cancelling him, just move tf on. There’s no need for the amount of toxic stuff I’ve read already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No-one is perfect. So, unstanning him and being toxic asf towards him saying all this disgusting shit isn’t it sis. It’s disgusting. You wanna stop being a fan of him because of one mistake? Fine, you do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because someone’s in the wrong doesn’t change their character entirely. He took a bad role, he didn’t murder someone. He made a mistake, and yes, we/you can hold him accountable for it. Everyone makes mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You 👏🏻 can 👏🏻 still 👏🏻 be 👏🏻 a 👏🏻 fan 👏🏻 of 👏🏻 Chris 👏🏻 Evans 👏🏻 and 👏🏻 point 👏🏻 out 👏🏻 when 👏🏻 he 👏🏻 is 👏🏻 in 👏🏻 the 👏🏻 wrong.  BUT, this whole “Chris Evans is over party” is toxic asf. Stop. #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshbrolin @cptsteverogerss I’m so confused what is happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of endgames best decisions was putting Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes in leather jackets. 😍🥰🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God dam. 😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pey_pey1234567 😍🥺😍🥺😍🥺😍🥺😍🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misssophiachase @stefanswarner Pahahhah yes!!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominantCub72 Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misssophiachase @stefanswarner That really would be a fun table, but I also feel like there'd be a lot of arguing going on there. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm ngl when I first saw this for a split second I thought it was pre-serum Steve but then was immediately like "WAIT NO. He didn't come back, so it's gotta be old Steve right?" and I was already crying at this point but oh boy did more tears come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE HOW HE JUST FREAKS OUT AND EVERYONE ELSE IS JUST CHEERING AND SCOTT'S JUST STOOD THERE LAUGHING FKJERNFKJERNFKN LOOOL Awwh and then everyone high fives and Scott and Chris hug that's cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaiwood93 Torrrrrrrrchwooood. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anjuli42 That's totally fine! You're not the only one. Everyone's allowed an opinion. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaiwood93 @brookIynmarvel It truly was a brilliant show, Sebastian was amazing in it like he is in everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dw_hanna20 relatable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss these interviews. Their humour is absolutely brilliant. Also, Chris' face in the last picture... 😂I still love that this was totally not meant to happen but they kept it in the movie. 😂 #ChrisEvans #HayleyAtwell #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers #PeggyCarter  https://t.co/4DIHghgCGq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, remember when #HayleyAtwell wanted to scare #ChrisEvans back after he scared the living heck out of her and she tweeted "Got to be SOME way I can scare him in revenge. I'm thinking of hiding under his table then randomly grabbing his boob." LOL. She's one of US!!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when #HayleyAtwell bought #ChrisEvans a Ukulele for his birthday and he literally didn't put it down? 🥰  This is so wholesome. 🥺  I bet he's still got it somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alishbaziz @brookIynmarvel It's called Political Animals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bring this tweet back because this is absolutely HILARIOUS he was just like "yeah, sure" and then HAYLEY DID THE SAME IM-  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL  I love them. I love him. 😂🥺  #ChrisEvans #HayleyAtwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stefanswarner Imma sit with Stefan, Elijah, and Hayley.  This was such a hard choice jdkfnejrnf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>brb sobbing hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anjuli42 To be fair, they've explained the timeline several times that anything he does in the past won't effect his future. Even if he did go and find Bucky when he went back in time it wouldn't have done any benefit for him in a way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marvel CONFIRMS INSANE CAPTAIN AMERICA THEORY We all Wanted! - Avengers ...  https://t.co/L8kEZrJEzH "There has always been two Steve Rogers in the same timeline." DUDE. TWO OF THEM?!

<|startoftext|>Their reactions to seeing each other dead breaks my heart. Despite one of them being a dream, one of them was real. They both were so broken despite everything they'd been through with each other. #Endgame #AvengersEndgame #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #TonyStark #IronMan #Stony  https://t.co/OPzEmDAtv1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about how relieved they all looked when the portals started opening? Especially Steve considering he was standing alone at that point. His face when he heard Sam's voice... I'll never forget that. #AvengersEndgame #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #Thor #IronMan #TonyStark  https://t.co/RYi5xLxno1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This was the funniest thing ever. The fact that two of the 'Harveys' are laughing their heads off is even better.

<|startoftext|>@claireqtx @ChrisEvans honey no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just finished #TheRedSeaDivingResort/#RedSeaDivingResort and as always #ChrisEvans' performance in it was absolutely phonomenal. He literally embodies every single role he plays. He is so talented.  @ChrisEvans  AMAZING work as always. Glad I watched it. You're so talented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #ChrisEvans hopping over the desk in one go so attractive to me wtf. Also he's doing pull ups and push ups like every 5 minutes I'm- #RedSeaDivingResort #TheRedSeaDivingResort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>every time i love it 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jesus Christ Chris, you're not allowed to be that attractive. Even in diving gear. 😳🥰😍 #RedSeaDivingResort #TheRedSeaDivingResort #ChrisEvans  https://t.co/jyRJo5CfdG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so I had to take a break because I had something come up in the middle of #RedSeaDivingResort but I just got to THAT scene where #ChrisEvans is like... butt naked in bed. 😂😳 Now he's just casually shirtless and looking as good as ever. 😂 #TheRedSeaDivingResort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just hugged a straight up butt naked dude. 😂 #RedSeaDivingResort #TheRedSeaDivingResort #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChrisEvans is having a lot of soft moments in #TheRedSeaDivingResort with kids and they're the CUTEST FREAKING THING. HE'S GOT A DAUGHTER AND KISSED THE TOP OF HER HEAD. IT'S SO SOFT. DNEKRNGKTJRGN. #RedSeaDivingResort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only a couple minutes into #TheRedSeaDivingResort and #ChrisEvans has already gone and ran into gunfire to save a child, carried that child, then held hands with that child and carried him again. Then put the child on his back. SOFT EVANS. I LOVE IT. #RedSeaDivingResort #Netflix<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feb. Jake Gyllenhaal/Mysterio.  ok yes pls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok but the interview with #AnthonyMackie and #SebastianStan reading thirst tweets was so funny. I literally love them together. Sad it was so short, and I wish they read some wholesome ones too because they're cute as heck and would be nice for poor Sebby to read. 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Update; I've lived with this new #TwitterUpdate for about 5 minutes and I've decided I don't like it at all. It's too squished together, the feed keeps refreshing every 2 seconds and I can't type a tweet because it keeps dissapearing and I have to scroll up. Just no. #Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I just got the new Twitter update... this is... odd to say the least... I'm sure I'll like it/get used to it the more it's been out. But for now.... I'm not too sure. #TwitterUpdate #Twitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So... I just saw a spoiler for a future #SuitsUSA episode and... I'm shook. I have no idea why it's happening but it's really going to make the storyline interesting. We'll see how this goes I gues... #Suits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HarveySpecter missed #MikeRoss so much he rented out Mike and Rachel's old apartment just in case they came back. I miss them. HE EVEN PUT "RICK STORKIN" ON IT.

They're working hard and are probably tired because they've been working hours. I know you want to meet them, but do it afterwards. Please, don't interrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder that in #AvengersEndgame Steve &amp; Bucky said THAT line to each other but reversed.  Steve: "Don't do anything stupid until I get back." Bucky: "How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you."  #BuckyBarnes #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #WinterSoldier #Stucky #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Meh, I've seen better."  #UnlikelyFirstWordsOnTheMoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that people are being so toxic towards #TomHolland because he's in a relationship is absolutely disgusting. You call yourself "fans" and yet you're calling him all these names and calling her all these names. No wonder they kept it private for months! Be happy for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve would be chasing Bucky shirtless?... I mean... I'm ok with this.... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love these dorks. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #SebastianStan can you like... stop... being so attractive? Although, that's probably not possible. BUT seriously. 🥰🔥😍  https://t.co/RdINnmjsV1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why is every YouTuber or social media influencer or just influencer in general posting a photoshopped picture of themselves looking old? Did I miss something? I feel like I missed something. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just had an idea of a video to make that includes #WeHaveAlwaysLivedInTheCastle &amp; #KnivesOut with both #SebastianStan and #ChrisEvans in it. I might make it like a trailer kinda video. We'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevcroqers why would u do this to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hurts me, because he looked so relieved when he realised they had won, but then he turned around and saw Tony and you could see his heart visibly break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FalconAndWinterSoldier series in a nutshell.   *Bucky minding his own business* . . . . . . . . . . Sam, storming into the room in an irritated manner: “Shut the fūck up.”  #BuckyBarnes #WinterSoldier #Falcon #SamWilson #Marvel #SamBucky #SebastianStan #AnthonyMackie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SebastianStan is off supporting the US. Look at him being all cute and patriotic. Hope he has a good time where ever he's going. 😊🥰❤  https://t.co/c99j1qteYy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun fact about #SebastianStan: He worked out so much that his arm was too big to fit in the metal arm casing/mould thing that he wears for #WinterSoldier/#BuckyBarnes and honestly, that's just brilliant. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he looks damn good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t expect to be so sad over this, but he’s my age and I watched him for several years on Disney channel and followed his career on his socials because he was a genuine nice dude. I’m so speechless... taken way too soon. 💔My thoughts are with his friends and family. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wake up to the news that Cameron Boyce died in his sleep at the age of 20. I was like “This is obviously some hoax.” Turns out it’s not. WHAT THE ACTUAL F—?!

<|startoftext|>I literally love this dork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If I had romance tips I'd probably be married. Maybe... I have this habit. Whenever I'm in an argument with a girlfriend, I'm constantly thinking: "What am I doing wrong?" I think if you kinda look at yourself first, that's a step in the right direction." - #ChrisEvans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If ya'll haven't seen #Southpaw yet with #JakeGyllenhaal in it then I certainly recommend. God, he's such a talented actor it's unreal. This man deserves all the awards he gets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Okay so I just finished #WeHaveAlwaysLivedInTheCastle and it was so eerily good. I was so confused at the beginning but then it all started piecing together and making sense. Wow. Just wow. And #SebastianStan's acting was creepily good. He's so talented it's insane. Loved it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AGREED<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why does this look like some sort of like up and coming movie poster about friendship? I'd watch it. 😂 It'd 100% be a comedy with this kind of cast, I know that for sure.  #SebastianStan #PaulRudd #ElizabethOlsen #ChrisEvans #AnthonyMackie #JeremyRenner #EmilyVanCamp  https://t.co/OcHqzjnOy1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait for the three of them to reunite in #SuitsUSA and see their reactions to him being back. But most of all, can’t wait to see Mike’s reaction to #Darvey.

<|startoftext|>THE CRUNCH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I Stan this power couple. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The heroes who have inspired me and millions of others, who've given us someone to relate to and look up to in times of need. I can't wait to spread the love I have for all the actors included in #MarvelStudio's movies, not just the original six. Every single one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait for the day I get to tell my kids about the original six #Avengers. The amazing #CaptainAmerica, the brilliant #TonyStark, the fantastic #Hawkeye, the brave #BlackWidow, the fierce #Hulk, the electrifying #Thor. I can't wait to tell them all about #Marvel's heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I hear that first opening note of 'The Real Hero' from #AvengersEndgame I get goosebumps and I have to brace myself. The song knocks me into tears immediately. God, I can't wait for the day I tell my kids about #Marvel and all of #TheAvengers. 🥰 #Avengers #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree that the ending credits for #AvengersEndgame was so well done. Like, I was in tears just from the credits. The way they went through EVERYONE, and then it was the original six, their signatures, and their characters. Amazing. #Endgame #TheAvengers #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't WAIT.  #JumanjiTheNextLevel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Embrace your differences and the qualities about you that you think are weird. Eventually, they're going to be the only things separating you from everyone else." - #SebastianStan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"When you're old and on your death bed, looking back at your life it's not going to be the films you've made or what you've accomplished, it's the relationships you have. You're survived by things that matter - the people you love and those who love you back." - #ChrisEvans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I really like women who get emotional about babies and puppies. I've met some incredibly cool women who are tough, but the woman you marry should have a really soft side." - Chris Evans.  #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL - Official Trailer  https://t.co/YTFD7OhIoy This looks like it's going to be really good and actually hilarious. Also, Danny Devito! Can't wait for this though. 😂 #Jumanji #JumanjiNextLevel #JumanjiTheNextLevel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I genuinely adore the friendship between #SebastianStan &amp; #ChrisEvans. A lot of “famous friendships” feel forced for publicity, but you can tell theirs is so genuine. They have so much love and respect for one another, it’s so lovely to see. They’re always supporting each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh damn. 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Chris Evans has a new tattoo apparently? EEEEK. 🔥 #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Avengers game looks cool and all but they killed off #CaptainAmerica in the trailer so I'm a little mad. Although, choosing Nolan North to voice #IronMan/#TonyStark was a brilliant idea. Same with Troy Baker as #BruceBanner/#Hulk. Looking forward to it. #E3 #Avengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I JUST realised?! What if we find out what the can opener ritual was in season 9 of #SuitsUSA? Like... omg.

<|startoftext|>Remember when #JurassicWorld had this line:  “If I don’t make it back, remember you’re the one that made me come.”  Then he laughs and is like...  “I’ll be fine.”  Owen Grady, you knew what you were saying. 😂  #JurassicWorldFallenKingdom #FallenKingdom #OwenGrady #ChrisPratt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BryanDechart @telltalegames Woo! I can't wait for it. Thank you for your reply and the link. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @BryanDechart have you considered playing Telltale/Skybound's Walking Dead on Twitch? I'd love to see yours and Amelia's choices throughout the series if you ever did decide to play it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which should I post first? • Suits vid I made years ago with some made-up "what if" storyline. • Uncharted 4 edit (aka me messing w/ new plugins).  They're both like YEARS old.  #SuitsUSA #Suits #Uncharted #Uncharted4 #YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>awww this is so cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CHRIS LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE SASS YES KING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree that the credits for #AvengersEndgame were absolutely fantastic. Just how it went through everyone, and then it showed the original 6 #Avengers with their names, their characters, and their signatures, and it played the epic music. It was all so amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Haha, it'd be a lovely idea. I'd give it a shot but it was only a simple little thought I had and I'm not too good of a writer anyway. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can also imagine #SteveRogers turning up in the afterlife first after several years of old age to join them and both Natasha &amp; Tony being incredibly confused as to why he's there so soon. Then Steve has to explain how he went back in time and stuff. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MCU || Under Pressure  https://t.co/dMQFXyP3nY This video needs more views, it's so good. #Marvel #MarvelStudios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think people are realising just how heartbreaking this is. They both KNEW it was goodbye. Bucky KNEW that Steve was going to go back in time and be with Peggy again. Bucky knew this was the end, and so did Steve. #SteveRogers #BuckyBarnes #CaptainAmerica #WinterSoldier  https://t.co/XMmlqyO0PP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They later join everyone else they'd lost previously, and wait for their friends to join them in the many years to come, watching them live long and happy lives beforehand, and when their time finally comes, they greet them with a smile, an embrace, and become a family again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After #AvengersEndgame #TonyStark appears in the afterlife, #NatashaRomanoff's there waiting for him. She asks if everyone's okay, Tony says they won. They both smile, although tears linger. They wrap their arms around one another, and walk off into the distance and it fades out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he's baby I love him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS THE BEST.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still not over the fact that #ChrisEvans knows about the acrylic nail edits. Like, that's absolutely hilarious &amp; he even watched a video of loads of edits and re-freakin-tweeted it saying it made him belly laugh. jnerkeknrf I LOVE THIS MAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure a lot of us would volunteer as tribute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony: "Everything special about you came out of a bottle!" *Steve lifts Thor's hammer* Steve: "You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play." *Tony sacrifices himself to save the universe*  #Marvel really did that. 🥺💔 #Stony #IronMan #CaptainAmerica #TonyStark #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony Stark &amp; Steve Rogers  https://t.co/WZERKLrXXZ I'm literally in tears. We're never gonna see them again. #TonyStark #SteveRogers #Stony #CaptainAmerica #IronMan #ChrisEvans #RobertDowneyJR #Marvel #TheAvengers #Avengers #AvengersEndgame #Endgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I will NEVER be over the fact that Bucky KNEW Steve was going to go back in time to be with Peggy. That's why they BOTH looked so sad after they hugged. This breaks my heart.

<|startoftext|>@TJ_BuckyBarnes I'm sure Mackie gets a tonne of letters, he could've possibly taken loads out recently and it's empty because of that and already piling up with more. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and Chadwick's are pretty empty too, possibly for the same reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ You're not a brat. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the one with tom and seb doing an awkward prom pose im-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that we've all seen #AvengersEndgame I can basically guarentee that Robert's is just overflowing with people sending strongly worded letters of how heartbroken they are and ending it with "But I love you 3000." 😂 But damn, these guys are gonna be busy. #FanMail #Marvel  https://t.co/IAnWccU4tQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I'm aware, I was just making a joke lol.  It's still hilarious to think about how Stefan was just in peace and all of a sudden everyone's back and it's just like being alive again. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was randomly checking IG stories and Miley posted this. Ngl, they look goooood.  #MileyCryus #LiamHsemworth  https://t.co/UPGn5E1g3q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>UERFJKEN I don't wanna get my hopes up but if he's back to film something for Suits I'M GONNA FLIP. Mike Ross would be so damn happy that Darvey are finally a thing and probably throw a damn party. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 idolised by everyone but that’s how Hollywood works. You start with something. And Twilight was HUGE whether you like it or not. Ya’ll aren’t even giving him a chance. If it was some other actor you’d all be fine with it. But because he was in twilight. It’s otherwise. (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 You don’t find him to be good for the role yet you haven’t even seen him play IN the role yet. You’re all too quick to judge. And yes, he will be known for twilight, it’s what helped his name get out there. Every celeb has a starter project. Sometimes it might not be (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PaulWesley and #IanSomerhalder with Paul’s parents in Poland. The Salvatore brothers reunited! How lovely. I miss them tbh. 😩  https://t.co/AtRrj5E8iV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 You’re clearly doing what everyone else is doing him and judging him off past roles. People refuse to see past his role on twilight because they’re petty when in fact he’s a great actor and could make a fantastic batman. Everyone’s judging him before he’s even got a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are judging Robert Pattinson WAY too quickly. You’ve obviously not seen his other acting gigs. He’s actually really talented if you watch other projects he’s been in. Stop judging him off twilight. It’s 2019. 🙄 #RobertPattinson #Batman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the FUCK gave you permission to do this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans I really hope you know that you did more than an amazing job playing #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica. There’s no one else better for the role. You are Captain America. You made him your own, and you were more than fantastic. Please dont feel any other way. I love you. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How DARE people make #ChrisEvans feel like he didn’t do a good job as #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica just bcoz they didn’t like his ending in #AvengersEndgame. Honestly, how dare u? Not liking the ending is fine, but making him feel like this? That’s disgusting. #Endgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’ve come to the conclusion that Sebastian is: 1) Gorgeous (But we all knew that). 2) Trying to kill us with his looks. 3) Succeeding in doing so. 😂  Look at him. 🥺🥰🤤🔥 #SebastianStan #WeHaveAlwaysLivedInThisCastle  https://t.co/WYEMJtXFxb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scarlett should’ve been there... 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine Bucky going up to Steve really frustrated and saying "Why the is everyone asking me if I have an Apple?!" &amp; Steve's confused for a moment, then it clocks and he almost facepalms and is like "You mean the phone company?" and Bucky's like "???".  #BuckyBarnes #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How are people uploading edits of #InfinityWar? I made one on April 30th 2019 and uploaded it and within seconds #Disney copyrighted the entire thing and blocked it worldwide. I was so proud of it too.  Guess it'll never see the light of day. #Avengers #TheAvengers #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A thread of how #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica's list of recommendations changes in the movie when it's shown in different countries. It's really interesting to see what changes and what's recommended to him depending on the country the films being shown in.  https://t.co/shMWwzycZR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so interesting to see how the list changes in different regions, I mean... imagine #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica listening to Shakira, Daft Punk, AC/DC. Although he'd probably like The Beatles. I can just imagine him googling all this stuff and being so confused. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>such an epic scene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This goes for ANY special guest, not just Sebastian Stan. This is just one example of many. Understand that it's not their fault, it's really not. They've been there for hours, and they're really thankful that you're there to see them. It's whoever's organizing the events fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People could tell he was tired and obviously not enjoying himself anymore, but he stayed for hours and would only take bathroom breaks. It's really unfortunate that it get's like this sometimes. Please understand that if you meet him and he seems off, he's not being rude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's upsetting that some events are poorly coordinated and it results in the special guests getting tired, going hungry for hours, cramping up, etc. #SebastianStan's signing at an old WW con was meant to last an hour, he stayed for like 4-5hrs signing, then had to do pictures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New picture of #SebastianStan with friends!! 🥰😍🔥❤  https://t.co/fmcFFDtPQf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ChrisEvans &amp; #SebastianStan don't get enough credit for the way they talk openly about mental health and break the stigma of it being a 'taboo topic'.

I love him. 😂 #Marvel  https://t.co/tFIvh8ludg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lillseb The minute I saw this scene my heart broke. I can’t believe they did that to us, but at the same time I’m so thankful we got an interaction between them. Gah...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Spider-Man far from home starts right after #AvengersEndgame. Like, all those events are FRESH/BRAND NEW in #Spiderman/#PeterParker’s brain and everyone else’s. We’ll probably see how everyone else deals with things too. Oh god. 🥺 #SpiderManFarFromHome #TomHolland #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally don't know what to do with myself now that I've seen #AvengersEndgame. It's the only thing on my mind and my emotions are a mess and I'm a mess, and I'm just-. I can't believe it's really the end of an era. I miss everyone so much already. WTF. #Avengers #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I now know that scene everyone’s talking about where [Censored] takes [Censored]’s [Censored] and [Censored] is like “I knew it!” 😂 Loved it. Sounds dodgy asf with no context but go watch the film!! 😂 #AvengersEndgame #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 AGREED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 Aaah!! Glad you finally got to see it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really a spoiler but, The second they mentioned hot tub time machine I was like “Wait, Sebastian is in that!” So, does he exists in the marvel universe? It’s a legitimate question! #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #SebastianStan #HotTubTimeMachine #Marvel #MarvelUniverse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Avengers spoiler without context that isn’t really a spoiler tbh:  Booty booty booty booty booty  #AvengersEndgame #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 I really hope you enjoy it!! 😊✊🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish some characters got a little more screen time together, but all in all it was an absolutely fantastic movie. Wow. I’m absolutely blown away. Go see this movie. #AvengersEndgame #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I understand the why they filmed one of the several endings they filmed... #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AvengersEndgame has made me feel so many things. But all in all, I just want to say... #ThankYouAvengers. For everything. The original six, and everyone else who are just as important. All of them. Every single person who made this happen. Thankyou. So much. ❤️ #Endgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm watching #AvengersEndgame tomorrow. I'm not ready to say goodbye... #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that both #SebastianStan &amp; #ChrisEvans have said they really really want kids one day and they both just love love and both just want a good future with kids and a partner... AAAH. I can't wait to see them so happy one day as dads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to see it tomorrow with my brother! So excited but also incredibly nervous. ✌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone please send me a link my in twitter DM's where I can watch #SebastianStan in the 2009 show 'Kings' for FREE. It's on the NBC but I can't watch it in the UK, and when I do it's got a crap tonne of ads in it. Ffs, I just wanna watch the series... #Kings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, my friend sent me a tiny snippet of one of the songs featured in #AvengersEndgame. I haven't seen the film yet, but I started crying at the song... imagine how I'm going to be when I actually see the film... oh god. I'm gonna be an absolute mess. #Endgame #DontSpoilTheEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've not seen #AvengersEndgame yet. But, I wanna express how thankful I am for the entire cast of #Marvel. You've brought joy to so many of our hearts, picked us up when we've needed it the most, and created heroes we can look up to &amp; relate to. #ThankYouAvengers for everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just putting it out there... This by far one of my most favourite outfits #SebastianStan has ever worn. Idk why, but I just LOVE it. Plus, I love his short hair.

<|startoftext|>I can't believe that after 10 years in the making #AvengersEndgame is FINALLY here. I'm not going to see it for a while probably, but I'm SO nervous. I'm genuinely so nervous. My emotions are a mess. I can't believe it's the end of an era. #WhateverItTakes #AvengeTheFallen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it weird I find hands attractive? Like, not in a sexual weird way. Just in a way of “Wow, you have nice hands and I wouldn’t mind holding them all day” way. 😂 Maybe it is weird, but I don’t care.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WHAT IF #STEVEROGERS IS SACRIFICING HIMSELF IN #ENDGAME IN FRONT OF #BUCKYBARNES AND BUCKY IS LIKE "STEVE DON'T DO THIS!" AND STEVE TURNS AROUND AND SAYS "TILL THE END OF THE LINE".

<|startoftext|>"Smile. Though your heart is aching. Smile. Even though it's breaking." - Robert Downey JR.  (It's not an original quote from him but, still holds a lot of damn meaning coming from him of all people.)  #IronMan #TonyStark #RobertDowneyJR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person: "Would #CaptainAmerica ever consider running for president?" #ChrisEvans: "Well, I think he does more good outside the system like Oprah. But, with more punching."  Okay, honestly, I love Chris Evans' humour. 😂 #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #SteveRogers #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Person: "Who's #TheAvengers biggest enemy?" #ChrisHemsworth, #BrieLarson &amp; #JeremyRenner: "Thanos." #ChrisEvans: "Chafing. If you've ever run through an interdimensional portal wearing a skin-tight body suit, you know what I mean."  Evans I love you. 😂 #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF #CaptainAmerica/#SteveRogers does die in #AvengersEndgame, I just HOPE he sees #BuckyBarnes before he does. I just HOPE he's able to know his brother is okay and made it back alive before he dies, because then he'll die with some happiness knowing his friend is finally okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when people say "#CaptainAmerica isn't a real superhero, he doesn't have powers." You don't NEED superpowers to be a hero. He's selfless, worthy, loyal, and more than a 'good man', he's is a great man and definitely one of the best #Avengers. He doesn't get enough credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Evans getting his dance moves on<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Marvel has made #SteveRogers say in the #AvengersEndgame trailer "I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't." they posted a video of his legacy captioned "Part of the journey is the end", &amp; #ChrisEvans retweeted a trailer captioned 'Wow, What a journey'.  #Endgame #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can imagine #SteveRogers going into retirement and every week or something #TheAvengers &amp; friends catch up with him and make sure he’s ok. Sam &amp; Bucky make fun of him for being “old”. Natasha saying she knows some old ladies that’d date him. 😂 #CaptainAmerica #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that some miracle happens and #Marvel was just playing us all along and #SteveRogers magically survives and goes into retirement with #TonyStark. It’s what he deserves. I really hope he’s not killed. #IronMan #CaptainAmerica #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #WhateverItTakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if the Russo brothers made the entire cast of #AvengersEndgame film multiple endings and none of them know which one is the true ending? 🤔 Imagine! #Endgame #Marvel #RussoBrothers #AvengeTheFallen #WhateverItTakes #MarvelStudios #TheAvengers #Avengers #DontSpoilTheEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a spoiler, it’s a prediction: Why does everyone think #IronMan/#TonyStark is dying in #AvengersEndgame? I honestly don’t think he is. I’d assume #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica is going to sacrifice himself beforehand and I’ll be crying my eyes out. 👏🏻 #Endgame #Marvel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What if Steve dies without knowing if Bucky is okay or not?

<|startoftext|>#DontSpoilTheEndgame is trending and I 100% agree. Don't be an asshole and spoil it. Even when it's been released for a few days, don't spoil it.

<|startoftext|>I can't imagine how #TonyStark is feeling in #AvengersEndgame after loosing #PeterParker. Because in #SpidermanHomecoming he said to him "If you die, I feel like that's on me".

<|startoftext|>I love how legit SHOOK #SebastianStan gets when he hears someone speaking Romanian. He legit is full on shook, his face shows it very clearly. It's so adorable. He's kinda like "Wait, that's Romanian! I can understand you!" 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's incredible how you can tell just how different #InfinityWar &amp; #AvengersEndgame are going to be just by the music they used in their trailers. The soundtrack for #Endgame is so much darker than IW's was. I'm so pumped, but so scared at the same time. #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching male birds performing dance moves and sequences to impress the female birds is absolutely HILARIOUS. These birds are absolute comics. The blue one even has back up dancers and is REHEARSING WITH THEM! I LOVE THIS SERIES. LMAO. #OurPlanet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scenes and shots in #OurPlanet are so beautifully HD it's unreal. Like, wow. My eyes are feeling blessed watching all these beautiful clips put together. Whoever filmed this, you need a raise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OurPlanet has got me crying over baby flamingos in the first episode. God dammit. This series is going to ruin me, but the shots are SO BEAUTIFUL, and the whole program is just amazing. Thankyou #Netflix &amp; #DavidAttenborough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Underrated friendship in the #Marvel universe: #WandaMaximoff &amp; #SteveRogers.  He protects &amp; reassures her.

<|startoftext|>😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheeto_Pedo Yeah, he’s doing GOTG 3 but that might be his last. They’ve all signed contracts that only allow them to be in a certain amount of films, and if he’s in GOTG3 then he’s been in all his film. It’s allegedly though, could be renewed idk. 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xavngrs He’s still doing GOTG 3, it allegedly finishes after he’s finished filming for that. But, who knows. Some of them might get renewed. 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominantCub72 Yes, he’s starting production for GOTG 3 probably in this year or something and then allegedly his contract ends after that. But like I said ALLEGEDLY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cast members who's contracts REMAIN after #AvengersEndgame (ALLEGEDLY):  • Brie Larson • Paul Rudd • Chadwick Boseman • Scarlett Johansson • Sebastian Stan • Tom Holland • Michael Pena • Evangeline Lilly • Michael Keaton • Cobie Smulders • Frank Grillo • Josh Brolin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marvel stars who's contracts are ending after #AvengersEndgame (ALLEGEDLY):  • Chris Evans • Robert Downey JR • Chris Hemsworth • Chris Pratt • Tom Hiddleston • Samuel L Jackson • Jeremy Renner • Mark Ruffalo  It's gonna be heartbreaking to not see them anymore. 💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SebastianStan said if he could cosplay anyone at #ComicCon he'd cosplay as The Riddler. But also said he's "extremely aware of the other side". 😂 #DC #TheRiddler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I might have teared up slightly at this Inside Out movie. I might have felt the salt of my own tears. Yeah, it was great, it was really, really great. I was amazed." - #SebastianStan talking about #InsideOut making him cry. Gah, he has a great taste in films too. #Pixar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SebastianStan's go to karaoke songs are 'Dead or Alive' by Bon Jovi, 'Sweet Child Of Mine' by Guns N' Roses, 'Suspicious Minds' by Elvis Presley and 'Bizarre Love Triangle' by New Order.  He has such good music taste, df.  #WinterSoldier #BuckyBarnes #Marvel #RickiAndTheFlash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember reading an interview w/ #SebastianStan years ago and he said he would love to do a film with #Falcon, and here we are in 2019 where #DisneyPlus announced that they're getting a show together. #AnthonyMackie #WinterSoldier #BuckyBarnes #FalconAndWinterSoldier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget this iconic moment from Steve &amp; Bucky. 😂  Pre-Serum Steve: "I think I pulled a muscle." Bucky: "Steve, you can't pull what you don't have."

<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 But then again, they might not even pass on the 'mantle' and he might just be a wonderful memory. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 Even if Bucky or Sam did take over being 'Captain America' they wouldn't be able to top Chris Evans' performance and that's good. It'd be interesting to see their take on it and I'd love to see either one of them take on the role because they'd make it unique to themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 Yeah, in the comics it's Bucky that becomes Cap. But, it depends what route they're going to follow I suppose. It'll be interesting either way. I hope Bucky get's something though. His story deserves a big arc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica does die in #AvengersEndgame, I'm going to be heartbroken when it shows everyone's reaction to it. Especially #BuckyBarnes, &amp; #TonyStark's. I wonder if Bucky will become Cap? 🤔 #Endgame #IronMan #WinterSoldier #Marvel #ChrisEvans #SebastianStan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ 17 &amp; 18 year olds, post pictures of her wearing barely any clothes on her instagram when she's literally under the age of consent.

<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ She dates guys way older than herself when she's under the age of consent, and now she's apparently pregnant all at the age of 15 years old? I'm saying where are her parents because she's out of hand. Not just because of pregnancy, but because her parents are letting her date -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I didn't say a thing about her being locked in her room and not letting her to go to school, lmao? She's problematic and has been posting since she was like 11 or something. She makes innapropiate videos and posts them on social media knowing older people are gonna see them -<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly, in #AvengersEndgame can we just get a scene where #BuckyBarnes finally gets to eat some damn plumbs. That's all he wanted in #CivilWar... 😂  #SebastianStan #WinterSoldier #Endgame #TheAvengers #Avengers #Marvel #WhateverItTakes #AvengeTheFallen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SebastianMgirl6 Yeah, I can't remember either. But, it'd be interesting to see how it gets back to Steve regardless. I'm sure whatever way they do it, it'll be some sort of nice reunion between the pair. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, this is #ChrisEvans' personality in a single picture. Always laughing, adorable, always grabbing his chest and tipping his head back when he laughs, most the time wearing hats, and huge dog lover. 😂❤ #SuperpowerDogs  https://t.co/zcGGz4sIhM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really interested in how they're gonna bring back #CaptainAmerica's shield. Who's going to find it? Who's going to give it to him?

<|startoftext|>my strange addiction  https://t.co/7ID3aMdakc The fact that #BillieEllish used some of #TheOffice quotes in this is fantastic. If the music video has the cast in it I'll flip (in a good way). Or, the scene where Michael's doing his dance. 😂 #TheOfficeUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Behind the scenes pictures from #TheWalkingDead blizzard episode. This is freakin' adorable.

<|startoftext|>I want to yell at #ChrisEvans for making all these jokes about #CaptainAmerica/#SteveRogers dying. Why play my heart like this? But at the same time, I wanna hug him tight and just say thank you for everything. #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #WhateverItTakes #AvengeTheFallen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loveIydylan 27. So, in 7 years. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*#SebastianStan being interviewed about his steamy scene in "#TheBronze"* Interviewer: "Everybody is talking about that sex scene!" Seb: "Oh good, I hope so." Interviewer: "How did you film that?!" Seb *Laughing*: "We filmed as much as much as they let us film." SEB LMAO 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'M LAUGHING SO HARD. IN THE VIDEO OF #THEAVENGERS READING THE THANOS CHILDREN BOOK #CHRISEVANS POINTS TO THANOS' CHIN AND SAYS "SAG THE NUTS". I'M LAUGHING SO HARD.

<|startoftext|>Theres all these rumours about #AvengersEndgame where #CaptainAmerica/#SteveRogers will sacrifice himself to save erry1 else, but what if #Marvel/#RussoBrothers are just messin with us and he lives and they got us all upset&amp;angry for nothin? I CANT TRUST THEM ANYMORE. #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why would u even make me think about this 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay so #MarkRuffalo "accidentally" almost spoiled that there's a wedding in #AvengersEndgame? Whaaaaat? #Endgame #WhateverItTakes #AvengeTheFallen #Avengers #TheAvengers #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand how #SebastianStan &amp; #ChrisEvans are single. They're by far two of the hottest men in #Marvel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see this picture of #ChrisEvans and all my brain can imagine is him as a father reading to his future kids and it makes me so happy inside because he's always said he wants kids one day. #Endgame #Avengers #AvengersEndgame #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers #Marvel #TheAvengers  https://t.co/4IolSWTKNm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finished #TheMartian and it was absolutely awesome, I loved it. Also, snapped this ADORABLE picture of #SebastianStan holding a baby. I just had to... like, c'mon. #Martian  https://t.co/9ChBB7pqzS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching #TheMartian and Sebastian Stan is in it and one of the dudes said "I get to fly around like Iron Man" and the camera went onto Sebastian's face and he was just laughing (in character), but lmaooo. Breaking that 4th wall... kinda. 😂 #SebastianStan #IronMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>im gona cry my eyes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #RussoBrothers said that apparently no-one has guessed the ending of #AvengersEndgame yet, but they also said that #InfinityWar didn’t include the name of the next film, and it did. IDK. #Endgame #Marvel #TheAvengers #Avengers #WhateverItTakes #AvengeTheFallen #MarvelStudios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #AvengersEndgame cast reading a story book is something I never needed but now that I have it I adore it. Seeing #ChrisEvans reading a book makes me imagine reading to his future kids. #Endgame #Marvel #Avengers #TheAvengers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need a scene in #AvengersEndgame where #Thor introduces #CaptainMarvel and #CaptainAmerica to each other and he’s like “Captain... meet Captain...” and Steve and Carol look at each other and just nod at one another and it’s epic asf. 😂 #SteveRogers #CarolDanvers #Endgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is fucking disgusting. But, you're in a room full of wrestlers &amp; security guards. GG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If my prediction for #AvengersEndgame does happen and #CaptainAmerica sacrifices himself. If they show a funeral scene with all of #TheAvengers there I'm done for.

<|startoftext|>Scott Lang/Antman is a wonderful person and an even more wonderful father. He is seriously underrated and Paul Rudd doesn't get enough credit for his fantastic acting in the films he's in. He's just as good as the everyone else. #ScottLang #Antman #PaulRudd #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, I love them so much. Look at how happy they are. Also, #ChrisEvans is looking extra good in these pictures, probably because of his smile, but still.

<|startoftext|>Prediction #2, I feel like in #AvengersEndgame, #IronMan is going to retire at the end because of (my other prediction) Cap's gona sacrifice himself. &amp; Tony wants to settle down w/ Pepper. #Endgame #Avengers #TheAvengers #TonyStark #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update, still stuck in the queue for Avengers Tickets. Been in it for two hours now. Fun times. #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #Avengers #TheAvengers #AvengersEndgametickets #WhateverItTakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AvengersEndgametickets are on sale and my local cinema website has over a 3hr long digital queue of people waiting to buy tickets to it. Oh my god, save me. 😫 #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #WhateverItTakes #TheAvengers #Avengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENING ITS HAPPENING. TONY LOOKING AT A PIC OF HIM AND PETER, TONY AND STEVE BECOMING FRIENDS AGAIN, STEVE FINDING HIS SHEILD, PEPPER AND TONY HUGGING, EVERYTHING IN THIS IM FREAKINGGGG OUTTTTT! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That #WalkingDead episode was certainly something. Seeing everyone smile and have fun for once was nice. Also, did Negan sort of just redeem himself kinda? That moment was really sweet, i'm not gonna lie. #TheWalkingDead #TWD #TheWalkingDeadUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prediction for #AvengersEndgame ending. #Hulk's gonna take the gauntlet and put it on to reverse everything. But, #CaptainAmerica's gonna take it off him &amp; sacrifice himself w/ it so his friends can live. But, I want Cap to stay alive. 😫💔 #Endgame #SteveRogers #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was an april fools joke but I don't care they still said that Rose &amp; Ten got a happy ending together in the parallel universe and even if it's fake I'd like to think they did so shh. #DoctorWho #AprilFools #TenthDoctor #DavidTennant #RoseTyler #MetaCrisis #BilliePiper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they just casually confirmed that the half human half timelord Doctor &amp; Rose have children and a retired police dog in the alternate universe. Oh my god. #MetaCrisis #DoctorWho #DavidTennant #BilliePiper #TenthDoctor #RoseTyler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love this man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this #DoctorWho news is true of #DavidTennant &amp; #BilliePiper having a spin-off series of their own of the half human half timelord doctor &amp; Rose then I'm going to flip my shit because OH MY GOD. YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Evans *Taking through a Captain America action figure*: "Hey kid, wanna help save the world?" Kid: "No." *Chris literally dies of laughter, throwing his head back &amp; grabbing his left boob as usual.*  I love him. 😂  #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @ChrisEvans please tell me you own this. 😂 Like, I need to know. I just need to know. It's on the offical disney website.

<|startoftext|>DYLAN LIKED THIS, LMAOOOOOO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that #Antman proper fanboyed when he met #CaptainAmerica, because honestly, same. 😂 I relate a lot Scott, don’t worry. 😂 #ScottLang #SteveRogers #PaulRudd #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I legit love this 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god stop 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that some people are defending #CardiB when she ADMITTED she drugged and robbed men when she was a stripper is disgusting. Men can be victims too, news flash! Her behaviour is disgusting. How can you defend her when she admitted to it herself? Jesus Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evansndodger Agreed. Either way, I’m glad Chris is so vocal about having anxiety and raises awareness for it all. It’s nice to see, especially for people who feel so alone in the world because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evansndodger Yeah, he’s joked a few times. It’s a little unsettling, but I’m sure Chris would’ve told him otherwise if it was getting outta hand. People who don’t have anxiety just don’t understand how scary it can be a lot of the time &amp; think someone can just “forget about it” and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DO IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His suit 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember watching RDJ on a talk show saying Chris Evans was super anxious for the civil war premier and RDJ just said “He needs to man up” which isn’t funny. I suffer with major anxiety disorder and you can’t just ‘get over it’, I relate to Chris in many ways with anxiety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does this mean, Gillies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this hurts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cherish this picture because it gives you good luck and good vibes and cuteness on your timeline. Jks, idk if it’s lucky, but it does give cuteness and adorableness. #ChrisEvans  https://t.co/chPZjgDIjt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #ChrisEvans confirmed what we knew was going to happen all along just breaks my heart. I want to believe he’s joking, but from the spoilers I read it doesn’t sound like he is. 💔 #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #AvengeTheFallen #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adorable!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I cant believe #Skybound just played me like that. Omg. My emotions in that finale were EVERYWHERE. But, I LOVED it.

<|startoftext|>All I’m gonna say... if the spoilers I just read are correct then one of the very last scenes in #Endgame is going to break me, and several others. #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna rant about the ending for #Endgame I just read but don’t wanna be spoiling people, but I need to rant. Iuuchahajjwjs nevermind, ill just go back to crying. #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s ending the way I don’t want it to end. Of course it’s ending this way, we all guessed it. We all knew it was coming. My heart aches so much. I don’t want this to happen. I’m sobbing from just reading it, so I’m going to be a mess in the cinema. 💔 #Endgame #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m really fucking sad now. I just got spoilt for the ending of #Endgame and I know now for sure I’m going to be sobbing my fucking eyes out. I already am just reading it. Why do this to me marvel wtf. #Marvel #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just found an interview where #ChrisEvans said that he wants to be in a role in the future where he can incooperate his tap dancing. He'd like to possibly be in some sort of musical thing. That'd be interesting to see!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bruh, the amount of good movies coming out this year is insane. I'm so ready. Go 2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stealthnomad @ChrisEvans He'd be happy about the Doritos for sure. He needs to swoop in and order them all up again like he did a few weeks ago. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@p17blo It literally got confirmed that it was a false alarm and that an elevator was faulty, the bang just freaked everyone out. They called security and armed forces in out of panic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got Captain America three times in a fucking row and then Black Widow. Screw this game. 😂 THEY’RE NOT DYING!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p17blo You do realise it’s a false alarm right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone freaking out about Disneyland Paris, an elevator malfunctioned and it made a loud bang noise that's why everyone was freaking out. All is okay. #Disneyland #DisneylandParis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best characters from #DoctorWho and who I miss with all my heart you ask? Wilfred Mott. They should 100% bring him back, even if it's for a small cameo or something. It'd be hilarious to see his reaction to the doctor being a woman now. 😂 #WilfredMott #BernardCribbins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're so talented, wtf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh my god i just realised... I'm going to see #AvengersEndgame w/ my brother but the guy I like goes to the same cinema as us and if he bumps into me and my brother and sees that I'm in a mess because of all the deaths n stuff I'm- HELP.

<|startoftext|>I'm legit getting so sad at the fact that we might lose #CaptainAmerica in #Endgame. Like, I genuinely am feeling so fking sad about it. Yeah, it's just a movie and a made-up character, but it means #ChrisEvans isn't Cap anymore, and that fking- I can't. #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louology  https://t.co/3A4I2WUqXE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@evanswrth ask them to keep steve rogers alive in endgame pls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, they added the music from Love Actually. They added scenes of Andy. Bonnie's lost her toys. Old toys are back. Looks like its gonna be one hell of a ride.  Conclusion: I know I'm gonna cry.  I can't wait for this. #ToyStory4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I find Klaus' face so hilarious when Caroline says "C'mon Bob, I'll show you the toilets."

<|startoftext|>Thor: "This drink was aged for 1000 years. It is not meant for mortal men." *Thor hands some of the drink to Captain America because he knows Cap can handle it tho.*  That was I C O N I C.  #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers #Thor #ThorOdinson #ChrisHemsworth #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gonna be me watching #AvengersEndgame in the cinema with my brother trying not to cry when #CaptainAmerica gets hurt and probably dies.

<|startoftext|>#SteveRogers &amp; #TonyStark deserve to live in #Endgame so they can get in an elevator with #Thor's hammer and test the theory of if it'd go up with it inside or not. They deserve that moment.   #CaptainAmerica #IronMan #Stony #AvengersEndgame #TheAvengers #Avengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve Rogers: "But if you put the hammer in an elevator..." Tony Stark: "It'd still go up." Steve Rogers: "The elevators not worthy."  One of the best moments. 😂 #IronMan #CaptainAmerica #TonyStark #SteveRogers #ChrisEvans #RobertDowneyJR #Stony #Avengers #TheAvengers #Thor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if at the end of #Endgame they say thankyou to everyone who isn't going to be doing Marvel anymore as well a wonderful tribute to #StanLee.  Just imagine seeing at the end "Thankyou, #CaptainAmerica." (Or Chris Evans) and whoever else is leaving. I'd cry. #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna miss him so freakin' much. Please don't kill him off. Please please please please, I beg.  #Endgame #AvengersEndgame #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when you love someone so much it actually causes you physical pain? That's how I'm feeling about #ChrisEvans these days.

<|startoftext|>@BeeH84 It was all over the news and both parents were interrogated as suspects, Kate only answered one question and then refused to co-operate because the police were treating her as a suspect and was "distracting from their work they should be doing to find Maddie".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>cuuuute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police in Portugal were meant to be searching EVERY car that was attempting to leave the area, but instead they sat in their patrol cars for 40 minutes to stay out of the rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the police turned up to the scene they said the place was a complete mess, the McCann's &amp; friends had been in and out of the apartment, had trampled all over potential evidence, had been touching and moving things. You'd think not to in that situation, right? Like, cmon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said before when the sketch artist drew what people had seen of the guy that was spotted nearby the McCann's apartment carrying a little girl in her pyjamas, they made this image as a reference and well... the resemblance of Gerry is unsettling.  https://t.co/BYWcLebgqT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elliegallag2 I thought it was because Madeline was born via IVF so that could possibly be one of the reasons, but even then she's still their daughter. So, it is incredibly weird why she's not there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@softdechart Awh, you're more than welcome! Have fun with whatever you decide to make!! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@softdechart Don't put yourself down, literature is still art! Plus, it's Bryan. He'll appreciate whatever you decide to make, just that fact that you're wanting to make something for him is lovely and I'm sure he'll appreciate it greatly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*cough* Romeo Lacoste *cough*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurennnkeller Yeah, it's shitty. Especially when it can go on behind the scenes and no-one knows about it. It's always the ones you don't expect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>c u t e !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurennnkeller High five. ✋🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironic how his twitter is no-where to be found now, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey so, if you were subbed to Romeo Lacoste, please unsub to him. He doesn't deserve your money or the attention. Scumbag.  #RomeoLacoste #YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurennnkeller It's straight up sickening. I'm glad he didn't DM you with this shit or anything though. Can't imagine how traumatic it is in the long term for the person who experienced it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Romeo Lacoste told an UNDERAGE girl he wants to get her incredibly drunk and then fill her stomach with cum sickens me. I genuinely feel sick. That's disgusting. Not to mention, he KNEW she was underage and he STILL wanted to do sexual acts to her. #RomeoLacoste<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(HUMOR) Infinity War | Please don't put your eggs in me!  https://t.co/5qSDcNWHR1 I love this. #InfinityWar #Avengers #TheAvengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold on, so... McKenna Grace knows Chris Evans AND Sebastian Stan? My god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the start of a romcom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love this so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll add more stuff to the thread later probably, I need to eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've already said this before too, when Kate noticed Maddie was 'abducted' she left her other two kids in the apartment whilst she ran off to notify people of the 'abduction', like...? You'd take your kids with you, obviously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the night of Maddie's disappearance, when they had left Maddie &amp; the twins in their apartment, they left the patio door open and unlocked, accessible to anyone. Like, why would you do this if your kids are in there??????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A thread of the #MadeleineMccann case:  https://t.co/8BjcjCu4iD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maddie has a defect in her right eye, when she went missing police told Kate &amp; Gerry to NOT reveal this; worrying it'd make it easier to find &amp; kill Maddie. But, K&amp;G made the defect VERY public &amp; the focus of their plea. Gerry even quoted as saying it's "a good marketing ploy."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kate washed Maddie's favourite stuffed toy that was in their rental car when she heard the news that two sniffer dogs were coming to sniff out the car for clues. She stated it was to get the smell of suntan lotion off it. If that's not suspicious, I don't know what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The McCann’s took the money of millions of people that had donated to a GoFundMe that was meant to help them search for their daughter, and paid off their house mortgage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their lawyer said that the dogs detected traces of blood &amp; corpse in the car because Kate was a doctor, not because she had murdered Maddie. He also stated that the dog alerted corpse in the trunk due to some raw meat that had been in a garbage bad in the trunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did the sniffer dogs find traces of CORPSE and Maddie's BLOOD in the rental car they were using? Like, why would there be traces of corpse in the back of your rental car? Blood on Kate's clothes and Maddie's toys that were in the car?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yvonne Martin back in England was a worker for child protective services and wanted to offer any assistance she could. Kate proceeded to tell ehr Maddie had been abducted by a couple only a few hours after the disapperance. There were no leads, theories, or evidence yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The McCann's lied when they returned to the UK saying that an intruder had "broken" and "smashed" the shutters to take Maddie out of a window. This was not true, as there was no evidence of a break-in. Why would you lie about your own daughters disapperance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kate somehow immediately knew that her daughter had been taken, she screamed "THEY'VE TAKEN HER!", when there was no evidence that immediately showed an abduction. At this point it was safe to assume that Maddie had wandered of when she woke up confused. But Kate refused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the family members even stated that they were 80% sure that the man was Gerry in the photograph that bad been sketched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the sketch artist had finished drawing the 'man who was carrying his daughter back to a resort' which was coincidentally beside the apartment the McCann's were staying in, people were shocked that the sketch of the man had a strong resemblance to Gerry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their friend Matt went to check on the children around 9:30PM the night of Maddie's disapperance, he stated he could not say for sure if he could see Maddie in her bed, but he could see the twins in their cot, sleeping. If he could've seen them, he could've seen Maddie for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kate and Gerry McCann have NEVER been cleared of being involved in the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On May 29th, despite the possibility of an abductor still being at large, the McCann's embark on a European tour, leaving their twins behind in the very town they claim Maddie was abducted from. Less than 3 weeks after Maddie's disapperance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But to me it still seems a little strange that a man was carrying a little girl in pyjamas just like Maddie's in the middle of the night RIGHT NEXT TO the apartment the McCann's were staying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2013, British detectives identified the man was in fact a British holidaymaker who had been carrying his own daughter. Andy Redwood, Former DCI described it as a 'revelation moment' which shifted the focus of the investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red Herring; A piece of information in a story that distracts readers from an important truth, or leads them to mistakenly expect a particular outcome. Most often, used to refer to a "false clue".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They had drawn an image based off Jane's descriptions of the male and child, but six years later it was established that it was 'almost certainly' a red herring to the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, their friend Jane Tanner said she'd seen a man carrying a girl in pyjamas as she went to check on her own children. You'd think if you saw that, it'd be a little suspicious, right? Especially to a parent, not to mention this was super late at night. Like, why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, that's all the questions that the McCann's REFUSED to answer to the police. And for some reason, it was completely allowed. It's so suspicious in my opinion, especially the ones about the corpse, blood, etc found in THEIR RENTAL CAR. If that's not suspicious, idk what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>47) When confronted with the results of Maddie's DNA, carried out in a British lab, collected from behind the sofa and the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn't explain more than you already had?  48) Did you have any responsibility or intervention in the disappearance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>46) When human blood was marked in the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn't explain more than you already had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>45) When the sniffer dog marked the scent of corpse coming from the vehicle you hired a month after the disapparance, did you say you couldn't explain any more than you already had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>44) When the sniffer dog also marked human blood behind the sofa, did you say you couldn't explain any more than you already had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>43) In the case files, you were shown canine forensic testing films. After watching them, did you say you couldn't explain any more than you already had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>41) Is it true that in England you even considered handing over Madeleine's custody to a relative?  42) In England, did you medicate your children? What type of medication?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>38) At a certain point you stopped working, why?  39) Are the twins difficult to get to sleep? Are they restless and does that cause you uneasiness?  40) Is it true that you sometimes despaired at your children's behaviour and it left you feeling very uneasy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>34) As for your professional life, in how many and which hospitals have you worked?  35) What is your medical speciality?  36) Have you ever done shift work in any emergency services or other services?  37) Did you work every day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>30) What was Madeleine's behaviour like?  31) Did Maddie suffer from any illnesses or take any medication?  32) What's Maddie's relationship like with her brother and sister?  33) What's Maddie's relationship like with her brother and sister, friends and school mates?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>26) Is it true that during the searches you remained seated on Maddie's bed without moving?  27) What was your behaviour that night?  28) Did you manage to sleep?  29) Before travelling to Portugal, did you make any comment about foreboding or a bad feeling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21) Who did you phone after the occurrence?  22) Did you call Sky News?  23) Did you know the danger of calling the media, because it could influence the abductor?  24) Did you ask for a priest?  25) By what means did you divulge Madies's features, by photos, or by other means?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>18) How were authorities contacted and which police force was alerted?  19) During the searches, with the police there, where did you search for Maddie, how and in what way?  20) Why did the twins not wake up during that search or when they were taken upstairs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13) Who took place in the searches?  14) Did anyone outside the group learn of her disapperance in those following minutes?  15) Did any neighbour offer you help?  16) What does "we let her down" mean?  17) Did Jane Tanner tel lyou that night she'd seen a man with a child?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9) When you raised the alarm at the 'Tapas' what exactly did you say - what were your exact words?  10) What happened after you raised the alarm there?  11) Why did you go and warn your friends instead of shouting from the verandah?  12) Who contacted the authorities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7) Assuming Madeleine was abducted, why did you leave the twins to go to the 'Tapas' and raise the alarm? The supposed abductor could still be in the apartment.  8) Why didn't you ask the twins then what happened to their sister or why didn't you ask them later on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) Why was the curtain by the sofa near the side of the window tampered with? Did someone go behind the sofa?  5) How long did your search of the aparment take after you detected Madeleine's dissapearance?  6) Why did you say Madeleine had been abducted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) When you entered the apartment, what did you see? What did you do? Where did you look? What did you touch?  2) Did you search inside the master bedroom wardrobe?  3) Can you describe the contents in the wardrobe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things that don't add up about the #MadelineMcCann case in a thread.  Starting off with 48 questions the McCann's refused to answer, which doesn't make sense, because if your child was missing you'd stop at absolutely NOTHING to find them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcCamphill It works now, didn't work 2hrs ago for some reason. Thanks though. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathyCookson2 I know, I searched it and it didn't come up for some reason. But then searched "McCann" a few seconds ago and it popped up. Must've been delayed or something. Thanks though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahWO90 That's indeed weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My netflix in the UK doesn't have the #MadelineMcCann documentary on it yet. ffs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I used to watch Felix's videos when I was a child but grew out of his comedy. Yes, he's said some fucked up things here and there which I'm not defending. But, he no way in hell had anything to do with this shooting. Anyone that thinks so is just reaching for straws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't imagine how #PewDiePie is feeling at this moment, he had NOTHING to do with these shootings, and anyone that believes he did clearly needs a fact check.<|endoftext|>

I’m not saying it coz I love his character, I’m saying it coz he’s never had the chance and It’s all he wants. Settle down, have kids.. #Endgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they kill #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica imma be RIOTING, but the Avengers are gonna grab #Thanos' glove and just reverse time and bring him back to life and keep doing it over and over until it stays, right? K Thanks. #TheAvengers #InfinityWar #Endgame #Avengers #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was about to tweet about #Endgame but realised it'd be a spoiler. #Avengers #TheAvengers #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want #CaptainAmerica and #CaptainMarvel to meet and there be some inside joke where #SteveRogers introduces himself and goes like "I'm Captain America" and she's like "I'm Captain Marvel", and then bam Civil War part 2, there can only be one Captain. 😂#ChrisEvans #BrieLarson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also just realised that Tony never actually called Steve and doesn't know that Steve's also in the #InfinityWar and they're gonna end up meeting up in #Endgame and kicking some ass together. HELL YES. #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #TonyStark #IronMan #Stony #Avengers #TheAvengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I JUST realised?! How in the holy hell did #Thanos snap his fingers in #InfinityWar? He's wearing a METAL glove. There's no way he could've snapped his fingers. 😂#Endgame #Avengers #TheAvengers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>multifandom | smile [for niamh!]  https://t.co/Sg7XFvcaRQ This made me smile A LOT. So well made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #TomHiddleston said that whenever #ChrisEvans texts their #Avengers group-chat and asks them if they're hanging out, when they're all ready to meet he sends "ASSEMBLE!" in the group chat. I freakin' love him, oh my god. 😂 #TheAvengers #CaptainAmerica #Loki<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manchester Pride is NOT a concert. Don't buy tickets just to get a chance to see Arianna Grande or the other performers perform. That's not what it is. It's not a concert, it's PRIDE. You go there to celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ Community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂 Sorrrrryyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, to summarise the interview I just watched with #ChrisEvans. • He sleeps nude. • He said that someday he'll have to pass down the shield of #CaptainAmerica, and that breaks my heart because #Endgame is growing nearer. 💔  #Avengers  #TheAvengers #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Evans was talking to an Interviewer and told them he sleeps nude and the comments turned into an absolute thirst section... oh my god, calm down. 😂 #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Then maybe in a few years they can bring him back in some other marvel movie for a cameo or something and a “surprise return”. He doesn’t deserve to die. 😩💔 #Steggy #ChrisEvans #TheAvengers #Avengers #AvengersEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope they don’t kill off #SteveRogers/#CaptainAmerica in #Endgame. As much as I’d like to see him reunite with Peggy in the afterlife, he deserves to just “go offline” and live his life with someone, anyone, and get used to it all properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PEGGY NEVER GOT TO TEACH STEVE HOW TO DANCE AND THAT IRRITATES THE HECK OUTTA ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UUUUGUGGUGUGUGH.  #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers #Steggy #ChrisEvans #PeggyCarter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching @mammamiamovie and absolutely LOVED it. I'm ashamed it took me so long to see it, but I'm so glad I finally did.

<|startoftext|>Love these new/old wedding pictures of #DylanOBrien, but can we also talk about how adorable #JuliaOBrien is in the pics. Her smile, the fact that she's wearing a suit. Just everything about it, Y E S. I love the O'Brien siblings. Both of them in a suit is fireeee.  https://t.co/XUVYlkxweI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really really really really tempted to make a trailer spoof with the Infinity War music in it coz it's so dramatic and just dope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMFAOOOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I neeeeed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how competitive he can get. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more tweets I see about Chris Evans, the more I fall in love with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Chris Evans &amp; Chris Hemsworth eating Doritos together in an interview* Evans: "I've never tasted myself before." Hemsworth: "This is exactly what I thought you'd taste like." *Both of them start laughing like little girls*  #ChrisEvans #ChrisHemsworth #Thor #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, I just wanna hold someone's hand and feel loved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, quick question; How's a 95 year old that looks like a 25 year old aka Steve Rogers, only kissed like 5 people or something? Not to mention, a possible virgin. He's CAPTAIN AMERICA. Like, Damn! I know he's loyal and a gentleman, but CMON. 😂 #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, Harvey really had his hands ALL OVER Donna's body. Their make-out was steamy asf. We've waited years for this and we've FINALLY gotten what we deserved. I hope they have a happy life together from here on out. They've finally come to their sense. #Darvey #SuitsUSA #Suits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAMANTHA FINALLY MAKING HARVEY REALISE HE'S IN LOVE WITH DONNA AND HE NEEDS TO GO GET WHAT THEY'VE BEEN FREAKIN WANTING FOR YEARS. YES SAM. YES. #Darvey #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alex: "Robert's right, I need to get home to the woman I love." **Harvey standing there, finally realising he needs to go to Donna after all these damn years.**  #SuitsUSA #Suits #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that Harvey didn't even need to say any words to Donna, they both just knew and he walked right in there, wrapped his arms around her and they finally kissed and did what they've both been waiting for, for so long. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robert and Samantha's hug was cute. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donna: "Love him? We just started seeing each other." Alex: "I'm not talking about Thomas..."  ALEX KNOWS WHAT'S UP. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HARVEY SAYING "MISS YOU, BUDDY" ON MIKE'S SPEAKERPHONE. I WANNA SOB. BRING HIM BACK, EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR ONE EPISODE. I WANNA SEE HARVEY'S REACTION.  #Suits #SuitsUSA #Marvey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harvey hugging Louis because he announced he was going to be a father was really nice. I'm glad they've become good friends to some extent. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Gretchen &amp; Louis' friendship. She's there for him when he needs it, not as a co-worker, as a genuine friend. Their hug was nice to see. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never be used to hearing them say 'Fuck' on Suits, I'm used to 'Shit' seeing as they used to say that all the time, but hearing them say Fuck is just a whole different thing. 😂 #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainHanne I know, but it's still cute as heck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samantha &amp; Donna make a good team, but also them jokingly flirting with each other. 😂 #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Louis can be an absolute pain in the ass but, I hope he gets a happy ending. #Suits #SuitsUSA #LouisLitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSS. THIS WAS IN MY UTUBE RECOMMENDED LEGIT A FEW DAYS AGO AND I FREAKED BECAUSE IT WAS SO CUTE. TALENTED BROTHERSSSSSSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harvey telling Louis he fantasizes about Tomatoes as a joke had me rolling with laughter, oh my god. THEN FREAKING HARVEY BEING LIKE "We both know it's strawberries and whipped cream." TO DONNA. HERKJFNERKJFWEN. "That was 13 years ago." #Darvey #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Louis: "I had a gun pointed to the back of my head!" Harvey: "Louis, buddy. It's okay. You're okay."  Okay, this moment needs to be talked about more. Louis crying in front of Harvey and Harvey being a genuine friend, and just being there for Louis. It was so sweet. #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so sad that Louis got mugged. 💔 #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was really sweet when Harvey saw the janitor crying in the bathroom and handed her a tissue and said "For what it's worth, I hope everything's okay.", that was so nice of him. #Suits #SuitsUSA #HarveySpecter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do - It's all any of us should.  So no matter what, I promise you. If you need us - If you need me - I'll be there."  - Steve Rogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but... I can see now that I was really sparing myself. And I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand.  I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My faith's in... people, I guess. Individuals. And, I'm happy to say that for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't.  I know I hurt you, Tony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Tony,  I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours - maybe more so than mine.  I've been on my own since I was eighteen. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread of Steve's letter to Tony. It has much deeper meaning now that #InfinityWar has happened and #Endgame is on it's way. Plus, it's just... really meaningful and sweet.  #TheAvengers #Avengers #TonyStark #SteveRogers #IronMan #CaptainAmerica #ChrisEvans #RobertDowneyJR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this interview 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If they bring back Mike in season 9 because Harvey’s calling him and telling him all the details like a school girl I’ll scream with happiness. Mike was the sailor of the #Darvey ship, he deserves to know it’s sailed. He’ll probably throw a party. 😂 #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet Mike Ross is having a bloody party right now. Harvey calls him and says him and Donna kissed and you can just hear Mike and Rachel cheering in the background. I can imagine it. #Suits #SuitsUSA #Darvey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just finished watching @GiftedtheMovie and absolutely ADORED it. I'm late to the party, but better late than never. 1000% recommend, was absolutely adorable and so well made, such good acting. We need more films of #ChrisEvans in roles like this. I loved it. 😊❤@ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I finished my #CarolineForbes &amp; #SteveRogers cross-over video and may have sobbed at one moment in it. I'm proud of myself, really enjoyed making it. #CaptainAmerica #TVD #VampireDiaries #TheVampireDiaries #CandiceKing #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People need to talk about #CandiceKing's acting more in that scene in #TheVampireDiaries where Caroline finds out her mother's dying and she's running into the hospital in slow-motion and looks so distraught and it's just so powerful. Just amazing acting. #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OH NO. LMAO. I've been watching #ChrisEvans stuff that long that I'm starting to do that left-pec grab thing he does when he laughs. It's the CUTEST thing ever, but now I'm doing it without realising. Oh my god. 😂 #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the cutest damn thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this Nebula's hand on Steve's shoulder? Natasha's hand on Steve's shoulder?

<|startoftext|>This is not okay. Chris Evans' performance as Captain America was absolutely phenomenal. He was the perfect man for the role.

<|startoftext|>I LOVE all of the #Avengers reactions to #Vision just casually picking up Thor's hammer with ease. Then Steve, Thor &amp; Tony just start debating it at the end of the film about elevators. Hilarious. 😂 #AvengersAgeOfUltron #TonyStark #SteveRogers #Thor #CaptainAmerica #IronMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve Rogers saying he's not sure if he wants a family or a 'normal life' anymore is heartbreaking. #CaptainAmerica #SteveRogers #Avengers #AvengersAgeOfUltron #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love that everyone's making fun of #SteveRogers because he said "Language" at the beginning of #AvengersAgeOfUltron. They're just like "He doesn't like that kind of language." LMAOO. Love these guys. 😂 #CaptainAmerica #Avengers #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IronMan just punching the heck out of #Hulk saying "Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep." LMAOOO. I'm laughing so hard. #TonyStark #BruceBanner #Avengers #AvengersAgeOfUltron<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lovewesIey ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THANK GOD. I WAS SO ANGRY THEY WERE REMOVING IT. BUT IT'S STAYIN IN THE UK. THANKYOU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about Thor's face when he sees his hammer move when Captain America tries to lift it. He looks genuinely worried for a moment. 😂 #ChrisEvans #ChrisHemsworth #Thor #CaptainAmerica #Avengers #TheAvengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuriVictorgirl3 I haven’t seen that one. I’ve seen What’s your number, London, The Losers, and Not another teen movie. And the avengers films and stuff of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovewesIey Hospitable. Dependable. Protective. Generous. Caring. Mysterious. Addict in recovery. Loyal. Family-Orientated.  There’s so many. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuriVictorgirl3 Yes! I watched that the other day, was great. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McKenna Grace Hugs Chris Evans -- #GiftedMovie  https://t.co/AftL902ceu This is the cutest thing I’ve seen in my life. It’s like he adopted her without knowing. Love their chemistry. He’ll be a fantastic father one day. 😊❤️ #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netflix is removing #TheVampireDiaries and I wanna riot. 😡 #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I am groot.” “I am Steve Rogers.”  I love that that scene/moment was improvised by Chris Evans so much. 😂  #Groot #SteveRogers #CaptainAmerica #ChrisEvans #InfinityWar #Avengers #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just remembered Chris Evans isn't going to be doing Captain America in films anymore and I wanna protest. #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica #InfinityWar #Avengers #AvengersEndgame #Endgame #SteveRogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind, I found a name I wanna use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God dammit I can't think of any good unique female names, or just good names in general for a female that isn't basic asf. Agggggggh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO. I just watched a #ChrisEvans interview where the interviewer asked him if he wants to be a dad one day and Chris replied "Chris does wanna be a daddy." and the comments on it are just "I VOLUENTEER!" and talking about how he said Daddy. 😂 He'd be an adorable father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, I just love that #ChrisEvans is a HUGE #Disney fan. How can you note adore him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I absolutely ADORE his character in this film. He played it so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I looked up Chris Evans and photoshoot in the same sentance. Bad idea. Drool everywhere. #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they needed a better ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know how #ChrisPratt’s sons favourite superhero is #CaptainAmerica? I wonder like, if #ChrisEvans ever had a child what if their favourite superhero is #Starlord? 😂😂 @prattprattpratt @ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is no-one gonna talk about how Edward and Emmett literally flip each other off after they both try and catch Carlisle’s hit but end up slamming into each other?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, I need to go to bed. It's 3:17am and I have plans tomorrow yet here I am watching #ChrisEvans films and falling in love with him. GOODNIGHT EVERYONE. 😂 #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hands down Chris Evans would be a fantastic father one day. How is he single? Like, damn. 😂😍 Plus, you get to say Captain America is your freakin' dad. #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I just watched #ChrisEvans in "London" and all I'm gonna say is... some of those scenes... damn. 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Natasha &amp; Steve betta kiss in #AvengersEndgame just saying. Well, I hope. Please.  #CaptainAmerica #BlackWidow #NatashaRomanoff #SteveRogers #Romanogers #Avengers #InfinityWar #TheAvengers  https://t.co/yXAUaRMAqh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NATASHA ROMANOFF AND STEVE ROGERS SHOULD BE IN A RELATIONSHIP DAMMIT. #CaptainAmerica #ScarlettJohansson #ChrisEvans #CaptainAmerica #BlackWidow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I actually really like the scene where Steve Rogers &amp; Natasha Romanoff are acting like a 'couple', like they were straight up cute together. And that kiss... 🔥 "You still uncomfortable?" "Not exactly the word I'd use."  😂  #CaptainAmerica #ChrisEvans #ScarlettJohansson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gonna sound weird as hell but #ChrisEvans looks like he has good kissable lips. Just thought I'd put that out there. #CaptainAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanDechart Hugs to everyone. I love you all. It's good to take a break from things from time to time. Don't feel forced to stream all the time. We love you and Amelia!! Do what you feels right and when you want to do it. ❤  https://t.co/4kkbJnISar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't watch #Supernatural, never have. I've considered it but also cba catching up on all the seasons tbh. BUT, I have to admit Jensen Ackles is one fine piece of a person... Like damn... 😂 #JensenAckles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I just saw a cross-over video someone had made and they paired Caroline Forbes (Candice King) with a Steve Rogers (Captain America, aka Chris Evans) character and it was great. Like, they actually seem to suit each other. I'm really into it. 😂#CandiceKing #ChrisEvans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In conclusion; #TheVampireDiaries &amp; #TheOriginals should've done more decade dance parties and I should've gotten an invite. I can't dance, but that stuff was such AESTHETIC and I would've loved just being in that atmosphere like you've time-travelled. 😂 #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Vampire Diaries 3x20  ** Best Scene [#1] ** | Elena &amp; Stefan Dance |...  https://t.co/59O0bZ2t4Q I loved this scene tbh, where they're both just doing the twist. 😂 #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries #Stelena<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish we got more party scenes in #TheVampireDiaries &amp; #TheOriginals. Not like clubbing ones, but like the old fashioned ones like the one where it showed Rebekah, Stefan &amp; Klaus meeting for the first time in 1920's and ppl were doing the twist n stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, I wish people still had parties like they did back in the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, &amp; 90's. Music back then was brilliant for having a boogie too and seemed much more lively and stuff. Wasn't just songs about sex and body parts. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly didn't have faith that he'd be able to keep this going. But he's got a whole year to go so we'll see.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ There's a lot of tutorial videos on YouTube you could learn from and watch, that's how I learnt on top of teaching myself just randomly because I enjoyed doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I decided to go on a walk, got lost and ended up walking like 4.8 miles with a very heavy metal thing carried on my shoulder because at the time it was easier to carry it like that. But now I just have regrets. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my favourite Alaric Saltzman quotes: "The strange thing is... Losing those people is what brought us together. It's how we found each other. It's what made us... Family." #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries #TVDForever #AlaricSaltzman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no I just finished editing a #TheVampireDiaries &amp; #TheOriginals video. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duskydyl Is that Brien O’Dylan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Pahahahah! Omg. 😂 It was just a random thought that came into my head that I had to share. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Sorry not sorry! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fuck off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my #Spotify playlist decided to play "Never say never" by the Fray and all I can see in my head is Stefan leaving Elena &amp; reuniting with Lexi in the afterlife and I wanna SOB BECAUSE I MISS HIM SM. #TheFray #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries #PaulWesley #StefanSalvatore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I dare make a #Klaroline video even tho I already have but that one was a sad one (and unpublished) but then again this other one I wanna make is also a sad one. 😫😂 #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, I can imagine Hayley appearing in the afterlife and Jackson's like "YES!" and he's happy coz the afterlife is peaceful and without The Mikaelson's bringing trouble and then like few days later Elijah and Klaus turn up and he's like "Fk sake." 😂  #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally sounds like something I'd do. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Through thick and thin, Rebekah, Klaus, and Elijah stood by one another for an eternity. Yes, they scrapped, they had their fights, their ups and downs. But in the end they always put family first, their love for each other and their family was immense. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay so yesterday I went on a walk but they'd changed the path and I got lost and I ended up walking 4.8 MILES, whilst carrying a metal scooter on my shoulder! I eventually got home, my back hurt, arms hurt, shoulders hurt, and now today, I can barely move and im bruised. FUN. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That moment when Caroline's holding Stefan on her lap, screaming for help and "RAIGN - Don't let me down" start's playing is such a powerful moment.

<|startoftext|>Alex: “There was an earthquake. Did they say what magnitude it was?” Joel: “5.1” Alex: “We can do better than that...” Joel: “😵😏😍😘”  That moment was hilarious. 😂 #SavingHope #DanielGillies #Jolex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they don’t just make Fiona end up in jail like they did with Ian on #ShamelessUSA. I hope Jimmy/Steve comes to bail her out or something. Can’t just end with all the Gallagher’s in jail. That’d be boring. #Shameless #ShamelessUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Idk what to do and I’m having an existential crisis over it. Fun fun fun fun. Thanks anxiety. I’ve spoken to him about my anxiety and told him it’s like... really bad. He has anxiety too, but it’s just.. zkenebejjwnsjakene complicated. I just needed to rant. LMAO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like him a lot and I could see it going somewhere but I’ve never done this before and when I come remotely close to saying yes my anxiety is like NOPE. I wish I could just chop it off my freakin body and dispose of it. It’s so damn annoying. Stops me from doing so many things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, I can’t even pluck up the courage to call him over the phone because I have phone anxiety and I just don’t understand how he still asks me and still likes me after me being so full of anxiety and stuff. My past bad relationships have messed with my brain and I hate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like him a lot don’t get me wrong. I live like a 10min drive from him and he’s nice, funny, etc. But dating is a new thing for me and I haven’t met him before. We’ve been talking since December though and I’ve seen his face before obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same guy has asked me on a date to see the new how to train your dragon movie about four times now and I don’t think he understands how bad my social anxiety is. I want to go with him to see it so bad, but my anxiety is just not letting me. Idk why.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>H: "Y'kno, we could be happy out here. But you might stand out in ur suit." E: "Well, I was thinkin jeans, shorts, and flipflops." H: "I want to build a life with u, Elijah. With Hope. I want us to be happy." E: "So we do that. Together. In Jean shorts."  #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was willing to drop everything and start a fresh new life with Hayley &amp; Hope on the bayou. He even said he'd do it in jeans, shorts &amp; flipflops.  Hayley: "I want to build a life with you, Elijah. With Hope." Elijah: "So we do that. Together. In jean shorts."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Totally forgot it's Valentine's Day tomorrow, but it's okay because I'm spending it alone. Happy early Valentines Day to everyone who's celebrating it with people they love though! Hope you have a fantastic day. #HappyValentinesDay #ValentinesDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like Coach knew that they were werewolves and stuff all along tbh. I mean, especially in the final season considering he legit saved Jackson and Ethan by smacking a dude with a lacrosse stick. 😂 I wish we found out who the iconic Greenberg is though. #TeenWolf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do ya think Clem's gonna take AJ, Louis, Violet, and the rest of their squad back to Richmond to see Javi and the gang again? I hope she does to be honest, it'd be nice if they could all just live out their days there or something. #TheWalkingDeadGame #WalkingDeadGame #Skybound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*retweets for days*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I watch #ChrisEvans interviews the more I fall in love with his personality. Not to mention interviews with him and #ChrisPratt in them. Ooft. Save me. Their comedy bounces off each other so well, they're both equally as goofy. I love it. Easy on the eyes too. 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>brb sobbing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the end it's a fucking tv show and you can ship whoever you want as long as it's fking legal. It's all fun and games in the end, they're literally made up characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd understand if the ship is illegal in someway because thats just downright wrong, but seeing people argue over two ships because they think one is superior and the other isn't is ridic. Like, some people legit telling other's to off themselves because they don't ship a couple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, stop causing wars just because someone doesn't ship the same couple as you. In the end, it's a TV show/Movie, people can ship whoever the f*ck they want. I'm legit sick of people hating on others because they ship a different couple from the same show, like bruh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop rubbing it in 💔😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One can only hope she’s telling the truth this time. Last time she said she was seeing a doctor she came back and said the doctor said she was “fine” and got 10x worse. So, hopefully we see some changes for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My anxiety is fucking annoying. Waking me up at 4am and making me worry outta my mind because I don’t have any proof of my address to open a bank account yet. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cohanspolaroid I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces and I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Chatman I mean, I kinda knew it was fake anyways. I was just second guessing myself to make sure I'd heard it right.👌🏻You're right though, the amount of stuff people make up and then others believe is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope this rumour going around of Danielle wanting to kiss Joseph is fake. Because.... no. #TheOriginals #JosephMorgan #DanielleRoseRussell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a thread of #ElijahMikaelson being a cute/adorable Uncle to #HopeMikaelson because he legit just is adorable. Plus, it's #DanielGillies with kids. AAAK. #TheOriginals #Holijah ~  https://t.co/ysexFqVtvz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whenever Hayley and Klaus were busy, he'd look after Hope and tend to her needs just because he wanted to and because he wanted to spend time with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He always holds her close, making sure she's safe and secure and gives her kisses on her forehead, which is... beyond adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He buys Hope her first bike for Christmas with a giant red glittery ribbon on it with a label that says "To: Hope. From: Elijah".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He lets Hope bend the rules of her magic just one time so she could damage the car of the bullies that were bullying her friend at the Mystic Grill bar and they both swear not to tell Klaus of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was willing to kill his own brother to protect Hope from danger and harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah believes that Hope was the key to Klaus' redemption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's fighting the enemies in New Orleans to make it a home suitable for Hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's so protective of her. He would literally give up his life for her in a heart beat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah accepted who she was long before Klaus and Hayley did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope means everything to him, she's all that matters.  "Hope. Hope is all that matters."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He believes that Hope made the family whole again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did NOT want Hope to have the same burden as the Mikaelson family. He wanted her to have new things, he didn't want her to be followed around by their old enemies. He wanted her to have a normal life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He says that Hope is worth EVERYTHING.  "We are a thousand years of emptiness, an endless parade of slaughter. Until your daughter came to us. Now she's everything, Niklaus, worth every fight, worth every sacrifice. She must not suffer the same fate."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he was in the woods organizing food and had Hope in a stroller and some hunters came up and started a fight with him, he turned Hope's stroller away from the fight so she didn't have to watch. He didn't want her to witness the violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He promised her that nothing would ever happen to her.  "We will not allow anything to happen to you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He promised Klaus he'd be there for her at all times, and although he promised it, he did it anyway because he wanted to. He'd do whatever it takes to keep her safe, and he was there for her when she needed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he held Hope after not seeing her in a long time the first thing he said was: "Look at you, so perfect."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He would literally do ANYTHING to save Hope from being hurt or taken away from him and his family. And I mean literally anything. He wouldn't stop until she was safe.  "I'll violate everything sacred under the sun in the name of rescuing my niece."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing he was focusing on and the only thing he cared about was Hope and her safety.  "My only focus right now is that child and her safety."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Hayley gives birth and Hope get's taken away, Elijah arrives minutes after and Klaus says "They took the baby", Elijah was heart-broken and was stopping at nothing to get her back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He told Klaus he'd stay in New Orleans with him to literally build a home with his family so that Klaus could stay there and save his child from trouble and raise her there with all her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He said that family is power, confirming that Hope is power to all of them. Helping them become better versions of themselves.  Klaus: "What will this child guarantee me? Will it guarantee me power?" Elijah: "Family is power, Niklaus."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He let Hope drive his *Expensive* Bentley when she'd only learnt how to drive in a truck briefly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He literally called her "so perfect" when he first laid eyes on her after not seeing her in a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was jealous of Rebekah when she got to spend every day with Hope on the run when she was helping keep Hope out of New Orleans.  "I can't imagine the joy of spending every day with her."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He vowed to keep Hope safe at all times, literally saying it was his job.  "My job, is to keep her safe."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He literally gave Hope Mikaelson her name. When he thought Hayley had died, he said that the Mikaelson family had lost their only Hope because she was about to bring a child into their lives that'd change their entire family forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A thread of #ElijahMikaelson being a cute Uncle in general, but also why he was a great one to #HopeMikaelson in #TheOriginals. Because he was indeed, a fantastic uncle to Hope regardless of what everyone says.  #DanielGillies #SummerFontana #DanielleRoseRussell  https://t.co/wqJohUdUVQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YuriVictorgirl3 He's legit amazing, I don't see how people are saying he's got no talent. You're right, they probably wouldn't know good talent if it was labelled in front of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I just found this and I literally squealed at how adorable this is. Like, just look at how freakin' cute. Sksksksksskkssk.  #TheOriginals #JosephMorgan #KlausMikaelson #SummerFontana #HopeMikaelson #Klope  https://t.co/XryBbMLeYK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TheOriginals has made me wanna go to the New Orleans French Quarter and just dance my booty off with the Mikaelsons. The vibe, the music, the atmosphere, the people, not to mention... THE Mikaelsons. 😂 #NOLA #NewOrleans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I could go to things like #TVDNash/#TVDNashville just to get a chance to say thankyou and goodbye to everyone. 💔😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timberswesley Literally though, omg. 😂 I love Dobsley’s love for each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤤😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💔😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh I need this panic room, but then I’d panic more because I’m claustrophobic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NinaDobrev dislocated her shoulder in her snowboarding accident. Damn. I hope she’s okay. It doesn’t seem like she’s in pain which is good. She’s still hosting!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok it’s 3am, I’m done with Twitter for tonight. I’m done with people who aren’t respecting #PaulWesley’s private life. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuriVictorgirl3 Not to mention he’s going to a convention soon which means people are gonna wanna start asking him there and it’s going to be awkward as hell. I don’t blame him if he cancels to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuriVictorgirl3 The fact of the matter is, he didn’t announce this. A news article did. This should be news that HE announces, and then people call themselves his “fans” yet say disgusting stuff like this and I bet he’s being bombarded with questions about it everywhere. So disrespectful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t 👏🏻 ask 👏🏻 Paul 👏🏻 Wesley 👏🏻 about 👏🏻 his 👏🏻 “marriage” 👏🏻 or 👏🏻 personal 👏🏻 life 👏🏻 he 👏🏻 will 👏🏻 address 👏🏻 it 👏🏻 if 👏🏻 he 👏🏻 wants 👏🏻 to.  #PaulWesley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s disgusting to see people comment on this #PaulWesley situation saying shit like “Ew, it’s not Nina. I hate her, hope it’s not true.” Or “Where’s Phoebe? She’s better than Ines, lmao.” Like, shut the fuck up and respect Paul’s life, and you call yourself his fans? No, honey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwesley, I love you, and I hope you’re enjoying life and spending your time doing things you enjoy. Sending good vibes your way. Because you of all people deserve it, you’re so talented and genuine, we don’t deserve someone like you. 😊❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly can’t imagine how disrespected #PaulWesley &amp; Ines are feeling now. Please don’t ask him about it at his next con. If he wants to address the situation, he will. For now, send him love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, please don’t ask #PaulWesley about his personal life and marriage at this upcoming con. If he wants to talk about it, he will. But for now, it’s meant to be private and personal between him and Ines. Please, just send him love. He doesn’t deserve this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>E!News just out here exposing Nina and Paul. Jeez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don’t ask #PaulWesley about his romantic life/marriage at the con he’s going to soon. I honestly don’t blame him if he cancels, all this should’ve been announced from him and Ines alone. Not a news article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true I’m beyond happy for them both. ❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Paul and Ines really did get married then I’m beyond happy for them both! ❤️😊 #PaulWesley<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Went and complimented Peter Capaldi's acting in Lewis Capaldi's new music video "Someone You Loved" and well, Lewis replied. Didn't expect that. I highly suggest you go watch the video though. It's SO lovely. #PeterCapaldi #LewisCapaldi #SomeoneYouloved  https://t.co/VWLzLw9pK3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candicesjoseph I have read some, they're what keep me going through life. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kenny would raise hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candicesjoseph Omg it's legit everywhere and they always say the same shit about it. 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of times I've seen a #VidCon London advert on my TV now is insane. It's like every 15 mins. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy oh boy I miss them all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I see one more promo on my timeline I s2g. "My boyfriend bought me this necklace that when u zoom in on it the text says I love you in different languages. FYI, he got it from here: insert link"  NO HE DIDN'T. OKAY??? shhhhHHHH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elliot_gonzalez  https://t.co/IDVAtbyZ17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close yet so far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BUT AFTER ALL THIS TIMEEEE, I'M STILL INTO UUUUU.  Jokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ True true, and they did split sometimes so maybe some of them spent times in other places more than others. Honestly, who knows at this rate. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched Lewis Capaldi's new music video that features Peter Capaldi and cried my eyes out. I 100% recommend watching it. It's so sweet, and Peter's acting in it is absolutely fantastic and it's all just so lovely. #PeterCapaldi #LewisCapaldi #SomeoneYouLoved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Pahaha, it is strange to think about but again it is possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter Capaldi, THE Peter Capaldi is in a music video for Lewis Capaldi. Oh my gosh. DKJEFN I love this. #PeterCapaldi #LewisCapaldi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO WAY. I miss this man!! I've gotta watch this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ @loolurnotwesley 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I completely agree, I’m glad Daniel decided to speak up about it. That’s one of the reasons why so many people refuse to watch Legacies amongst so many other reasons. The actors, they’re fine, brilliant, it’s just Julie that’s the problem, treating them badly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Yeah, Daniel especially has been brutally honest about his feelings towards the show and how it ended and how they were all treated, and I’m glad he is to be honest, none of them deserved it. A sweet message like that from Klaus would be lovely though. 😊❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I do have a feeling they’re gonna end legacies like TVD &amp; The Originals to be honest because as we’ve seen Julie likes “heroic endings”, and messing with our feelings. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Agreed! Just a simple message would do me fine, from Hayley, Klaus, Elijah, anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ It’s everywhere on my timeline, can’t miss it! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Yeah same, even if we don’t get a vision of them in the afterlife together enjoying life, I just wanna know they’re okay. Coz I doubt any of them will return to film scenes for legacies tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I don’t watch Legacies either to be honest. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ There’s no clues at how old she is or where she’s living or what school she goes to at all to be honest. I’m wondering because of the fact they mentioned her whether she’ll appear or something? Who knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I agree. It’s annoying too because they keep using Klaus to bait viewers into watching and stuff, but there’s legit no mentions of Elijah or Hayley, or any other Mikaelson‘s in that case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ Infact, Josie said "kids", so they probably have two, but one of them is indeed confirmed to be called Stefanie Salvatore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ But Damon &amp; Elena do have a kid called Stefanie in the real world which is mentioned by Josie Saltzman, which is obviously in tribute to Stefan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IT'S THE MASTER AND MISSY AND BILL IS A FREAKIN' CYBERMAN. IM SCREAMING. THE MASTER, THE MASTER, IT'S THE FEAKIN' MASTER. #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Doctor talking about Missy: "She was my man crush." LMAOOO. That's Doctor Who for you. 😂 #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missy is dabbing and saying The Doctor's real name is Doctor Who. I can't cope. 😂 #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently in Legacies: #Delena is married w/ kids of their own, one of them being Stefanie Salvatore named after Stefan Salvatore (Which I called before #Legacies even did it tbh.) #Klaroline are married in an alternate universe &amp; in Paris together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Mikaelson is a 1000+ year old Original Hybrid and refuses to drink his tea without biscuits. You can tell he's British. 😂  E: ❝Niklaus, is there something you wish to contribute?❞  K: ❝I prefer biscuits with my tea.❞  #TheOriginals #KlausMikaelson #JosephMorgan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I FUCKING CALLED IT. I KNEW IT. I KNEW DAMON AND ELENA WOULD CALL THEIR DAUGHTER STEPHANIE OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES IN TRIBUTE TO STEFAN SALVATORE. I FUFEKRNFEJRFNEKJ KNEW IT. #TheVampireDiaries  #TVD #VampireDiaries #Legacies #Delena #Stelena #StefanSalvatore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I genuinely think there was some sort of feeling between Derek &amp; Stiles. They both cared for each other deeply. You can't deny that with all the legit evidence of them saving each other, Stiles being Derek's anchor, Stiles getting Derek to help Scott, etc. #TeenWolf #Sterek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klausbieberr LMAO!!! What?! 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop bringing Klaus back up. 😩💔 And if you’re gonna use him, you’ve gotta use Elijah too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is now allowed wtf! No! Turn back time. 😭 #RIPMrOreo 💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This may sound weird but, I would've really liked to have seen Klaus' reaction to Stefan's death. Regardless of how much of an ass he was to everyone, deep down he obviously thought of Stefan as a friend. Same with Elijah. It would've been interesting to see. #TheVampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dantdm Quite the news title you've earned. 😂  https://t.co/DVkNCr0NS2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They need to bring back Jenny. What the heck happened to her? She's still alive somewhere, surely The Doctor's heard of her over these billions and billions of bloody years? Bring her back &amp; Captain Jack Harkness. #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DoctorWho S9E6 I legitimately get so giddy every single time Capaldi references Tennant and showed that scene where Donna begs him to save one person and he saves the person in which he took his face from. AAAAAAAHHHH! I miss Ten so much. #PeterCapaldi #DavidTennant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but I actually kinda like the idea of Lucien Castle &amp; Freya Mikaelson. Idk why. Like, when he wasn't being a psychopath and that deleted scene where he brings her a boquet of flowers and puts one behind her ear. It was cute asf. #TheOriginals #Frucien #Frecien #Luceya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BIG MOOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd say Dylan O'Brien but I'd want him to be Spider-Man more than Batman.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YouTuber’s parents must get proper confused when their kid starts asking for lights and a camera for their bedroom. Probably think their kids about to shoot some porn. #YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling if I ever met #DavidTennant I’d pass out from anxiousness but also sheer excitement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @jtimberlake, hope you’ve had/have a great day!! 😊❤️ #HappyBirthdayJustinTimberlake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I could go to #TheVampireDiaries/#TheOriginals ending tour thing. I just wanna say goodbye to all the cast/crew/everyone and thank them for such an amazing series that's impacted so many of our lives. Sucks that I live in UK, and I'm broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't hear the song "be still" normally anymore without thinking of Alaric Saltzman's death in #TheVampireDiaries and my heart breaks all over a-freaking-gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To this day #TheVampireDiaries finale breaks my damn heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe they made Stefan sit through Elena's entire "ILY" speech to Damon in season 4 and when it showed Stefan's face he looked BEYOND heart-broken, and Lexi placed her hand on his shoulder to comfort him. I felt so bad for him. 😫💔 #Stelena #Delena #TheVampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me weird but the line down someone's back is incredibly attractive to me and I don't know why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saying... Finnick deserved better. #HungerGames #TheHungerGames #SamClaflin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knowing Korsh he'll end the final season of #Suits/#SuitsUSA with #Darvey finally getting together, but he'll either cut it short, or they'll be interrupted by someone/something. Or, he'll simply just end it by the door closing like he did on the whipped cream scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how now that #Suits/#SuitsUSA is on it's final season Korsh will probably make #Darvey happen because he knows people will wait until the very final episode to see what they've been waiting for, which is Darvey finally happening. We've literally been waiting years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks good. Too good. Lovin' the short hair on him. But damn Paul. 😍 #PaulWesley  https://t.co/ef2qbxPwBQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>yes. always. yes. 100% yes. Joel Goran. Come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been making a lot of tear-jerker videos lately that have been making me feel emotional asf.

<|startoftext|>You've gotta admit tho whether you're a #Klaroline shipper or not their make-out scene in the woods was hawt. Like, Klaus couldn't stop smiling. 🔥#TheOriginals #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Right, I get that you're a #Darvey shipper and all, and you want Harvey &amp; Donna together. But, sending hate to the actor of Donna's new partner and shit just BECAUSE of that is out of order. #Suits #SuitsUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder for myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PaulWesley changed his icon to a picture of him snowboarding. It matches his blue theme on his twitter page. It also doesn't have his face in. But, I'm still proud. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I genuinely think that Jimmy/Steve is gonna make a return to #Shameless for Fiona. With the direction she's currently going in... aka, turning into Frank 2.0. I feel like he's gona come back and she's gonna leave with him. They're made for each other. #ShamelessUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is petty asf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I just say that @JosephMorgan &amp; @danieljgillies were the absolute PERFECT picks for Klaus &amp; Elijah Mikaelson. They were legitimately born for those roles and played them so perfectly whilst also making them their own. So proud of them, and so happy to be a fan. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, someone give me #SapphirePlugins for #SonyVegas coz I wanna step up my editing game but I'm also hella poor. 😫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was it ever actually confirmed whether Christia is dead or not?? What if Clementine ends up somehow reuniting with Christa after all this time? #TWDGame #WalkingDeadGame #TheWalkingDeadGame #Telltale #Skybound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi, I miss Lee, Clementine, Kenny, Christa &amp; Omid. I basically just miss everyone that died in the game. That's the tweet.  #TWD #WalkingDead #TheWalkingDead #WalkingDeadGame #TheWalkingDeadGame #Skybound #Telltale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Clementine will reunite with Javi and that gang? I mean... they said she was always welcome back. Maybe she'll take her new friends to them? 🤔#Skybound #SkyboundWalkingDead #TheWalkingDead #TWD #WalkingDead #WalkingDeadGame #TheWalkingDeadGame #Clementine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He played such a fantastic war doctor. Forever missed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul’s laugh in the background snjsjdjsjdjejje<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday @GabrielMacht, hope you have a fantastic day however you decide to spend it. ❤️ #HappyBirthdayGabrielMacht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only tell someone you love them if you 100% mean it. It's scary, yes. But, if you say it without genuinely meaning it. You could break their heart more than you know. But also, don't rush it. Never rush it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ok this face is cute ngl tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone on my timeline freaking out about the #Dobsley reunion and rightly so. I'm with ya. 😂#PaulWesley #NinaDobrev<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Clementine &amp; Louis, just sayin' But, I also love Clementine &amp; Violet. But, if I had to choose... I'd probably pick Louis. (In my own playthrough). #TheWalkingDead #Skybound #Clementine #SkyboundWalkingDead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HIIIIGHWAYYY TOOO THE DANGER ZONNNEEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I adore Elijah. He’s just so awesome. Daniel Gillies definitely made him his own, I couldn’t imagine anyone else for the role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"As a devout feminist, I refuse to say you hit like a girl." - Elijah Mikaelson.  That line was ICONIC, not gonna lie. When he's teaching Gia to fight. #ElijahMikaelson #DanielGillies #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ @TheFaultMovie I recommend it, but definitely bring tissues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched #TheFaultInOurStars for the first time and I hate this film for making me sob like a damn baby but the story was also so beautiful. God, I'm heartbroken... I'm legit in tears. kjernfekrjgnerkgn So beautifully done though. @TheFaultMovie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m not sure how I’ll feel if Clementine’s story ends like Lee’s. But, I’m also not sure how I’ll feel if it’s just Clementine still living out her life in the apocalypse with AJ. I don’t know what ending I want for her. I just want her happy. #Skybound #TheWalkingDead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>jesus christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually needed this tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm so proud of you." God, Klaus watching Hope transition and being so proud of her. The smile on his face when he sees her turn into a wolf. #Klope #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus and Elijah fighting in the Salvatore house like olden times. "You will get them to put it into me instead and kill me." God, Elijah really does love Hope regardless of how much she hated him after Hayley's death. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You weren't the villain of my story." KLAUS WANTED TO KISS CAROLINE SO BAD IN THAT MOMENT. And Caroline looked genuinely sad when she turned back to him for a moment. #Klaroline #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus watching his daughter dance with Landon is ADORABLE. He looks so proud of her and just happy she's living her life. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah legitimately encouraging Hope to go and dance and interact with Landon is adorable. And he's just like "Behave" to her. 😂 #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so adorable they showed Hayley at peace with Jackson, Mary, her parents, everyone they've lost. I just hope we got a scene with them all at peace. Klaus, Elijah, and Hayley. #Haylijah having their last dance together in peace. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwh, Hope and Klaus hugging so tightly and she's saying she doesn't wanna die and Klaus is just sobbing and holding onto her tightly just glad she's still alive. I wanna fucking sob my eyes out. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caroline letting Klaus wear some of Stefan's clothes. Oh my godddddddddddddddddddddddd. #TheOriginals #Steroline #Klaroline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You invited Voldemort to campus!" LMFAOOOO. Alaric comparing Klaus to Voldemort. 😂 #TheOriginals #Klaroline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah: "Do you know how to dirve?" Hope: "Mom and Declan taught me a little in the old truck." Elijah: "I think it's about time you drove a Bentley."  What a freakin' cool uncle. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget Elijah leaving Landon a $300 tip/payment because he knew he was being treated badly by bullies. Can you see why I love Elijah so much, yet? He cares. Even about people he doesn't know. #TheOriginals #ElijahMikaelson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caroline calling Klaus "Mr Mikaelson" and then Klaus talking to her twins and Alaric coming in and being like "Whatever the hell's going on, NO!" LMFAOOOOOO. I love him. That was hilarious. 😂#TheOriginals #Klaroline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landon calling Elijah "Mr Marshall" and Elijah looking so happy to be called the same last name as Hayley. #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Niklaus wanted me to run away with him, but I told him I would never leave Rebekah and Kol to the hands of Mikael." Elijah to Hope, he's so sweet. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>god, his smile... I miss him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe they mentioned the #Klaroline hook-up when Klaus said he'd never return to Mystic Falls and then mentioned Stefan's diaries. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Excuse me, I just need one minute with this very lost new janitor. Come on, Bob. I'll show you the toilets." Caroline to Klaus. 😂 #TheOriginals #Klaroline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus and Elijah stopping at NOTHING to save Hope. God, Elijah would've made a fantastic father too. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus being amused by how Hope was slightly buzzed after Freya and Keelin's wedding was adorable as heck. And then looking so so SO happy when she finally says that she wants him to be with her when she transitions into a wolf. God, I love Klaus as a dad. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shitt..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus looked like he was genuinely about to have a panic attack when Rebekah told him that there was days, weeks, maybe hours left of Hope's life after he'd gotten Freya her dream wedding venue. Poor Klaus, he looked so broken in that very moment. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, I hope #PrincePhilip’s okay. 😳  https://t.co/aRGZNuucMF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beyond adorable that Freya wanted Elijah to walk her down the isle and then it ended up being Elijah AND Klaus walking her down the isle together because they knew how much she wanted to marry Keelin. Everyone needed that wedding down time. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I don't work for buzzfeed anymore, I don't have to be nice." - Eugene, from The Try Guys. 😂 #TheTryGuys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that people are getting mad because people are hyped to see #JakeGyllenhaal as #Mysterio in the new #SpiderManFarFromHome trailer saying that we're direspecting #TomHolland. Then they come at u saying "Jake can't act." Sorry... what? LMFAO. #Spiderman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FinnHudson*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the nicest, caring, loving, dudes out there. I can't believe it's almost been 6 years without him here. I just WISH he knew how loved he was and that there's light at the end of the tunnel when you're struggling. #CoryMonteith #Glee #FinnHudson  https://t.co/GeXA2xfxr1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the last things that #CoryMonteith said on video before his death was "My life is complete." because people were saying "We're waiting on that wedding!" to him about him and Lea's wedding. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It breaks my heart every time knowing that scene in #Glee where #WillSchuester/#MatthewMorrison is clutching onto #FinnHoudson/#CoryMonteith's jacket and crying his eyes out and just yelling, it's not acting. It's real, raw, hurting, emotion from Matthew himself. 💔😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh shit I just remembered #MarkSalling is dead too.  #Glee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miss you, Cory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely heartbreaking when the director of #Glee said when they were filmin the tribute episode for #CoryMonteith they had to do everything in one take because people couldn't contain their emotions. They didn't have to act in that episode, it was all real, raw, emotions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget the moment where Caroline's sobbing her eyes out from heart-break and Enzo climbs into her car and makes her look at him and is legit angry at the fact that someone would make her cry like that and wants to kill them. #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ I agree, I miss them so damn much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I 100% forgot they're making an #Uncharted movie and #TomHolland is playing young #NathanDrake, and I'm so pumped. EEK. I think #ChrisPratt would be great for the role of older Nathan Drake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Wood Gives Us the Backstory on That Epic Kai-Damon Rain Kiss Video  https://t.co/q4U8yOQ2Bm Never forget this moment because it was freakin' hilarious. #TVD #VampireDiaries #TheVampireDiaries #ChrisWood #IanSomerhalder<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also, can we talk about how when Elijah sees Hayley in her wedding dress before she marries Jackson he literally looks at her like she's an angel and legitimately calls her perfect. He was so head over heels for her, regardless of how much he was hurting. #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else think its adorable that whenever Elijah put his hand on Hayleys face to either stroke it with his thumb, or just cup her face in general, she'd always lean in and close her eyes slightly like she was just so content and could stay there 4ever. #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but #PhoebeTonkin is actually gorgeous. Like, just flawless. She literally can't look "bad", ever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>EEEEEKKKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YourPsychoEx_ Pretty sure they're friends, even if they're not, they're civil and not fighting like everyone wants them to be. They have a son together, they took him trick-or-treating at Halloween with both of their significant others, so I'm pretty sure they're both fine w/ each other.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been one year since we lost Alan Rickman. That absolutely sucks. We miss you a lot Alan. Don’t forget to raise your wands in honour of him today. ✨⚡️  #RIPAlanRickman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Christ people #ChrisPratt is allowed to move on. He’s in a happy relationship with Katherine and wants to marry her. That’s entirely his choice and her choice. Not our choice. He’s happy, she’s happy. Let him move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvnishaLalan No? Because they didn’t reunite. Just some of them did for Nina’s birthday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuccccckkkkkk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how like the entirety of twitter was freaking out because #ChrisPratt’s “dad bod” was back and everyone wanted it to stay but it’s only temporary. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pearson Specter Litt Ross Paulsen 👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvnishaLalan What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ninachella looks lit. Nina sure knows how to throw a damn party. Woot! #HappyBirthdayNinaDobrev #NinaDobrev  https://t.co/A43fekoFwP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because #PaulWesley isn’t at #Ninachella doesn’t mean he doesn’t like Nina. Why would you even come up with that? I bet 1000% he had an invite. Newsflash, he’s an actor. He’s busy. He doesn’t HAVE to be there, we just wanted him 2 be bcoz it would’ve been a sweet reunion. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pessimsfit Same, I feel you. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several posts from #Ninachella. Haven’t seen #PaulWesley at all though. 😩 Either way, I hope Nina’s having a fantastic time. ❤️ #NinaDobrev #HappyBirthdayNinaDobrev  https://t.co/s3MmDlQDuj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like Fiona’s story is gonna end with Jimmy/Steve coming back. She was genuinely happy with him. They’ve both done crappy things, but in the end they’re a good match. He’s probably gonna take her away like he offered ages ago. #Shameless #ShamelessUSA #ShamelessUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be honest, I love #PrinceHarry way more than #PrinceWilliam. He’s so much easier to approach and relate to and is just an absolute pleasure. He’s always nice, always interacting with kids, just being himself. Plus, he’s with #MeghanMarkle and they’re adorable as heck. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7foreverlucky Yeah, he is in it. It’s good! It sucks that Netflix has removed it though. Idk if it’ll be on tv or something, but you should give it a watch whenever you can. Good film. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGurlFromOz81 Agggh that sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to watching #DanielGillies in #BrideAndPrejudice again and Netflix UK has removed it. Uuuugh. Stop removing the good thingsssss. 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>all. the. time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone give me the exact size of a #Twitter banner please for the love of god. I'm bored of googling it and getting about 2000 different answers. I just wanna edit my banner with a HD image is that too much to ask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is dope wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #BillieEllish is 17 years old and successful asf just puts into perspective how shite my life is right now. And I'm older than her. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2019 started off great. New @paulwesley photoshoot, and new photos of @danieljgillies. We love a photogenic married couple. 😂❤️  Seriously though, look... 😱🥰  #DanielGillies #PaulWesley #Stelijah #Paniel  https://t.co/RYavj8y4TT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS IS ADORABLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so happy that Josh got to be with Aiden again though. I HATE that he died. But I'm happy that he got his happiness. He deserved it. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree that after everything Vincent deserved a happy ending. He should've got a happy ending. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Vincent released all the Witches spirits so that Ivy could die in peace is just... something else. If that's not love, I don't know what is. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Klaus straight up was just gonna let Hope torture that dude. Like, he encouraged it and everything. Even gave her torturing advice. 😂 Like father, like daughter.  #Klope #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was SO adorable. Like, so adorable. Definitely one of my favourite moments between them. Just how he hugged her, stroking her hair, comforting her. He’s a good dad.  #Klope #TheOriginals #DanielleRussell #JosephMorgan #KlausMikaelson #HopeMikaelson  https://t.co/Xkdhj3pUmy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus saying he's going to be with Hope every step of the way, putting his arm around her, cuddling her in his side, and she asks if he can stay a little longer and he says of course and brushes her hair away. Was so damn adorable. I can't even. #Klope #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KEELIN AND FREYA ARE ADORABLE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY. IT'S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT.  #TheOriginals #Freelin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually really sweet that Elijah went to Declan to let him talk about his feelings and stuff about Hayley, regardless of them both hurting. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I HATE the fact that Hope was so rude towards Elijah. Blamed him for Hayley's death. It hurts even more at the fact that Elijah adored Hope since day one. Elijah DID NOT kill Hayley. For Christ sake. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about the fact that someone asked #DanielGillies if they could ruffle his hair and he actually got on his hands and knees off the edge of the stage and let this woman run her hands through his hair? LMFAOOO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Joseph is basically all of us with The Originals &amp; The Vampire Diaries. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else pissed by the fact that the kids on #CWLegacies/#Legacies call Stefan and Damon “Those brothers that owned our school.”? The disrespect. This school needs to properly teach the students about the legends before them that sacrificed everything. #TheVampireDiaries #TVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CBS on Instagram just reposted that #Dobsley reunion video where #PaulWesley meets #NinaDobrev when she’s filming “Fam” and they also posted this. Ugh. Dkeksjjdjeje look at him. 😍  https://t.co/c8FWJZULGl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Julz7913 This is so lovely. You're a precious person, and so is your brother. I'm tearing up at this post. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so adorable. Julia's post about Dylan. ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaLeigh_ @danieljgillies I 100% agree, their acting is absolutely fantastic!! It's always amazing when actors can make you feel something just with their faces, no words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just the sheer fact that he said "I'm sorry" with a fucking smiley face makes me wanna slap his fucking jaw off his face. I don't even know this dude and I'm so mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Share this around as much as possible, please.  This guy is an absolute creep and stalking on little girls. Absolutely disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at him. I genuinely forgot how to breathe for a minute. He's so damn gorgeous and talented and just a freaking amazing person. I'm so happy to be alive when he's alive. Can't wait to see more stuff from him. Just LOOK AT HIM. Legit speechless. 😍❤️  #PaulWesley  https://t.co/9q1s8i3W0l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daniel's acting when he remembers Hayley, when all that guilt comes flooding in, when he's crying out, yelling, heart-broken, shaking. God, I felt that. Daniel Gillies is SO talented, it's un-real. He played Elijah SO well. @danieljgillies #TheOriginals #DanielGillies #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He was there for me, when my rage got the better of me, setting me on a path to redemption. For a 1000 years, he made me need him. He was my greatest ally. He was the only one who could give me a chance of being worthy of Hope, he was my bestfriend." #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah gave Hope a teddy when she was born, oh my god. Elijah is the cutest freakin' uncle ever. Not to mention he gave Hope her damn name. HE'S SUCH A CUTE UNCLE. He really did adore Hope.  Hayley: "Katherine?" Klaus: "God no."  😂😂  #TheOriginals #ElijahMikaelson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You and I never really had much in common apart from our dashing good looks." - Kol to Elijah.  I mean, he's not wrong. 😂 But also "You and Freya more or less murdered my wife." Oof. Okay. But also peep Kol calling Davina his wife. #Kolvina #TheOriginals #ElijahMikaelson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kol turning up in the chamber de chasse half-naked because he was waiting for Davina to get home is absolutely hilarious. 😂 #TheOriginals #Kolvina<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus being there for his daughter despite the fact that he knows it'll cause chaos, holding her hand as they both watch Hayley's body drift away. He hugs her, calls her sweetheart, and is just there for her and reminds her that he loves her. He's a good father. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hayley shouldn't have died. Josh shouldn't have died. Elijah shouldn't have died. Klaus shouldn't have died. None of them should've died. They deserved happiness. Just a little bit of damn happiness for once in their lives. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, in S5E7 of #TheOriginals you can see that #ElijahMikaelson's got Enzo/Lorenzo's number in his phone. Idk if it's THAT Enzo from #TheVampireDiaries, but it reminded me of him. I miss him. 💔☹️ #TVD #VampireDiaries #DanielGillies #EnzoStJohn #MichaelMalarkey #LorenzoStJohn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ian: "To Nina &amp; Paul, how many times have the Salvatore brother's bitten Elena?" Paul: "Bitten Elena?" Nina: "I mean does anyone know the answer to that question?"

<|startoftext|>Paul: "I've never done karaoke in my life. Actually you know what, I've done it once. The one and only time I did it was at a Bar Mitzvah and I sung Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice."  LMFAOOOO, I love him. #PaulWesley #VanillaIce #IceIceBaby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Doesn't matter how much crap they put eachother through they intended to die by eachothers side. Elijah loved his brother far too much, and you could tell Klaus thought the same. I'm not happy with the ending they got, but it just shows the love they had. #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he just confirms everything people have been wondering without even caring<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rami Malek more than deserves that Golden Globe for his performance in Bohemian Rhapsody. I haven't even seen the film yet but even from the trailer I know he played the role so fantastically well. Congratulations Rami. #GoldenGlobes #GoldenGlobes2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i'd love to see more of these around everywhere. i'd be more concerned about the creep outside filming it and zooming in and out on it though, considering they have nothing better to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMFAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsNotFoundInMyCar me. because i don't have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I just love how at the end of #TheVampireDiaries when they were filming that scene where #Defan hugs, #PaulWesley &amp; #IanSomerhalder just kept hugging whilst they were attacked with silly string and confetti because they didn't want that moment to end. 💔 #VampireDiaries #TVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing #MichaelMalarkey break down into tears when he says his final goodbye on #TheVampireDiaries is so heartbreaking. I just wanted 2 hug him. "It's changed my life. I've had a kid here. I grew into a man here. I want to thank everyone. I can't say enough." #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PaulWesley in the behind the scenes video for the last ever episode of #TheVampireDiaries "I'm getting emotional. That's not a Paul Wesley thing." 😂 I freakin' love Paul so much. #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They 1000% need to bring back drive-in movie theatres and theatres where you can just sit on a picnic blanket and eat some food and just sit with someone outside and it's all cute and stuff and night time and lit by like glowing orange lights and ugh. It needs to come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just finished watching #MirrorMirror and it was such a fantastic film. I loved it so much!! Lily Collins was a fantastic choice for Snow White. She's so beautiful. Loveddddd the film! It was so good! EEK. #SnowWhite #Netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daaaaayumm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't matter how long it's been I will always cry over #TheOriginals &amp; #TheVampireDiaries &amp; #TeenWolf finale episodes. I miss them. Fuuuuck. #TVD #VampireDiaries #TW #TO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have so much respect for #DanielGillies being so brutally honest about #TheOriginals finale and the way he was treated. He does NOT deserve that, and neither did any of the cast. I wish they got the proper ending they deserved and not some half-assed confusing version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know that moment in #TheVampireDiaries where Bonnie's holding the fire back and Enzo and the Bennett's join her. I can just imagine Enzo being on the other side gathering them all and being like "You needa be here at this time, now!" 😂#Benzo #TVD #VampireDiaries #BonEnzo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That scene after Rose's death is lovely though. When Elena's talking to Damon and he says "I feel okay? And it sucks!" and Elena just hugs him and Damon's just frozen, because he needs it. As much as he doesn't wanna admit it. #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries #Delena<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I truly believe Damon and Rose could've been SO happy together. He was happy with her. She was happy with him. I truly believe if she wasn't bitten by a werewolf it would've lasted a long time. #TheVampireDiaries #TVD #VampireDiaries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Will we ever see this selfie? Probably not.  So, I'm glad someone else caught this beautiful moment of two husbands being husbands. 😂 God, I love &amp; miss them.  #PaulWesley #DanielGillies  https://t.co/KGvtCoJIw0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two husbands reunited in 2019.  #DanielGillies #PaulWesley  https://t.co/ztDgwKR1fy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'VE JUST REALISED THAT THE WOMAN WHO PLAYED GRETA IN #THEORIGINALS SEASON 5 WAS MICHAEL MALARKEY'S (WHO PLAYS ENZO IN #THEVAMPIREDIARIES) WIFE, NADINE LEWINGTON. LMFAO. A lot of their wives/husbands have been on the show, I love it. Both TVD &amp; TO. #TVD #VAMPIREDIARIES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew without even googling that the voice actor for Lukas in #Netflix's #MinecraftStoryMode game was the same actor that did Luke in telltale's walking dead. I was correct. Woot. Love his voice. Plus, they're both telltale so it makes sense. #Telltale #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ILoveBeingAloneBecause i just do ok mum, it's not a phrase. I'm anti-social and awkward and uuuugh just accept me mum<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#IanSomerhalder, #DanielGillies &amp; #PaulWesley are all going to be in New Orleans for the same comic con and I'm so jealous of anyone that's going to be able to meet them. Hopefully we get some reunion pics. #NewOrleans #TVD #VampireDiaries #TheVampireDiaries #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE HIMMMMMMMMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMFAO I LOVE THIS MAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was randomly looking at Mardi Gras stuff and found a website where they were hiring extras for #TheOriginals for a 'Mardi Gras' scene. Imagine how freakin' cool that would've been. God dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In their darkest hour his sacrifice was their redemption."  #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marcel: "I did what was necessary." Vincent: "No you didn't Marcel, and that's the problem man!"  #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It's been a glorious ride Niklaus. My greatest honour." - Elijah  🎵 And so the light fades 🎶 🎵 It’s still your birthday 🎶 🎵 So blow out your past lives like they’re candles on the cake 🎶  The lyrics match their ending scene so well... it breaks my heart. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Antionette: "I've been told Shanghai is a good place to go." Elijah: "Feel free to send me a post card."  LMFAOOO WHAT A SAVAGE. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Elijah and Klaus talk about Rebekah and Stefan back in the Germany 1933 flashback thing saying she seems happy with him. Aaaack. I miss Stefan. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peep Elijah &amp; Antionette making out in an alleyway though. Hawtee's. Well, Elijah is. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus' hair and look in 1933 Germany tho and Elijah's hair and his usual bloody suits. What hawtees. #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was anyone else shook when Klaus picked up that coin and it had the fucking NAZI SYMBOL ON IT. Like, what the fuck. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMFAOOO I LOVE THEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I don't do well without Elijah." Poor Klaus, he misses Elijah so much. Marcel's trying his best to help. :( #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWTEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realised there’s no more #doctorwho until 2020 and I already hate 2019. FFS. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don’t like the new #DoctorWho writing. That New Year’s Day episode was way too simple. Really not liking Chibnall to be honest. 😕 The actors are FANTASTIC though, don’t get me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miss them sm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discordapp “We were on a break!!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how everyone was expecting some proper awesome #Inbetweeners reunion episode but instead it was quite shit to be honest. 😂 #FwendsReunited #InbetweenersFwendsReuinted #InbetweenersReunited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She posted somethin real nice and he put two hand emotes ok #MyLifeAsEva  https://t.co/IBB6M4scu4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure I'm the only one who hasn't seen #BirdBox in the entire damn world right now. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Courteney Cox was in #Shameless is funny asf. I didn't expect her to be it at all. I mean, I knew she was going to be and all, but didn't expect her to be. 😂 #ShamelessUSA #ShamelessUS #CourteneyCox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terry: "Milkovich's don't bottom." Ian: "So was Mickey adopted?"  LMFAOOOOOOO FUCKING IAN IM LAUGHING SO MUCH. 😂 #Shameless #ShamelessUS #ShamelessUSA #Gallavich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PaulWesley living his best 2019 life. I love that first picture with him just wearing purple glasses and a New Year’s Eve tiara thing. 😂 Glad he’s having fun and spending it with friends/family/his girlfriend. #HappyNewYears Paul!! ❤️❤️🥂  https://t.co/ibd26YaTf9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I WANNA LOVE YOU BUT I BETTER NOT TOUCH (DON'T TOUCH) I WANNA HOLD YOU BUT MY SENSES TELL ME TO STOP I WANNA KISS YOU BUT I WANT IT TOO MUCH (TOO MUCH) I WANNA TASTE YOU BUT YOUR LIPS ARE VENEMOUS POISONNNNNN  Honestly, what a bloody tune. 🎶 #AliceCooper #Poison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So like when are we going to make period pads and tampons free for people? Because there's homeless people out there that need them, and also younger people who can't afford them or even talk to their parents/guardian about it. They're far too expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still not over the #InfinityWar ending because Spider-Man knew he was dying before it even happened because of his freaking spidey-senses and that makes me want to FREAKING SOB. #Spiderman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAIT WHAT?! IT'S BEEN THAT LONG?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LMAOOO IM LAUGHING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm straight up avoiding the #DoctorWho hastag so much because I haven't watched the episode yet and I don't want spoilers. SKSKSKSKSKS. I already know about the Dalek's tho, how can you not. Exxcccittteeeddd!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna make stuff but I'm so un-motivated. 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwh, Elijah's face when he first realises he can play the piano. This is freakin' adorable as heck. Daniel Gillies is such a fantastic actor I'm always blown away by his performances. #TheOriginals #ElijahMikaelson #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not gonna lie though, I love seeing #ElijahMikaelson in casual clothing. Don't get me wrong, he looks smokin' in a suit but seeing him in casual like long sleeved shirts and stuff is hot asf and he just looks like #DanielGillies pretending to be a vampire. 😂 #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Antionette saying "Maybe you were a butler" to Elijah. Lmao, she did not. Then freakin' Elijah just coming in with a tonne of shopping and adapting to a complete different life. This is so cute and he decides to go to a freaking NIGHTCLUB. Such a different dude. 😂 #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be honest, I love seeing the way #ElijahMikaelson discovered being a vampire again and was so fascinated by it all. We didn't get to see that before, and the way he met Antionette was nice and simple and cute, I'm not gonna lie. #TheOriginals #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing Elijah in truckers clothes instead of a suit is the weirdest damn sight you've gotta admit. 😂And the way he just casually knocks the Jesus bobblehead and then drives off in the truck. #TheOriginals #ElijahMikaelson #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"My dad thinks I'm broken. I don't think um... I don't think he loves me anymore."  FFFFFUUUCK. He does Hope!! DAMMIT. He just cant be near you because he'll freaking kill you with the dark magic/the hollow inside of him AAAAAAH. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>holy shiiiit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In my experience, fathers cause pain. Whether by their presence or their absence, there's a certain type of ruin that only a father can leave behind." Fuck Klaus, I felt that. Like, personally I felt that for real. Jeez. #TheOriginals #KlausMikaelson #JosephMorgan #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe how hurt Klaus looked when Declan said he’d been there for Hope when Klaus wasn’t. Basically implying he’s been a better dad over the 7 years. Oof. Bad move Declan. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah, I got Klaroline! What are the odds in that?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s cominggghh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scintillantom I’m far from doomed 🤤😍  https://t.co/2uE4c0LmzW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait to see your first single 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love and miss themmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too Sean, me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unkind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy new year joseph!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Years everyone, I’m off to bed because I’m shattered. Hope this year is kinder to me and my family. Lost too many people last year. #HappyNewYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAMNNN YES DYLANNNN!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UPDATE: Found out what that thing was on snapchat that I posted a few days ago. @Snapchat #Snapchat #HappyNewYear #NewYear #NewYearsEve #HappyNewYear2019  https://t.co/RsvcWF4TTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Mikaelson ✗ Dernière Danse [+5x01]  https://t.co/MglKIadJpS You've gotta admit this scene is dope w/ that background music and his words. Just fkin awesome. Joseph is so brilliant at playing Klaus. #TheOriginals #KlausMikaelson #JosephMorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus' face when Caroline says "Because I happen to think you're someone worth knowing." is the most adorable freakin' thing ever. #TheOriginals #Klaroline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will never get over the fact that Rebekah called Caroline to go find Klaus. Rebekah is a freakin' #Klaroline shipper. She knew Caroline would be the only one to be able to change his mind regardless of the fact that they haven't seen each other in years. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novoxamor I appreciate that, feel free to rant too! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novoxamor ik this isnt relevant but we just like posted the same thing dkskskssk  BUT, I hope you feel better soon lovely. ❤  https://t.co/snS0ELpBv1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so fucking depressed its not even funny anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nikki, Paul &amp; Ines awww fekjrnkfejn cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH I hate that they hire pretty women to play "ugly" roles. I could totally become an actress and steal all those roles. Also then again, hiring someone who they consider "ugly" would be incredibly rude obviously. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit #RIPDameJuneWhitfield. Can’t believe we’ve lost so many people this year. Rest in peace. 💔 #RIPJuneWhitfield #JuneWhitfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea what this means on @Snapchat but it’s certainly ominous. Especially with that “🤔” emote above it. #Snapchat  https://t.co/PWd3vWHS5C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your dads watching a car program and #JakePaul appears on it and I get him to turn it off because I ain’t watching that scumbag. 🙄🤮🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so damn cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leetje So sorry for your loss, I know how much it hurts and it feels like it’s never going to get better. Remember the good times you had together, it’ll help more than thinking of the alternate. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DebbyRyan &amp; #JoshDun = Engaged. #MattDavis &amp; #KileyCasiano = Married. #MileyCyrus &amp; #LiamHemsworth = Married.  Anyone else wanna get married or engaged in December? 😂 So happy for them all though. ❤ #KileyDavis #MatthewDavis #MileyHemsworth #DebbyDun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also you've gotta admit, whether you liked #AlaricSaltzman or not, his death when he's in the graveyard and they all gather for him and he steps out and "be still" plays and like almost everyone's fking crying. You gotta admit that shit was heartbreaking. 😫💔 #TheVampireDiaries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To be honest, make #TylerHoechlin a main character on some show or just him as anything because I miss him and he's such a bloody talented human being I love him. GIVE HIM A GOOD SHOW. #Superman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IMAGINE if they brought back #StefanSalvatore &amp; #KlausMikaelson &amp; #ElijahMikaelson in #Legacies because Jo's now back which means somethings ovbiously gone wrong on the other side. Wait, I just realised Stefan died human so he won't be able to... WHAT THE FUCK. NO! #CWLegacies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never be okay with the death of #StefanSalvatore, #KlausMikaelson, and #ElijahMikaelson, just saying. It will never BE OKAY. UUUUGH. #TVD #VampireDiaries #TheVampireDiaries #TheOriginals #WhyJuliePlec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a #Bumblebee advert on TV and I'm so excited to hear #DylanOBrien's first voice acting role in it, apparently he talks quiet a bit. EEEEK. #BumblebeeMovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>look. at. him. omg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HIS ACTING IS SO FKING GOOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never get over when Hayley was in the pendant and she was actually scared of Elijah and then Elijah finally came to and apologised to her and was just so ashamed in himself and so sad he'd made her scared. My heartttt. #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #Haylijah is reunited and he puts his jacket around her but it's Hayley in Elijah's memories and shows the after part and she says she's missed him and just looks so happy and he's so happy and even Hayley who's viewing the memory again smiles. THEY'RE 2 CUTE. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just sayin' but that scene with Davina &amp; Elijah where she pricks her finger with that pin and puts a tiny bit of blood on it and Elijah grabs her hand and moves it to his lips was oddly sexy because they were looking each other in the eyes the entire time. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Elijah to Aurora "You are a deranged and ridiculous child who cannot be left unsupervised." Then Aurora looks like she's about to cry LMAO #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Tristan, I can't murder you this very moment but I could just as easily tear those eyes from your skull and feed them to your sister."  Elijah really does know how to make a threat. 😂 #DanielGillies #ElijahMikaelson #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also the fact that it's his very first voice acting role is just freakin' awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So proud of @dylanobrien for landing the voice role of Bumblebee in the new Transformers spin-off. I don't usually watch Transformers but now I just might, who knows. Congrats Dylan!! #Bumblebee #DylanOBrien #BumblebeeMovie #BumblebeeFilm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>NO FUCKING WAY, IM SO HAPPY FOR HIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH we all knew Elijah had a thing for Hayley the second he saw her come in that room and she was like "Who the hell are you?" he was looking @ her like she was the most beautiful women he'd ever seen in his 2000 years of existence. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Past episode, Derek Hale, all serious: "The bite is a gift." Scott McCall, trying to sound serious: "T-The... bite... is a gift...?" Stiles Stilinski: "Scott, what the f-" Basically how it happened when Scott tried to tell Liam the bite was a gift LMAO. #TeenWolf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A line both Klaus &amp; Elijah have muttered to one another; "I can't do this without you, brother." #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Elijah FLINCHED when Hayley chopped that persons head off with an axe and he's seen stuff far worse than that. That says something about him. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot Elijah sent Elena a letter and apologised to her for the trouble him &amp; his brother brought to Mystic Falls and even said he admired Elena because of her good qualities. Bruh, I miss Elijah. He's been through so much shit. Daniel Gillies played him so well. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>

"It's called Hypervigilance."  Never related to him more in my life, his character, personality, all of it. #TeenWolf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think about it, #ElijahMikaelson is way more twisted that #KlausMikaelson in some ways. He can hide it exceptionally well and keep himself collected, but when he switches he's a complete different person and will stop at nothing. He can be terrifying. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAOAOAOAOAOAAOAOOA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>&amp; Then they hug and Andy wishes her well and stuff and they keep in contact but he gives all the toys to his own kids and sees them playing with them like he used to when he was young and it just fades out from there and hopefully it's a happy ending and Andy DOESN'T die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonnie says something along the lines of that she's heading to College like he was when he handed them over to her and she promised she'd hold onto them for him and this is her giving them back to him now that she's older and doesn't play with toys as much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andy just gasps a little, taking Woody and Buzz out and holding them in his hands and looking at all the other toys he used to play with as a kid and just smiling widely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He invites her inside and they both sit down, Bonnie's older now and an adult/young-adult herself and she's leaving for college like Andy was and opens the box up to reveal all of Andy's old toys, Woody &amp; Buzz sitting on the top looking up at Andy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if Andy's old now, like in his 30's or 40's with kids of his own and he's at home with his significant other, and the doorbell rings. He heads over to it and answers it to find Bonnie on the other side and they both smile at each other and she's holding a box in her hands...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When they can't find Elijah in the pendant and Sia's "wings" starts playing and everyone's panicking and Klaus is angry, and Hayley's about to break down and Hope comes in and helps Freya.

<|startoftext|>To everyone saying Anne is being a drama queen, etc. Educate yourself on Asperger’s syndrome &amp; Autism. She is NOT being “over-dramatic”, or anything of sort. I have so much love for her. #ImACeleb #ImACelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davina: "She didn't kill them because they were mean or unkind to her, she killed them for fun." Klaus: "Well... we all have our bad days." I love Klaus. 😂 #JosephMorgan #KlausMikaelson #TheOriginals #DavinaClaire<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hayley: "You can't promise me a future and then offer yourself up to die." Elijah: "Hope needs her father. Hayley: "I need you. I love you."

<|startoftext|>@PrecipussCrafts You're welcome. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah telling Davina to kill him instead of Klaus and then Hope comes in and unleashes her freaking POWERFUL spell on every1 and Elijah just looks impressed asf. Proud Uncle ofc. 😂 Even Alaric said she's impressive. "Nice meeting u littlest Mikaelson." ❤ #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eyyyy #TheLEGOMovie2, if it has another song like "everything is awesome" that gets stuck in my head for about 2 years then I'm gonna... probably still watch it coz the first one was hilarious. 😂 #TheLEGOMovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that in #InfinityWar when everyone's dissolving the entire theatre just fell silent and you could hear people sobbing, and then Spider-Man's came along and people lost their shit. Same with after credits when they made the title disintegrate &amp; "thanos will return". 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I never knew Anne had autism, but she had a bit of a cry and then got stuck right back into it and that takes a lot of guts for something way out of your comfort zone. Well done Anne. ❤️ #ImACeleb #ImACelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Barrowman on #ImACeleb was the best decision yet. LMAO. He's so motivational and extra and I love it. "Ooh, I've love to take you into the jungle." and cheering everyone on. I LOVE HIM. Defo want him to win. #ImACelebrity #JohnBarrowman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say what you want but Finn's death was actually heartbreaking. He just wanted to be surrounded by his family and died peacefully with them by his side. He accepted his fate. After so many years of feud with them, they all just loved one another in that moment. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hayley &amp; Elijah | The Lonely  https://t.co/9gTH62CyKU #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DanielGillies' acting in that scene where Elijah finds out that Hayley's dead, when all his memories come back, his screaming, his crying, his gasping for breath, his sheer heartbreak. My entire heart broke for him, his acting was phenomenal. #TheOriginals #AlwaysAndForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From day 1 Elijah promised to protect Hayley ALWAYS and FOREVER, and he kept that promise for the rest of his living life and Hayley's death broke him, he didn't want to live a minute longer without Klaus or Hayley by his side. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that Elijah said “I grew up on a Viking farm I’m familiar with the smell of fertiliser.” Aka Elijah basically saying someone’s talking shit. 😂😂 #ElijahMikaelson #DanielGillies #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ELIJAH &amp; HOPE MIKAELSON  https://t.co/G1e7cuNMeH I. love. them. so. much. #ElijahMikaelson #HopeMikaelson #TheOriginals #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, #DanielGillies played evil-ish #ElijahMikaelson so well. Well, whenever he makes threats. Whatever. Either way he played it brilliantly. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, why do #ElijahMikaelson and #KlausMikaelson look so good with dark circles under their eyes? When the Hollow takes their forms and they get those dark bags under their glowing blue eyes, they look so sinister and just... attractive. #TheOriginals #DanielGillies #JosephMorgan  https://t.co/FimysRLwmk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah: "I was thinking jean shorts and flip flops." Hayley: "I wanna build a life with you Elijah." *They kiss all cute like* Elijah: "Then we'll do that, in jean shorts." I MISS THEM. THEY NEEDED THAT FUTURE. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We never got to see Hayley &amp; Elijah be happy together and Elijah in jean shorts and stuff like they both imagined and I would've laughed so hard because that'd be beyond adorable. They needed their happy ending, DAMMIT. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Elijah and Klaus are sharing that bottle of whiskey and they both drink from it but the lid/cap is still on when they both 'drink' from it. LMAO. They didn't even try to hide it either. 😂 #TheOriginals #Klelijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember that #ElijahMikaelson gave his life to save a bunch of kids which resulted in the Hollow taking over him and all that bad stuff happening. ELIJAH IS A FREAKIN' HERO OKAY. He risked his life for a bunch of kids. #TheOriginals #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elijah: "Make no mistake. I will violate everything sacred under the sun in the name of rescuing my niece." Dude we needed more Uncle Elijah scenes so bad. I love him.

<|startoftext|>*Daniel spins around in his suit like Elijah all dramatic and just way out of his nature* "Good evening you sexy bitches." LMAOAOAOA. I will never forget that video. 😂 #TheOriginals #DanielGillies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He just tries to make everything a little bit awkward." #TheOriginals cast talking about #DanielGillies. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do people just 'casually' find celebrities on the subway or in the middle of stores? Like how the fk? I can't even find my parents in a store half the time let alone a celebrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Too infinity and your mom." I'm crying with laughter. #ToyStory4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #JakeGyllenhaal's #Stronger on Netflix and oh my goodness. What an amazing film. Brought me to tears. Fantastic acting from all of the cast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Hope is telling Klaus she's had a bad dream and blood starts coming out her nose and Klaus yells for Hayley and Hayley runs out wearing Elijah's shirt. OOP. #Haylijah #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we just remember that #ElijahMikaelson, THE Elijah Mikaelson set up a spontaneous date for him and Hayley in the garden of her home but they just skipped the food. 😂  E: "There's too much good in you. That's why I love you." H: "I love you too." #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwwwwhhh, Rebekah &amp; Klaus saying goodbye to one another and telling each other how much they mean to each other. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus: "My daughter is an art prodigy." He says, looking through his daughter's drawings. Awww. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually great David Schwimmer made that 'parody' video of the theif, because it made people curious of the original and in result helped arrest the man who was stealing. The police even thanked David Schwimmer. Lmao!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus: "Nothing is going to harm my little girl. Nothing will even get close. You're all that matters to me." #Klope #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hayley: "You were her fairy tail prince Klaus, and now you're real. You have a lot to live up to." And then he just looks at his daughter who's painting just like he did, and joins her. I'm ekferkjfnernf they're so cute. We needed more #Klope scenes. UUUGH. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus' reaction to seeing Hope for the first time in 5 years is absolutely adorable. Even the entire families reaction, Rebekah and Elijah just smiling and the rest of them in awe. #TheOriginals #Klope<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also love how they made Jimmy/Steve show up at the end of S4E12 but he was called 'Jack' and it was like WHAT THE FUUUUUCK. #Shameless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also love just how much Mickey stuck up for Ian when he was diagnosed with Bipolar and said "He's fucking family." and also Mandy tried to make it easier for Mickey. Mick put in so much effort to keep Ian safe and tried to look after him. #Shameless #ShamelessUSA #Gallavich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH, I love that Kev and the guys in the bar were just so accepting of Mickey coming out and Kev bought him a beer because Mickey was just so terrified and thought he'd get the shit beaten out of him like his dad did to him. #Shameless #ShamelessUSA #Gallavich<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can I just say, #BradleyWalsh’s acting in the scene of #DoctorWho where they’re taking Rosa Parks off the bus was absolutely phenomenal. His horror when he realised he was part of it, his face when they were arresting her. He was fantastic in the episode. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can just imagine Claire Holt’s child calling #TheOriginals cast their uncles &amp; aunts and all the cute pics there might be of them holding Claire’s child. Soskjdjsjwbab. I’m so happy for Claire it’s unreal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Hayley visits Elijah in his coffin and just places a kiss on his lips with his fingers. I miss the Mikaelson's so much man. #TheOriginals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Freya's doing that spell to put herself, Kol, Elijah, and Rebekah to sleep and Hayley just grabs Elijah's hand tightly to reassure him that she's there and they look at each other and somehow say goodbye with their eyes, but he's also so thankful. #TheOriginals #Haylijah<|endoftext|>
