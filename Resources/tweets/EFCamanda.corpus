<|startoftext|>@scousericey Gomes and Pickford...one’s too slow the other erratic &amp; whilst making those fantastic saves, there’s  at least 1 mistake in every game, just a case of whether it ultimately costs us. Should’ve taken the lead second half when on top - rather than it looking like we were lucky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALANMYERSMEDIA Yeah Brighton and Keane ...a long list of terrible decisions against us! Makes a change for us to get something ...great biased BT commentary too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSpaceTheory @jnshenton Definitely someone to leave a foot in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinKitch Yeah absolute shocker that one! Reaction from players and replay clearly shows ball was won! Teeing it up he was!! Should be f*cking furloughed bearded red shite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveRimmer9 Lol! Me too 😆💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>60 grand 60 grand 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Puddle575 John it’s shit but I’m still coiled 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think it’s safe to say that football is totally sh*t without US! the ones that actually go the game! This crap stadium noise and no matter how much @premierleague players are paid will make it was it was! Grounds need crowds and I’ve no idea how that’s gonna happen! 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveRimmer9 Yep and then at the end Pickford lumps it Ffs 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a booking! FFS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doctor_oxford @NHSEmployers @MattHancock @NHS_HealthEdEng An absolute disgrace now discarded as we’re coming out the other side and to prevent paying what they’re due! Not only should they pay them for the contract, even if they’re not needed and don’t work it, they should wipe their fees! Clapping one minute shafting ‘em the next 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @MarcusRashford Attention seeking again looking for a reaction with the continuous array of nasty comments! Fancy waking up each day knowing how many people absolutely despise you! Negative energy festering! #karma<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elle_efc Didn’t shop there before, they sell absolute shitey tat! Could have used my NHS badge today, but I like many others were working, so as it was an in store offer - it was nothing more than a publicity stunt! Would rather pay 💯% elsewhere!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So the R =&gt;1 in the NW, can’t believe just heard the Shite v Palace, where they’re likely to win the PL, is at Anfield. Of course people with go to Anfield that night! Stupid arse decision @premierleague risking us all! Local lockdown inbound!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simoncarlyle Fantastic news! Cheered me up no end! Cannot wait 💙#TwoDoorsDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are they getting away with this? MPs as representatives of their constituents unable to stand in line to vote, therefore no vote.

<|startoftext|>@Puddle575 Who is your MP John?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because she’s not on Twitter doesn’t mean you can’t publicly shame the fact that she cannot be bothered to reply. I’d email her every day until she does! 20 working days they have to reply!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Boris and his #eugenist advisers have always cared more about the economy, it’s clear! Comms have been confusing and unclear for some and this #StayAlert will only add to this.

<|startoftext|>So we’re putting a package together to help the vulnerable eat &amp; to quarantine arrivals into the UK.

<|startoftext|>@thejamessutton What about the thousands who have died from #COVID19 but their deaths are not recorded in the numbers as they were untested!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scousericey @RichardFargher @ALANMYERSMEDIA Fine with my three too! Good idea! 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incompetence on every level of that pathetic, arrogant and cock swinging government! We were told, 3 years ago in an emergency trial exercise that we’re not prepared!

<|startoftext|>We had Michael Foot, an intelligent man and then replaced him with Neil Kinnock a passionate man, and the Tories lapped it up!

<|startoftext|>@littlejudda @p4ulrichards Since 2000 almost £285m of European Social Fund cash has been invested in 1,260 projects to develop the skills of the people of Merseyside. Last yr the European Commission &amp; govt signed a deal for funding which would have seen  £190m handed to Merseyside over next 5 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only wish that would be true! The weakest #Tory party 4 yrs and #LabourParty still don’t go to town! Should be wiping floor with them! Too many won’t vote #Corbyn and our weak front bench so right wing media use him and them as a threat that makes the #Tories palatable ..sigh 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcpress @David_Cameron @BBCOne He will never know a poor day ...but his absolute arrogance has brought massive division and angst for many in our society. Jog on! You’ll be known in history for this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching @CarolineLucas doing a fine job calling out Mogg’s behaviour in Commons at the EU Withdrawal Emergency #Debate 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Absolutely gutted at the thought of a #GE. We should be lambasting these #Tories but infighting in #Labour and the unpalatable front bench will mean another term for them! JC is unelectable as principled as he is! He’s an easy target. It’s imminent and we’ll lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“He’s Brazilian”...brilliant today @richarlison97 all over the place MoM 🙌🏾💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottocrat @TonyMaudsley1 Except the current #PM will have carried out the will of the #British people meaning he’s likely to succeed in a #GE that will immediately be called #5moreyears of #Tory hell! God help us all especially those more poor in our society! Oh and many of them stand to make £££s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lib_Lab_Con @terrychristian We’ve got a diminishing NHS workforce no thanks to #Tory treatment of NHS staff so the NHS can only function with foreign colleagues!New immigration rules could affect the ability of the NHS to recruit doctors and other medical staff from the rest of the world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joswinson Like you and your shower didn’t fight the Tories when you were in bed with them deluded and seduced only to be absolute gullible puppets.

<|startoftext|>@SylviaWilkinson What a comment!!! The NHS is in crisis because of massive Tory cuts, lack of investment, unprecedented increases in demand. Probably worked back to back shifts! They are human,morale is shot and their own mental health &amp; resilience likely to be poor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips Massive shortage of nurses before the bursaries were cut meanwhile student nurses are expected to work 3-4 12 hr shifts per week for free whilst studying and paying nearly £10k a year in fees! Surely this needs to be urgently reviewed for all student nurses? Our NHS is precious!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@G_Stino @Everton Yep and like the soft arses we are we’ll be there ...what we do regardless but Everton literally ruins my life 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bluepeter1979 @Everton Shocking since then ...a curse ...it’s too easy for our players to pass backwards. No passion, pride or balls particularly in midfield- Gylfi is either sugar or shite. Dry January is done like our season 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@G_Stino @Everton Said same Coleman did look up for it but there’s no leadership. Agree stupid fouls and with our inability to defend and zonal fricking marking it’s just a disaster! BBC glorifying those absolute scummy team and fans! Season over gutted 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omfg @Everton absolutely shite, fans attacked before game, to watch that shit show! We can’t defend, we can’t pass and we can’t attack! Just pathetic- gutted for poor fans being held back inside ground because those cheating scum bags are likely to want seconds! #endofdryjanuary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on blues we don’t want them lot anywhere near our place 😔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JyotiWilkinson @bbcquestiontime Unbalanced audience was clear to see, the BBC are an absolute disgrace in more ways that one.  Their values purport  that trust is the foundation of the BBC;  independent, impartial and honest. Couldn't get further from the truth. It's about time that they were held to account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So frustrated that the #Labour Party are not ripping the #Tories apart taking them to task on the total shambolic mess we have which includes zero attention to domestic issues like the NHS, Policing, Education. They should be having a field day ☹️<|endoftext|>

Not the first time it’s not what GB is about and he’s inciting hatred which is not welcomed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam he said he'd left instructions to call customers but no one bothered!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam The order was cancelled at 22:50 Fri and just spoken to Delivery mgr to tell him of the rubbish experience!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam what would be the purpose of that? Foreign call centre? Poor contingent, mgt at Widnes store! It's ok in @tesco as we speak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam no it didn't traced del to store turns out they knew and chose not to call customers! A complete joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asda you've still not delivered and are not going to tonight! Think the delivery is with @astro_timpeake lol! #groundcontroltomajortom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still waiting @Asda &amp; why can I trace it when your call centre can't? Kind gesture of £5 off nxt order but can it be for @Tesco instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're late @asda delivery - 1st order 4 a while and is the last hungry child here! Call ctr appears 2 have psychic powers @AsdaServiceTeam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Disappointing @Everton today, wasted possession, wasted chances and a wasted £1.5M for slipping a place! 4/5 new players min needed 15/16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made up for Sunderland! What a game!!! #ARSvSUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nationalrailenq ridiculous overcrowding sort it out! Seat reserved but another person has same seat!!! 3 units not 6 on ...shocking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shocking bias from @KayBurley tonight! Annoyingly interrupting and making stupid, non related quips to Milliband #cameronvsmiliband<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Everton have the best away fans ever! #COYB #QPRvEFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think we need to sign Titus Bramble to solve our defensive problems ...he has the "character" we need!!! 😝 #DKVEVE still love you @Everton 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very strange selection Alcaraz over Stones Atsu over @Osman21Leon and Barry over @D_gibson4 @RBarkley20 mom simply can't defend #DKVEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wishing all our travelling Kyiv blues a great day tomorrow. @Everton the last team in Europe #COYB #DYNvEFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker because @Everton play tom &amp; blues know regardless of performance @BBCMOTD MOTD usually put EFC on last!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EuropaLeague should make example of clubs with fans who can't behave and kick em out full stop. Stop talking about it and act!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not happy at @everton draw with little chance of getting there/back safely to cheer em on. Needed 2nd leg at GP.  Tough team who r unbeaten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great overall result @Everton good to see @D_gibson4 back to his passing best! praise to the big man too @RomeluLukaku9 #BluesOnTour #COYB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Barry looks destroyed so why take young legs of Besic off? @everton @EvertonArentWe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's at least twice Carroll has elbowed this half and no yellow! Stupid from McGeady. Mirallas to equalise! EvertonArentWe @grandoldteam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @Everton. Love Besic hope RM puts him in with @JMcCarthy_16. More direct is so much better @grandoldteam @EvertonArentWe #ontheup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's ALL get behind @everton today. Massive game physcologically! Remember we're Evertonians! @EvertonArentWe @grandoldteam #COYB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg Jags in after match interview? Can't look at interviewer! no confidence body language doesn't lie #noeyecontact @EvertonArentWe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pauly_J84 yeah and then losing it!!!! Ross on to help us in final 3rd. Dunc really needs to work on Rom's 1st touch. Barry 😢 missing Naisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking clueless in the final 3rd here! Barry off and Barkley on through the middle? Referee is shocking! Kick on Eto'o ridiculous #EFCMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barry having a mare! Too slow on the ball! #EFCMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply not good enough @Everton  too much passing no movement. Pass move score simples #efc<|endoftext|>
