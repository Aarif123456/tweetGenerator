<|startoftext|>@CommentaryRhop @CatTaucher @candeegal I just watched the episode again it was not a lie. Candiace shouldn’t have been a snake, befriending Charisse while she was spreading rumors that Monique was cheating. It was not only words but actions that got her ass whooped. Dumb ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommentaryRhop @CatTaucher @candeegal The reason Monique fought and was pissed at Candiace was because of the rumors about her sleeping with her trainer and the baby not being her husbands. Charisse was spreading that and Candiace was hanging out with her #Rhop FOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommentaryRhop @CatTaucher @candeegal I watch every episode, you liking Candiace makes me wonder if you watch the show?! Silly bitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatTaucher @CommentaryRhop @candeegal I am watching the episode now. It’s been a while. I know her ass said something and needed to be popped. Lol she’s always asking for it. Literally “drag me”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatTaucher @CommentaryRhop @candeegal I gotta watch the episode again but I’m sure it was because Candiace said “Monique is mad because she doesn’t know the father of the baby is.

<|startoftext|>@mekakinny @thuglove143 @doofey004 @netflix Wrong again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertM49657110 @Melina_Daneri @netflix Ironic that it received a Sundance festival award and we all know the co owner was imprisoned  for sexually abusing children so perhaps that sexualization of kids played a role in the award.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertM49657110 @Melina_Daneri @netflix I saw the trailer it was done in poor taste. If it wasn’t about sexualizing little girls they should’ve been very aware of all marketing that went out to protect the girls in the movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zapped998 I need a restraining order at this point. They are literally stalking and assaulting me. #Mosquitos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squidmango @netflix Are u justifying the sexualization of girls by saying it’s happening everywhere? Weirdo. It should all be stopped. Clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theserfstv @netflix Then they should’ve been on top of the marketing and made sure it was done properly. #Cuties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertM49657110 @Melina_Daneri @netflix You must be a creep. You like little girls twerking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mekakinny @doofey004 @netflix I watched the trailer and it shows the little Latina girls crotch when she’s wearing shorts. They have their fingers in their mouths! Sexually. Are u blind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netflix Why did it happen? Who was involved?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ntltcswift Who hates her? 🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aspiringdreamer @yeunftw @TessaThompson_x She could’ve made sure they didn’t sexualize those girls. Someone could’ve said NO i don’t approve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspiringdreamer @yeunftw @TessaThompson_x She should’ve made sure children weren’t exploited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netflix But why did it happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethElderkin I don’t like either, why do they have to have bras and panties exposed?<|endoftext|>
