<|startoftext|>@DeanBristow16 @bhembedj @steviereidV2 @SpursOfficial Also, Liverpool in the 70's/80's really weren't that entertaining  Solid defence, patient play, exciting forwards, lots of titles   Sound familiar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanBristow16 @bhembedj @steviereidV2 @SpursOfficial See you on the 16th ... I'm feeling you may be concerned we could turn up at Anfield, play our 'cowardly football' and waltz off with 3 points. ?.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanBristow16 @bhembedj @steviereidV2 @SpursOfficial Best goal difference? Spurs. Best defense? Spurs again. We're punching way above our weight once again  only this year our punches are landing and our guard is holding up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanBristow16 @bhembedj @steviereidV2 @SpursOfficial All my life(57) Spurs have played, beautiful, attacking football. Praised by all and sundry for our flair. Titles? Zero.  I'll take a season of pissing off 'purists' (and still scoring wonderful goals) if it brings me a title b4 I die. (sorry 4 assuming u r a gooner)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jenniflyygyrl Surreal scenes as the press shout " are you a rascist" to a President about to speak about MLK who then implies that the national holiday is his idea.  I will dance in the streets the day he finally falls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder He wouldn't dare step foot in the UK.  We don't do stage managed welcomes. No flag waving smiling children waiting for him here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickMuffinstuff I literally had to do that so my six year old twin girls didn't hear "shithole" on the BBC news. Trump hasn't even got the balls to come to the UK and face the protests. We stand with #TheResistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson To paraphrase The Clash... " If Adolf Hitler flew in today, you'd send a limousine anyway" (White Man in the Hammersmith Palais). Lines have to be drawn. Be on the right side if history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never heard the word "shithole" used on BBC news at 10 before. But that's where the President of the United States has taken us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated The "special relationship" is alive and well, the UK stands with #TheResistance. Let's get rid of this clown. If his trial is televised it will be bigger than Live Aid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What a ridiculous thing for the President of the United States to be investing his time in.  Why not just shut down all news outlets except Fox and be done with it.

<|startoftext|>@funder Wormtongue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaycollins52 @DanRather @jaketapper It seems to be more and more opinion based rather than cold, hard reporting.

<|startoftext|>@kaycollins52 @DanRather @jaketapper Sorry, when I said "your"  I meant the US. I live in the UK where, although split l/r the media still has some credibility. Trying to sort fact from fiction looks like a full time job for America.<|endoftext|>
