<|startoftext|>@MikeFox_69 @Darrla @adamlevine @NBCTheVoice He persuaded the vote.  It was very biased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrla @adamlevine @NBCTheVoice I agree he use to be my favorite too. Not sure how to feel about him after that.  @imreaganstrange was no better than @deandreknico and he sang for votes, but instead of talking about how great he sang he insulted him. so disappointing.  Hopefully the next judge replaces Adam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tiffanieromeyba @BasketballWives I agree here...  @iamjennifer is messy for starting the lie and @TamiRoman should of let it die.  The only one i have felt bad for is @ShaunieONeal who although is a little shady sometimes didnt deserve that.<|endoftext|>
