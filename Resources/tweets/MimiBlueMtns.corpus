<|startoftext|>@jayellemm @AdamBandt Yep. unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley We'll miss you Kay. Watching from Australia, your cross examination of Matt Hancock on the question of the scotch egg was sheer brilliance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrianPeberdy @LCFC @Madders10 I said the exact same thing, watching from Australia this morning. Give it to Albrighton!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh Hope that's the first of many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC But Ward and Luke Thomas played well imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManiaaSZN @LCFC Not much to chose between them. The question should be what does Albrighton have to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Losing to a much lesser side and still keeping Albrighton on the bench? What has he done to upset you Brendan Rogers. And there has to be a better option than Iheanacho and Praet even in the Under 16s.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Serious question...when I was growing up in Leicester and you pronounced 'three' as 'free', you'd  be sent off for speech therapy. Now it seems to be accepted as normal in the UK. Why can't people say their THs anymore? @GaryLineker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LFC96594865 @matt_matt130467 @SkySportsPL Only 10? Which is one of the reasons there are 30,000 new cases a day in the UK. Hope the rest of the team get tested prior to the game v Leicester. Madness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 The blue logo bottom left explains all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Two words...Blue Wall!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz The CNN coverage has been...well, simply awesome! Love John King, Chris Cuomo and the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SummersAnne @albericie @JoeBiden Gutless? What a strange claim. CNN are doing an amazing job constantly confirming the integrity of the voting system but obviously not calling it yet. Votes are still being counted. Not helpful Anne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @DHughesy I've never understood why making fun of stutterers is OK. This is genuine empathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Very telling!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bobjcarr @MikeCarlton01 Why on earth are you writing for The Australian @BobJCarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Awesome coverage Chris. Congrats from Australia. One question...are there legal processes in place to remove Trump from office if Biden wins and if he refuses to concede? Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz One is mad, the other just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKingCNN Are you getting any sleep at all?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bairdjulia This is why I'm  glued to CNN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanJones68 @staceyabrams @fairfightaction @NewGAProject Watching from Australia...so proud of you and the CNN team. Integrity and sincerity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Hasn't he got a bunker he can retreat to with Eva (I mean Melania)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 We all know that but the question is, how can his fellow Republicans stand by and tolerate this madman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKingCNN This is getting exciting now. From Australia, thank you so much to you and the CNN team for the most remarkable election coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEBassett @atrupar Banking on Amy Coney Barrett? Oh so that's why she got the job!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC @67Kelechi @EuropaLeague Kelechi good but I would have nominated Chaudry as MOTM but such a good effort from all players. Fuchs and Albrighton always reliable. Madison needs to grow up a bit...petulance and time on the ground a problem despite amazing skills.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is worth retweeting, over and over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariajlorenz @JohnKingCNN Love it Maria. We are watching John King in Australia and I am simply in awe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Speers Un-believable. Second day of being glued to him. Compulsive viewing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 It's starting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bairdjulia So it's starting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayellemm @vanOnselenP Priceless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Obviously looking for a pay rise from his mate Donald. What a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKingCNN John King...been glued to your coverage of the election from Australia, now into the 2nd day. I am in absolute awe of your coverage...on your feet for hours, never missing a beat and always immaculate. (Not to mention your incredible knowledge). Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willleahy Watching from Australia. I am in awe of John King.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what a statesman looks llike...  https://t.co/q5AqcTZFlh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I'm  watching from Australia!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John King is amazing. He's been on his feet calling the election for hours and hours without missing a beat.  https://t.co/UQhF3Ht7nS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Been glued to CNN. Personally I think their presentation and demographics are excellent, clear, concise and compelling. Just switched to the BBC...they're understandably a little bit preoccupied with Covid...25,000 new cases a day and still waffling about lockdown. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>25,000 new cases a day in Britain and 50 Tory MPs vote against another lockdown. People 'discouraged' from travel. The lockdown when you're not really having a lock down. Meanwhile in Australia...  https://t.co/SppvyE4KWh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albericie @CNN CNN coverage today has been quite remarkable. Have been glued all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Very good!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @abcnews CNN has been amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But fails to use it in relation to the children in Australian Concentration Camps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One Council after another plus local businesses coming on board to support Marcus Rashford in his drive to support the poorer kids in society when Boris and his privileged toadies refused to help. Marcus you should feel so proud and what a role model for others to follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Disappointing, but not surprising. Mostly privileged young men with no clue what some people are going through. Go the All Blacks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Trouble is, some politicians don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunriseon7 @Channel7 @jeff_kennett Yes the numbers are just terrible in Victoria aren't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker @LCFC Agree but serious question, what has Albrighton done wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Frustrated from Australia. Good win today but where was Albrighton? #whereisAlbrighton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCClassic Thank you for last week's programme...what an absolute treat. No-one  to touch her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's  hope the tide is turning, and this is just the start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Agree but the question of the decade is why so many ordinary working folk have turned Conservative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@archer_rs Because too many of them read a Murdoch paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictorianCHO Congratulations. All the Covidiots need to look at the numbers in Europe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marquelawyers And looking forward to the day when the colour of someone's skin will be totally irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @TheRealPBarry @smh And it couldn't be in Yosemite as he can't pronounce it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 We wish! It's not too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKostakidis @PhillipAdams_1 @LNLonRN Thanks Mary, I missed that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lisa_Wilkinson @GladysB Same in our Woolies today. Clearly we know by now that recommendations don't  work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @BradHazzard @PaulTooleMP I think there might have been more than one who found Brett Hazzard funny. Boys' club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 And 31 year old footballers are called 'veterans'!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @drkerrynphelps Way too reactive at present.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abc730 Love you Magda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodiMcKayMP @BenFordhamLive Huge respect Jodi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 I'm reading Jack Fairweather's The Volunteer. This (plus what's happening in Lebanon right now) makes all the niggling over face masks and lock downs just soooo irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Milliganreports Is he seriously allowed to get away with this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mez_spy @Peter_Fitz The Sikh community is awesome. I'll  never forget my visit to the Golden Palace in Amritsar where they and a large group of volunteers feed up to 70,000 a day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCClassic Great music for cleaning the house on a wet and misty morning in the Blue Mountains. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrbenjaminlaw You've  been reading too much Kathy Lette.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarilynShephe15 @aspientiae @GrogsGamut Marilyn Shepherd, oh dear oh dear. This is exactly what we are up against, The Covid virus and Covidiots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Volunteer, by Jack Fairweather, a reminder of what mankind is capable of and what horrors governments are capable of ignoring. This Costa Book of the Year 2020 is essential reading. Nothing really changes. @Peter_Fitz @MikeCarlton01 @PhillipAdams_1  https://t.co/3Is7moSyLQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterWMurphy1 Really troubling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Footy Excellent news (from a Leicester fan!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoddo461 @MikeCarlton01 Sir Alex hits the nail on the head. Maggie has a lot to answer for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB Hope it's  not too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagdaSzubanski @UniversalPics Still remember the day I first saw that film. Wonderful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 But books about him and his wives are fascinating. Loved Paula McLain's books about Martha Gelhorn and Hadley Richardson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thommo52 @Delpuerto10 @abcnews @GladysB It's truly terrifying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delpuerto10 @abcnews YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 You missed a big one...EDUCATION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 700 new cases again today. Queensland Premier closing the border. Gladys PLEASE do the right thing! @GladysBBerejiklian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robshehadie Shocking!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sng0777 @leighsales Here we go again! Leigh Sales just doing the very best she can as always and there's always someone. Really!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster @drkerrynphelps International Court of Justice, where are you when we need you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 But what a brain-washing exercise by Tory forces to persuade voters otherwise! Margaret Thatcher has a lot to answer for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaBerginOAM Absolutely bonkers that air borders aren't closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abc730 @leighsales Good one Leigh. Hope you are OK. And you can always rely on the trolls for some entertainment. There are some sad people out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz More proof that MPs should undergo a mental fitness test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKNye @Peter_Fox59 @GladysB One a day is still too many if arriving passengers are jumping in to taxis to get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkerrynphelps Feeling grumpy! Why do so many people feel the need to travel at the moment given the rate of infection of this virus? Unfathomable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 How old is she? We have a 14 year old GSP. Sad to see the decline but still managing 2 walks a day!  https://t.co/bq3y9IAR6i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just check the Jetstar website. I couldn't believe it either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @GladysB I checked the Jetstar website out of curiosity this morning. Any number of flights between Melbourne and Sydney for $96 one way. Gobsmacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't  believe the amount of flack being thrown at #DanAndrews for doing his best to protect Victorians from this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this @RitaPanahi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Oh @RitaPanahi you make me want to cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB If NSW is on a knife edge, why on earth have we still got flights coming in and out of Melbourne? Gobsmacked!  https://t.co/BETFTDpDGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KKeneally Just out of curiosity, checked scheduled Jetstar flights Sydney to and from Melbourne. What the xxx ? Thought the border was supposed to be closed? #gladysberejiklian  https://t.co/jxZXGlK63o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Declaration of disaster in Victoria but still allowing flights in to Sydney with passengers catching Ubers and taxis at the airport. Bonkers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Creighton What's the point of trying to protect individuals if they are all as brainless as you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Fingers crossed!üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebSpillane @Peter_Fitz Unfortunately Debbie, as you will know, most football supporters (that is soccer to Australians and Americans) enjoy a range of sports. Rugby Union supporters consistently show disdain for all other sports.  It's a perceived class thing. Quite sad really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuardianBooks Once in 10 years or so a book comes along that touches your soul. Thank you #davidpark, you are a genius. I will be reading Travelling In A Strange Land more that once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallyjsara She's obviously been to the Trump School of Lies and Obfuscation. Outrageous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodreads Travelling In A Strange Land by David Park. THE most extraordinary book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 No surprises there. It's not going to be easy removing him from the White House<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't want a crooked election? The only thing crooked about US politics is him! #DonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government losing credibility rapidly. $$$ more important than lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we read that Treasurer Frydenberg takes his inspiration from Margaret Thatcher (no surprises there), remember who claimed "there is no such thing as society".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelWestBiz @PhillipAdams_1 Well there really is no hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LeighSales Topic for tonight's 7.30? This is really scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanTudgeMP Where is Priya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebekahhlt @MikeCarlton01 Reminiscent of brown shirt Nazi roundups? So so scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnastaciaMP @MikeCarlton01 About time! There's been too little too late during this second wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB Oh dear Gladys, you don't seriously believe that those 'rules' will be complied with? Scotty insisting on  $$$ before lives again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford Watching old interviews with the amazing Jack Charlton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a national disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is Priya? PLEASE SHARE Contact lost with Priya, she called to say she is being removed from Perth Hospital, taken to airport by 10-15 guards. Heard asking to speak to her legal rep and screaming in distress...  https://t.co/8kd0l4EFNn #peterdutton #craigfoster #blm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only they'd listened!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No further words needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonahac And there will be thousands in the same boat or worse who voted for him and his government. Go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jot_au @AllenMcleish @Kimick4 @SkyNewsAust @AlanJones We could go on!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but Scomo seems to think otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ausgov No it's not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Loves his Capital Letters !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As usual, too little too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@normanswan Thanks Norman, the trusted voice of reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KELLYROWLAND @Channel9 @TheVoiceAU Love you Kelly and the black in this photo is so classy...but what was that ridiculous blue number all about? Soooo inappropriate for a family show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should never forget what cruelty and inhumanity our government continues to inflict on these human beings held in concentration camps. Keep up the good work Craig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@normanswan Doing a magnificent job Norman. Please keep calling it how it is #elimination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If elimination is feasible, why does Australia continue to pursue a suppression strategy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren As a bystander in Australia, just want to say Elizabeth that I'm  sorry you are not running the election race against Trump. Super impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelindaJones68 @ScottMorrisonMP @MailOnline Don't  know how he's allowed to get away with it. Outrageous dereliction of duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are all the sensible strategies behind the eight ball?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRHewson I get it...#scottygoestothefooty doesn't  know how to work Zoom (plus he'd rather be at the footy). And...he's been chatting to his mate Donald who's told him not to worry, everything's under control. No hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickiPlatt5 And how can there be an economy without people?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB There won't be a recovery plan at this rate. Elimination all but a distant dream. And we were so close. Opened up way too soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pure gold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So predictable... Trump aides seek to discredit Fauci over coronavirus crisis as cases surge   https://t.co/W2I8eQsoRj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB So 300 in a pub is OK?  $$$ before lives. Simply madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC If only!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Was thinking the same thing, not to mention the orange make-up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely it's  the only way #GoForElimination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LnpCockup My thoughts exactly. We are definitely going to lose this one now when we were so close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billbowtell @smh My feeling is that after having every opportunity to eradicate in Australia, we are going to lose this fight now simply because of people not doing the right thing and the government putting pressure on to open up too soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgloveroz @smh A pat on the back? You were lucky!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/zI7B8B9f6y #peterdutton #ScottyFromHillsong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deemadigan @ScottMorrisonMP @AnnastaciaMP Not overly bright as we know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 And just a quick fact check on Donald's assertion that the US has the highest testing in the world...  https://t.co/N146LD5gMm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trump doubt if you'll read this Donald but this is the problem with your lies...too easy to fact check. Your Covid testing is nowhere near the highest in the world per 1000. Just saying.  https://t.co/0OZ3zLJczx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaTrioli @DanielAndrewsMP @abc730 No points from me for the unecessarily aggressive interview Virginia. Amazing that he found the time to come on the programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarciaDevlin Congratulations Great Aunty Marcia! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsAust Don't be ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo That logic is way too obscure for #DonaldTrump !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Shocker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodreads American Dirt...last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh And hopefully Ghislaine might just help things along!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @mjrowland68 Growing up in England with a Dad in CID for many years (unarmed), I still get freaked out at the sight of Australian police officers carrying guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADL_Archivist @LaTrioli @leighsales @abc730 Agree, that was such an annoying comment. Inter city parochialism is so old school and right now the borders should be closed to protect everyone. Sorry Virginia if that was meant to he a joke. No joking matter right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reardon_shaun And have dumbed down their citizens to such an extent that they'll still vote for same government next time around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @AngusTaylorMP Not to mention the Robodebt grand theft!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 They must be quaking in their boots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreakfastNews @normanswan And shouldn't Victorian borders be closed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @BilliFitzSimons Terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB Why are we not closing borders between Victoria and NSW?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCClassic Martin Buzacott, I love you, but 'Lar Bo-aime'...that really hurts every time you say it! Please ask Ed Ayres how to pronounce La Boh√®me!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonahac Can't wait for the next installment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Blue Mountains, NSW, Australia. And thinking of all those in lockdown in Leicester right now.  Go Leicester.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Log in to Optus Sport here in Australia but have to wait for husband to get home from golf before watching the replay. Fingers crossed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@archer_rs Too good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Just read the entire trail...too too good! Thanks for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jarrapin @Peter_Fox59 Confirms that there has been long term dumbing down by media and politicians so that the vast majority are...stupid. Not just restricted to US or UK obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @adamhillscomedy Oh please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel7 Gordon Ramsay speechless would have to be a huge improvement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner The fact that they haven't well before now is troubling. All covering their backsides?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoshorr @LCFC Isn't  it more about delivery? He only gets good crosses when Marc Albrighton is on the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srpeatling @MikeCarlton01 Many of us wondered at the time but what was tennis Australia doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster Surely so many things that are illegal under International human rights law but how to go about being heard in The Hague?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCClassic Dropped the husband at the golf course at 7am...driving home watching the clouds turn pink and listening to the ACO play Bach.  Worth getting up for. Thank you Russell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneHolley48 If they don't all disappear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMscreens @GreenGuideTV Thank you for your honest review. Too often sub standard Australian productions with terrible scripts and bad acting are given rave reviews to try to boost viewings. How on earth can such a serious topic descend into farce? Couldn't watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NdLCFC @LCFC @BenChilwell Exactly...watching it here in Oz and I was so furious watching that. Probably telling Barclay " see you next season". Hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC And once again, when Albrighton gets the most crosses in (well all the crosses into the box) why is he not starting every week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC The worst part (apart from his abysmal performance again) was watching Chilwell having a laugh with Ross Barclay after the whistle went. Does he even care and was he saying see you next season? Hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighsales @SBSOnDemand Loved Series 1-4, excited to start Series 5. Outstanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyZelic Do we have any info on why England voted for Colombia and not Australia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWorldGame @LucyZelic @Craig_Foster He'll be missed. Hope Lucy has the job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBursztynski @normboy562 @PhillipAdams_1 I've been thinking about that a lot lately. How can an autocratic, ultra-conservative, mean spirited, elitist government possibly be called liberal...time for a name change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore My thoughts exactly Stan. I'm an English woman in lockdown in Australia. We've got our fair share of plonkers here too but we're in a panic when cases rise to 30 in Australia. Bonkers! PS Go Leicester!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @AusRepublic So disappointing but was a reason given?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring it on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto in the UK. How would you feel as a health worker when you see large numbers of your population not even trying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just so you know President #Trump  https://t.co/ho89dJxQEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackEDeacon @dannysimpson Oh yes please. Best comment Jack Deacon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 No hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course if they slowed the testing down there wouldn't  be the cases ?!!! ü§î Wake up America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Defenders did their job although Chilwell not good enough again. Midfield was woeful. Ndidi rusty and Mendy truly awful. Maddison needs to grow up, stop hitting the ground and he not as good as he thinks he is! . Strikers never had a chance. Need Albrighton to deliver to Vardy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCClassic Awesome, moving music from Jaara Niylamum. And thank you for sharing the story behind it. We need to honour our first nation people by playing more like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Artbymonique @letswinin2020 @MatthewJshow @realDonaldTrump And unfortunately neither are his supporters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyBarnes My husband also admits to loving Doris Day as his older sister used to sing it around the house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Love that place. Visited a couple of years ago. Feel so sad that the tourists won't be coming this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh Several 'no surprises' and Margaret Cuneen was there!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 I'd love to know why a veil of secrecy by the media around Jones' private life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think they should have waited a couple of weeks to see if there's a spike after the protests.  https://t.co/qkCtfsBGU5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz There were a few glimpses and mentions. My guess is he chose not to feature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyZelic Looking forward to watching Premier League again and in particular Leicester City!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philsmithchic @HarveyWilms @Peter_Fitz Only a Union supporter would say that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QandA @abcnews WHY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PictonChris @Peter_Fox59 Incredibly depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Always love that quaint phrase 'must of'. Says it all every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albericie Along with Bronwyn and Abbott. No words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCclassic #classic100 I could stay in lockdown forever listening to the Beethoven Top 100! Thank you ABC Classic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marquelawyers Very few. Isn't that the point? This government is a master at the smoke and mirrors game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Of course it is useless. No surprises there. This government is a master of appearing to provide and then making it almost impossible to qualify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericperipatetic Another extraordinary story Eric. In awe of Dr #AnastasiaVasilyeva. How on earth do you dig these stories out, let alone report on them in such detail during the pandemic?  Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Donald, Donald...you'd be a much better President if you simply took responsibility and stopped the blame game. You fool nobody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@russelltorrance Exceptionally beautiful choice of music on your programme this morning Russell. Swooned to Jacqueline Du Pr√© and loved Slava's This Time. What a way to start the day! Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamliaw loved your article in today's SMH Adam (I'm  starving what's for dinner). As a full time Mum I always rushed home from work to cook dinner for 5.  Feel sad that there is a perception these days that cooking is either hard or more expensive than fast food.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DalrympleWill Stay safe. Here in Australia we've  had drought, bushfires, floods and now Covid. I think Mother Earth is trying to tell us something! PS Enjoyed your talk with Richard Fydler ABC Radio recently, thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@udderrunner @ljstone09 My mother almost died aged 5 from scarlet fever, diphtheria and whooping cough all within 12 months. Half the children in her class died.  Unfortunately these protesters have not grown up with these stories.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>32,000 Covid-19 deaths and rising in the UK. 32,000. How are you feeling now Boris voters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK road deaths for 2019...1,870. UK Covid deaths so far in 2020 32,000 and rising. Does that answer the question do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or he's been watching Insiders!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As another ¬£10 Pom...I have to agree with you! That was the stupidest and most embarrassing  question of the night but brilliantly addressed. (Actually, how's the Covid death numbers going in the UK versus road deaths I wonder?).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 My grandsons' main concern is that they'll have grown out of their very cool new football boots before they've had chance to wear them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamishNews Yes entirely predictable. Was only just discussing this scenario with my son this morning. Scomo saying one thing and Gladys another. Not everyone will take the trouble to research the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homeless, hungry, jobless...the vulnerable affected by Covid-19 and the CEO of Macquaroe Bank takes home $18m a year. Shemara Wikramanayake how do you sleep at night?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster @UniversitySA Love your work Craig!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighsales Mark Humphries' take-off of Marina Abramovic last night...too good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isaac Newton invented calculus in self-isolation during the Great Plague. He didn't have kids to look after  https://t.co/FgBx0fYe4m via @ConversationEDU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamsuey @AlanBixter Yep, same in the Blue Mtns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great tweet James. You've really started something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 A Gentleman in Moscow...like watching paint dry (but I know this is a minority view!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonSCampbell Working at what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's being done about Clive Palmer and his full-page newspaper ads touting hydroxyChloroquine?  #HydroxyChloroquine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelPascoe01 Is that what he looks like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrKRudd @Peter_Fox59 Is that for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Donald, pay attention. This is how it's done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 Really missing grandkids but some good news from Gladys this morning. And incidentally, compare her impressive note free briefing each morning with Donald's embarrassing efforts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I really think you are overdoing it now Donald. Losing all credibility. Look it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@normanswan I can cope with social isolation, I can cope with  toilet paper shortages, I can cope (just) with not seeing children and grandchildren. What really p...es me off is seeing so many people flouting the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruskin147 @OrlaGuerin But why doesn't she call him out? Does she need the job that badly that she forgoes the ethics of her profession to pander to Trump? Her silence is so disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_haigh Had to turn him off. But full marks to Kristina.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerrySerio @KKeneally Yes. So annoying...asking the question and then not waiting for the reply. Kristina handled it well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @smh I've definitely noticed a slackening off...Groups out chatting over coffee,  neighbours with visitors' cars in their driveways. I haven't seen my children or grandchildren for a month. So bloody frustrating when most if us are trying to do the right thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelSpring17 Or a deliberate ploy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 üò•<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelPascoe01 @PhillipAdams_1 Yes most inconspicuous. First time I'd seen the NSW Governor on the news yesterday too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GladysB Could we please have a reminder about social distancing and no visitors. Far too many people breaking the rules and judging by comments on social media people don't even seem to know what the rules are. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar You could almost excuse Trump due to lunacy and incompetence . She should know better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovHowardDean Imagine having to defend the indefensible?  She must really need that job. Embarrassing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But let's hope Trump gets a taste of his own medicine...literally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @smh Interestingly enough was speaking to family in the UK this week and I must say I was somewhat surprised  that they seemed to have no idea of statistics in Australia. And where is Boris?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveKinlan @MikeCarlton01 Thatcherism alive and well. And working class voters voted to keep it that way. Depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpilger Please can Australia be rescued from the scourge of Thatcherism too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 Shouldn't he be being tried for war crimes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaTrioli Keep calling it out. Same goes for racist comments...we've kept silent for too long, often at the risk of seeming impolite or at the risk of losing 'friends'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could I have my Ansett frequent flier points back too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjrowland68 @TurnbullMalcolm @abc730 Genuine and refreshingly honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicola70070968 @JessWalshVic @FatherBob I was struggling for words to adequately express my disgust but you've nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMCLibrary Missing you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he's trying to blame the World Health Organisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albericie So is Year 5 grammar (but at least they are doing it). Signed Bamboozled Granny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neilpharaoh Same rules as everyone else...you have to be joking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KiamaChris @Peter_Fox59 I'm completely disgusted at the outcome of the Pell decision but to tar all lawyers with the same brush is just plain ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighsales It would be timely to interview Peter Fox (Walking Towards Thunder) and Sarah Ferguson!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@415holgate @MikeCarlton01 Too good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for those who missed Revelation Episode 3 first time around...more important than ever in light of Pell's acquittal today. ABC iview...watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Unfortunately. I'm crying for those boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am crying for those boys and their families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jimi2tone @Al_Mc17 @MikeCarlton01 Let's hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually it's a terrible day for the law and for justice. One would hope that they would go hand in hand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusonNews @ABCTV Let's hope those victims who were brave enough to speak out will encourage others (and there will be many) to speak out also. Strength in numbers. And we must never allow this to be swept under the carpet any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@murpharoo I've put it on the husband's to do list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @HachetteAus Well deserved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annabelcrabb I'd like to call for a ban on every press conference where the audience can't hear the question being asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusonNews The NZ copper had them sussed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 $25m salary completely obscene.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ericperipatetic @ForeignOfficial Love your work Eric. Are you still in Italy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayellemm Looks like it but he's going hard in the solarium!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too good. Wonder what will take over the streets of Sydney? Hope it's wombats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnlittle He could afford to keep it afloat himself couldn't  he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MargotSaville @sallyjsara @GrogsGamut I'd been searching for it for ages Margot and then finally found the DVD in our local library. Doesn't  appear to be on Netflix unfortunately although a quick Google finds it on YouTube and Google Play Movies for $3.99. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know the feeling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like the 'notional' bush fire relief fund, I'll believe it when I hear that people have actually seen the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusonNews @nialfulton No words!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallyjsara @GrogsGamut Was wondering how you were doing Sally (after watching the film A Private War about Marie Colvin the other night). Hats off to you and all the other female foreign correspondents. I am in awe of Orla Guerin, Marie, Martha Gellhorn, you and all the others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they've got it down to a fine art.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Join a union. Now there's a novel idea. Most people have forgotten why people fought and died for unions in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @ScottMorrisonMP @realDonaldTrump I think he thinks he's Winston Churchill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighsales Re newly announced subsidies, please ask him where 'the button' is on the ATO website as announced by Scomo! Also "We are experiencing high call volumes resulting in long wait times. If you've been affected by COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) and need assistance, visit¬†COVID-19."!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh this gets worse...click on News &amp; Media and announcements appear but in no particular date order!  https://t.co/0J37YNrXcA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilCygnus Any other time or place there'd be an outcry. The apathy and acceptance of the status quo  is beyond comprehension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelindaJones68 @MathiasCormann Yes disappointing in the extreme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennyleong It's the "I'm not racist but ..." brigade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsidersABC @J_C_Campbell Loved that bit! Honesty so refreshing in these times of Government smoke and mirrors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annabelcrabb Yes yes yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words he didn't have a clue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathywilcox1 You mean like Jacinda Ardern?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipWeir18 @Michaeldmac2006 @PhillipAdams_1 @MikeCarlton01 @Peter_Fox59 Extraordinary. Even the media is now accepting the new normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could we get @andrewprobyn to ask #ScottyFromMarketing what has happened to this money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spockarama @Pnutzs76 @PhillipAdams_1 @MikeCarlton01 @Peter_Fox59 @WHO And the saddest thing is, people would still vote for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grumpyMichael @InsidersABC @David_Speers @MathiasCormann Do you mean that 'notional' bushfire fund?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsidersABC @David_Speers @MathiasCormann Matthias Cormann, the king of waffle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesSzulc @JmarrMarr @PhillipAdams_1 @MikeCarlton01 @Peter_Fox59 Yes definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alancumming16 Yes and particularly now I've read your book. Ooh this is exciting. You are now 'following me'!!! Sorry about all the government rants!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBell7 Well yes there are 2 points really aren't there Peter Bell?...1. The government's bushfire relief fund appears to be a lie and 2. Is all the money that was donated to other organisations getting through to the people who need it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And anyone who hasn't read it should!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markdreyfusQCMP @Peter_Fox59 How can this be happening, how can it be allowed to happen? Is there nothing that can be done to remove these incompetent buffoons from power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I missed something? Has this been buried under coronavirus? #ScottyFomMarketing @PhillipAdams_1 @MikeCarlton01 @Peter_Fox59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 William Deane every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alancumming I know I've been very slow on the uptake but I'm  self-isolating with 'Not My Father's Son' here in the Blue Mountains, NSW. All I can say is thank you. Your book making bush fires, floods and now Covid-19 just a little easier to bear. ‚ù§<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samanthamaiden He's doing online schooling from Trump! #ScottyFromMarketing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKoutsantonisMP @Peter_Fox59 Smart? What compared to Trump? #ScottyFromMarketing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuentinDempster @Peter_Fox59 Presumably for the same reason people presenting with symptoms at hospitals are being refused testing and told to go home. Laziness, mismanagement and negligence. Take a leaf out of Singapore's book and don't  give us that crap about us being a 'different country'!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Can we include the Greenie crew in that?...surprised they've not been blamed for coronavirus too.

<|startoftext|>@TracyWesterman So reassuring!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes and hardly a revelation for Peter, the victims and their families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that's way too extreme left wing if not downright verging on the Communist Jeremy. Wonder if all those proud working class Conservative voters are going to regret not voting Labour?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Obviously hasn't seen Ken Loach's latest film, Sorry We Missed You.  https://t.co/u8ZJFGmIIz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 @Peter_Fitz @MikeCarlton01 Watch Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You and explain why anyone would vote for the Boris', Morrisons and Trumps of this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can #ScottyFromMarketting possibly be stupid enough to make this announcement as if it's  a good thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 And seriously, urging everyone to go out for a Chinese meal...particularly Three Sisters Chinese in Katoomba (if you can get there in the rain!). Sad to see these places being avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But not surprising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this will just be the start of it. Chinese restaurants are very quiet!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 And the problem is that this lack of empathy, humanity and leadership is becoming the new normal so people are getting used to it. She'll NOT be right mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can he possibly see that this is appropriate when Australia is a war zone? Genuine question. #scomomustgo, #bushfirecrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadFckingWitch @MarciaDevlin But don't  you worry about it #scomofrommarketing Enjoy the fireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bushfirecrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Scomo's out tonight watching the fireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMorrisonMP So pleased you enjoyed your overseas trip Scott Morrison and now about to watch the fireworks from Kirribilli House. Oh by the way, Australia is burning and it's a war zone out there but don't you worry about it. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BocaR97 @vardy7 Me too (but I'll let you off)! Congratulations to you and your family and delighted Leicester are still 2nd. With love from a very smokey Blue Mountains, NSW x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMorrisonMP I'm  Australian and you are definitely #notmyPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @ScottMorrisonMP And he's still smirking. Not mine either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This says it all really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMorrisonMP I cannot begin to fathom why fire ravaged communities would have you anywhere near them. You are a complete embarrassment on every level and Australians deserve better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyBarnes @Craig_Foster Can't  we take it a step further and call #gameover on Scomo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlboMP Oh yes ...he's  exactly the man they voted for and those people get exactly what they deserve unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Absolute disgrace as far as I'm concerned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zalisteggall @AboutTheHouse @ScottMorrisonMP Getting scarier by the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC Chilwell is good but Fuchs is still a better defender/tackler/header/positioner/crosser/thrower-inner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennyweez @stephendziedzic And in Malaysia and many other countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlboMP About time we had that conversation. Now what about the legalities of what this government is doing under international human rights laws?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And our government has the audacity to criticise China over human rights abuses?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it goes on....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC How could anyone leave this brilliant Foxes Family for a few extra $$$ and a mediocre club? (Not naming any names)! ‚ù§ from Oz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fox59 @loudfence So has anything improved post Royal Commission?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 @LCFC @67Kelechi You had me worried for a minute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 So you must be doing something right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendy_Bacon @Peter_Fox59 Well done to The Project for promoting this book. Peter Fox you are a legend for bringing this to light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz This book should be shouted from the roof tops. The extent of abuse by Catholic priests and the cover up by its most senior members is beyond belief. Peter Fox should be hailed a hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Dele Alli...good to see him back on form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@executivestyle Advertising $4,000 dresses and completely over the top 'stuff' I find highly offensive and insensitive when there are so many people (and animals) doing it tough. Bad timing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Was just thinking the same thing. Hard to fathom in this day and age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster If there was crowd funding to help prosecute this government, I'd cough up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 üò≠üò≠üò≠Devastating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford very proud of you for not reacting to the blatant head-butt. Should have been a red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could sustitute New Zealand for Scotland!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Him and so many others. Take a look inside Villawood Concentration Camp. Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group can tell a few stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadFckingWitch No doubt about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DohaDebates @drkerrynphelps @BehrouzBoochani One by one...We also need to focus attention on those incarcerated in Villawood Concentration Camp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a difference...  https://t.co/OBgj1dPfRm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster @jacindaardern Little by little...this is exciting news. Next let's take a look at what's going on in Villawood. Young Tamils incarcerated for 3 years without trial or processing. How can that be legal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is such exciting news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankelly08 Missing you on RN Fran but so impressive on ABC News this morning. Not missing a beat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Any chance of interviewing Ken Loach on LNL Phillip? As with all his work Sorry We Missed You, such an important film in today's climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This government is causing me nearly as much stress as the bush fires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackieKayPoet PS Amazing photo...you can tell a lot from a face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackieKayPoet Dear Jackie...ashamed to say, living in Australia, I only recently discovered you on a Desert Island Discs podcast. In the midst of reading Red Dust Road, I decided to Google you to see what you look like, only to find this announcement about your Dad. So sorry for your loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juanita_Phillip @PhillipAdams_1 But now is not the time to talk about it?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tzarimas ABC newsreader..."twenny twenny"...really Helen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn A question from a Brit living in Australia. How can these ideals be the cause of so much negativity? Why is Jeremy Cornyn the cause of so much negativity? And why is a demonstrable liar and self-serving narcissist leading the polls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sterling7 Admirable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I absolutely despair of the morons supposedly 'governing' this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where has racism come from?... https://t.co/0VPqXkS9VW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL 64 but kicking myself for not making Vardy captain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 All of the above but especially videos of the dogs...I've  missed them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyZelic Totally agree Lucy. Not a fan of Arsenal fans. I don't  like booing the opposition either...So disrespectful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradfordTerrier @dannysimpson Still miss you at Leicester Danny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC @OfficialFPL Schmeichel, S√∂y√ºnc√º and Vardy...kicking myself for not making Vardy captain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Easy to see why football is the beautiful game! The best part of tonight's match was the national anthems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldCroaky @MikeCarlton01 Yes I agree but on this leg...old plane, terrible legroom, poor food, generally substandard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Avoid Qantas at all costs and to be honest Singapore Airlines wasn't much better on the same leg last month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They call it 'post truth' apparently. Trump, Boris and Scomo are very very good at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 Ah you're back. I've missed you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GretaThunberg I don't  know you Greta but something tells me that you are stronger than all the hater/deniers put together. Stay strong and proud. We at behind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoops! (But he should still be in the starting 11)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 Listened to your wonderful Desert Island discs interview the other day whilst driving from the Blue Mountains to Sydney. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 I had a dog that howled like that after our other dog died. I have had dogs all my life but never knew a dog could grieve like she did. That sound will haunt me forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewmac71 @PhillipAdams_1 Don't recall saying Australia is a terrible place Andrew but the government should be doing much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Ah yes but he "strongly disagrees" with the Court's decision!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marquelawyers I can't believe there are so many of these plonkers judging by comments on fb. So depressing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 But what is more depressing is that people voted for him. A 'friend' recently told me "he's a fantastic prime minister"...sent me into a complete decline!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Although she wouldn't want to live here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodreads Penang (Gift of RaIn)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@screek7 @LucyZelic That is quite funny! Actually I love Adelaide and Canberra!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QandA @KerryOBrien @Jan__Fran @PaulFletcherMP @Bowenchris @dai_le Kerry O'Brien all over Paul Fletcher...still got it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leighsales Love your show! Especially tonight...Allessian guy and the joey man. Important messages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallymcmanus @abcnews Obscene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 @LCFC Hasn't the penny dropped with your Manager yet...you don't win without Marc Albrighton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Brexit shenanigans are getting sillier and sillier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#tantwaneng please write another book!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz But will the people be brave enough to vote for Jeremy? I doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLibraryBear 13!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLibraryBear Oh Sara, that is heartbreaking. Have a feeling Mia will be joining your boy soon. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC But where is Marc Albrighton?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm constantly battling to understand how we've come to this and what this country has become. üò≠üò≠üò≠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissieEvert Very disappointing comments about Serena pre Sharapova game. Her behaviour was abysmal. The umpire was doing his job. The booing was unacceptable. Poor form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 @LCFC Well that's what always happens when Albrighton is on the subs bench. No-one else consistently getting balls up to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and would love to be able to watch them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm with you PF. And while we're on the subject of the World (Yes World) Swimming Champs, what does it say about Aus sport's coverage that not one tv channel is covering this event and after 2 gold medals and 2 world records last night, not a mention on the 10am ABC news radio?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews Just listened to 10am news. 2 gold medals to Australia in the World Swimming Championships last night...one a new world record and one equalling  the World record...and not a mention. Bad enough that there is no coverage on any tv channel. What a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Duncan Scott given same reprimand as Sun Yang. FINA can't differentiate between those with moral standards and drug cheats. Shame on them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigV2011WCE An absolute disgrace! Hours and hours of NRL and AFL and Ariane Titmus wins a gold medal at the World Championships and no-one gets to see it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ShowSwimmingOnTV Nothing on Australian tv either including free to  air and pay tv. What a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissiepman @adam_peaty @BBCSport @Dad72Swim You're lucky. Not one channel in Australia covering the World Championships!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goodreads The Spy and the Traitor by Ben Macintyre<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PenguinUKBooks Please come to Sydney! Just finished the book...life will never be the same. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Just finished reading The Spy and the Traitor after listening to your interview with the author some months ago. All I can say is Thank You...what a story!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaGillard Thanks for last night's chat with Jenny Brockie at Sydney Town Hall. Attended at the invitation of my daughter. So inspiring for women young and old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannysimpson So sad to see you go. Love from Oz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonysquires love Back Page Tony and love your work But...How could that comment from your panel member (Merrick Watts?) on the parentage of Prince Harry be acceptable? Extremely poor taste and so not funny. Hope we don't  see him again. Bring back Ryan Fitgerald.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayellemm @ABCthedrum @vanbadham Oh but wouldn't have missed Teena for the world!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Craig_Foster @prayutofficial @fatma_samoura @FIFAcom Also wondering if Vichay's son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (King Power and Leicester City chairman) can have any influence?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vardy7 Best Christmas present ever Jamie, thank you from Australia. Christmas greetings to you and your family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh Most Liberal politicians have never had to fight for anything...so out of touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jess_Irvine  "Don't get me wrong, some of my favourite people are oldies".  Jessica, your article 'It's about Franking Time' (SMH 29 Nov)..I found Frankly ageist, patronising and offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CUhlmann Big business!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh Not to worry, if past examples are anything to go by, it'll all be swept under the carpet and he'll  get his own tv show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryMaguire93 And with you back in the team...even stronger! Amazing game this morning (in Oz!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 @RebekahVardy @OxfordUnion You two...as a Leicester girl now living in Oz, so proud of the role models you have become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoodbankAus @Bowenchris @PaulFletcherMP @ScottMorrisonMP This government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBartlett Couldn't  agree more...especially in the light of the Invictus Games raising awareness of ex servicemen's struggles. What an absolute travesty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyZelic Heard a LC supporter interviewed... "I am 56 years old and I'm crying for a man I never met. That is the effect Vichai had on everyone". My feelings exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkerrynphelps Pauline Hanson, please stop making a fool of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PaulHayward As a long term Leicester City supporter now living in Australia (and so wishing I was in Leicester right now), may I say thankyou for your Telegraph article picked up in today's Sydney Moring Herald.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jeff Sachs I love you! #qanda<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Well if you don't mind my saying so, we need more Phip Adams in this world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LCFC @England @Madders10 @BenChilwell @HarryMaguire93 Albrighton should be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classless and clueless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And will we be able to read about it amongst the 10 pages of rugby league (non) news in the SMH?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @smh Agree, but good fodder for Plain Writing consultants. I know of one who uses the SMH regularly for 'how not to' examples!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remind you of anyone from last night's show? #qanda  https://t.co/j9ISVrn9qE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@braddybb @QandA What it must be like to be so ignorant yet so confident. Truly painful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_Gascoigne8 Nice words Gazza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing you on SBS World News Anton. Hope you are doing OK @AntonEnus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neighbour_s @FergusonNews Because of course there's not much space in Australia!!!  Come on Aussies...get creative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scribepub Just finished reading...such a privilege to share this journey with Kim Mahood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz But so predictable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LornaJaneActive ...re your  'Places that made me'...SMH travel section March 3/4...you say if you hadn't  moved to Australia "maybe I would have been a designer of librarian-wear instead". When did you last go near a library? How gobsmackingly ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barrel46 @james_maggie91 What a complete plonker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_MissHenderson @7olympics Actually my guess is that it's a man in charge of the programming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_MissHenderson @7olympics And so far today nothing of the ice dancing team competition. Shocker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7olympics @Channel7 @JannyMedvedeva Yes it would be nice to see some ice-skating!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't understand when 7 advertise live coverage of women's cross-country skiing, they are showing reruns for at least the third time of the women's  moguls??? @7olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvcalendar @herdyshepherd1 This is absolute gold. James Rebanks, thank you so much for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLibraryBear Apparently it was awesome in Penang!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonieMShort1 @richardaedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Millennial job interview. Too good!  https://t.co/j9ISVrn9qE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonieMShort1 So was I and somewhat gobsmacked that there was no discussion around knowledge loss or knowledge retention in times of organisational change. Won't be hiring these guys anytime soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericperipatetic @abcnews @ForeignOfficial PS Loved the music!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericperipatetic @abcnews @ForeignOfficial Great story on Greenland on Foreign Correspondent tonight, thank you. Especially after just reading your book and chapter on Greenland from 10 years before. I thought there'd be more cabbages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herdyshepherd1 Lord Howe Island<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Blame the parents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7tennis @Optus @AusOpen Will Ferrell??? Wasn't even funny. Roger stuck for words. US humour not required at the Australian Open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Wasn't a fan but showed signs today. Give him a go guys! (Never thought I'd  be watching my team v Fleetwood here in Australia!).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryMaguire93 And thank you for making ours last Saturday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 Jamie Vardy...proud of how you have become such a positive role model as well as a great player. Merry Christmas and good luck in the next few matches (from a supporter in Oz!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgloveroz Just read your beautiful article 'Ghosts of Christmas past' in the Herald this morning...and cried!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 But seriously, what is the real reason for the media blanket on Barnaby's indiscretions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardy7 Beautiful picture Jamie and well said. Good luck at the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishGovWatch @MikeCarlton01 Wish our Prime Minister in Australia had that much integrity. #undertabledeals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @WhiteHouse Certainly a House of Horrors at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Not to mention the Iraq war and weapons of mass destruction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QandA @JoshFrydenberg Another politician more concerned with personal ambition than the future of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewhayden @4corners @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump She was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusonNews Outstanding, incisive and professional interview with Hilary. Congratulations Sarah.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abc730 @leighsales Leigh Sales congratulations! Salmon Rushdie one minute, primary school kids the next. Fabulous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport So it wasn't that exciting but at least they're through. Watched the game in Oz this am &amp; it was a lot better than the Aus v Syria match!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipAdams_1 Yep, definitely out and about with the warmer weather. Hope the dogs are OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbc5live @vardy7 @England Proud of you. Please continue to be a great role model on and off the pitch. The game needs you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLibraryBear Ah must be the F1...have a great time Sara!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 "We're a middle-of-the-road country with ambitions for change...that‚Äôs come to see its mission as preventing the future."...GOLD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Sad news. Worked with Penny for many years. My condolences.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealBozza Great punditry tonight Bozza. Hope Ange takes notice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Remind me again...Who's  been doing the hatchet job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resourcefultype @MikeCarlton01 @TonyAbbottMHR Impressive on Q&amp;A the other night Ms Forster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLibraryBear @qantaswallabies They wouldn't if Australia had someone who could kick goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebekahVardy You and Jamie should be so proud of the way you both conduct yourselves. Just saying. Stay strong. üòö<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @AJENews So so true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Condolences. My Dad was a copper in Leics in the 60s &amp; fondly remembers your Dad on his market stall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz @smh What a kick in the teeth this will be for the government if it's a landslide YES. Bring it on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Logic would suggest no-one would fall for this cheap ploy but then again?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Heaven forbid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Queue_Reads Unpack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDE66 World Record never under threat!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayellemm Yep...a real eye-opener!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDE66 Great job at World Athletics. Loving your commentary.  You might want to mention on air...the great Betty Cuthbert just died age 79.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 How very 'liberal'!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz Mental health issues is putting it mildly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Thatcherite greed and folly. Oh what a legacy that woman has left us. Surely it's time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlaGuerin  you are an absolute legend. Thank you for what you do but take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guardian_sport Sanchez cheated by pretending he'd been hit in the face and then he lied about it...and that's  OK?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz You could always try football. Been some cracking Champions league and FA Cup matches recently!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aristotle288 @Peter_Fitz Think you've  just proved my point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz And then there are Australian rugby followers...one dimensional, ignorant and parochial. Quite sad really!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 Thought it was one of those Aussie footy award nights with the Wags till I saw Trump in the background.<|endoftext|>
