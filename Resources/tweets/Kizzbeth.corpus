<|startoftext|>@Ewing_Official @jmorley13 @ipliskin_Ltjg @amandapalmer How does feeding people hurt children?

Not the kid‚Äôs fault!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ewing_Official @jmorley13 @ipliskin_Ltjg @amandapalmer So you‚Äôre against supporting children after birth. So this isn‚Äôt really about abortion. It‚Äôs about controlling people. Might save you a lot of debate if you were just up front about that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anxiety disorder won out over hyper completionism. Had to quit @nerdist podcast in the middle. #Apocalypse #JackAntonoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pridemovie looks like just another jokey feelgood tale of misfits coming together. It's a moving, funny, intelligent history lesson. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best ending is one where everyone knows how it ended, they all think it ended differently, and they all could be right. #fb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beebott Someone from my class posted a few but he lives in N Hampton so it might have been a different stop on the tour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>5 mins is not a "short" video to show me how to do something! #MicrowaveGeneration #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beebott And painfully misleading if you've been a part of the BlogHer community. @WendiAarons @ItsSuebob @BlogHer @washingtonpost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for fuck's sake. #Childfree @WendiAarons @ItsSuebob @BlogHer @washingtonpost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suspect someone will pick this up again today as the work continues. #FightFor15 #fb  https://t.co/I8zJhOSVVD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beebott That's the real problem they have. They've completely eroded consumer confidence. Glad you did wind up with your steps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lotta old white dudes in top hats out here today. #TheKnick #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good time to remind you that a pet's microchip is only useful if you register it annually. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QOTD: "We live in NYC. We will not go wine, snack, or knit-less. All things are possible." Me. I said that. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#fb   https://t.co/SrWquztD4V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something else I'm going to hate about #ELECTION2015: So many people substituting "a female" for "a woman." Not that subtle othering. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out The Knick has the most elaborate craft services of anything that's filmed in our neighborhood in years. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I blink so much?!?!? (Watching video of oneself is hard.) #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This aisle has condoms, Monistat, &amp; tampons. Worst sex ed narrative EVER. #fb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@efrex @ChipFaust I never got to this one as a kid. I'll be sending it to a young reader, glad it has a history of good impressions!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>4 of 5 stars to Wild by Cheryl Strayed  https://t.co/B2OToGjDtm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel incredibly stupid not to have realized that The Master is a completely unveiled story of Scientology. PSH even looks like LRH. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beebott Are you going to run for Pres now, too? I mean, if a brain tumor is the pre-req...I'd rather you be my leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beebott That sounds like a system problem and you might actually get the credit. Fingers crossed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beebott call customer service! You have the proof on your other device!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beebott I wonder if there was a problem with their system. I think I lost some last night too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 1 is him explaining to the local police chief as they hurry to the crime scene where Anne will solve everything.  http://t.co/e41CBBlNoV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, the new Disney pipeline means that every story goes through animated feature, broadway musical, then live action feature? #recycle #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I apologize to all the political humorists for that last tweet. #abolishelectionseason #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be happy if no one announced their presidential run until the night before. Plenty of time to google their track record &amp; decide. #fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never punish the growl, please. It's communication. We need that.  https://t.co/wbET28DWmR<|endoftext|>
