<|startoftext|>Hey @WSJopinion - the woman who pioneered the process that makes the Pfizer vaccine work, is a "Dr" with a PhD. According to your columnist today, she should not be referred to as "Dr" since she lacks a medical degree. #JosephEpstein #JillBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBastel Actually, now this would be a genius way to party with neighbors with lots of social distance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz That‚Äôs great.   Just out of curiosity, which country was it that refused to buy a second batch of the Pfizer vaccine, and is now on track to fall way short of having enough to vaccinate everyone, due to this huge blunder, since Pfizer has lots of other commitments.   Wonder why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That question mark is haunting me. The They Might Be Giants show was in Feb 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donmoyn People called him (the writer of this piece, Epstein) "doctor" because probably nearly every other Professor at Northwestern has a PhD, while Epstein only has a BA, it would have been mostly assumed that he had a PhD when he was a Professor there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donmoyn Can you imagine outrage if Jill Biden was given a Professor role w/just a BA (like the writer of this piece, Epstein was)? There would be congressional hearings on how she got the job. Does Epstein know "Dr. Kissinger" also has a PhD and not an MD? Most medical doctors use MD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aetiology Does Epstein not know MDs generally  don't put "Dr." in front of their names anymore? They usually use MD as a suffix. He gets paid to write?

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 81.3 million for Biden - 74.2 million for you = YOU LOST BY APPROX 7,100,000 votes and you lost by 74 electoral votes. 306 to 232. I don't know why you keep bringing up the 74 million. Were you just trying to beat your number from last time? That is not how it works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxKennerly Medical docs don't put "Dr." in front of their names that much anymore, in my experience. They'll write "John Smith, MD".

<|startoftext|>@TTuberville Shorter Tubby: the game is over when we have counted most of the GOP areas. Once we get around to counting the much more populous (MORE PEOPLE MORE TIME TO COUNT) Democratic areas..let's just call a time out &amp; say...game over.

<|startoftext|>From what I've heard, Trump is running TV ads in very few states, however they just played one here in NYC. All it said was that Biden was a professional politician (true, and we need this) and he'll raise taxes (but it's only on people making over 400k).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the trick Trump team is trying to do is this.

<|startoftext|>@ZevShalev Secret Trump voter they are quoting is a) a lesbian b) who also lives in Manhattan c) has a car d) cares about her 401k going up 19% even though she‚Äôs in her 50s d) lost her job &amp; had to use Obamacare but it was too expensive for her-um, remember Cobra?

<|startoftext|>@Caissie @jdesmondharris Four is correct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patrickroddy Definitely getting famous &amp; future earnings the fame from being on TV brings. They get compensation/free stuff during the show as well.

<|startoftext|>@LucienSmith An anonymous source in Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs right wing tabloid claims he did illegal acts that would have been likely noticed and prosecuted. A convenient story.

<|startoftext|>@Caissie Due to the cost of the ingredients, they do have to charge a relatively high price for it. I‚Äôve been watching my carb intake, it has only 1 net carb. For a bread like product (that you can make a sandwich with) it is really hard to beat in terms of the carbs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caissie Slightly off topic, but Cauliflower Thins (from Trader Joe‚Äôs) made with Parmesan, egg and other ingredients are so amazingly tasty. Life changing. Almost seems healthy too? Maybe? So good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pdxkitty1 Trump‚Äôs mission is we are talking about the building owner, whose building was demolished by riots. Instead of talking about Trump‚Äôs hundreds of serious failures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdxkitty1 They want us to get all worked up over this. Trump does 100 evil things a day. The guy does own the building. He has insurance too I assume. So no comparison to the loss of life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneapplebaum @GovHowardDean I too thought this was crazy at first but the guy actually does own the building so it isn‚Äôt actually too misleading. There are so many other things to get upset about<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustOKOnline I‚Äôd be interested to see a comparison: Trump supporters‚Äô net worth in their imagination vs the actual number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustOKOnline Used to have a theory 1) GOP policies are known to benefit the rich 2) if one voices support for GOP then they likely agree w/ said policies 3) it‚Äôs fair for people to assume they may be rich themselves 4) even if they aren‚Äôt rich they get the feeling of being part of that class<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs the middle of the night and President TV Tattle is still up pondering aloud if his viewership numbers were worse than Biden‚Äôs or not. Republicans are more online than Dems? Yeah maybe in Russia. TV ratings are a constant fixation for him. Governing? Notsomuch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatereeves @LucienSmith Corruption: using public resources for private gain.

<|startoftext|>Does Trump almost have a new Southern Strategy? Be extra racist to activate racist Northerners and Southerners, ones who have typically not voted?

<|startoftext|>@davehill77 In my view the electorate does not line up (at least not in the swing states we need for the White House) with this dynamic. We could have all of Bernie‚Äôs policies as the platform &amp; lose. The majority of people been brainwashed to hate progressive policies. Very tough to change<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donwinslow We need it for the Senate and the White House. I think he will give more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavMicRot One thing I don‚Äôt get is how he inherited 400 million. He‚Äôs one of four kids. Did he get a bigger share for some reason? Why more for him? Or was his dad worth 1.6 billion? Seems hard to believe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MagistraGoetz @OTOOLEFAN I totally agree AND Joe is partially at fault for him being elected. BUT this could help tear off some Trump voters who feel they have to vote for the R.

And that he supports having foreign workers and immigrant laborers? Dude - who is picking all those crops in Kansas? It ain‚Äôt white kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, apparently standing with a President who has ruined the economy (40,000,000 newly out of work and hundreds of thousands of businesses folding) and mismanaged a health crisis that has killed 160,000 people and counting is a bad thing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizRNC You can‚Äôt see what they are burning. Or where this is taking place. Could be anywhere.

But again this is Russian propaganda -it‚Äôs labeled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizRNC One person burned one bible. And Biden, who isn‚Äôt in office, is at fault? Also this video is from RUSSIA TODAY.

<|startoftext|>Yes people‚Äôs main worry right now is sports players are down on one knee (typically a sign of reverence) instead of on two feet. Not the collapse of thousands of small businesses.

<|startoftext|>@parislingard We had the same record too. He was a 5 seed. And I was a 6 seed. His points average per game was better.

<|startoftext|>@parislingard See here. This was me  https://t.co/P5CrtCGhlm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parislingard Paris. On Tuesday I was declared the winner by one point. On Thursday it was a tie due to a one point revision in favor of the Ravens for ‚Äúsacking‚Äù a running back.

<|startoftext|>@bycharlescurtis How was that running back sacked though? All of his team mates were blocking. No one was trying to receive the ball. So how was he considered a passer? This lost me the championship. The guy raised his arm to protect his body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened to me. On Tuesday I was declared the winner of the season by one point. Yesterday, @ESPNFantasy changed the Ravens score to reflect a ‚Äúsack‚Äù of a running back who wasn‚Äôt throwing to anyone. No one was looking and he was using one hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNFANSUPPORT But why was the ESPN app showing 5 points for Ravens Defense on Sunday night, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday? And now today, 6 points?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNFANSUPPORT @CoachAndre4008 If it was ruled that, it was ruled wrong and there was a flag. You can‚Äôt sack a running back with all the other offensive players blocking instead of trying to receive m. He clearly was not trying to make a forward pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoachAndre4008 @ESPNFANSUPPORT Yes me too! I won the whole season by one point. Now it‚Äôs a tie due to this ‚Äúsack‚Äù and I am showing a loss since I was a 6 seed and the guy I was playing was a 5. We even had the same record for the season. Crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you do a correction on Thursday for a game that was on Sunday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNFantasy how was a Browns running back sacked on Sunday, but the app didn‚Äôt show a Defense point for the sack until today? He was rushing not passing. He had it in one hand. And there was blocking downfield. This cost me the championship. This wasn‚Äôt a sack. See rules #pic  https://t.co/rZN9IFm4AN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@socal345 @ESPNFantasy They didn‚Äôt have it as a sack until today. No way that running back was intending to throw to a specific person. Should not count as a defense point.

<|startoftext|>@dannydo222 @MatthewBerryTMR I went from 1st to 2nd based on a stat correction giving the Ravens credit for sacking a running back who I‚Äôm not sure was really trying to do a forward pass<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@proBRUCEr @andrewcuomo @CynthiaNixon @PolitiFact Heard this clip of them sparring at the debate. MTA NYC Subway that she is referring to is run by the city.

<|startoftext|>@proBRUCEr @andrewcuomo @CynthiaNixon @PolitiFact IMHO biggest threats to Trump right now are his legal problems in NY. We cannot afford a Republican governor who will sweep this under the rug. Cuomo is taking on Trump.

<|startoftext|>@proBRUCEr @andrewcuomo @CynthiaNixon @PolitiFact I am not a fan of Cuomo by any means &amp; I appreciate your point of view, I just cannot bear thought of a Republican Governor &amp; I don‚Äôt see Nixon as all that electable.
