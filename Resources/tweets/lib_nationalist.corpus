<|startoftext|>Genocide*  Wherever I wrote homicide in thread correct it to genocide😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tried my best to bring the brutes on malabari hindus during 1921 to light.  If it is for the first time u came across this homicide, make sure you retweet/like this post.   PS- I wanted the thread to be more detailed but the twitter word limit did not allow me to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "mallabar revolt" (which now we know was a Hindu genocide) is one of the major causes of Sarvarkar converting to a "Hindu Nationalist". This incident has been wiped out of history books. The failure of khilafat movement (under gandhi) was never brought to light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>William Vincent, (Home Secretary at that tym) said "Mr. Gandhi's supporters were responsible for the terrible loss of life in Malabar."  C. Sankaran Nair wrote a strongly worded criticism of Gandhi and his support for the Khilafat Movement, accusing him of being an anarchist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot to mention that some khilafat leaders got death sentences for this homicide - 1.Kunhj Koya, President of the Khilafat Committee, Malappuram 2. Koya Tangal of Kumaramputhur, Governor of a Khilafat principality Remember it was Gandhi who started the Khilafat movement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of establishing unity that he was prepared to make light of the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafat congratulating them. He spoke of Mappilas as the "brave God-fearing Moplahs fighting for what they consider as religion and in a manner which they consider as religious."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>were so misguided as to pass resolutions of congratulations to the Moplas on the brave fight they were conducting for the sake of religion". Any person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Muslim unity. But Mr. Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>B.R. Ambedkar on this anti hindu pogrom- The blood-curdling atrocities committed by the Moplas in Malabar against the Hindus were indescribable. A wave of horrified feeling had spread among the Hindus of every shade of opinion, which was intensified when certain Khilafat leaders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These mappiah barbarics and religious fanatics are called "freedom fighters"  Many were arrested by British, some deported, some given death sentences. But they were NOT freedom fighters. They were murderers, terrorists, and rapists and deserved nothing less than death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the Mappilas burnt around a hundred houses of Hindus. The bodies of Hindu men and children were dumped in the river.  One saw saw a dead body of a six-month-pregnant Hindu woman. Her stomach was hacked in such a way that the dead fetus lied outside her body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11/n Another one goes like this  (quoting from swarajya article) "The rioters were grouped according to their duties. While one group murdered, the other group robbed; some would set houses on fire after the attack. On 9 November 1921, in a place called Vallikunnu,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they were compelled at the point of sword to open their eyes and witness the rape committed by the brute in their presence." Page 132 of "gandhi and anarchy"  https://t.co/31QjFzchyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C.Sanskaran Nair (former president of INC) writes in his book-  A respectable Nayar Lady at Melatur was stripped naked by the rebels in the presence of her husband and brothers, who were made to stand close by with their hands tied behind. When they shut their eyes in abhorrence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>7/n I highlighted "ALL" cause the mopiahs did not discriminate between the landlords and labourers, did not discriminate between man, woman, child, infant or even an unborn foetus!! This is important to highlight coz some communist historians call the malabar homicide as an agro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6/n considered it their "religious duty" to make an Islamic state.  This "revolt" was started in the wake of khilfat movement and had the support of the "legendary" MK Gandhi in intitial stages! This quickly turned from fight against British to violence against ALL hindus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5/n  to make an Islamic Nation out of Malabar. Malabar saw a rapidly increasing Muslim population since Mysore invasion in 18th century (by "great" Tipu Sultan) There were many violent riots starting since mid 1830s. These always involved the murder of Hindus by mapillas who<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got some urgent work would update the thread after 1 hour. Sorry for keeping u all wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moplah stands for Mapilla muslims predominantly found in Kerala. They are mixed descendants of Middle East and native people.  Our "history" often calls this homicide as a revolt aimed for agrarian discontent or for cause of khilafat movement. But it was a full fledged attempt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice the use of word "atleast" and that these are "official figures". In reality it included killing, rape and conversion of much higher no. of hindus! The genocide started in August 1921 and lasted till November. (Know that population of South Malabar was lesser at that tym)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fighters" by government of kerala! This genocide of Hindus of kerala is often removed from history. To understand it's scale, this is Lord Curzon's statement in Parliament- "at least 10,000 Hindus were murdered, and at least 1,000 more were forcibly converted to Mahommedanism."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/n  Making a twitter thread on Moplah "Revolt". This will be ugly, depressing and long.  I was suggested by a friend to write on this topic. But I avoided thinking it will invite unnecessary hate. But I just saw one post to know that these "revolters" are recognised as "freedom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The decision here was out and it was right!!!  The reason - bails light up earlier than stumps. It was blown out of proportion. There were two angles giving different results.

<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna In his half career he broke several records of domestic tournaments😎 Chalo bye.  And a reminder- your cricket knowledge is bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Carry on your hate for him.  U will get your answer in under 1 year. And not getting a chance- Washington Sundar gets more chances than Ashwin(in odi, t20)!!!!  So "Ashwin" is average for u😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Isilye Kohli best hai  Kohli &gt; Smith Rohit &gt; Mayank (as of now)  Technically Mayank &gt; Rohit  But telling again, Mayank "average" nah hai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna He never played t20 internationals!!!! Mayank has record to be the fastest to score 2 double tons in test cricket (broke Don bradman's record)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Free ka gyaan- The first answer on Google is often not related to your question. Poora padha Karo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Mayank is awesome. He is not "average" in any way. His technique is superior to most indian batsmen at present.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna 😱🤐toh itna gyaan kiss baat kaaaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Yaar I am seriously not interested in arguing with u. Even a quora search could easily help u on this topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Popularity aur legendary Mei difference hota hai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Kuchh bhi. Waise ind vs Pak matches have more pressure. No comparison between Smith and Kohli in ODI, t20s.  I am not interested in even talking about it. U only saw one match, read someone's comment and made this false image.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Read fully.😂😂😂😂u are seeing "home tests". Home tests 88  Away 26  Australia is even lesser. Yaar challenge karne se pehle padh toh liya Karo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna And Kohli is better batsman than Smith. (As u don't consider test matches important)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna 😂😂😂no use arguing with u. Wait for 1 year. Take ss. Would accept my loss if it doesn't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna 26 in away tests- Rohit Sharma. I don't remember rohit's average specifically in Australia. But Mayank is better than Rohit anytime in overseas test matches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Maine Kya likha aur tumne Kya samajha. I am here saying Mayank is a great player. I never said he would replace Rohit. Rohit is in odi team till retirement. And Mayank has already replaced Rohit in test team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Okay, next u would claim Rohit is above Kohli and Steve Smith coz only Rohit has 2 double tons.  Rohit is better than Sachin as Sachin had only one 200!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karannautiyal9 @Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna Average of mayank. Rohit Sharma can't do this even in domestic test matches.  https://t.co/Wt8zAWcmYW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Hmm. U said u are good with cricketing knowledge. U should have known better😂. I don't think u ever saw any test match let alone Ranji matches. #DCvKXIP  https://t.co/me6u8eqCbG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna It looks like u don't consider test cricket as cricket. So I can't even argue. And Ranji trophy is not as easy as u are thinking it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Karannautiyal9 @Atheist_Krishna Can u pls share Average of Rohit in Australia test matches😂?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karannautiyal9 @Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna I have already told her that Mayank plays test for india. In one year, Mayank would have a permanent position in team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna Much less. Only when workload permits Starc. He would any day prefer test over odi/t20. Google Search it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GappistanRadio How can someone fix Mayank's catch to hetmyer, Jordan's catch!!! No one can exactly control their shots. Itni accuracy hoti toh baat hi Kya thi.... I really hate such crybabies who say "match fixed tha, ambani ne paise khilaya....blah blah" #DCvKXIP #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GappistanRadio "Match fixing" is only on easy terms like - more than 11 runs in 1 over, 3 wides... No one can fix a whole match. I say again NO ONE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkhilRKrishna10 @GappistanRadio @GappistanRadio is on our side here i.e. he is taking a jobs at ppl who always say any interesting match is fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna "Legendary players" tag is generally more applicable to test quality batsmen.  I don't want to drag it any more. Coz i am MI, DC fan. U will get the answer in 1 year. #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna Starc. (Only plays WC in odi, t20)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna 😂😂well then I doubt your cricket knowledge.  Fyi Mitchell starc doesn't plays odi, t20 for Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna By "endless" u mean the time Rohit would take to get into test team again???  1 year and Mayank in the odi team as well. Take ss. I am great at predictions. #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. This can be the only possible reason. But I still think tired Mayank&gt; pooran #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Im_pratihar07 @virendersehwag Frames*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna I hope u know that Mayank replaced Rohit Sharma in overseas INTERNATIONAL tests already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna International test cricket 😎 Ranji record holder. Mayank is not "average". Wait for his entry in Indian team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am generally MI at first preference. But this year Ashwin and Rahane have made DC my fav team. Ashwin deserves a chance in odi team. #DCvKXIP #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R4Rupen @Atheist_Krishna Muscles vs fat. Difference hai. It's not about weight. It's about belly fat.  #DCvKXIP #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trishaholic_ @Atheist_Krishna Mayank is not "average" at all. Search ranji performance of him. Aur test match mei he replace Rohit. #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Im_pratihar07 @virendersehwag The two time fraames are not well matched. I would give more weightage to the second pic than 1st. It was a dicey situation. Had to choose one. So u should just stop crying over it. #IPL2020 #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GappistanRadio Yeh Shreyas Iyer ki captaincy sirf mujhe hi buri lagti hai Kya???? Isse toh Ashwin/rahane acche captain the.  #DCvKXIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow the fantasy league is reducing my interest in game. For eg- I wanted Mayank to score runs (though I am a DC fan) coz I picked him in team. Why didn't Mayank play super over????? He was in such a freat flow! #DCvKXIP #IPL2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@s0m3sh @Alladkanya @srivatsayb Can they make decisions unilaterally with just 22% share? Answer is NO. Will China earn financially through it? NO (interest rate is 1.25+0.75% only) China DOESN'T have majority shareholding.(u are misunderstanding the term)  https://t.co/43f6bNvLK3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Narendranps09 @srivatsayb As I know u won't understand the meaning of status quo, here I explain it further- china increased it's soldiers and weapons on border. China has built camps on area where till Feb both sides patrolled and is now obstructing indian army to patrol. India did NOT lose any post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Narendranps09 @srivatsayb 1. Understand the meaning of LAC. Thanks to CONgress lac is not fixed. It's an area of different perception.  2. The Bank is Asian not Chinese. India has 8% stake in it and is the co owner. 3. China changed the status quo.  4. India did not lose any patrolling points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alladkanya @s0m3sh @srivatsayb I don't think he understands the meaning of holding 50%+ shares. He is intentionally blurring the line.  https://t.co/5KKEXmDO5E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeshKaBhakt @purvam_shah @s0m3sh @srivatsayb Tum log toh boycott UN, World bank, WHO bhi bol do ge as China funds some to all of the organizations.  India ka 8% share hai bank mei. Khud ke bank se paise bhi nahi lenge Kya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeshKaBhakt @purvam_shah @s0m3sh @srivatsayb China has 100% share in pubg MOBILE game. Thoda samajhdaar bano.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s0m3sh @karma33o33karm1 @srivatsayb 1. In PSUs government has shareholding above 50% 2. Learn the meaning of majority. 3. India, Russia and Germany together has as much power as China in the bank. 4. It's not a commercial bank, it's an international bank setup for Asian countries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb Nehru surrendered Pakistan, pok, cok, half of laddkh, Tibet. I still don't understand for what reason Indira Gandhi fought the war. India achieved 0 from winning the war.

<|startoftext|>@memorite007 @SachinS45739081 @simplysaurabh18 @ttindia @imrantelegraph 😂😂😂learn basics of shareholding. The decision making powers lies with all the countries. Unless china has 51%+ shares, it can't be called a china controlled bank. Fyi- the United Nations is headquartered at Geneva, Switzerland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ttindia @imrantelegraph Fake news!!!! AIIB is not "china-controlled bank" India is it's co owner with 8% stake.  https://t.co/dKHI4VEMWz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb @Vinod4INC It means, India cannot ban a product for it being a Chinese. The GOI needs to have a valid reason for taking such steps. In case of apps, the reason was lack of privacy and data leaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb @Vinod4INC ADB/World Bank/Multi-lateral procurement guidelines do not allow discrimination among firms/ countries. U should try reading the rules laid by World Bank before trying to pretend as an intellectual on such matters.  https://t.co/TK8n0XiKI3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb By your logic India should also leave United Nations as China funds 12% of it's functioning, along with being it's permanent member(only thanks to your idol jawaharlal nehru). I repeat AIIB belongs to Asia and not China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb AIIB can't be called china controlled bank. For eg- I have shares of SBI, but it doesn't bring SBI under my control. Unless a person/group has 51%+ stake in any company, decision making power lies with all the members. India is a co owner just like China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srivatsayb AIIB bank stands for ASIA infrastructure investment bank.  China has 22% stake. But India has 2nd highest stake in the bank- 8%, followed by russia, Germany. India is the co owner of the bank along with many other Asian countries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajit_singh @JoyBheem @TIinExile @mynameswatik Every argument in this world is belief vs belief. U can never prove any of it.

<|startoftext|>For those who don't know about me- I had cleared AIIMS last year with a decent rank. But I decided to take a drop and prepare for AIIMS delhi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teachers were expecting me to bring an under 100 AIR in the least. And here I am, struggling to enter the 3000 rank. As AIIMS and JIPMER has been cancelled this was my only chance. Thanks to @DG_NTA @DrRPNishank for the awesome arrangements that wasted my 1 year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rains!!!! Heavy rains. The rain water falling on iron shed made loud noise (and I mean it- too loud) Some water was splattering on me as well.(I was at corner). All these had serious toll on my performance. I committed the worst mistakes one could imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The paper was super easy (an easy paper is always bad for a hardworking student). For the initial first hour I faced direct heat. The 10 invigilators (for 60 students) were constantly chatting and disturbing. But what happened next broke me to tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Atlast the exam has ended.  I faced adverse conditions at the centre. The "room" was an open space with an iron shed. There were 60 students under the shed. A chalk line acted as partition to convert the shed into "5 rooms" The chair was of plastic and the desk was too high.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>4. Remove 1 semester. Adjust it's subjects in other sems. There won't be any loss of academic year!  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement  @DrRPNishank @PiyushGoyal @paritosh2608 @desimojito @Swamy39 @srijanpalsingh @iArmySupporter @theskindoctor13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. Increase shifts! NEET is to be conducted in pen paper mode in only 1 slot. Make the slots 4, i.e. distribute students in 4 lakh groups each and conduct exam (happens in aiims ug, gate exam, normalize the results)  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now I believe everyone understands that there are genuine problems. But what are the solutions? 1. POSTPONE exams by 1 month. Flood clears, lockdown ends in Bihar. 2. Open test centres IN EVERY DISTRICT #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akash789123 @iArmySupporter Pls read my whole thread. U would understand.  https://t.co/za3ekV6AkV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akash789123 @iArmySupporter I am okay with covid. I am not ok with floods! Double centres, distribute students in 4 groups (it happens in gate and aiims ug) there are not enough centres right now!  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akash789123 @iArmySupporter How does education loan increase? I am not asking for zero year, I am asking for 1 month postponement. It can be easily managed (said aiims ex director, IIT director) juniors, seniors ko Kya problem hogi? #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akash789123 @iArmySupporter As of now, Bihar has test centre in 2 district (for neet). Distribute students in 4 groups and do their exams at different slot to maintain social distancing. Later normalize the result (as in aiims ug, gate) #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akash789123 @iArmySupporter Postpone by 1 month. Flood clears. Open transportation. End lockdown (Bihar). Open test centres in every district. Remove 1 semester from 4/5.5 years and adjust the subjects.  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paritosh2608 @_i_am_Dev @TheDeshBhakt  Many right wingers are ignoring the issue. If u believe exams should not be postponed, I am ready to argue. But kindly don't ignore the issue. #studentskemannkibaat  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponment  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Students were preparing for exams, which they believed would be delayed. No student was giving 100% during the last month -topper(myself) or backbencher. This is reason for anxiety in everyone. This point was ignored. #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid #studentskemannkibaat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On mental pressure- To understand the above tweet, u have to think from students pov. The students situation is a case of Shepherd and wolf story. Generally we increase study hours to extreme in last 2 months.  But this time everyone was easygoing #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is subjective. Why are students in so pressure? Coz many of us expected postponement. 99.9% students procrastinated their studies. Now the students have only 13 day notification (jee mains). I wish the order had come 20 days earlier.... #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros 1. Flood clears ✅ 2. Transportation starts✅ 3. Partial Lockdown ends✅ 4. Centres are allocated in every district (a must)✅ 5. Mental condition of students improve (explained later)✅ 6. Hotels, dharamshala opens✅ #Studentskemannkibaat  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am ready for arguments if anyone wants. To all aspirants reading this, post your problems below. We need to end the miscoception among ppl that we are creating excuses. Problems are real which must be solved. #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #studentskemannkibaat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The above problems are solvable and should have been solved by now! We want postponement until  centres and corresponding districts are increased by gov. We want postponement until flood clears, transportation starts. #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid @Swamy39  #studentskemannkibaat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number of cities with NEET centres haven't increased since Jan 2020!!! 2 districts in whole Bihar!!! Don't give enough options during registration and everyone will get cities of 1st priority #Studentskemannkibaat #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponment  https://t.co/VCW4v1v2vL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The NTA is brainwashing ppl to believe "centres have been increased, 99% students got 1st priority city". Fact is NEET students have increased from 14 lakhs to 17 lakhs. They would be giving exam at 1 time slot!  #Studentskemannkibaat  #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ppl often ask, "will conditions improve in November?" I don't know and no one knows. But by Nov, floods would be cleared, transportation would have been started, partial lockdown would have been lifted, and most importantly CENTRES can be INCREASED. #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamInCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please retweet this, as I want to reach a bigger audience. This is an emergency!! Supreme Court said, postponing exams will lose an year. IMO, this assumption is false.

<|startoftext|>@Swamy39  has pointed the problems already. A lot of ppl have misconceptions that we want zero year/cancellation/no academic year. The students want POSTPONEMENT only. #SATYAGRAH_AgainstExamsInCovid  #NationWantsJEE_NEETPostponment  https://t.co/OSIYo7Hw09<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What the above data means- most students have 0 centres in their district. They would have to go to other districts to give exams. Many states are flood affected.

<|startoftext|>@Ayush94565177 @Chhotelogbadip1 @BesuraTaansane To make it clear. The Hindu report U SHARED is based on a "leaked plfs survey" with a new matrix, lesser sample size and wrong result on a simple factor like urbanization. The data given in the thread shows lesser unemployment under NDA (from data by world bank)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ayush94565177 @Chhotelogbadip1 @BesuraTaansane Ayush, u should abstain to comment on things u don't understand.

<|startoftext|>@VJ290481 I am sad to read your statement- "Losing Aksai Chin is not the end of the world".

<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta Sardar Patel is named once in a small subscript describing an image!!! Nehru is repeated 14 times Gandhi is repeated 64 times The chapter "Nationalism in India" doesn't mention the real nationalists rajguru, sukhdev!!  https://t.co/GjEtzpQaWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta Congress written history tried their best to remove Sardar Patel and his work from history. NCERT books of 9th, 10th doesn't mention kashmir issue, Indian wars, UNIFICATION of india under Sardar Patel,  Indian national army, Bose, Rajguru, sukhdev,etc. Attaching ss from ncert  https://t.co/nDf7ZAzZRz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta 6/n Goa's liberation was actually delayed because of Nehru. Nehru wanted non violence! India's unification is because of Iron Man of India Sardar Patel who is respected by everyone (except the "dynasty")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta U missed mentioning POK in your thread!!  Maharaja Hari Singh gave his kingdom of J&amp;k to India in exchange of protection(nehru had contributed absolutely 0 to it) Nehru even after "winning a war" gave up 84000 sq km area to pakistan. Somebody give this coward a noble Peace prize!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta 4/n So the truth is Nehru had already lost control over Aksai Chin in 1959 without fighting a war!!! Nehru lost a winnable war against China in 1962 because of the dumbest blunders one could think of (China and Indian economy were equivalent in 1960s)  https://t.co/5o9accCMLO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta Nehru said: “I would suggest to honourable members not to pay much attention to news items emanating sometimes from Hong Kong and sometimes from other odd places. We have had no such claim directly or indirectly made on us.” The coward deliberately omitted mention of Aksai Chin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta 2/n Nehru didn't lose aksai chin after fighting a war in 1962, rather we had lost Aksai Chin in 1958 itself much before war took place. Nehru like the coward he was hid the truth that Chinese had built Tibet Sinkiang highway in aksai chin in 1958 !!!  https://t.co/huDOX0xMPx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeevMatta 1/n "No one should get the right to defend nehru after reading this thread" It's you who are doing whattaboutery. You conveniently included Sardar Patel and Indira Gandhi's achievements in a post defending Nehru. Nehru was the worst possible PM on issues of national security.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds Tu chewtiya ho gya hai modi hatred mei. How does selling of PSU improve gdp in short term? (As you claimed bjp increased gdp growth by selling psu). Poora data Diya hai. Gdp per capita, growth rate, forex reserves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds I am blocking you after seeing you are a follower of umar khalid 😂😂 keep being brainwashed, keep bootlicking CONgress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds Compare India to China on gdp growth rate that will help your blind eye see some reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds Ever read about licence Raj of Nehru. You showed u have 0 understanding of data and economics. Selling psus don't help gdp😂😂(in short term). Why so phobia with privatization. Ain't it started by MMS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds Gdp growth rate is NOT proportional to gdp/gdp per capita.😂 Learn some basic maths. You are not able to see context. Have you seen the video?  How could you be so blind to not understand the context. "Chota sa Bangladesh", what does small size of ban has to do with growth rate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr The local authorities were more responsible for implementation . My city (Indore) had a very strict lockdown with groceries being home delivered. If u see everything with glasses of "he is doing it for 2024 elections" , u will never be able to appreciate good things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr I couldn't find any data but I think the deaths due to such reasons would be less than 1% total Deaths. In mumbai, in March (when lockdown happened for 10 days) deaths decreased by 20%  https://t.co/iJ9kPPSId9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiorOdds Watch his video, he always refers gdp as gdp growth rate. Gdp is not a concerning factor, gdp per capita is. A simple question, is the statement "Bangladesh jaise choti si country ki gdp hamare zyada hai" true or false<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr I don't like bjp in my locality but I do trust the top leadership of bjp. Package had to save the most poor and the businesses (which would otherwise had led to permanent job losses). Service class could take the battering, others can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr Package was meant for everyone (indirectly) People would get jobs back. I could assured that next financial year will be better for everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paritosh2608 Thanks sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr Add*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr Lockdown was only hope against corona. India would have reported at least a 2 lakh deaths uptill now if there had been no lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr 15000 die every month in road accidents. If u want to know how many lives are saved at this as well. The no. Of people dying of treatable diseases is minor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr I am "expert" on this though. The lockdown happened at the right time(I would have preferred 3 days earlier). Corona could have created havoc in India (India's population density is 10 times US). The lockdown has saved thousand of lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr Ignore "if".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr He still is the best one. Modi has outdone any other leader in the world.(though he was not perfect). I could say it with all my heart. Also if your anger on package is irrelevant. The government doesn't have capital to provide it directly to people(as other Western countries)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr For me it is the right thing. If my thread helps any rightist /modi supporter or helps any brainwashed leftist, I am satisfied with it. (I was once a victim of fake narratives spread by my procongressi teacher which made me hate modi and bjp)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr The need is to compare NDA to UPA. If the world economy contracts by 6% u can't expect India to grow. It's always a compare compare game when you have to choose a leader. The thread was aimed to bust fake narratives surrounding corona, Rs valuation, hdi, press freedom, etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@subbuIndian2 Pehle chart Mei comparision Kiya hua hai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Ah. I meant I Didn't use inflation as a criteria in my threads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaishnavi_dr 😂😂😂 sometimes you should read the whole tweet before commenting. I clearly said pre 2020(before covid) .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 I am not comparing pros or cons of lpg. I am comparing NDA vs UPA. I didn't even used inflation as a criteria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Yes, by same logic, I have every right to criticize the leftist books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrishnaSolepure The data continues in next tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Damn, u are not even understanding the context. Check out inflation rate between 2010 to 2020. NDA has it under control in contrast to UPA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Ask the media and YouTubers to stop criticizing because "nothing is gonna change"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Okay, stop criticizing modi or bjp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 My procongressi friend said during congress rule gdp grew at 10% and modi brought it down to 5%. Other time he said, "see modi has ended our currency". The post came in reply to those people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Because leftists often accuse modi of ruining gdp growth and Rs valuation. Simple. It was an answer to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 I could criticize whomever I want . It maybe a leftist historian or a bad actor or a bad player. My choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 You didn't understand me. Let me give eg. Have u ever criticized nirmala sitharaman or modi or virat kohli? U can't be them but u do criticize them. The next time u criticize an actor, other guy could say why not you do acting?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 Inflation is measured by Consumer price index. It's inflation that caused Paisa to disappear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 🎉🎉 most senseless argument ever. I am ready to write those books if you could recommend my name to government please.  Your argument takes your right to criticize an actor, politician,or sportsperson. The next time u blame modi, rrmember ur own words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 I don't understand whete i compared unequal. Check out inflation rates between mms and modi to clear yourself. I compared gdp per capita growth rate(the most reliable indicator for development). Now coming to Rs, India's foreign assets are all time high.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@susheelraju @theskindoctor13 I am comparing nda to upa in above thread. Inflation is much under control in nda. Paisa was stopped in circulation during nda Why not go into figures?

<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare Job creation is the only way to remove poverty -by Narayan Murthy. Capitalism works, socialism doesn't. There are numerous examples out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare Bhakti search kar le YouTube pe yaa google pe. Or ask it to the public, perhaps any poor person. U would know what bhakti means for an average Indian. And then ask about leftism to those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare The basis of socialism is distribution of wealth. But how do you generate that wealth? The only way known is capitalism. U may abuse ambani for being too rich but the fact is he provides employment to 2 lakh people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare Know that Word bhakt was never so common before 2014. I am ok with u using chamcha or any other u could think of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare U are too distant from ground politics. Leftism in India is actually no concept (99% of Indians don't understand leftism in revolutionary sense). Leftism in India is an ideology used as a veil by islamists/communists/bjp haters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @shirospeaks @iabhinavKhare 😂😂Welfare state doesn't mean socialism. U could achieve a welfare state through capitalism. And every sane person confident on his abilities would vote for a capitalist government. (Know that Bernie Sanders lost to Joe Biden)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some clarifications.  The 1st gdp per capita growth rate table is most important. There is a column comparing India to "low and middle income countries" and other for world.

<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Thoda zyada brainwash ho gaya hai tu.  I would start following your favourite YouTubers the day they stop defending Tahir Hussain and report on Ankit sharmas death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare 😂😂😂😂 u follow kanhaiya kumar and Umar Khalid. You are hopeless. U just wasted my time. Keep being brainwashed.(i know it because I was there once).  See u soon "mullah"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Okay I am starting the lead by calling all leftists as mullah  Throughout this discussion I have been using your own logic to make u understand why bhakt is communal. But if you still are not ready to understand, then u should be okay with someone calling u or any leftist a mulla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Akash Banerjee I a mullah, muhammed zubair is a mullah, owaisi is a mullah, Saba naqvi is a mullah, barkha dutt is a mullah, Kunal kamra is a mullah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Ur logic. I could use the term mullah for all leftists (Hindu or muslim). I could call them mullah because they blindly preach political correctness (without ever considering the cons) like a mullah blindly preaches Islam . Cool. Ur logic cleared all my doubt. U are a mullah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Yes I am free to call you mullah then. I call every leftist a mullah be it Hindu or muslim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare And I don't support them. I am not against labels(that happen in every democracy) but communal labels. But in your all the above names, I support sudhir Chaudhary, because jihaadi and Jihaad  word is itself used by islamist fundamentalist. (It's not a term coined by any rightist)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@None99818512 @ShaitaniSatan @Vikassi19140247 @smithinder Ram mandir was bjp's main agenda for decades. There is no way it would not have been politicised especially with Kapil sibbal in opposition. (Nobody takes jnu seriously). The protests could not have been carried without funds from opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare I am okay with Librandu aur "modichoor ke laddu" .I am here speaking about communal labels specifically like bhakt, mullah or jihaadi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare The reason is a lot of left support kanhaiya kumar (cpi leader) or sharjeel imam. Lutyens lobby is fully leftist. I am not here complaining about labels but I am complaining about communal labels be it bhakt or mullah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare I don't care about normal people. Do famous people use the term  mullah? No But every "freelancer journalist" uses it to discredit rightist people and in turn is disrespectful to hinduism. Your favourite Akash Banerjee or dhruv rathee or comedian often use it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@None99818512 @ShaitaniSatan @Vikassi19140247 @smithinder I don't think it was ever about caa. The opposition was impatient and wanted an issue (they were not able to do much on ram mandir and 370) they chose caa and started brainwashing people. BJP also was supporting the polarisation initially before it became too widespread)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare Preachers of modi hatred, hatred common hai. I was once leftist and made a comment supporting caa. The people replied by saying me "gaumutra pi", andhbhakt and then started abusing idol worship  I later changed my views to become a rightist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare The term Jihaad has been used by many islamists earlier. Now I could use your third reason to defend the use of mullah and jihaadi. Oh, because mullah and Jihaad are also Hindi phrase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare First I am no spokesperson of abhijeet Iyer Mitra (I don't even know him) .Now there is a huge difference between jihaad and bhakt/mullah.   (I am against label like jihadi though).  Now wasn't the jihaad episode a reality? The Jihaad term is not given by sudhir to terrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@None99818512 Pls share the paper. I am an mbbs student and unknown to this . I still believe deaths per million is the best indicator (parallel to age profile of the country)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare By your analogy I could call someone  Liberal mullahs if they preach unnecessary political correctness. As they are far from real meaning of Islam and are actually preachers of modi and hindu hatred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonakFd01 @iabhinavKhare I don't understand why u don't see the word "bhakt" as communal. The word bhakt is inherent to hinduism. For me it is as much communal as word "mullah". Do u encourage the use of word mullah  for people who preach for "dynasty" or who preach "liberalism"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vikassi19140247 @smithinder I thought Akash Banerjee was neutral untill I saw his views on Delhi riots. He still hasn't made a tweet about Ankit Sharma and Tahir Hussain. He actually has a tweet defending Tahir hussain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vikassi19140247 @smithinder I supported bjp on kashmir issue, ram mandir and then caa. Also whenever I tried explaining caa, the other person always ended up   replying "gaumutra pi", andhbhakt or abusing my religion. This caused me to become a rightist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vikassi19140247 @smithinder I was following dhruv, Kunal kamra, Akash Banerjee, peeing human once. But I was confident that CAA is constitutional. (My arguments are similar to Harish Salve.) I found the anti caa protests too stupid and understood that leftists are brainwashing people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_hindu Yes, since 1959<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To conclude Nehru's overtrust of China and Mao , "panchsheel principles", lack of intent, overlooking China's earlier aggression and neglecting India's defence were reason of India losing a big part of Ladakh and a humiliating loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. Logistic Failures. There are reports of shortage of food, ammunition.  About the loss of Aksai Chin, Nehru is reported to have said in Parliament “not a single blade of grass grows there.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. No use of Indian Air Force. (One of the most dumb things to do that I could think of) India's airforce was more developed than China's at that time. China was actively using it's Air Force while India's Air Force use of limited to supplying food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>China first attacked on arunachal border and then on ladakh. War started.  5. Internal fights and bitterness- Maj. B.M. Caul, a relative of Nehru was made Lt. General by superseding his seniors who had only served in Army service corps and had NO WAR EXPERIANCE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. Ignoring General Thorat's warning. General Thorat from Army had submitted a report to the home ministry warning about an anticipated aggression from China, but was ignored straight away by nehru and co.  To conclude India had no preparedness and neither any intent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3.Allowing China into Indian territory. Nehru allowed China to build Tibet-Sinkiang highway on Indian soil (now Aksai Chin) in 1957. Nehru replied  to China "with 56 inch" that "the workers don't have Indian visa". To conclude China had control over aksai chin even before war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. Not supporting Tibet- On China’s annexation of Tibet, Nehru’s response was ‘Tibet, as far as we are concerned, is simple’. Nehru was supporting China's membership in UN. India watched as China occupied Tibet (killing 1.2 million Tibetans) and stood at it's own border by 1952.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>enemies, so, there was no point in keeping and maintaining such a huge army force. He was the only defence minister to suggest reduction of defence budget, calling troops back from the border. "Defence against whom?” Menon said to have asked famously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The army of nation can only be as strong as it's political leadership allows it to be. VK Krishna Menon, a far left diplomat, a friend of Nehru became India's defence minister in 1957. He once proposed in parliament that Pakistan is now a friend and that India has no other cont.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Revisiting history today. I am making a thread on how India lost the 1962 war (this comes in response to congress trolls).

<|startoftext|>Visible underemployment is underemployment in which an individual works fewer hours than is necessary for a full-time job in his or her chosen field.  So do government employees really work up to their full potential?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sensibllysane You are confusing India's total exprt to India's agricultural export. India lags in processed food export which is major income source.

<|startoftext|>@SHAKIR1166 I don't think it can happen in India. Ever thought why everyone wants government job? The reason is they know they would have much less work load. In india, A person choose government job because he doesn't want to work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sanjeet85380674 And support underemployment ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SHAKIR1166 Because PSUs have always been like that. (From last 70 years) They increase underemployment. Money doesn't end after selling , it goes to the country.

<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Okay then consider this simple eg. There is a population of 100 people and 50 died of them There is another population of 2000 and 100 die of them. Which population underwent more loss?  Now which government acted better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Are you talking about "urban unemployment monthly"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Aise nahi chalti duniya. Mars reported 0 deaths due to corona. Hence Mars government is best.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Then stop following manmahon Singh fan page 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Kindly delete this pic, it is pound vs euro 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance See the table again. Their is a column comparing India with world and low, middle income countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance I am not comparing gdp but gdp growth rate. 1970 to 1990 was where the difference arose between India and China. The chart I provided compares India with countries of low income as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shabda 😂😂😂 facts de raha hu. But if you want to keep turning a blind eye you are free for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Yes, I know it. I was just fighting the one sided narrative of congressi trolls and stupid YouTubers. But the difference between me and "freelancer journalists" is I don't claim to be unbiased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Kar de recommend 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Check India's rank in 2013. There has virtually been no change 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRamlingam I have made another thread for the same. It was going to lengthy, hence had to skip that part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalariedTaxpay1 I rechecked the data from world bank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance 😂😂😂 zyada fek Diya tune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Their are no sources at present. Their is a "leaked report" which I don't really find reliable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 It's not that indian Rs has gotten weak but US dollar has became stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Just random. Salman Nizami often says "Bangladesh has more gdp than India" (in tweets, videos). But fact is India has more gdp as well as gdp growth than bangladesh but lags today in gdp growth rate. To counter his stupid argument, it's best to reply in a stupid manner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Do u even understand data? I believe u are heavily brainwashed. The data also includes 2010 to 2020. If you have any data to present you are free. Don't blabber without any facts. 2020 consumption is 10 times that of 1965. Are you mad. Did u even read my whole thread?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance We always use death rate, birth rate while studying a population ecology, especially while comparing different countries. (About 23000 die in India every day. ) Which do you think is safer place to roam around today, sweden with death per mil 449 or India with death per million 4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capitalism and privatization goes hand in hand. Osho who was a socialist but still supported capitalism said, "It is only the Tatas and Birlas who can produce that enormous wealth which is needed for distribution. Distribution cannot happen otherwise."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mortgage*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason I am writing this is to end the phobia surrounding privatization . A simple question, which school do you choose,private or government? Which hospital would you go for a surgery private or government? Or which simcard are you using bsnl or idea/jio/Airtel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Privatization has been key for development of any country based on capitalism.  But Congress and it's socialist policies had ruined India's economy prior to 1991. Privatization promotes growth, brings efficiency, provides better facilities to consumers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India had to mortgaged it's gold reserves in 1991. It was the time when our forex reserves were just enough for 3 weeks of import. The crisis later paved the way for liberalization, privatization and globalization which brought or gdp growth rate of 3.5% to above 5%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theskindoctor13 I made a thread busting fake narratives of congress' "eminent economists"  https://t.co/BGY3fZTjz3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance With increase in denominator(population) the numerator increases (corona cases). Hence we should only compare ratio. India is bound to have more cases than them because we are much more populated with 10 times population density<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance More population means more cases and subsequently more deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoothingTrance Is India more developed than UK, Canada, France because we have higher gdp than them? No . The correct indicator is gdp per capita. Similarly the correct indication for a countries performance against covid is deaths per million. It's the ratio that is important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 The government was trying to avoid migration for a long time, after which it became inevitable. The reason for this heavy migration is no food distributed to them by state government.( I interacted with some labour's from Maharashtra while going to UP)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 The migration has just made green zones susceptible to covid. This is also the reason to give a very short time (4 hours) after announcement. Nobody predicted that the lockdown would go so lengthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Kindly compare India vs world covid (I provided data in my thread )  For migrants, you will have to understand the psychology of government in beginning of lockdown. The mathematical models predicted 40 days lockdown will be sufficient. The government did not want any migration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 Speculation is that the issues will be resolved. I seriously doubt your  news sources<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 I meant Consumption spending and employment rate are better than congress.  Indian Rupees is actually getting stronger. But US dollar has improved even more.

<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 No it hasn't come "40 km". That's false news. Nepal has communist government. Their pm oli was questioned for supporting India 6 months back by opposition. Hence to satisfy them, he is taking antiindia stance. That is temporary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 China doesn't want a war and neither does India. China wants to bully us to stop infrastructure development in #ladakh and wants India to not go against china on world platforms.( On hongkong, Taiwan issues as well).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BijayPrakash17 I don't think there I anything to worry about China. China wants to divert the attention of the world and it's own population from corona deaths/economy to other issues. Also it wants to bully India so that it doesn't support US and Australia against it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Salman Nizami (inc speaker) often confuses the term gdp , gdp growth and gdp growth rate and hence spreads fake news.The truth is India's gdp (2.7 lakh crore $) is 10 times that of banladesh(27000 cr $)  https://t.co/U76bWfTY9N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MalabarHornbill There were min 6.4 lakh cases in china (it was the data of people who were admitted to hospital for corona treatment, which should be much lesser than real number of cases).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MalabarHornbill Mathematical models all over the world predicted an expected time of 40 days for india.( Before tablighi jamaat incident happened).The people who suggested lockdown were more knowledgeable than u and me.

<|startoftext|>@ArvindSanu It's you who have to wake up. The protests are now taken over by leftists and anarchists who are using it as a political tool against trump. You CANNOT kill a white man while protesting for black lives matter. The violence calls for an #alllivesmatter campaign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Muslims got the fruit of their anti national seeds in the form of Pakistan. Gandhivadis called those people anti-nationals and communal who were against Pakistan and themselves accepted Pakistan and agreed to all the conditions of Jinnah. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On 15 August 1947, Pakistan was accepted Trick fully. No thought was given to the Hindus of Punjab, Bengal and other states across the border. Country was broken into pieces and a Nation was formed just on the basis of religion.  #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@universal_rover Gandhi was famous for his hunger strike. He striked against separate electorates. Not a single strike against partition? Nation trusted gandhi and he let the motherland get divided to make nehru the pm.kindly visit my thread and you will get answers #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to me, Mahatma and his followers always had one policy, that is showing opposition toward the demands of British, then try and compensate and then totally agree on their terms. This is how Pakistan’s formation was accepted. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gandhivadi(followers of Gandhi) say that they got Swaraj by their own will. If they got Swaraj by their own will, how did the British were even able to state conditions of Division? Why didn’t they use their will to oppose them? #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I assassinated Gandhiji so that his people, the Hindus did not suffer injustice.” #NathuramGodse was indeed a patriot, who had the courage the bring out the hypocrisy of the "mahatma". Unfortunately most public will never understand his sacrifice.😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He significantly pointed out that after the Mahatama’s death, the Indian government sent, armed forces to Hyderabad and defeated the Nizam. Hyderabad too became a part of Independent India. Gandhiji with his philosophy of non violence would have never allowed it. #nathuramgodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarly the men of the Nizam of Hyderabad, carried out excesses on the Hindu brethren. But all Gandhiji did was appease the Nizam and requested him to give up his State and join the confederation of Independent states. The Nizam never ceded ground. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Hindu activist Ganesh Shankar Vidhyarthi was brutally murdered by a Muslim mob. Gandhi wanted everyone to give up their life for India’s freedom, but fighting non violently. He did not condemn the violent action of the Muslims. He was never for retaliation but suffering quitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But on Gandhiji’s insistence the government policy had to be changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am, full of grouse, that Gandhiji and the Congress never exerted diplomatic pressure on Pakistan for the safeguard of its people or threatened to retaliate.Sardar Patel had refused to grant fifty five crores to Pakistan from the exchequer.  #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike India, the Hindus in Pakistan were forced to leave the country. Men, women and children were brutalised. One million people died. Mahatama’s ideology of non violence, led to lots of violence. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cont. All the Muslims were granted full security in India and had the choice to stay back, if they wanted. As a result majority of Muslims never went to Pakistan and the very purpose of creating a new nation, for them was defeated #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cont. refugees. In the cold winters, the Hindu refugees had no where to go. A request similar to that of mosques was not made for temples in Pakistan. On the other hand temples in Pakistan were defiled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gandhiji was supporting unreasonable Muslims interests at the cost of the Hindus.  First it was the demand for Pakistan which he accepted.  Second, the empty mosques housing Hindu refugees in Delhi were vacated on Gandhiji’s insistence, so that they could be occupied by muslim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was furious at the Mahatama for accepting Jinnah’s demand for Pakistan, a separate nation, to be carved out of India. It was apparently a prerequisite for free India by the British. But then the British were already a spent force. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#nathuramgodse Mahatama strictly practised and imposed non violence on everyone. If the Indian National Congress and its leaders digressed he would start a fast unto death. The demands had to be complied with. His personal ideology at times harmed country’s interests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Below is a thread with few excerpts from #NathuramGodse book "why i killed gandhi"- a must read for everyone who wants to know his untold story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dchapeyarcodez @Zedd_28 You have read only gandhi's side of story where he is portrayed as the ultimate hero. A person who allowed motherland's partition is worthy to die a horrific death(said in mahabharata for bhishma) #nathuramgodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dchapeyarcodez @Zedd_28 Didn't gandhi allow partition to happen? Why didn't he went on hunger strike against partition? Gandhi and nehru betrayed bose only because bose didn't believe in "non violence". Why did gandhi's" nonviolence" allow indian soldiers fighting ww2 #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@universal_rover Have you ever read his side of the story? He faced hate of the country, happily laid his life. I believe this is sufficient to prove his courage. He saved us from stupid gandhian double standards towards islam. Gandhi allowed partition to happen. #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zedd_28 You listen to owaisi! Read godse's "why i killed gandhi" and then give your arguments. He was a patriot. He stood out against the authoritarian gandhi and his fanatics.#NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who hate #NathuramGodse either haven't read his book or are afraid to face the truth of gandhi and his appeasement politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the judges, G. D. Khosla,wrote, “I have, however, no doubt that had the audience of that day been constituted into a jury and entrusted with the task of deciding Godse’s appeal, they would have brought a verdict of ‘not Guilty’ by an overwhelming majority” #NathuramGodse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NathuramGodse is one of the most courageous leader, i ever read about. He took hate of the entire world, readily accepted death to save his country from double standards of muslim appeasement politics. A patriot. Happy birth anniversary<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@inmalky @srivatsayb 2008 growth rate went 2.4% Economic slowdown is hoax.  2.hunger index is not reliable, there is economic times report on this, which you could search. 3.too low crude is a bad sign for global ecobomy which affects indian and growing markets economy as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inmalky @srivatsayb Currency is stable, i said. Rbi reserves are at all time high. Too Low crude price is actually related to low global demand and global growth(which dropped to 3.2% in 2019 ) slowdown is more due to global reasons. For easy understanding fall in crude causes fall in nifty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inmalky @srivatsayb But still bjp's steps against covid have been great.(though far from perfect). I can't imagine what congress would have done if they had been in power.

<|startoftext|>@inmalky @srivatsayb Currency value is stable though. Demonetisation(a blunder) is one reason. But the "economic slowdown" (at average gdp growth above 6%)is more of a hoax than reality (untill corona).

<|startoftext|>@ashoswai Who is stoping you from investing? U are free to participate in auctions. Remember 1991 privatization is the reason for India's development.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhaumiknramani Pagal hai kya? U are free to participate in auctions. Kindly compete if you can. Privatization always gets the system more efficient, cheaper and with better facilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PandyaPearl It's competition. U are free to participate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamizhRatsaschi Actually common sense says YES. Investment generates emplyment. Job creation is the only way to eradicate poverty(said by narayanmurthy). Fdi would kickstart indian defence production. I wish you studied some basic economics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Advaidism If foreign companies set up factories in india, it will provide employment here. You need initial capital for industries to kickstart which will be provided by fdi. Simple business sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SyedAhm95851703 @SanataniNaman There is a difference between burqa and mask. I condemn ghoonghat as well as burqa because they are the results of patriarchial mindset of people like you. Why do you wear masks and not burqa if it is so progressive?<|endoftext|>
