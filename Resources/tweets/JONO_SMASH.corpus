<|startoftext|>@AskPS_UK I‚Äôm up for renewal in Feb but there‚Äôs no discounts or deals you cannot offer me now? Surely keeping loyal customers happy is a way to entice new customers. 25% discount to new customers is a kick in teeth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SonyUK @AskPS_UK Thanks for getting back to me, I‚Äôd like to know so appreciate an answer. Thanks !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SonyUK as a PS+ user, you make it very hard to justify continuing your subscription when you give offers to nonmembers but loyal users have to pay full price for their current accounts. Where‚Äôs the love?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Here‚Äôs something that I guarantee will put a smile on your face.  https://t.co/qfNhfdac44<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hybridscores My condolences to the little fuzzy one, but 21 years old !!!!! That‚Äôs gotta be a record. I hate pets dying, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm waiting for a pet dinosaur or crocodile. They‚Äôll out last me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Slow day in the studio ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daraobriain ‚ÄúBecause he's the hero Twitter deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll wait for him to get good. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a squeaky guardian, a balloon manipulator. .....A dark balloonist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sussex_police hi, there‚Äôs an business alarm going off in Fleet Street Brighton. Unsure exact location but it‚Äôs been going off since 6am every 10-15mins. Then stopping. Underneath the One Brighton building.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hybridscores So this has more cowbell ? Or less?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK please can you organise 12 car carriages on the Brighton-Bedford/Cambridge routes.  By the time we get to Gatwick it‚Äôs extremely busy and a no brainer to give us a more comfortable ride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomgara I‚Äôd expect nothing less from a Brighton MP to protest. But I‚Äôm a little disappointed he then didn‚Äôt proceed to reenact scenes from Star Wars and use it as a light sabre of sorts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lloyd_rm I‚Äôd expect nothing less from a Brighton MP to protest. But I‚Äôm a little disappointed you then didn‚Äôt proceed to reenact scenes from Star Wars and use it as a light sabre of sorts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider I‚Äôd expect nothing less from a Brighton MP to protest. But I‚Äôm a little disappointed he then didn‚Äôt proceed to reenact scenes from Star Wars and use it as a light sabre of sorts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @bbcstrictly @bbcstrictlyPR @BBCStrictly2018 Nope......still not watching it. You can‚Äôt make me. No......sireeeeee..... (*puts Light of the Fearless on) ahhhh. That‚Äôs better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Plusnet jumping on your mobile service. Great price. Got the sim. Awesome. Now twiddling my thumbs waiting for an email before I can activate. Please change this. It‚Äôs silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustEatUK We struggle to get food delivered and similar competitors have that feature. Why can‚Äôt you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustEatUK guys your drivers struggle to find apartments in big complex‚Äôs as the use generic gps mapping systems. You need to allow customers to give pinpoint entrance locations so our food does not get cold. Please make this happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores I bet he doesn‚Äôt have T-shirt‚Äôs and branded cow bells !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores  https://t.co/iFZEPgChVp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mostlybobbins @hybridscores You‚Äôve got a button??? I don‚Äôt have a button. Are they on sale ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores thanks for a great evening you guys. It was great to finally see you (even if there was not a single cowbell on stage) and I got to see the whole set before rushing for my train. Enjoy your evening.

<|startoftext|>@EM___Reid @RoyalAlbertHall @londonsymphony Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalAlbertHall @londonsymphony I have tickets and if offered partial refund in vouchers. I would like to know what they can be used for. Is it purely performances? Or other things like drinks and food?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hybridscores GIANT COWBELLS ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barclaycard No, it‚Äôs fine. I can get in via website thanks so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre working hard to resolve it. Perhaps let me know when they have and I can test to confirm ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @cannonballruneu @briftdotorg Already watched Hooper. Bandit and Cannonball tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Just one smiley spin drum. Are you mad??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores You‚Äôve already got a dozen tracks to go with this chase sequence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeCentral Deeper stuff = cowbells?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@007 Sounds like there‚Äôs one man for the job. Christopher Plummer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@delayrepayagent GTR. They‚Äôre a joke !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Can‚Äôt wait for Hybrid Live - The Cowbell Tour...........no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermodeMovie Urrrgh, knowledge is just the worst... Ignorance is bliss according to the Daily Mail. I wonder what her thoughts are on Sex and the City 2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK It‚Äôs not the monkeys we need to see, it‚Äôs the organ grinder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Pfft. Like we needed telling.   Or is this said like in 300. THIS IS HYBRID ?  https://t.co/4yiByAn4Ni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hugh_McNulty @KermodeMovie Yes, yes I had the lasagne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores If you decide to use props on stage.....giant cowbell for instance. Just remember this warning.  https://t.co/cVvyqKlYxb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Finally. The annual meeting of the cowbell appreciation society has been organised. I‚Äôve purchased my ticket and look forward to seeing you all there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Mike, you look amazing. But best get the make up off before Charlotte comes and finds you üòÜ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Is it the remix album we‚Äôve all been waiting for? Cowbell of the Fearless ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores   https://t.co/1ez5phIKhk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Additionally, if you do an ABBA cover......we might fall out ok? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores I kinda liked La La Land.....there I said it.   Your music has not softened, it‚Äôs matured like a fine wine. The sound design is huge. I weep for anyone not listening on a decent set of headphones or speakers. #headphonesnob #findallthecowbells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mostlybobbins @LukeCentral @hybridscores This isn‚Äôt a cult right? I‚Äôve not seen matching smocks on the online shop......yet! #findallthecowbells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mostlybobbins @LukeCentral @hybridscores I bet there are more cowbells hidden the tracks. This is like a Dan Brown novel....The Divinci Code and Angels and De‚Äômooooooooooo‚Äôns.  Flipping geniuses !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @mostlybobbins I can‚Äôt be the only one right.....guys.....hello???    This thing on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @mostlybobbins Ok, sampled is the wrong word. I‚Äôm just hearing that theme. (Most likely it‚Äôs in my head)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores M&amp;C, I gotta ask. Track on new album - Long Time Coming. 1m54s in. Pretty sure it‚Äôs a cowbell..but it sounds like a sample from the old BBC Cricket Theme.  https://t.co/dtzLqQKTOU  I‚Äôm still loving it but can I request Grandstand is sampled next please! Thanks!! üòò<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores   https://t.co/8hdUDzkzeC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Ok, so I‚Äôve now listened to the album now on the following - B&amp;W PX‚Äôs - Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks - B&amp;W P7‚Äôs and finally on my B&amp;W 683‚Äôs...... it‚Äôs so well crafted and produced. It‚Äôs a fucking illusion surely. Sounds epic. (And I can hear the cowbells)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Track - Long time coming. Cowbell ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores There‚Äôs times when you know one of your favourite bands have similar musical tastes to you. This is one of them. Awesome playlist. Loving the long good Friday track.  https://t.co/gHhOIa0VOE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahHoile @MuseumofLondon Literally round the corner from my work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Ok, who‚Äôs bringing snacks? If we don‚Äôt get organised we‚Äôll just have 200 tubes of Pringles and a tub of hummus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesGunn You‚Äôve done nothing wrong pal, @prattprattpratt  - actors need to step up and save your director. @MarvelStudios you need to support this movement as JG is the only director for GOTG3 !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Bounce bounce bounce. Fuck yeah!!! Most anticipated album since those two French geezers and their shiny helmets came out. This looks epic! #morecowbellWHHHHOOOOOMMMMPPP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores EVEN MORE COWBELLS??  #hybridfridays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Needs more rain, but Lewis drive was incredible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenniRich2009 @hybridscores That should be on a hybrid tshirt. ‚ÄúGotta love a whhooomp!!‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LASTEXITshirts Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil. Involuntary dilation of the iris... for a last exit tee?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores YOU BROUGHT THE WHHOOOOOAAMMMMP!!!! Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TLRailUK @ABCommuters yet again you‚Äôre running a 8 carriage train on days with reduced service. Please can at least give us 12 carriages as a standard between hours 6am and 9am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kewxedge @ABCommuters @TLRailUK @CarolineLucas  thought you‚Äôd like to see this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Hybrid Egg cups??? FINALLY !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCommuters @transportgovuk @NSoames @peterkyle @CarolineLucas @AndyMcDonaldMP @LilianGreenwood @grantshapps @CommonsTrans @BBCTomEdwards @christopherhope Continue to work within terms of the contract....meaning you‚Äôre screwing over the public whilst generating large sums of cash and causing mayhem everyday !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Sooooooooo. Is now a good time to ask when the 6th Album is coming out? üòùüòòü§£ #toosoon ?  Also, how much did the Alpaca contribute to the new album?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores GROUP HUG !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK 6:22 Brighton to Bedford. If you insist on adding  3 extra stops on the journey. PLEASE RUN A FULL 12 CARRIAGES. It‚Äôs really a no brainer because of over crowding.  8 carriages is ludicrous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores Digging the new pro tools advert, makes me wanna buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KORvGER #worldcup                  Typical Germans.   We (the English) finally practice penalties and they get knocked out before we can show them we‚Äôre better now.   Tsk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK 5:52 BTN to London. Where is the train crew. This is very poor service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @hybridsound I‚Äôm a patient man. But. Please can you announce soon. PLLLLEEEEEEAAAASSSSEEEEW  https://t.co/xJML2DGFao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK @PhillBlanchard On this train too, driver said ‚Äòoperational incident‚Äô which helps no one !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK 6:22 Brighton to Bedford is 8 Carriages long instead of the regular 12. Why ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK Amended timetable seems to be failing already in Brighton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK @ABCommuters @SouthernRailUK - Why don‚Äôt you simply re-introduce the old time table while you actually plan the new one. I‚Äôm sure the travellers will agree. Let‚Äôs find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanieAcutt @SouthernRailUK @TLRailUK The ground staff are in the dark as much as the rest of us. It‚Äôs those pulling the strings who should lose their jobs, starting with the senior management and Horton !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delayrepayagent Pants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seb_cameron @TLRailUK @ralphyke Oh, if they said sorry. That‚Äôs ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK If there‚Äôs a points failure. Why did the 7:07 from Brighton get sent that way, but the 7:18 from Brighton has flown through ??? This makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK @ralphyke The 7:07 has been over taken by the 7:18 which has already left East Croydon. But the 7:07 is stuck outside East Croydon. Why ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTomGray @rrrexie You should, it sounded awesome mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTomGray @rrrexie Will the mighty Gomez be releasing a live recorded album of the recent gigs in the UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores @TravCB Can I put forward the title suggestion of Hybridy McHybridy Face as an album title ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sleepingjamie @rianjohnson Stop stealing my lines !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK any reason why the 5:20 Blackfriars to Brighton stopped and opened its doors at London Bridge ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK waiting for someone to open up the train in Brighton 6:30 to Vic. What do they think we will do, steal it ? Let us in, it‚Äôs cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyCinemaUK our Oscar party is in its 17 year in a row and we are enjoying the show. Love you guys. Kinda. Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@F1 I‚Äôm very sad to see you‚Äôre not releasing your TV streaming in the UK. Home to the biggest F1 Fans and where the majority of the teams are based. This is a deal worth solving. Get sky to agree similar pricing so we are not left out and you lose fans !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephencalver7 @F1 @tata_comm @nbc @istreamplanet It‚Äôs a disgrace. The UK fans should boycott the Silverstone Race and make their feelings known that as some of the biggest F1 fans are UK based. Disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Who thinks the cleanliness of southern and thameslink and gatwick express needs addressing and a deep cleansing of the seats, toilets etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Why do your toilets on ThamesLink and Southern always smell unclean?, I've seen the cleaner literally walk in flush to loo and then walk out. Pretty certain people would catch something from those areas. appalling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybridscores You have to seek out and watch a copy of Zero Hour (1957). The Zucker brothers bought the rights to this and used all the lines/scenes/characters from that film in Airplane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EBallroomCamden do you know the set times for Rocket From The Crypt Tomorrow please ? Many thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport cannot call landlines in Brighton area. Confirmed by two Three users. Get a recorded message about completing call failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatwickExpress hi, 6:30 Brighton to Gatwick - Carriage 423216 - front disabled toilet. The door won‚Äôt close and doesn‚Äôt seem to reset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK i understand signalling issues. But dont cancel packed trains ! No one likes a cattle cart ! 7:12 BTN to Vic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moathomes @tomhodkinson @E_Austerberry 21 WEEKS NOW ! (May 7th) Since Stepney Court, Brighton has had a fully functioning Lift. Firstport MA should be stripped of their contract !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vipalex9797 Good one huh ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Yes thanks, Driver arrived with 3 mins to spare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK waiting for the driver to open the train so we can get on the 6:30 Brighton to Vic. Standing here and it's cold !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moathomes @E_Austerberry @StephenW_Moat Thank you ! I hate having to go to the extreme of twitter to get a response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Austerberry @moathomes @StephenW_Moat - Stepney Court Brighton still has no functioning lift after 3 months of water damage from burst water mains. No replies !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@champagnephippi Long season....you'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foofighters hey, who's the support act for your London O2 gig in Sept ? Looking forward to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Austerberry @moathomes Hi, thanks for your reply. @E_Austerberry, @moathomes I can't DM you until you follow me. But talk to Firstport who seem inept at sorting it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK why is the heating on the 6:30am Brighton to London Vic ? It‚Äôs not freezing cold, i nfact it‚Äôs quite unpleasant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider summary of the debate ?  https://t.co/mpoxqNpq4A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatwickExpress carriage 423215 on the 7:12am Brighton to London Vic. Disabled toilet faulty. Door lock not working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 7:12 BTN to VIC Carriage 423208 - Zero toilet paper and seat damaged. (Loose)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 4 Coaches instead of 12 on the 6:14 Brighton to Vic. Why even run? You are the worst run company EVER !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK none of your toilets on the 7.12 Brighton to Vic have toilet tissue. Can you guys get your act together please ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas  https://t.co/8uvsarDDFE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK why can‚Äôt the 18:30 Vic to Brighton continue to Brighton as a shuttle train ? If you‚Äôre running services which would help ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK your driver just said it was due to a passenger taken ill. Waiting for ambulance. So which is it ? Or don‚Äôt you know ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK @RMTunion #SouthernBackOnTrack Southern Rail Managerment/PR, as much use as a chocolate teapot !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK here‚Äôs a suggestion. Why don‚Äôt your drivers stay on the train for the entire journey. Instead of swapping half way through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Another stellar performance from you tonight. Make the train wait due to lack of crew then say you had door problems.Rubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 6:30 BTN - VIC. No toilet paper in disable loo at back of train. If we can‚Äôt have a good rail service. At least give us that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK why are other trains going ahead in front of us. 18:15 Vic to Brighton. Once again proving your worth (Not) ! #southernfail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Another late to meeting tonight. Due to cancelled trains. This is our lives Govia ! We pay you enough. Good luck Caroline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatwickExpress why partially cancel the 6:30 BTN to VIC so late ! Either plan this or run it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Tina, now your bosses have resolved all the train problems by cutting 15% , I guess you can go half day right? #southerncuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK If you supply short formations of trains should cancel stops up the line to avoid overcrowding. Unacceptable ! #southernfail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK You cancel the 7:12 from BTN-VIC but supply the 6:46 with only 4 carriages. Please can you give me a service worth the price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK if you insist on giving us 4 coaches on the 7:12 BTN - LDN - at least cancel some of the stops to avoid crowding !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatwickExpress hi, 7:12 BTN TO VIC. The heating is on !!! please get it turned off. Not needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LennyHenry was that you on the horrendously packed train at Vic. Hope you survived the journey sir !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 7:12 BTN to VIC - please can you turn the heating off !! It‚Äôs not needed. 2nd carriage from back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermodeMovie If @SouthernRailUK was a film director they‚Äôd be combined of Bay/McG/Ratner/Synder (the 4 horsemen of the film apocalypse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transportgovuk @CarolineLucas Who ever is in control of @SouthernRailUK franchise needs to be stripped immediately ! 4.1k for poor service<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 4.2k for nothing. Service is absolutely dire. CEO Should be stripped of position. Franchise renationalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK if you insist on running 5 carriages instead of 10, then cancel some of the stops on the 7:12 BTN- VIC to avoid overcrowding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK @GatwickExpress   https://t.co/Ad3ibfmOKt you should step down immediately. Everyone sign this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 7.12 BTN to VIC cancelled at Gatwick due to no crew.  Who got us to Gatwick. Your service is a joke. Total utter joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK @CarolineLucas 5 Carriages instead of 10 for busy commuter trains from Brighton is unacceptable. Happening far too often !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 6:30 Vic to BTN. Why only 5 carriages. Massively over crowded. You should declassify 1st Class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK 18:30 Vic to Brighton. Half a train. Over crowding and quite frankly disgusting. Please sort this incompetence out. Enough !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK another journey home after  hard day at work &amp; delayed train into Brighton. Get your act together. Big joke #4KFORBADSERVICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK sadly I don‚Äôt have time to chat as you‚Äôve cancelled my train again and I‚Äôm late for work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernRailUK Service is an absolute joke, late running trains guaranteed. Quite frankly you should refund in full. Late home again.Thanks<|endoftext|>
