<|startoftext|>Hey Ellen @TheEllenShow I know this is a long shot, but if anyone can do it, I know it would be you. I'm participating in a 🇨🇦/🇺🇲 Christmas 🎁 exchange with a (California)stranger. I'd like to send her a bottle of 🇨🇦 wine, but our law says no. 🍷😢🤞😘<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Time to retire, old man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope you watched the President-Elect speech. It was "great". "The best". "Probably the best speech ever in the history of the world". He used "big" words. "More words than any other president". I guess you missed it. You must be busy packing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Please give @VanJones68 a social distance hug for me. His reaction was real, raw emotion. I cried w/ him. Although I don't pretend to know, feel or fully understand what it is like to live w/ those fears, I hope you &amp; all those who carry those same fears, sleep little better now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris on your win. This is so needed right now. YOU both are so needed this year. Monumental move forward for Americans, and women around the world. #ThankYouJoeB #muchneededchange #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhilPerkinsCHCH This makes me ill. Those that agree with this should ask themselves, if someone you love - child, parent, significant other, friend, was awaiting an organ donation, and you finally got the call, would your first question be, what colour was the donor? NO! You'd be grateful. #WeR1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ikea #ikeaburlington you really need to step up your game in the social distancing, sanitizing, staff engagement of customer assistance and being aware of how many customers in the store at one time.

And I can't even respond to the thread because you've deleted it! Wow...you should go home early...you obviously work way too hard &amp; care too little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TD_Canada Your response do not answer my question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TD_Canada what if I want to decline your new two-step verification? Is it time to switch banks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey just watched 'Liar Liar' for the umpteenth time. Still love your antics. Come back to Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robin_McGraw Invite my parents down from heaven  to spend a day with me. It's been way too long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMO this fee was for interest. You should eat it FFS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame on you @BMO for you dishonesty and greedy ways. My daughter had a loan with you, she honoured her payment schedule to a 'T' and when she asked for confirmation / proof it was paid in full, you have the nerve to now ask for $48.74!!! #customerservicesucks #findanotherbank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN I guess this means the girls will just be bringing cookies and not 'girl' guide cookies??? What a sad world, why can't we just allow everyone to join whatever group they want despite the name of the group. I don't care what gender you are...you're welcome everywhere, period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHCHNews @KathleenWyne @fordnation and @AndreaHorwath  are having a pissing contest. It's like any high school president election...soon they'll be offering free ice cream in the cafeteria, or new uniforms for the football team. None of you deserve my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favourite way to enjoy a Thursday night. @BlueJays #Torontostrong #familytime  https://t.co/1CgP7FZvKO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Relax...not every comment or opinion requires an argument. Keep doing what you're doing David - your future will be bright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN David, I think you could teach your president a thing or two. Well said! #NeverAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darbysofficial NO!!!!! Don't go... 😪 You guys rock! (Loved the ladies wardrobe...and the guys abs 😏😉) &lt;----thats not creepy at all. lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlueJays Two great games today. Well done @BlueJays ⚾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN You have some really dumb people in office in your country. From your leader down...they all need to find someone / something to blame. #ownit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLeadCNN @CNN Shame on all of them! Grow the fuck up or get out of the way so others can run your country the way it should be run.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSpec @Kathleen_Wynne This is just a political 'one up ya' to the NDP to counter their student loan dept dismissal. How about coming up with something that will benefit majority of Canadians, not just those with preschool aged children? I think it's time you packed your bags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueJays @HondaCanada See you on Friday! Let's. Play. Ball. ⚾️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN They announce in a joint statement, then ask for privacy...get over yourself, nobody cares. Although, a little advise....lose the last name. Nobody needs to keep that ball and chain. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Somebody take the podium and microphone away from him. America can't be this crazy twice to vote him in for another term. #learnfromyourmistakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robin_McGraw Perhaps the Girl Guides could make a diabetic version of their cookies...so we can all enjoy them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angleonfire63 @TheSpec I believe politicians have their own agenda, that sadly has nothing to do with the citizens of their country. Look at Donald Trump &amp; tell me I'm wrong. When will voters wake up &amp; realize it's time for a positive change. Don't allow politicians to inflict fear in you-stay strong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angleonfire63 @TheSpec How very sad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN If this analysis is true...then what extra curricular activities influenced a grown man to cheat on his wife.

<|startoftext|>@CNN What the fuck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN 🇨🇦 I'm sorry to the youth of the USA. Here was a moment your (so called) leader could have shown compassion &amp; solidarity to end unnecessary death / gun violence. Teachers playing frontline military, engage in crossfire in classrooms is not a healthy solution. Try again ass hat!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Perhaps the jury should be comprised of the parents of the children who lost their lives that day...don't hold your breath on Trump getting involved. Use that energy towards healing yourselves and fellow classmates. Together you are strong! 🇨🇦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Isn't that kind of like closing the barn door after the horse has left the barn? Trump, you need to step up your game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinmochrie 🇨🇦 This makes me terribly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN 🇨🇦 That's mature. Guess you really showed her, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN 🇨🇦 What the hell do you know about signs?! America, you've got yourself one lazy president. Instead of tweeting your condolences, go to the scene, grieve with the people, pitch in and help them heal. Show them that you care. Make an effort ffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow Hi Ellen, this is my 7 year old Golden Retriever/Bassett Hound baby boy, Onyx. We recently lost our beautiful Golden Lab, Willow and poor Onyx hasn't been the same since.

<|startoftext|>@Bell_Support The equipment is not a phone. It's tv boxes and an internet modem. How do I return it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bell_Support I don't think my account number etc is required. I'm wanting to return equipment that is no longer required. Please advise how to return it? Can I drop it off at my nearest bell store, or provide me with your account number of the courier of your choice with a return address<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bell how do I return equipment to you that I am no longer using? Get these charges off my account!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenoWilson Happy Birthday Reno! Hope it was awesome. Cheers! 🎈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AC360 @CNN A view from Canada... it's time the individual elected to speak on behalf of the American people, actually considered those that elected him. Penis envy doesn't #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #timetogrowuplittleboys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSpec This #OHIPPlus should include a greater age, as most families with benefits already include up to this age bracket.
