<|startoftext|>@CoryxKenshin #SpookyScarySunday  https://t.co/hdjYRxBCY7 This is probably the scariest video I've seen on youtube 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone higher than the top 0.01% Thank you @billieeilish for spending 13,512 minutes with me this year on @Spotify. You are my #1. #2020Wrapped  https://t.co/4GyYsRGjOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂 &lt;- me after they threaten to block me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯&lt;- the guy calling me racist after I use a calm tone and bring good points and still puts words into my mouth and thinks I'm racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nas_M_A Simply an idiom, not calling you an animal. Sorry if you interpreted it this way. I will respect your wishes tho and not reply after this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supportingzaire @CoryxKenshin Nope! Made it myself (with commands tho lol) also yes this is a very late reply I never check twitter 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmoDeathKitten didnt answer the question :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nas_M_A You can lead a horse to water, but can't make it drink I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/2)when things are done poorly. And just because something is done poorly doesn't mean that the cause behind it is bad! Stop seeing things in black and white. This is a gray situation with a great lesson of not being racist and a horrible execution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...so you genuinely believe that this was a good way of spreading anti-racism. you think this was well executed? just because something spreads a good message, it can be poorly executed. That doesn't mean I'm saying it has to be "done exactly how I like." It means I can tell(1/2)<|endoftext|>
