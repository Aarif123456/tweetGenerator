<|startoftext|>@TanyaMcRaeSoCal @SpecNews1SoCal I heard you mention Spinoffs skating rink in Boston. When I was a teenager I went there often too! Just hearing you mention it brought back fun memories. Great story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillMoyers They can only win by lying.  They’ve shown that time and time again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Yeah...can someone explain that to me? While you’re at it, explain how they can brag about the dems not winning the senate, the number of votes Trump received yet refuse to accept the election results. 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoriBush @ninaturner All I can say is Wow!  They think that’s your name???  Anyway...congratulations!  Thank you for keeping up the fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention the gloating you’ve been doing over Democrats not winning the Senate and losing seats in the house...but according to you there’s widespread VOTER FRAUD!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedFNC Love how your network gushes over how many votes Donald Trump got while at the same time screaming voter fraud.  Can’t have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost Your first tweet of the day should have been to thank veterans for their service but instead, this is what you tweet. I look forward to seeing you leave the White House on Jan 20.  If we’re lucky, you’ll leave sooner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 1. We don’t care what you believe and believe nothing YOU say.  2. It always seems impossible until it’s done -Nelson Mandela.  3. You calling someone a thief is hilarious.<|endoftext|>
