<|startoftext|>Happy Safe Harbor Day!! Or as I like to call it, one step closer to eviction day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was there any public acknowledgement today from our government to commemorate the 79th anniversary of Pearl Harbor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marceelias You are worth every single penny too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh! Nothing screams voter suppression like closing down polling places<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for our undefeated record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelers WTF there we went<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Steelers lose tonight I will NOT be happy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper She lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you ready for some FOOTBALL! STEELERS 🖤💛🖤💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STEMthebleeding Exactly. We expect our elected officials to abide by a code of conduct that respects the norms, not break them. I hate to legislate everything but sometimes it becomes necessary. Again though it comes down to enforcement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally preventable death and so unnecessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STEMthebleeding It needs to be run apolitically with the violations and punishment clearly laid out and the POTUS should not be involved. No room for ambiguity either on the violation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenBlumenthal There really needs to be a halt to any nominations or hiring/firing in govt during a lame duck session. This is bs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My recommendation for the Biden administration is to put some teeth into these violations. Put the OSC in charge of handing out the violation, make it three strikes and you’re out of a job. Enforce the rules or they are meaningless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you lose even Fox 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexMohajer Did anyone get a count of “radical liberal”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who filled out a time card when they were 11? I started working at 14 1/2 and I had to get permission from the state first.  This Stepford Senator not truthful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_sipher I find it baffling that Jenna Ellis inflated her CV to include lawyer for the state dept.  Did she think no one would check?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson He won’t quit before the inauguration. His ego is too big to resign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpenSecretsDC Can’t Biden just fire these people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think the Republicans are bad now with their silence? During the dark days of McCarthy, they remained silent for FOUR YEARS! Cowards then, cowards now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan She’s horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Radical liberal....yawn  OMG he wants to end cash bail!!! Good for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, she’s a Stepford Senator. Not an original comment out of her mouth. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi radical liberals yada yada<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnFetterman The real enemy are those who snub their noses at science, don’t take this pandemic seriously and continue to go on as if life is normal. People have died because of the indifference they have shown by refusing to wear a damn mask.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ziggiezaggie @CloreenBacNSkin “Parris, the mayor, said he was still gathering information about the incident but said it appeared that the economy, the closure of schools and public places, and the tight living quarters in homes amid the pandemic had created a stressful environment.”... it’s reality though<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The tabulation machine at my precinct wasn’t working, I had to deposit my ballot using the secure slot.

<|startoftext|>@BMorgenstern45 Release Trump test results, including the last time he tested negative. We have the right to know<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just announced- Steven Miller tests positive for COVID-19! Karma is real 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are going to crash so hard when you come down from that steroid high you’re riding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast I could have gone the rest of life not wanting to hear his voice. It sounds as bad as I imagined<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Article leaves out the tampering with evidence information.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DetHippieChick Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetHippieChick What’s your source for that, I don’t see it anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cue the crickets from the right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump being trolled 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump When did he defeat them the first time? Asking for the farmers-During the 2019 calendar year there were 595 Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies, up nearly 100 filings from 2018 and the highest level since 2011's 637 Chapter 12 filings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz This is obscene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Who could be mad at all that awesomeness 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw Is it still down?  https://t.co/SrVM2Ed3Cn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loves_pinot I agree, I think he suffered a TIA. Notice to when he gets tired,  he drags his right foot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loves_pinot Yup, he did that when he was holding hands with Melania at the debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw @ProjectLincoln  @TheRickWilson  FYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse Rudy G, Jared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshscampbell He’s got it. No way he walked out of that room the only one not infected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Not like this  https://t.co/jzw2kqxh8n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loves_pinot If he makes it that long-  https://t.co/xWWoasJ2xF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loves_pinot Yup and not very steady on his feet either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder I 💕💕💕 her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Now report how unsteady he was and breathing fast. Look at the video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone watching the video of Trump after he took his mask off? He’s unsteady and his respiration is fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TappsReady No he didn’t. He was talking about Bill Stepian, the campaign manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patient one should look at this timeline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maureendowd #ETTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HunterJCullen I have always said he has it, don’t know how people can believe otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Or that he tested positive earlier th an they are aaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFILE @yashar It’s like they’re covering something up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell THIS 😂 🎯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Will they stop at McDonalds drive through and get him a happy meal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A real potus 💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli He’ll back back at WR in days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morbidly obese old white man who has access to the worlds best medical care, wants you to not be afraid of COVID-19.  Take away his health care and free medicine and let’s see how struts then. #COVIDIOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmackau It’s a fool who has himself as a patient<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corybantic @apathetic_NY I think he was referring to the campaign manager Bill Stepien. There would be no reason for the AG to sit in on debate prep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar @HC_Richardson Karma do your thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC I would love to see @ProjectLincoln make another ad. Lindsey said duringthe debate that his best is yet to come. He’s been there 27 years, what is he holding out for??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko That face 😘<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the Trump family is a nutshell, thumbing their noses at Americans. @IvankaTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouGarza86 If anything they are downplaying the severity. He’a got it. I read this morning that he has a greater than 90X chance of dying because of his age and weight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP @MaddowBlog Assuming no other senators are infected or that they don’t remain sick longer than 14 days, this hearing may end being delayed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acyn Great debate tonight. @harrisonjaime reminded Lindsey of his original promise to leave Congress after 12 years: he’s been there 25<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You could have worn a mask you idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JhendersonJames @beenthiswayb4 I watched some of the debate earlier, you wiped the floor with Lindsey. Well done<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast There has been a LOT going on this week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d I see some people who are wearing masks. If someone doesn’t wear a mask and gets sick with the virus they only have themselves to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnazaryan Sounds like that could be grounds for a lawsuit. By forcing them not to wear masks it created a hostile, unsafe work environment.<|endoftext|>
