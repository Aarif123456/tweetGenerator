<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump I do know what I'm talking about.  The Florida teachers Union sued the state of Florida. For trying to force the teachers, to go back to school to teach in person instead of online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @SMV47040761 @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump No he wanted the kids back in the class rooms  in person in the building's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump Um, what about the students that were doing online distance learning or virtual school? So I guess teachers like you would work for free then!🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump So you are ok that Trump was screaming open the schools and threatening to take funds away from states that didn't open their schools! All while his son was at home doing distancing learning!  Do you not see the irony?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This right here!👇🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump I am pretty sure your descendents didn't come here legally! Also why are you so worried about what someone eles does with their body?

<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump You didn't miss it because I didn't say it. But if you are a racist then thanks for telling me. 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump We need to worry about the children in foster care system! Does any of you think of them. Also You Republicans are always talking about less government, your rights! But you want to tell women what to do with their bodies! How does that make any sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeacherIdaho @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump Oh ok everyone that comes from another country are drug or human traffickers!

<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor You would think with all your grandfather went through. He would have a grandson that knows about racism and discrimination. You would think with what he went through, you would know better then to judge people by their race. But I guess not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Just saw this one last thing! I am not looting or destroying anything! Once again your racism is showing! I do not live anywhere near or around any of those cities. I know that's shocking to you because, I am black. I guess all black people are suppose to live in the same areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Please learn facts and stop with blacks commit most crimes🤦🏾‍♀️  https://t.co/AEioWvvZob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Yes, we know this! I live in America. Is that your excuse for racism! Everybody eles does it, so its ok! We need to fix our own race problems before we can fix anyone's. I can't with you anymore. You are a racist. I am not going 2 waste anymore time or energy on a person like u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Once again you are showing you are a racist by saying only blacks do drugs n steal! Have you heard of the opioid epidemic that's going on and whose being effective by that! People that look like u! Suburban housewives, teens, etc. Drug addiction doesn't know race,sex, or age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Did I say he was a saint? Substances Abuse is a disease or is that only for people caucasian people. Also just because a person isn't a saint doesn't mean it's ok to murder them. I work in the foster system and trust me all those things you listed is not only a black issue!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBFO @MikeDesmondWBFO This is crazy! They said the police report claimed that the old man tripped and fell! The whole police system needs to be dismantled. We have to come up with a better system then this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor When you become Egyptian or Middle Eastern.Then you can talk about their experience. When you wake up and become black , live a day in my life or walk a mile in my shoes. Then maybe just maybe, you can talk about the black experience. Have a wonderful day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor I guess those peoples actions are acceptable to you because it's not about a black man being murdered. I guess he got what he deserves in your opinion. As you sit in your whiteness and say society treats people the way they present themselves!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Let's not forget how American got its Independence from England! They rioted, looted, and burn! Did you forget American history! Did you forget the anti- war protest about the draft, and Vietnam war!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor See you are showing your racism, right there! When I watched the protest. Their were whites, blacks spanish etc. Their were protestors holding signs, people damaging, looting of all races. Also Jews people got some justice for the atrocities that happened to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Did you free your mind from, Pearl Harbor or 9/11? Just stop with these types of comments! American was built on the backs of Black and Native people. Our, blood and tears are soaked into this land! So yes we can still be angry and upset if we want to! Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Yes, everyone knows that! I love how white people like to say things like this! Do you tell Jewish people to get over the Holocaust too? What about the Native Americans who were murder and enslaved Thier land stolen. You tell them to free their minds from their past also.<|endoftext|>

How many cops have you seen actually go to prison 4 murdering an unarmed POC. #BreonnaTaylor shoot 8 times in her home by cops. Boyfriend shot at people he thought broke in his home  was arrested that night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @joshua009900 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS I read your comment. I can't twist the words that you tweeted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @joshua009900 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS What are you talking about? No one is taking any steps back! I bet you weren't saying that when, anti- maker/open up people were protesting a couple of weeks ago. You obviously don't understand and never will. I can't. Have a blissful evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @joshua009900 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS Yes, we have technology, education and all the great inventions of  21 century.  We also still have Racism, Sexism, homophobia, Transphobia, Anti-semitism, and the list goes on! Those that forget, their past are doomed, to repeat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @joshua009900 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS With you saying that everyone out there were criminals. Tells me all I need to know about you. Because I saw people protesting, people damaging, people looting, people yelling, people talking, people getting hurt,people helping and people caring! Hope you have a good evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @joshua009900 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS Yes it's easy 2 say just let it go, when you are not 1 of the people that is affected. What you don't seem 2 understand is that it's constantly being repeated with just a different name, face, age and or sex. No where in my tweet did I say that damaging, looting, buring was ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaricarmenRoca7 @DPWIMM @FLOTUS You mean the racist people calling the police on innocent black people going to there apartment, trying to have a cookout! Etc Or maybe the system that continuously, let people that are suppose to protect and service kill people that look like me!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@embertherain @Cheryl1572 @bradleyrsimpson Just because we lost the first time doesn't mean we quit! I would rather try again, then just throw your hands up and let them win! If we all do that then we will definitely fail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watched the Coronavirus Outbreak: U.S. taskforce led by #Pence. They claim risk remains low🤔. They claimed there will be enough #COVIDー19 test 4 everyone if they need it. Insurance, medicare, medicaid will cover the testing. But wouldn't answer if the uninsured can get tested!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figured this would start! It's so sad that the world is so racist, any excuse just to beat and hurt people that don't look like you! SMH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Is this really what he thinks he needs to do to get the black vote!🤦🏾‍♀️ Dance! That's it just dance and rap! Are we suppose to be that stupid. I can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyti The students who sent it should be suspended<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am still not sure who I will vote for yet. But I know who I won't vote for #Bloomberg, #Klobuchar, and #Buttigieg! DEFINITELY NOT #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheanderDanni Nope, have to disagree with you. In Beth and Abby relationship it was always about what Beth wants n how Beth is feeling. Beth is just exhausting as a friend. Addy thinks that Colette actually cares about her. Yes Colette is garbage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not a Bernie stand but people need to give him a break with his comments about #Castro literacy program being good. Our suppose founding fathers have done alot of   horrific things to Native Americans n POC but we still celebrate them! 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarlaRK3 He got fired which is great, but was found not guilty on charges.😑 They need to start finding these type of cops guilty so they will learn. You can't go around treating children like this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngelinaWTSP @10NewsWTSP My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends! 🙏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish #DonaldTrump would testify  but we all know that he is too scared! 🏃🏿‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Torvi is always going to be my Favorite of #Bjorn wives and #Lagertha ShieldMaiden's @HistoryVikings Not really liking the #RusViking  they are boring me🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't like this new #KievanRus not a fan of him poisoning his brother. Not very viking of him! 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't like #Brjon new wife. Also I am confused about the #RusViking how the hell did #Ivar get there. Last we seen he was in a wagon😑 @HistoryVikings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did Ivar not go back to his uncle @HistoryVikings Also why does #Borjon care about what people think? They know that man is lying about #Floki<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HistoryVikings I am assuming that #Floki lives since they are doing a Floki Saga before the show! I hope so cause I liked #Floki crazy and or kind of sane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Nexflix #TopBoy I am so glad that Jack stuck up for her sister. Even though I didn't agree with her beating her sister up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't even know who, I am rooting for #NexflixTopBoy I like Jamie and his family but I love my old favorites! #TopBoy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TopBoy @Nexflix is Killing it! I can't believe Sully cousin is such a B#### that he couldn't even do the hit himself! I still have alot of questions from #summerhouse that hasn't been answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving this episode of #WatchmenHBO I like how they added this spin to it! Bravo @HBO 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so disappointed in #TheBlacklist tonight! They have let other criminal masterminds get away before, so why not #HannahHayes😤 @NBCBlacklist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheBlacklist Why, Why, Why did they have to make Hannah Hayes get caught. What are you guys doing to me @NBCBlacklist #LetHannahHayesGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #TheBlacklist Sorry I am loving Hannah Hayes! I don't want her to get caught! @NBCBlacklist She is my hero🤗👸🏼👍🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AltusLibera @alison_futoran @AMC_TV Really 😑 I guess DNA means nothing to you Or lack thereof. But I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, even if it doesn't make sense.🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they REALLY have to interview #LindaFairstein for the #preppymurder @AMC_TV  I hope eveyone watching this REMEMBERS what she did to those young inner city black boys #centralparkfive No matter what she will always be a monster to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMC_TV #thepreppymurder I just wish they would stop repeating over and over white rich, white rich, white! I get it you guys were white and rich. Rest in peace Jennifer! I always felt like Robert didn't get enough prison time, for what he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #thepreppymurder on @AMC_TV I love the fact that they are focusing on Jennifer's life. Her family and Friends. My heart goes out to her family and friends. I remember this case when I was in middle school. Read the book in high school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evil This is a great show. I am loving it the cast, the stories, everything! #EvilCBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blacklist I have a big problem with them making the black lady a betrayer.😑😵 I really did like her character @NBCBlacklist 👎🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthonyMarisc10 @Spectrum I know lol. So I am miss everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I CAN'T EVEN WATCH #90DayFiance or anything because my cable company #Spectrum @Spectrum has had an outage everyday night for tje PASS 6 DAYS🤬😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally getting to watch #WatchmenHBO the beginning has me speechless and crying! #BlackWallStreet @HBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sindi_Berry @ronkelawal I was just thinking the same thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AfricaMustWake @RightOnTV I remember this! It was so disgusting how they let that monster go. For killing a young girl for no reason. She was walking away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how I feel about #Katrina she seems a bit 😬 @NBCBlacklist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCBlacklist #Aram was so sexy in this episode. Hoping to see more of this side of him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really think this is going to be my last season. Since they let #OG go. But have kepted the other women that have actually been aggressive physically. #DoubleStandards no matter what you say #Shaunie #BBWReuion @VH1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sorry but what #Shaunie said during the after talk didn't  make sense.Trying to say that the other women put their hands on each other because they have known each other longer. So that's not really aggressive 🧐😑 #BBWReuion @VH1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Eden is a lying B! I remember that episode. I feel bad for #Noah @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually feel sorry for #Noah he is a self absorbed asshole, but he is not a rapist or one of those type of men. @SHO_TheAffair Just when things were looking up for him. Love his lawyer. #Noah never listens 🙄😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes this is the #Helen I ❤ @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I am so happy that #Helen is seeing #Sasha for who he really is! Why worst then #Noah! Definitely no #Vic  I really don't like #Sasha @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved what #Helen said to #Sierra about her not being the first mother in the world! @SHO_TheAffair Get of the couch and take care of your f###### kid! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Also I don't like #Sasha but not sure about his step daughter yet🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janisha31 @MacyJJenkins They said the police union posted his bail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell did Laura expect, She married a younger man from a different culture. Who is going to be controlling 🤷🏾‍♀️ @TLC #90dayfiancetheotherway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLC I really don't see why Tiffany was so upset about the stripper for Ronald  bachelor party! His friends made the party for him and that's what guys do. He shouldn't of lied but its not that big of a deal. #90dayfiancetheotherway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew Raul had a reason for saying that. Now it makes sense Why he told Corey that stuff. #90dayfiancetheotherway @TLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadhammer11 @TLC Yes she is but on the other way its Jenny  https://t.co/o9ovwLaFrv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still don't know why Evelyn supposed friend said that. #90dayfiancetheotherway I am sorry Corey is trying to play the  victim and he is not! @TLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care what #Jhoon says he is one of my favorites ☺️ #90dayfiancetheotherway @TLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Laura crying already. I thought that was Jenny's job #90dayfiancetheotherway @TLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamiRoman I am going after I kick her a$$ and his!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Axel, see your friends and save your friends. #VanHelsing or are those other girls just people that bit people that #Vanessa turned? Or they #VanHelsing bloodlines @SYFYVanHelsing  So there are 3 now. Are we going to find out their history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VanHelsing How many of them are on this show now! Are they of the #VanHelsing blood line or they are experiments! @SYFYVanHelsing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am in love with #DavidMakesMan ever time I watch It I smile, laugh and cry! @OWNTV Please make another season of this fantastic and amazing show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @cw_spn I am so happy that it started again but so sad this is the last season my heart is breaking! 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Shaunieoneal rolling her eyes, trying 2 act like there is no colorism on this show. #BBWReunion All they kepted saying was that #OG is aggressive, #OG is scary etc. What about the rest of the ladies that have actually attacked each other? Oh guess that's just them being cute🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BasketBallWivesReunion #Evelyn was upset by #OG talking to or posting text about or from #Ochocinco. But she wasn't that upset n scared 2 call him on the vacation 2 get those dms from him. Just to try an make #OG look despite and thirsty. But #BBWReunion now she afraid 🤔🤨😑🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally watching the #BasketBallWivesReunion  This was completely ridiculous with #Shaunieoneal, #Evelyn n the other women saying they are afraid of O.G. with all the throwing of bottles, tables, glasses n vases. Jumping off tables attacking each other physically now they afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2fast4mum Sorry for your loss.🙏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealKripke @TheBoysTV @PrimeVideo I am so happy!🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SHO_TheAffair I don't think that #Helen owes #Priya a damn thing! She was always so nasty to #Helen I am glad that she is starting to see #Sasha true colors A##hole!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really, really really do not like #Helen with Sasha. I can't stand him! I think he is a fake and self absorbed! #TheAffair He is the worst parts of #Noah on a bigger scale! How could she go from #Vic to him! @SHO_TheAffair Now #Noah acting like a stalker 😬🙄😑🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stacey is so sweet! I think she is the best out of all the children so far! #TheAffair @SHO_TheAffair Are we suppose to feel sorry for #Sierra because I just can't! I took care of 3 by myself when my husband was overseas on military income! She can do better then this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sierra mom has me rolling! I love her all ready #TheAffair She is obviously one of those crazy over bearing stage mom, that wants to compete with her daughter and is so self absorbed! #JenniferJasonLeigh is fantastic ❤her! @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #Sierra really leave that baby in the f###### car! Where the hell is her suppose women group friends! I can't with her! #TheAffair @SHO_TheAffair That baby is so adorable by the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeadlyWomen @profilerdelong Had me falling out 💀When she said That anit no sheep #KillTheCompetiton @DiscoveryID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started watching #DavidMakesMan I am hooked already! What an outstanding show! @OWNTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepitcleva @SHO_TheAffair Yes she is, I can't believe that she did that at the funeral! Smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got an episode from #FearTWD that I really enjoyed @AMC_TV kind of liking #Morgan n #Al team work. Can't stand this new girl!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepitcleva @SHO_TheAffair Yeah, I wanted him to stay alive longer, I really did like Vic. His parents I could have done without.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeyondB48502818 @TalbertSwan 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainydayinmay @SHO_TheAffair I kind of agree but remember that's for #Noah perspective he all always sees himself as the victim. #Helen is acting a little crazy but #Vic just died so she is kind of lost I think. Trying to find herself again. I do not like #Sasha 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepitcleva @SHO_TheAffair Yeah he was, but he was dying and she seduced him! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breedykam @DiscoveryID The Grandma should take custody of those kids from her dumbA! I would have told my daughter u leave those kids or you get out my house. Now she is on here crying! She was so lucky that they were all safe! Just for some pretend 🍆 I can't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattiKay7 @DiscoveryID You just had me lol with that last part. I can't with some of these new moms. I never lefted my kids with no one but my family, and some members they had to be at least 5. A complete stranger never. I don't care how long I talk to your a## on the phone or net. This is ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamericanspice @DiscoveryID Yes I completely agree then she didn't even call the police after they took all 3 kids! She just sat there wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WebOfLies LoveAtFirstSight then Lakashia didn't call the F###ing after they took all the kids. AFTER HER MOM TOLD HER TO CALL! I  am having a hard time feeling sorry for her. How can you be that naive. Do better! This is ridiculous. I hope she gets the baby back! @DiscoveryID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #WebOfLies Love at first Text. I am sorry I know its not LaKesha fault for what happened, but it still kind of is. She should have listen 2 her mother! They tricked her once n she let them do it again. Some of these young moms need 2 use more common sense @DiscoveryID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SHO_TheAffair Sorry really don't want to see #Whitney story! #TheAffair 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #TheAffair Noah almost brought me to tears When he said, "Because I am her father and I am staying here encase she needs me!" @SHO_TheAffair 🥰👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Helen shouldn't have Sasha's saying stuff about Noah in front of the kids!  #Vic would have never!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really liked #Angelia even with her erratic behavior towards #Michael but throwing the cake in his face. Now that's completely disrespectful, if he comes to the US. She is going to treat him like a dog holding that visa/ citizenship over his head.😡 #90dayfiancebeforethe90days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't #90DayFianceBeforeThe90Day Zied sister has me laughing, but I feel sorry for #Rebecca at the dinner! Rebecca should not have let Zied sister intimidate her. 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that they are always saying #O.G is Aggressive but #Evelyin always jumping on table or throwing drinks in people's faces. #Malaysia n  #JackieC always ready to fight but #O.G aggressive 🤦🏾‍♀️ @VH1 #BasketballWives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved, loved loved what @TamiRoman said to #O.G #basketballwives @VH1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't #VickiG # That's What I heard! 😩🤷🏾‍♀️🤣🤣😂😂😂 #RHOC @BravoWWHL @BravoTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that's the #Noah I am use to! In #Helen version! Go Home, don't drive, take and uber I don't care what you do! Why Helen not Sasha! I hope it's just fun and she doesn't fall for him🤞🏾#TheAffair @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did #Helen not realize that her father had #dementia I knew it in the first episode with #Noah and #Jenelle! God I love Helen's mom talking to Serria! Lol I don't like her with Sasha NooooNoo #TheAffair @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like the way they just made #Noah fold to #Sasha about the script! What's that about! I can't stand the Sasha guy especially for #Helen 🤢 #TheAffair @SHO_TheAffair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devoninthecity @KnightfallShow Yes please!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarnivalRow Loved it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THR How can you believe a man that had an sexual  relationship with his adoptive daughter that he raised from child! I wouldn't put nothing past him! 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry #FearTWD this was a pointless episode!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't T.V. series and movie that want you to read the text just Put it on the Screen not on the Phone. My poor old eyes can't  see that s####!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am starting to think that the women's perception of #Noah is true! He always seems so self absorbed in all their version! Loved the scene with Jenelle and her ex! #TheAffair @Showtime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so glad that they #Jenelle side on the #Affair @Showtime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSource I will be tuning in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so glad that they put #Dwight on @FearTWD! Why the hell does #Morgan have to be so crazy, he can't stay close with anyone that knows his pain or he feels something a little more for! 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the new #BH90210 reboot! This is how all #Teen90's Show should do their reboots! With the Original cast in their adult lifes and / or as their older characters!  @FOXTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching amazing @DianeFanning  as always on #NoOneSawAThing on @SundanceTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #MTV still doing the #VMA when they don't even play music video anymore!🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally watching #90210 and I am loving it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mishacollins Happy 🎂🍰🧁 Birthday! Hoping you had a wonderful, fantastic day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvyKungu Yes, it is mine broke last night. We are dying over here thank god the A.C. is coming @ 4pm. Today🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am trying to watch #Netflix #TheFamily  I know I had a little bit of wine but damn I am not drunk. Can't figure out what this is suppose to be about. Jesus, politics, corruption. 🤷🏾‍♀️ only on the second episode!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched #Fleabag on #AmazonPrimeVideo It was a funny n heartbreaking. I hope there are more season to come!🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First off that was wrong he never said her kids were dirty! 2nd why didn't Jackie just go to Malaysia from the jump with the man's number so she could have called  him herself! #BasketballWives Sorry Jackie just🙄 being messy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don't the women just get together n talk about all the she say this and she say that! Instead of playing damn 🤳 #BasketballWives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that this new girl got all this mouth to say stuff about O.G and Tammy behind thier backs. Then confronted about it 🙊 she lies! Now she is spilling all the ☕ #BasketballWives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did that Feby girl lying she said what she said about O.G just admit it! #BasketBallsWives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caughting up on #BasketballsWives loving what Tami said just own it Cece. I am tired of them ganging up on O.G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got to watch #AssassinationNation Fantastic movie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe they killed Charlie and took Alice! #JETT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightOnTV Alf's favorite food was Cats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynBasil I am following you because I loved your tweet!🥰<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BigLittleLies are they really going to make Bonnie kill her mom! Thank God I was scared. I love all these women as actresses and the characters @ReeseW @ZoeKravitz #NicoleKidman @LauraDern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I say @HBO #BigLittleLies I love @LauraDern 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh Sorry I think it is wrong to lower the age of consent. It will make it easier for predators to prey on you naive teens. Children and teens are still getting  hurt with the laws we have now. So I don't think it's a good idea to help the predators out by lowering the age of consent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahluwal This is a disgusting use of force! For selling water Really, Really!  Alot of these cops are out of control and or on power trips!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WESH Hope they can get then safe and turned back around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just started watching #Deuces so far enjoying it. Love hearing  @LarenzTate voice telling the story he is still handsome as ever. @lala @MeaganGood looking Flawless @LanceGross all I want to say is can I take your shirt please☺️.  #Nexflix keep the black movie's coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #Black&amp;Privilege on #NexFlix some of the script and acting isn't that great! But the basic story and the knowledge in it makes it worth the watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok just finally finished watching #RiseOfThePhoenixes on #NexFlix Loved, loved,it. The murder's backstabbing, treachery, conniving,  outsmarting each other, the scheming, the lovestory, the family n friendship bonds and dysfunction. The ending though, I can't why why 😫😥😭?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will just leave this here!  https://t.co/0e8hk4DwS5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny how people want to agree with #DonaldTrump about saying if you criticize this country you should leave. Wasn't he the one  that was criticizing America when he was Campaign? #MakeAmericaGreatAgain I guess you can only criticize America when you are White!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a #Nexflix Movie. I wish Nexflix still had the 5 star rating system instead of just the 👍🏾 or 👎🏾.  Rating a movie is more then just liking it or not. Just my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope he actually gets put away this time. Hope that the victims will finally get some justice.  https://t.co/ddNSexLPMa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC 👏🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sam_Maddy I love Bobby the old 1 not the other world 1, they don't have the same history with the new Bobby.

<|startoftext|>@TheEpicNewman @patina626 @BirdieBaker2 @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Any Rifle or gun that does anything like the A.R guns/Rifle should not be  for sale to regular citizens for protection or hunting. Just my opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Never been a fan of civilians having A.R guns/Riffles just don't see the point. Like I said before you don't need an AR for hunting or protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Yes he could have but remember a guy did that in New York not that long ago, he kill some people but not as many as the AR. Plus the  white Supremacist who killed Heather Heifer. He ran in to a marching crowd. So I believe a AR gun/Riffle more dangerous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Seriously why does anyone need that type of weapon. It's not a weapon to deer hunt, hog or whatever animal hunting you want to do. To me it's just a weapon used to hunt people, but that's just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Yes I agree with that, the state's have let people down with mental health issues.

<|startoftext|>@AdamForce_1 Seriously, I had to read the letter twice. How does not letting a parent drop off lunch or a book your child forgot at home is a safety issue, but letting people buy A.R. type weapons ok. I just don't get it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't want to put a ban on A.R guns, but I get a letter from the public school that states we as parents are no longer aloud to bring things to the front office for our children for example lunch, school text book, homework, project etc. Does this make any sense<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@H_Combs @GOP Men and both side have been sex offenders. No side has clean hands. What people need to focus on now is how to help women speak out more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti About 3% of people who received two doses of the measles vaccine will get measles if they come in contact with someone who has the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Or if someone has an compromised immune system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Yes it can effect other children. Your child can bring it home and effect a younger sibling that hasn't been vaccinated yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Witch_All_Year @adamcbest I love it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Hope you have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti So she won't endanger other people's children. Sending her to jail just seem to harsh of a punishment in my opinion. Just my thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti I know that's my point. If she doesn't want to vaccinate her kid. Instead of sending her to jail make her homeschool him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Because you refused to get them vaccines? Or is it something eles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyti I don't think they should send her to jail. She should just have to home school her children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swiseman44 @MrFilmkritik @NorthernGreyJay But why would you fear minorities when it's usually the F.B.I. or other Law enforcement agencies saying that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 If I decided to change my religion to Judaism. I guess then I wouldn't be black any more just Jewish. That's why it's not consider a race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 once converted, they are considered the same as if they were born Jewish. This is not true for a race.  Sources: soc.culture.jewish FAQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 If you are referring to a nation in the sense of race, Judaism is not a nation. People are free to convert into Judaism;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Nope you proved who you! Can't make another statement so start name calling typical Trumper!! 🖓 To you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Don't need you to teach me anything! I know a lot of Jewish people that don't consider being Jewish is a race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Because you can't debate with out name calling like your man Trump. What a sorry man you are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Hello it's not a race. On any application does it say mark this box for being Jewish. And I was being nice to you. You are the ignorant one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Time but I do wish you a good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 His son-in-law is still White. Being Jewish is a religion. Look at who he wants to pardon!! But u can't understand. So not going to waste my<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Like I said before you are not going to date some one of another race and talk bad about them. And when did being Jewish become a race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividedxWe_FALL @Brine_Gildchaff @donaldlgay @tariqnasheed Sorry he is not looking to fix any kind of injustice. Why does he hate Obama so much? Did Obama go on and on about Bush?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 I can go on and on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 You would see. He was trying to bring back the death penalty in N.Y. by putting out ads for the Central Park 5 who were children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Would marry one. Plus why the he'll would he say anything racist in front of her so please! Let his daughter turn up with a black man. Then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosoxluke @Whipreck @thehill @JamesPaine33798 Just because you date one biracial doesn't mean anything. I am sure you have heard of wanting to date using a nice term doesn't mean you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That was Kathy Griffen and she got alot of crap for that. Never saw anyone get crap about the monkey or ape pics of the Obama's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama President that had a picture of a noose around his neck hanging from a tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Lol sorry he does not look like a dark skinned white man. I understand what you are saying but like I said before haven't seen any other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Not sure what you mean by this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I disagree just because you have privilege doesn't mean that you are in a bubble especially if you are not white. Trust me on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Yes, I agree with that. I don't think there is anything wrong with moving the statues and putting them in a museum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Yeah Florida wasn't that great lol. We only got a partial one, and I knew that but thought it was going to be more. Wish we had a total one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The slain victims. They are chanting any thing hateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I don't think that there is anything wrong with protesting. Most of the protesters are just chanting black lived matter or the names of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Well the young man said something or not. He was leaving and that didn't give that white old man the right to sucker punch him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Just because you grow up well doesn't mean that things haven't happened to you. Things do happen to people based on the color of thier skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That you haven't seen the pictures with a noose around an Obama looking doll. Or the cartoons of him looking like a monkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That just because you are mixed people don't necessary see you as mixed. Obama just looks like a light skinned black man. You can't tell me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Obama has openly spoken about his mother thanking her for her values and more then that. The thing that alot of people don't understand is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Are still happening now a days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I agree and disagree with you on this one. Yes I do agree about some political correctness. Yes there is alot of horrors in history that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I agree it does being at home. But history is and has always been one sided in America especially in schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The player on the football team would knock out whatever candy bar I got because they knew once it hit the floor I wouldn't eat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I think back in the day everyone has stories of getting picked on. I remember in high school I would go to the vending machine and one of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama No he didn't and he was told to leave and he was leaving. So if someone says something that you don't agree with you sucker punch them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama It was good talking to you have to read the rest of your tweets and get back to them later. Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I didn't make the group. So I don't have the answer for that. I want to keep tweet but have to take my girls to the solar eplicse event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Not understanding your point on this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Which video? Haven't seen it. Can u send link or tell me where to look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Older men which I am using loosely. Because really men don't treat a young women like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The young black man that got punched was not a payed to be there. And neither was the young black girl that got circled by a bunch of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Come on if Obama focus on all African-American problems people who of had a fit. Plus everything he tried to do in office was a fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Ok never said gangs were good. But have you thought of why people join gangs? The only way to stop gangs is to have more out reach programs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama And said something about N word. For no reason just because his skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Just the other day the second day of school my nephew who is mixed was sitting n a white kid draw a swastika n throw it down in front of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama So you would never really understand. It's not about hate its about our voices being heard. My family is a melting pot of all races.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Didn't make the national new just Florida. But I do believe that people of color do need a group, Like BLM. I am assuming you are white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I understand what you are saying. It's just the name they do care about all lives. I know in Tampa they marched for Heather Heyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Do you recall Donald Trump campagain where he was telling his supporters to punch non supporters in the face. To me that's violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Or even why they they started it. Or you just repeating what people say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Still doesn't make it the most dangerous place. BLM is not a hate group. Do you even know any thing about the founders of the group?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama BLM is not a hate group. Don't recall anyone from thier group running people down with a car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama What hate groups does Obama support. I think you are confusing him with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama And by the way  St. Louis, Missouri the most dangerous place in the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama What does that mean your comment doesn't make any sense. How can @BarackObama or I stop the violence in a whole state?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Yeah I know my purpose. I am a wife and a mother of 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree That's sweet that you are so giving. I see that you are a caring person. But judging people is not a Godly trait.  Have a great evening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree If you truly do then you would not Judge! He is the only one who can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes, I know. And so are u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes went to Sunday school and Bible classes at least 2 times a week when growing up. Go every Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I am sure he weeps because he also says he is only one to judge us. Let he with out sin cast the first stone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree I can completely agree with that one. It's not where I leave. My mom use to do foster care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Yes n we are also talking about that women's  right 2 choose. You don't want to pay for healthcare. So why worry about a women u don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I think every deserve the right to healthcare. If I have to pay alittle more I am ok with that. But that really is another topic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Sorry to hear that. It seems like you have made the right choices for yourself. That's all every women wants to have the right to choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree So let us make our own choices. To each is own. Be and let be. Don't judge me and I won't judge you. You seem like you are a nice person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree And I am happy for you. It was your choice. That's the point your choice. We are not telling you or anyone that they must have an abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Instead of a women who has made a choice to have an abortion. It's her body, her choice and her future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Did you read my other tweet? Why not focus on the ones that are here. The children that need help now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree No I am talking about people yelling at them and telling them that they are murders. That doesn't seem like a light from Christ to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree What demeans women are people shaming them for a choice that they have the right to make. About their future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree How does someone you don't know having an abortion tears the fabric of our society?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Sacrifice, you do know that abortions are not free. Right? Like I said before and will say again we are only human and slip up happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Planned parenthood does so much more then abortions and very few of them can even perform abortions. Condoms are cheap but things happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree What programs are you referring too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Again in a year or so having another baby addicted drugs on and on it goes. So that kind of goes both ways drugs destroy people period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree And I have seen women that are addicted to drugs having babies born addicted to drugs. Leaving or getting baby's taken away just to be back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Yes me too Family and or friends that have finished college, happily married and have children now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Just like you had the options to choose yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Everyone has a right to live their life. I have know people that have had one n they finished college and are happily married with children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resister_sister @Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Thanks resister_sister for answering I did even see this question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahRemini there is an women named #MimiFaust whose mom disconnected with her because of Scientology. Would like to hear her story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Instead of tell women what to do with her body and her life. That's no one business but hers and her God. Plus husband or boyfriend or etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I think that the Pro-life people should spend more time helping with this problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes there are alot of people that foster and adopt. But there are still alot of children that need homes and a loving family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree In their shoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Of why some women have n abortion. And she doesn't need people tell her that's she wrong or what she should do unless you have walked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree If you have foster children then you should know all the answers to those questions. I was just giving an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 I am loving your tweets!! Wish more people thought like you about this subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Ok so we agree to disagree and it Mrs. I am married. Hope your day is wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree More child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Ok, I get that. But we are only humans and mistakes happen. What if you are not ready or can't afford one child or even one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Sorry if you felted that my comment was mean. Wanted to understand your tweet but you lefted. Hope you have a wonderful rest of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resister_sister @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Rose not sure if you are talking to me or Resister-Sister. So what do you mean then and I really do not see any ugly comments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Can I ask u a question? Would you take a pregnant women in your home.Completely or partially support her n her child as long as they need it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree They are facing the consequences of their actions and I mean THEIR actions! Or do you mean what you think their only choice should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree There are so many children in the system that need caring and loving families. Adoption and Fostering not shouting, shaming, and degrading!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I wish that Pro-life people would think like you. Yes foster and or adopt. Instead of trying to shame other women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Hope you have a good day it was nice chatting with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo And it's not simple anymore. Our system is broken. Trump not the answer he just making it worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo It was built on the backs, blood, and lives of my ancestor. And many others who didn't get a choice or a voice. So let not go there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Different then a corporation. Just like some women will lie to give their husband an abili. And so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Married to Bill. But some women will fight for their husband name and what they worked for no matter what. It's not right but still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo No one said they are ok with anyone trying to shame women. I don't agree with that at all but it is still different Hilliary was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo So now it's going to Rich White Millionaire men and his kids and their spouses that know nothing. So much better!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo I supported Hilliary. People supported Trump. Look what he doing bring in rich old men. And his family!! Definitely not draining the swamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo He had to go on national television and admit he lied. Hillary will always know everyone knows her husband is a cheater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Ok you had me with Wiener. Lol. But still don't see the point of bringing up the Clinton's.They had their shame with Monica.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know that just because you own a gun doesn't make you a killer. But the statistics are higher for a gun involved accident if you own one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @WAGV @thedailybeast @ACLU  I would rather take my chance with someone wielding a kitchen knife. Then shooting a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @WAGV yes I agree with you. There is no way to stop all murders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @WAGV @thedailybeast @ACLU all of them would have been stopped.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EzyJ530 @BravoAndy @Dr_V_tweet as a matter of fact she should have her own talk show, She a whole lot better at giving advice then anyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NadineatABC  its about the Killing of woman n young girls with there finger removed. I think that next week episode there is a new murder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineatABC I know its such a great show there is always good n evil, I love how the  characters r so flawed with lines of grey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVTalkApp I also think that Ray on TheKilling was not a good man but he was not a murder,but I did feel a great deal of compassion for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVTalkApp on The Killing I think that Ray n Adrian both r telling the truth but from different perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petersarsgaard didn't like your character in the being but you made me feel for him, was crying through the whole episode. Gonna miss him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bravotv #HWNJ all everybody does is talk about Tre  and why is Jaquelin acting so crazy!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bravotv why does Melissa always have to tell Joe everything a woman gossip is between women why always bring the men in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the fact that Jennifer told Melissa that Tre had nothing to do with those girls talking sh## But Melissa is still trying to blame Tre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trying to figure out why Joe keeps saying Tre needs 2 apologize they all need 2 apologize 2 each other n stop with the backhanded comments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Housewives I think that Tre needs to watch out for KimD cuz  she is messy!! That's if she really wants to fix things with her brother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bravotv @HousewiveFan @Teresa_Giudice I think if you want to really fix things with your brother then you need to be careful of KimD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is so me!! But My husband put this up on my time line his trying to tell me something  http://t.co/yqYJ8iLVS9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that my daughter asked me to do her hair n now she has an attitude!! If u don't like it then do it yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOAWetpaint I think they need to be very careful who they pick for the roles. remember Nine n 1/2weeks n Wild Orchids it made some careers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 have a good one. :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 right at the time Fixing them. And I am not sure they are writing the show just to suit Cass character. Sam &amp;Dean 4 ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 I agree with Cass breaking Sam's wall as being messed up.But that what the shows about making wrong decision that might seem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 have a good one  I will admit they could never replace  Sam or Dean. There would be no show Its always about Sam &amp;  Dean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 Lol  guess we have to agree to disagree. I like Cass and with him it makes a dysfunctional family. like when Bobby was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 I love Cass n Kevin grown on me. Crowley is just good at being evil. Sam &amp; Dean always have a connection to someone else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesPurefoy I know Joe is not dead. See u on Seasons 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kimzolciak @Bravotv @Kandi I think that's kind of a petty comment! Just wish her the best. You have a show n she has one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bravotv  I feel like Kim acts  like she is better then every body else n a user n a two face. Glad that@Kandi finally sees Kim in the light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoAndy I really do not understand why Bravo gave Kim her own show. She and Kroy were so rude to the camera crew when she left the  show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Housewives I always thought she was a little bit crazy. And very immature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOGossip Kim barely had K.J. with her so I don't know who she is trying to fool. She has a Nanny n assistant. Let's not forget Sweetie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOAWetpaint I think that children should stay out of adults business. This is between her mother n Kandi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllThingsRH don't know if I believe this or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoAndy you need to come to Orlando,Fl  plz!!!! I am sure you are looking fantastic as always!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BotyYoung Plus Kim was always lying about paying@Kandi n I think Kim is a user. Look how she treated all of the women now that she had Kory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BotyYoung I don't think it's in the past.@Kandi let Kim make her moneyThen took it off iTunes  Kim lied and said she had rights to the song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravo_rhony I can feel the heat. @BravoAndy you look great as always. There seems to be a lot of things that we don't know about!<|endoftext|>
