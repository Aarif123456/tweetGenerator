<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor I guess those peoples actions are acceptable to you because it's not about a black man being murdered. I guess he got what he deserves in your opinion. As you sit in your whiteness and say society treats people the way they present themselves!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor See you are showing your racism, right there! When I watched the protest.

<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Did you free your mind from, Pearl Harbor or 9/11? Just stop with these types of comments! American was built on the backs of Black and Native people.

<|startoftext|>@MckenKela @theonlyemajor Yes, everyone knows that! I love how white people like to say things like this! Do you tell Jewish people to get over the Holocaust too?

No where in my tweet did I say that damaging, looting, buring was ok.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ToDropADime2 You are amazing!! Alot of people would never admit they have no use for that type of Gun!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheEpicNewman @patina626 @BirdieBaker2 @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Any Rifle or gun that does anything like the A.R guns/Rifle should not be  for sale to regular citizens for protection or hunting. Just my opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheEpicNewman @patina626 @BirdieBaker2 @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA The first kind of AR Rifle was made in the 1950 for fighting in the battle field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Never been a fan of civilians having A.R guns/Riffles just don't see the point. Like I said before you don't need an AR for hunting or protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Yes he could have but remember a guy did that in New York not that long ago, he kill some people but not as many as the AR. Plus the  white Supremacist who killed Heather Heifer. He ran in to a marching crowd. So I believe a AR gun/Riffle more dangerous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Seriously why does anyone need that type of weapon. It's not a weapon to deer hunt, hog or whatever animal hunting you want to do. To me it's just a weapon used to hunt people, but that's just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdieBaker2 @TheEpicNewman @CathyQuinn1231 @BeauWillimon @Emma4Change @NRA Yes I agree with that, the state's have let people down with mental health issues. Your every day law enforcement agencies are not really trained on how to deal with these issues. Social workers are over worked and underpaid. I still don't believe that any civilian needs an AR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamForce_1 Seriously, I had to read the letter twice. How does not letting a parent drop off lunch or a book your child forgot at home is a safety issue, but letting people buy A.R. type weapons ok. I just don't get it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't want to put a ban on A.R guns, but I get a letter from the public school that states we as parents are no longer aloud to bring things to the front office for our children for example lunch, school text book, homework, project etc. Does this make any sense<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Plus my ass should help me balance the weight of the garbage bag. I was shocked!! My co-woker laughed they were all male.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It shouldn't be that heavy for me because my tits were big n I should be use to carrying heavy things around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my male coworker jump in   n said he would do it. She told him no that I had 2 do it. I told her it was to heavy n she told me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I told her I thought we weren't allowed 2 do that at closing n the bag looked really heavy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus not to mention the bag was filled n very heavy. I was alot skinner back then but still had a booty n my breast were large for my body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was taken aback because one polices were that none of the girls were allowed 2 take the garbage out 2 the dumpster at closing at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was doing my usual routine n she all of sudden told me to come here. So l did then she told me the trash is full go take it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She would make us do work that usually just the guys did. She was the only manager that did that. One night when we were closing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Or if someone has an compromised immune system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Yes it can effect other children. Your child can bring it home and effect a younger sibling that hasn't been vaccinated yet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Hope you have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti So she won't endanger other people's children. Sending her to jail just seem to harsh of a punishment in my opinion. Just my thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti I know that's my point. If she doesn't want to vaccinate her kid. Instead of sending her to jail make her homeschool him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissSincereLGT @lovelyti Because you refused to get them vaccines? Or is it something eles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyti I don't think they should send her to jail. She should just have to home school her children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That was Kathy Griffen and she got alot of crap for that. Never saw anyone get crap about the monkey or ape pics of the Obama's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama President that had a picture of a noose around his neck hanging from a tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Lol sorry he does not look like a dark skinned white man. I understand what you are saying but like I said before haven't seen any other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Not sure what you mean by this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I disagree just because you have privilege doesn't mean that you are in a bubble especially if you are not white. Trust me on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Yes, I agree with that. I don't think there is anything wrong with moving the statues and putting them in a museum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Yeah Florida wasn't that great lol. We only got a partial one, and I knew that but thought it was going to be more. Wish we had a total one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The slain victims. They are chanting any thing hateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I don't think that there is anything wrong with protesting. Most of the protesters are just chanting black lived matter or the names of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Well the young man said something or not. He was leaving and that didn't give that white old man the right to sucker punch him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Just because you grow up well doesn't mean that things haven't happened to you. Things do happen to people based on the color of thier skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That you haven't seen the pictures with a noose around an Obama looking doll. Or the cartoons of him looking like a monkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama That just because you are mixed people don't necessary see you as mixed. Obama just looks like a light skinned black man. You can't tell me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Obama has openly spoken about his mother thanking her for her values and more then that. The thing that alot of people don't understand is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Are still happening now a days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I agree and disagree with you on this one. Yes I do agree about some political correctness. Yes there is alot of horrors in history that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I agree it does being at home. But history is and has always been one sided in America especially in schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The player on the football team would knock out whatever candy bar I got because they knew once it hit the floor I wouldn't eat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I think back in the day everyone has stories of getting picked on. I remember in high school I would go to the vending machine and one of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama No he didn't and he was told to leave and he was leaving. So if someone says something that you don't agree with you sucker punch them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama It was good talking to you have to read the rest of your tweets and get back to them later. Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I didn't make the group. So I don't have the answer for that. I want to keep tweet but have to take my girls to the solar eplicse event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Not understanding your point on this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Which video? Haven't seen it. Can u send link or tell me where to look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Older men which I am using loosely. Because really men don't treat a young women like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama The young black man that got punched was not a payed to be there. And neither was the young black girl that got circled by a bunch of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Come on if Obama focus on all African-American problems people who of had a fit. Plus everything he tried to do in office was a fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Ok never said gangs were good. But have you thought of why people join gangs? The only way to stop gangs is to have more out reach programs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama And said something about N word. For no reason just because his skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Just the other day the second day of school my nephew who is mixed was sitting n a white kid draw a swastika n throw it down in front of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama So you would never really understand. It's not about hate its about our voices being heard. My family is a melting pot of all races.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Didn't make the national new just Florida. But I do believe that people of color do need a group, Like BLM. I am assuming you are white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama I understand what you are saying. It's just the name they do care about all lives. I know in Tampa they marched for Heather Heyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Do you recall Donald Trump campagain where he was telling his supporters to punch non supporters in the face. To me that's violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Or even why they they started it. Or you just repeating what people say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama Still doesn't make it the most dangerous place. BLM is not a hate group. Do you even know any thing about the founders of the group?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama BLM is not a hate group. Don't recall anyone from thier group running people down with a car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama What hate groups does Obama support. I think you are confusing him with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama And by the way  St. Louis, Missouri the most dangerous place in the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deliveryguy6980 @BarackObama What does that mean your comment doesn't make any sense. How can @BarackObama or I stop the violence in a whole state?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Yeah I know my purpose. I am a wife and a mother of 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree That's sweet that you are so giving. I see that you are a caring person. But judging people is not a Godly trait.  Have a great evening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree If you truly do then you would not Judge! He is the only one who can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes, I know. And so are u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes went to Sunday school and Bible classes at least 2 times a week when growing up. Go every Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I am sure he weeps because he also says he is only one to judge us. Let he with out sin cast the first stone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree I can completely agree with that one. It's not where I leave. My mom use to do foster care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Yes n we are also talking about that women's  right 2 choose. You don't want to pay for healthcare. So why worry about a women u don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I think every deserve the right to healthcare. If I have to pay alittle more I am ok with that. But that really is another topic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Sorry to hear that. It seems like you have made the right choices for yourself. That's all every women wants to have the right to choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree So let us make our own choices. To each is own. Be and let be. Don't judge me and I won't judge you. You seem like you are a nice person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree And I am happy for you. It was your choice. That's the point your choice. We are not telling you or anyone that they must have an abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Instead of a women who has made a choice to have an abortion. It's her body, her choice and her future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Did you read my other tweet? Why not focus on the ones that are here. The children that need help now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree No I am talking about people yelling at them and telling them that they are murders. That doesn't seem like a light from Christ to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree What demeans women are people shaming them for a choice that they have the right to make. About their future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree How does someone you don't know having an abortion tears the fabric of our society?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Sacrifice, you do know that abortions are not free. Right? Like I said before and will say again we are only human and slip up happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Planned parenthood does so much more then abortions and very few of them can even perform abortions. Condoms are cheap but things happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree What programs are you referring too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Again in a year or so having another baby addicted drugs on and on it goes. So that kind of goes both ways drugs destroy people period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree And I have seen women that are addicted to drugs having babies born addicted to drugs. Leaving or getting baby's taken away just to be back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Yes me too Family and or friends that have finished college, happily married and have children now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Just like you had the options to choose yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Everyone has a right to live their life. I have know people that have had one n they finished college and are happily married with children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resister_sister @Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Thanks resister_sister for answering I did even see this question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahRemini there is an women named #MimiFaust whose mom disconnected with her because of Scientology. Would like to hear her story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Instead of tell women what to do with her body and her life. That's no one business but hers and her God. Plus husband or boyfriend or etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I think that the Pro-life people should spend more time helping with this problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree Yes there are alot of people that foster and adopt. But there are still alot of children that need homes and a loving family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree In their shoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Of why some women have n abortion. And she doesn't need people tell her that's she wrong or what she should do unless you have walked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mothersdream @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree If you have foster children then you should know all the answers to those questions. I was just giving an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @resister_sister @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 I am loving your tweets!! Wish more people thought like you about this subject.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Ok, I get that. But we are only humans and mistakes happen. What if you are not ready or can't afford one child or even one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@resister_sister @RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @KeepBCFree Rose not sure if you are talking to me or Resister-Sister. So what do you mean then and I really do not see any ugly comments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree Can I ask u a question? Would you take a pregnant women in your home.Completely or partially support her n her child as long as they need it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTreiger @Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @KeepBCFree They are facing the consequences of their actions and I mean THEIR actions! Or do you mean what you think their only choice should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree There are so many children in the system that need caring and loving families. Adoption and Fostering not shouting, shaming, and degrading!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara25603724 @resister_sister @RTreiger @KeepBCFree I wish that Pro-life people would think like you. Yes foster and or adopt. Instead of trying to shame other women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NARAL The same people that want to Stop our Choice. Don't want to put money in programs to help those that have the babies and might need help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytimes Men like these are never going to learn unless they lose their power! Which in his case is his show. Hopefully all his sponsors will go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalihSarikaya @DigitalReview_ I think that's kind of creepy. Just a man looking for a women to completely dominate, Since he couldn't find one he made one. So sad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo He had to go on national television and admit he lied. Hillary will always know everyone knows her husband is a cheater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Ok you had me with Wiener. Lol. But still don't see the point of bringing up the Clinton's.They had their shame with Monica.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo Just another sorry Trumper, looking to bash the Clinton's. When no one even talking about them. Sexual harassment is wrong no matter what!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bman1126 @OLREAL @MarkRuffalo What does Hilary have to do with Bill O'REILLY? Nothing!! How many years ago was that? Would have been better to say Bill Cosby.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 #WeShallOverCome and #WeWillPrevail  Wishing you a wonderful night. #EvilDemSnowflake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 I am sure you would love that. We stopped the #MuslimBan. We are stronge and can take anything that's thrown at us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 Didn't seem ironic to me. Thanks for your advice but don't really need it. Joking or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 it's right there where you tweeted @posha94 Racist. So please stop pretending the evildem, just started to tweet mean things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 ok I think you are getting confused. You called me a racist. And of course you are not worried about race. Why would you be.  https://t.co/O5M98pQgrK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 It's so funny how I bring up Trump. Then you say Obama. We are just going to have to agree to disagree. Have a great evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 Hope you have a wonderful evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 I guess so, because my chart has different facts from yours. By the way yours is 2012 and mine is 2013.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 Rather be a snowflake any day then a # Bigot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 you are the racist, like I said before the topic of Welfare and blacks started with your tweet. My tweet was about Nordstrom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 by the way sweetie I am not a racist look at the pictures of my husband!! Before you try to say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 If you are going to try to make a statement a fact please let it be right. Blacks are not the highest percentage on welfare.  https://t.co/FPjmoi56wM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 Your tweet was Dear Black people. That statement says it all!  Also there was not one word tweeted about welfare or race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 @christinawilkie @POTUS @Nordstrom Not Kellyanne Conway. Plus it's just simply tacky. Like your tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 @ByErinWeaver Then just up and leaving them in the hospital for the state to take care of. So get you facts right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 @ByErinWeaver Let's not even get started about drug addict White women having baby after baby born addict to drugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 @ByErinWeaver by the way there is a whole lot on white people on welfare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternally1776 @ByErinWeaver This tweet just shows how pathetic some of you Trumper are. I am Black never been on welfare in my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByErinWeaver @eternally1776 I am pretty sure that people on welfare can't get rich from being on welfare. Your statement is ridiculous!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is so me!! But My husband put this up on my time line his trying to tell me something  http://t.co/yqYJ8iLVS9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that my daughter asked me to do her hair n now she has an attitude!! If u don't like it then do it yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOAWetpaint I think they need to be very careful who they pick for the roles. remember Nine n 1/2weeks n Wild Orchids it made some careers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 have a good one. :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 right at the time Fixing them. And I am not sure they are writing the show just to suit Cass character. Sam &amp;Dean 4 ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 I agree with Cass breaking Sam's wall as being messed up.But that what the shows about making wrong decision that might seem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 have a good one  I will admit they could never replace  Sam or Dean. There would be no show Its always about Sam &amp;  Dean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 Lol  guess we have to agree to disagree. I like Cass and with him it makes a dysfunctional family. like when Bobby was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekStewart84 I love Cass n Kevin grown on me. Crowley is just good at being evil. Sam &amp; Dean always have a connection to someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mishacollins @CW_Supernatural @_SupernaturalCW @CW_network  can't wait for #supernatural to be on<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesPurefoy I know Joe is not dead. See u on Seasons 2.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bravotv @RHOAWetpaint sorry will not be Watching Tardy for the Party!! Don't know why @Bravotv n @BravoAndy  gave Kim a show!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#prayforboston my heart and my prayers goes out to all the family and friends who were affected by this tragedy today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bravotv  I feel like Kim acts  like she is better then every body else n a user n a two face. Glad that@Kandi finally sees Kim in the light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoAndy I really do not understand why Bravo gave Kim her own show. She and Kroy were so rude to the camera crew when she left the  show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Housewives I always thought she was a little bit crazy. And very immature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOGossip Kim barely had K.J. with her so I don't know who she is trying to fool. She has a Nanny n assistant. Let's not forget Sweetie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOAWetpaint I think that children should stay out of adults business. This is between her mother n Kandi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllThingsRH don't know if I believe this or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoAndy you need to come to Orlando,Fl  plz!!!! I am sure you are looking fantastic as always!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BotyYoung I don't think it's in the past.@Kandi let Kim make her moneyThen took it off iTunes  Kim lied and said she had rights to the song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravo_rhony I can feel the heat. @BravoAndy you look great as always. There seems to be a lot of things that we don't know about!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BRAVOMISTRESS  Like my mom always says you really don't want to know because once you really find out or have proof that changes everything<|endoftext|>
