<|startoftext|>In his lifetime, the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) was subjected to endless harassment and mockery. Yet he never wavered. No insult could ever infringe upon his legacy of tolerance, patience, and peace, which lives on in all those who continue to follow his loving example  https://t.co/PYZxgROZQ4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews What’s the guilt of children in wars? This’s very sad.There are many innocent people. May God protect Syria and we hope the  war that’s ending as soon as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiveScience Do you really think he's a historian?  Or he immigrated to Palestine and occupied it and stole its culture and attributed it to it and it’s  the culture of an oppressed people killed every day!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ostrov_A @jeremycorbyn I think you are the terrorist.  Hamas and Islamic Jihad are heroes who defend themselves and their lands that were taken from them.  You have no right to speak of peace and freedoms, my terrorist, the murderer of children, occupier of Palestine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@coneyisIandbabe @nepalidds @ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @UAEEmbassyUS Yes, this fact, and the media in America and the European Union govern countries and spread lies and cover up the truth, you can come to Palestine and see the events<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nepalidds @ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @UAEEmbassyUS You are the ones who surround Gaza and not another country, and you are supposed to bear this pain.  Give them back their land, and stop killing children and adults.  And respect the legitimate United Nations resolutions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @nepalidds @UAEEmbassyUS You surround 2 million people of  human beings in Gaza from the sea, air, and land. They are supposed to do more than that when their lives narrow and occupy their land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @UAEEmbassyUS You kill Palestinians every day and erect a huge barrier in order to separate them from their towns and tell me to expel the Jews from Hebron !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @UAEEmbassyUS Do you remember the Jewish immigration to Haifa?  How was the original Palestinian population expelled and the Jews settled there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportsHomer @ChampagnePali @UAEEmbassyUS Palestine is occupied here, and it must be liberated. It must be returned as it was before<|endoftext|>
