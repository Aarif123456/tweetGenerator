<|startoftext|>While I'm not surprised that Biden/Harris would win the @TIME #personoftheyear, I think this would've meant more going to the US workforce. Healthcare, the construction industry, the restaurant industry, small businesses, and grocery store workers deserve our thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be a strong move toward transparency and against corruption, if Biden selected a special council to oversee the investigation into #HunterBiden after entering the White House. It would also distance the White House from appearing to interfere in the investigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A lot of great selections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiskyAdvocate @MakersMark Very true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiskyAdvocate @MakersMark I would also say the Uncle Nearest 1856 100 proof was one of my favorites of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiskyAdvocate @MakersMark HA! With 1. I was pretty sure the Masters Keep and EC Toasted Barrel would be included, until I saw Rare Breed and Rye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KateWelshofer In all honesty, doesn't that basically scream you should actually freak out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a good point. How do you feel about the deal? Do you think Beal might be shopped now? My only concern is that I think of Beal and Westbrook as shooters. That said, maybe it turns into a Curry and Klay combo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I doubt 2 selections will be included from Elijah Craig and Wild Turkey, and that Dickel will be included 2 years in a row. I would personally place the @NewRiff Single Barrel and High West Midwinter Nights Dram as 2 of my favorites from the year. #Whisky #Bourbon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think I should get a bottle for guessing the winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was watching the news and they had a clip from the Georgia rally with #LinWood. I had to continue to watch and realize he was in fact a lawyer and not doing an impression of the president. 2020 continues to provide several surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to see what whiskey lands #1 on the @WhiskyAdvocate list. If the Larceny Barrel Proof isn't the selection, I'd be pretty surprised to not see it listed in 11-20 either. #Bourbon #Whiskey  https://t.co/5DHIB7jML4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like we're just coming up with new ways to say your vote doesn't matter. For the many who want to move to a simple popular vote, this only adds fuel to that fire.

<|startoftext|>@bobconfer I can't be sure now, but I thought during some of the spring briefings they referenced the individuals being furloughed or not being paid for a period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I'm with you. Well, almost. I thought I was scheduling all of mine back-to-back. Then I realized it was 1pm PST.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hate that Claire McCaskill is pushing the possibility that McConnell won't even allow some nominees a vote. Several members of his party have already stated that they support any president picking their cabinet. Let's not forget we do need our government to operate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Alright #FantasyFootball experts, should I play Curtis Samuel or Travis Fulgham at my FLEX spot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisOchoaEsq That’s a completely fair point. The old saying “it’s not what I say it’s what I do” is so important right now. Additionally we need all of these individuals to lead by example, and many have fallen short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As people continue to point fingers at Governors for implementing state restrictions, why aren't the same people calling their members of congress demanding relief bills that will help these small businesses, local governments, schools, and health care professionals survive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer @mikefeigin @LockportJournal @Batavia_Daily This statement is so true. The way Trump regularly spoke of press and individuals he didn't agree with was inappropriate, as was the way Cuomo responded tho everyone on Wednesday. WNY and even individuals in small corners of NY have felt great loss as a result of Covid-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I'm just thankful we haven't gotten to that point yet. We're thinking of stocking up soon, getting tested in December, then not leaving the house until the New Year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why is everyone upset that different media outlets claimed one individual as the "President-Elect?" We literally all watched election results for days on these networks. What did you expect the conclusion would be, an announcement that free ice cream was on its way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FantasyFormulaa Good thoughts. Dobbins could certainly run into an issue splitting touches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rumor is that Trump is planning to announce a run in 2024. I'm sure everyone who called Biden too old to run will obviously be saying that about Trump, even though they supported him this time. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Fantasy Football Day! I need some help, I can play two of these three: JK Dobbins, Marvin Jones Jr, and Curtis Samuel. Byes are killing me this week. #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If or when schools make the decision to go full remote, I hope the Governor gives them a 2 week notice. 1 week for school officials to sent notice to all the parents, and 2 weeks for teachers to prepare their kids and then also sent notice to specific parents. #ProudofTeachers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great read from two former chief of staffs.  https://t.co/aJtPMADwXE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KateWelshofer @BSN360 Absolutely. Too many people are viewing "science" as something political and even negative. Years of research and experience seem to be thrown out if a pundit or politician raises a question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisOchoaEsq I know... I feel like I keep hoping something will click and he'll realize how he acts has a ripple effect that will matter long after he's gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Construction training is and will remain something that needs to be prioritized.  https://t.co/wWZDGcfSYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion, it's entirely appropriate for Trump to request recounts or challenge races that are under 1%. That said, the rhetoric needs to change. Voting is one of our more crucial institutions, and diminishing that is not presidential.  https://t.co/pHWypZtLQq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs @staceyabrams I imagine she's no longer in the running for a Cabinet post if they don't take the Senate. She could easily run for Governor again, or the Senate (if they lose the run-off). She deserves credit and could eventually be a kingmaker in the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone who thinks they're going to storm #Philadelphia, you might want to take a step back. Remember, these are the folks that booed Santa Claus. The 2020 race ending in this city could be the most patriotic thing to happen in 2020.   https://t.co/8sj9amgvpO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The President is speaking at 6:30PM. I hope he realizes how important his words are for the country. Whether you voted for him or not, he can do damage with his comments. He can also help get us all back on track. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I realize it won't happen, but I would encourage the Democrats in the Senate and House to enter the next session with new leadership. Selecting individuals who could expand the party and refocus efforts would be a nice change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that individuals like #BillStepien is declaring victory in states when votes are clearly still left to be counted is just damaging. Can we all act like we care more about the US than politics for once? If votes don't count, then people don't matter in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 @9rimm Right. The path is still better for Biden. I hope for everyone's sanity we don't wait on PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it safe to say Chris Christie had a falling out with the Trump campaign after he caught #COVID19? It seems like that quickly changed this tone.   https://t.co/rAzGWDylTv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden wins Georgia, are @staceyabrams and @KeishaBottoms the two rising stars in the state? The real question could be whether they're running against each other for Governor. #Georgia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, in good news, both of my waiver wire requests went through. #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I wake up and look at where states are currently and what's left to be counted, I would certainly feel better if I were the Biden Campaign this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, there is still a lot to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During a high stress moment, such as the night of election, it's telling of one's character when you listen to the words they provide to others. The race is still close and the states that were supposed to be the focus still are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9rimm @aaronknights12 The crazy thing is the race could still be lopsided. What most pundits said about it being close and down to three states is still very true. We just didn't want it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter the outcome at the end of the night, we should all feel pride in seeing the turnout numbers. The fact that the day started with some states already surpassing their 2016 numbers is remarkable. Progress happens when people show up. #MSNBC2020 #ElectionDay2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>4 things about #HunterBiden and his emails: 1. The FBI should respond. 2. How do these emails compare to the President’s quid pro quo calls? 3.

<|startoftext|>@Wakefield716 If he does. I think he was one of the more careful individuals with all of his comments to date.

<|startoftext|>The Republicans and Democrats both have great rising stars in their ranks. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we have as many respected statesman anymore. It seems like #Romney might be trying for that, I wonder who else will.  https://t.co/mAJ1Qfmdm2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I know...but I can hope. I actually wanted Biden to walk out and immediately say he passed a drug test, then look at Trump and ask if he took one. Or, he should play with his ears the entire time to get the conspiracy theorists going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to Chris Wallace tonight. He's one of my favorite interviewers, and I think he's tough. Now I just hope the debate shows two adults discussing plans and not a battle of personal attacks. #Debates2020 #FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer We own a rescue pit and he’s a baby. This entire article makes me sick. Thankfully someone was in the right place at the right time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen so many mentions from local governments and here's another. As the Senate focuses their attention on a SCOTUS nominee, small businesses, local/state governments, and individuals will suffer. Focus on a #COVID19 relief bill first.  https://t.co/dwcO8JwGeI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCookVA I can’t speak for the senate dems of that time. Nor can I speak for why senate republicans have changed their talking points from 4 years ago. I can only speak for myself. The ending of the filibuster was something I said was ill advised back then too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss the days when a president would select a Supreme Court justice who could potentially receive 70% support. A lifetime appointment should enter the position with that support, rather than knowing their selection is surrounded by politics. #SCOTUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I thought about that one too, but then I assumed it would come in one of the others. Foreign policy, health care, and education (especially with COVID19), among others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, these are the topics everyone wants to hear about. The debate will come on the verge of both Iowa and Georgia reporting deadlocked polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllThingsJen As someone who's worked on several campaigns in the past, it's what some people need to hear and say. There's always the people that think about today and not tomorrow. Elections matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllThingsJen You're right, he might not want to. That said, he and Alito (both over 70) might feel pressure to do so if Trump wins again. The impact of this election could matter even more when you consider the possibility that in some shape or form it might end up 8-2 or 7-3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone feeling as though they're vote won't have any affect on the Supreme Court, you couldn't be more wrong. Even if a conservative is confirmed into the #RBG seat, it's important to remember Breyer is 82 and Thomas has been rumored to be thinking about retirement. #SCOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fully believe Congress can focus on multiple important issues at once. That said, I'm curious where assistance for small businesses, local governments, state governments, the and the forest fires all rank? Since it seems they're all focused on the #RBG seat... #SCOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnKeenan3434 @LindseyGrahamSC Yes, he was confirmed on Oct. 6, however the hearings were done prior to Graham’s statement here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 Completely agree. When comparing to each other, it's different. I think many people hold Biden to this high standard and anything less is a blow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I know. The truth is, I don't even think he's doing that well. He's doing fine, but he's obviously not Biden of 8 years ago. That first debate is going to be the real test.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The sad part of whether or not Trump made disparaging comments about the military and those who have lost their lives is the fact that it's believable.

Wearing a mask, time limits, reduced occupancy, and other mitigation measures could all be put in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWelshofer Definitely been there. I donated blood on someone's first day. I kept telling them it was OK, then another nurse came over to let me know I was pale as a ghost and should lie back. That was a fun day...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaKClark Agreed. I’ve had friends who’ve worked for similar groups in the past and have constantly promoted them. I just hope the countless people that are all of a sudden posting about the important issue don’t move onto so something else in another week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re currently posting about #SaveTheChildren... Don’t get into a conversation about masks, don’t state we should focus on the topic instead of others, and don’t try to spread falsehoods that aren’t helpful. Do act, or continue to remain quiet.   https://t.co/lDPIJSilKY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraHayesDC Things are good. We're both doing well. Obviously the restaurant/bar scene is a struggle, thankful to be healthy and have our other jobs as well. For the first time in years, we've actually been getting time together to work on our house again. How are you doing???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a co-owner of a restaurant and bar, this is anti-business. We're all doing our best to remain viable, while protecting the well-being of our customers and staff. It's unfortunate when patrons can't get behind these simple measures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you don’t have any well thought out critiques you settle for the biggest words you know. @KamalaHarris  https://t.co/625jq4t5u1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FL Sen. Scott previously said NY shouldn’t get a bailout after being hit hard by Covid. When FL was hit, NY sent supplies. Now the FL says they’ll need Washington relief. Wonder if @SenRickScott told his Gov no too. Forget the politics, state and local governments need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we should all step back and realize for the first time in our history a black woman is on a presidential ticket. Once we allow that to officially sink in, we should also ask the question of how did it take that long? #Progress #KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Bass is out of the running for VP. If people want to play the game based on where people are speaking at the convention, it's Elizabeth Warren for VP. (Harris and others are on Thursday, VP is slated for Wednesday.) #BidenVP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah...I would agree. I also think it's pretty inappropriate to compare college football players to those who fought for the US during WW II.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaKClark Baseball has certainly not left me with much confidence that it can happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just thought about Kamala Harris debating Mike Pence and I realized it would probably be must watch TV. #VPDebate #BidenVP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaKClark I completely agree with you. I hope the NFL is played, especially with hype around the Buffalo Bills. However, I completely support the safety and well-being of everyone first and foremost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a Big Ten football fan...you're probably not too happy right now.  https://t.co/CRuCD8n7ls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's the confirmation that the VP is also not Michelle Obama, if she's speaking Monday. If the VP gives a better speech than the former President it will be the talk of the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hootietheclown I'm going to take a guess it's not her though...I'd love to see the surprise from people though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hootietheclown If it's Michelle Obama, I can say someone in our household will likely be very happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With a decision coming soon, it looks like you can begin narrowing down the candidates for VP. Gov. Whitmer is speaking Monday at the convention, so she's out.  https://t.co/Wuxm3rORbe #BidenVP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If @TakeAwayTre_ or any other player decides to opt out, don't blame them. Some things are more important than a game. He's got a long career ahead of him and many more years in Buffalo. The goal this year should revolve around player (and their families) safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not commenting on the effectiveness of the ad, but this picture of Biden is powerful. What looks like a very private photo shows a bit of empathy to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremyscarroll @bobconfer Completely agree. It all depends on who we're talking about. Gen Z is the group just out of college in their first jobs. Millennials had 9/11 before entering the workforce, the Great Recession, and then this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer This would drive my English teacher wife insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NFL players have until 4pm (today) to officially opt out for the upcoming season. Two questions remain in my mind: 1. who will be the biggest start to pass on playing this season, and 2. do we really think there will be a season to play?  #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>News: Herman Cain has passed away from COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 Yep. I think many in Congress would have major issues with this, from the liberal to the constitutional conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The talk of delaying a national election should should upset everyone. Moments after bad news comes out about the economy that's the response from the President. If the election were delayed, it's realistic to think it would fall after the January date and need further approval.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I realize many people enjoy shopping on Thanksgiving Day, but it's great to see a number of stores deciding they will now be closed.

<|startoftext|>@bobconfer I think those are valid reasons. There were several components where he was late on compared to others. Though, I also think many governors would fall into that category too. I think Cuomo will continue to come back down to earth in the coming months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a 7-2 decision the Supreme Court has ruled against the President's desire to keep his financial records private. I tend to believe if you're running for President, all of this should be on the table. #SCOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump said in an interview with Fox that he doesn't have a problem with masks and he did recently wear one. He then compared his appearance to that of the Lone Ranger...

<|startoftext|>Congratulations to several friends listed here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those who believe COVID-19 is simply a tactic by Democrats in an election year, let's travel back in time to 2014 during the midterm elections. Ebola killed 2 Americans, and a future president was calling on Obama to resign and Senators were calling him a failure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whether tests are being done or not, the CDC Chief believes the overall COVID-19 infection number could be 10x higher.

<|startoftext|>In other news, 14 states have just reported their highest infection rates of COVID19. Whether you want to talk about it or not, it's still an issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Beccie0725 @bobconfer Do you know where to find that in writing? I agree with you that I would be cautious, but I know some in the area would like to see this. As of Friday we were hearing it wasn't the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer I think some people are just doing it and haven't realized there might be limitations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer It's statewide. The question was raised on one of the local Medina COVID19 pages and the response was provided from someone in emergency management. They posted a couple of the sections.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WayneEIFS @DCMinute It is important to differentiate between those protesting and looting. There's quite a bit coming out about those driving the violent acts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer I agree with you, but it's been a question. I've heard it from several now and there are more that are telling people they don't need to wear one and you can't make them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I use this analogy too. It’s spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with #AllLivesMatter is that it's only used when #BlackLivesMatter is trending. It is the defense that a specific group might need more attention and is being unfairly treated in society. Show all lives matter, by focusing on the black ones for a little bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether you care about the Republican Party or not, does anyone think the President cares if it exists in another year? I think he wants R’s elected to help his causes, not that he thinks it’s the best for us.  https://t.co/wv6L7d28cH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chriswadeva While I don't disagree with that, a campaign is a long game. At some point, there are voters who will sit down and try to determine who the 2 candidates are. Will they be able to list several things about Biden they like, or just things about Trump that they don't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Dak Prescott really wants $45M a year, the #Cowboys should let him walk, sign Cam Newton to a 2 year deal, and draft a QB in 2021. Cam would have a host of great weapons and a solid OL. Cowboys would have loads of money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 The same could be said for Nixon/Kennedy. Nixon's campaign tried to get him to be friendly with the press and he just could've do it. There's a great story about a swimming pool. In the end, he also condemned the WaPo and blocked them from the WH during Watergate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 I think a lot of people are asking that same question, for different reasons. He was vetted for VP in one of the most important elections of our lifetime. He was also praised by his accuser multiple times for positions on this exact topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 I disagree with this one. 2 points: 1. media bias is not a new thing. History shows it's been since the beginning of the US (look at Jackson vs. Q. Adams) 2. time will tell if the handling of this was a mistake. What if Reade's allegations turn out to be untrue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 It being wrong? Or Reade's allegation? As for sexual assault, I think it's a sign of times changing. People are finally being taken seriously and accusations are being investigated rather than just dismissed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 ...and honestly, isn't some of the point that it shouldn't matter if it's a minnow or a whale? Wrong is wrong. This one is going to be challenging, when Reade notes that even her complaints don't include her allegations now. I hate the allegations no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 I don't disagree that they're different in terms of the positions, but remember many actually were propping Franken up as a rising star in the Democratic Party. He wasn't just some guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those so quickly calling the responses to Kavanaugh/Biden allegations a double standard, I think you're forgetting how Democrats pushed Al Franken out. That said, of course people are more likely to believe some people over others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you use the quote, “Arbeit macht frei” on a sign to get back to work, you're better off returning to history class. Those are not just words. #Auschwitz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachbarnhart @morningmika During the UD question, yes. That's why I think they will authorize that search as soon as he realizes it wasn't opening all the files, just her name. Besides that he said Reade had the right to come out, shouldn't be attacked, and had the right to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachbarnhart @morningmika She definitely did a good job and stuck on questions. As for the Biden/Kavanaugh comparison, I disagree. Biden seemed focused on repeatedly stating women should come forward and not be attacked in doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be shocked if we don't learn by the end of the day that @JoeBiden is giving the University of Delaware the go ahead to look into his records for the name Tara Reade. #MorningJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet a lot of people tune in to hear this. While I'm sure he'll deny the allegations, I hope he stands up for victims coming forward.  https://t.co/ndz2xDjY7K #Joebiden<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden's camp should take a play out of Trump's 2016 book and call into morning shows every week.

<|startoftext|>@9rimm Honestly, I think Warren should take the Ted Kennedy approach and become a lion in the Senate. She could use her national support to push for certain issues. Or...she gets a cabinet spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9rimm Yeah...I think either of them would be wise to pick someone considerably younger. Especially someone they could see being a presidential contender in 4-8 years. I think 2020 was the last chance for all 3, unless it's a reelection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9rimm I'll disagree. I think he's probably been the one that when VPs come up it's always a woman. I realize a Senator from California might not get more votes, but Harris would certainly bring an energy he might not currently have. As one of the options, that is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@9rimm You have to wonder if the reason Mike Pence is leading the efforts are so that they have a scapegoat in case things sour fast. Drop him from the ticket, pick a new VP (Haley) and move on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I sure hope so. A lot riding on Josh Allen in his 3rd year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going into the year it seemed a lot of people were saying the Bills would play around with a 6-10 or 7-9 record, some fans thought playoffs. It seems weird to enter this off season with some saying the Super Bowl might be in play. What a weird world we live in. #GoBills<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I appreciate that Rep. Schiff is an attorney, but I would've avoided his name as a Senate trial manager. I don't believe he'll sway anyone and if anything he plays into the partisan narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9rimm Lucky you. NYE in Medina?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a Senator, Democrat or Republican, I think you should recuse yourself if you've already determined how you will vote on the impeachment. A juror would be rejected, wouldn't they? Now, onto important things...the Bills made the playoffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't then Senate act as the jury and in this case the President as the defendant? I'm sure that would go over well in other trials. Frankly, I wish others would testify during the Senate hearings, there seem to be others that need to speak  https://t.co/32pnV5y1w6 #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's got to be tough to be an Angels' fan. They continue to go after big hitters, but it never really seems to make a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always find it absurd when members of Congress and others want to stop specific items, this time impeachment, so they can get back to work...

<|startoftext|>Frankly, I think everyone should testify. McGahn definitely should and I think Nunes and Schiff should at least answer certain questions about their actions and what they know (when they knew it). Put politics aside and get to the bottom of this. #Impeachment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>NY-27 is getting attention again, and again, it's for the wrong reasons. Republican or Democrat, I hope we can all rise above and elect a solid public servant. Too many ignored the allegations in 2018 and voted because of the R.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the NFL really cares about QB and player safety, I’m shocked the hit on Josh Allen isn’t even going to get a small suspension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not about politics, it's just sad that he was reelected to his seat when these allegations were plain as day and public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair, didn't Bernie supporters say this after Hillary was nominated? It's over a year away, let's take a deep breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DYK the last time the Buffalo Bills beat the NE Patriots (when Brady played 4 quarters) was after their 3-0 start in 2011? Also, the Bills started out down 21-0. Hmm...seems familiar... #BillsMafia #GoBills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those trying to avoid the impeachment talk that will dominate the news for the coming weeks, football is one day closer than it was yesterday. #facts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I think I'm OK with it. If McCoy was coming off a great or even good year, I'd probably think otherwise. The Bills seem like they have faith in the 3rd round rookie to learn from Gore then more to him as the year continues.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amazing time at the 4th Annual Medina Farm to Table dinner, last week.

<|startoftext|>I'll always be a Tyrod fan, but he's not a Buffalo Bills player anymore. Peterman has shown consistency and I'm surprised we're so quick to move on from him. This should be easy to determine he's starting week 1. I wanted McCarron to shine, but he's not going to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyhungerford Isn't he in prison after threatening people at the funeral home? Maybe Dez Bryant can play OL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manafort is found guilty on 8 counts. Inside the courtroom I envision him looking like this...  https://t.co/RWwdAdN7EQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like AJ McCarron's second opinion looked better than expected. The third week with Josh Allen starting should be telling. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adarraghbills @ChrisTrapasso But a second round pick? There are likely better qbs out there that Indy could turn around and trade that pick for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 The people he spoke highly about all make sense. It would've been a bigger issue if he was negative about his own QB, who he admittedly points out that he doesn't play against them much. Things about Allen just don't make sense though. Glad Allen took the high ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #Cuomo missed the mark just as much as #Trump. #America is already great, we should just all acknowledge that we can do much better. Everyday we should strive to build each other up and collectively move our country forward.   https://t.co/UWE9MP337I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer That's pretty cool. Can't say many people get compared to multiple presidents in the same sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 AGREED! Probably the same people who sit on their couch and scream at the tv while football players are kneeling during the National Anthem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you’ve got a big receiver like @kelvinbenjamin you should just feed him the ball. Great opening possession. #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always get nervous by the idea of trading a RD1 pick before the season, when you really don't know what your needs will be. This would certainly be an exciting piece before the year starts. #Wishfulthinking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TurboStyle7 I'll be honest, I wasn't big on Lebron until he came back to Cleveland.

Still think MJ is #1, but I'm excited.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 Agreed. It's a sad decision, especially when the NFL probably thinks this is a solution of any kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone in the NFL really believe they did anything about the #TakeAKnee? How long until it's unpatriotic to raise a fist. Or, better yet, until a video/images surface of players kneeling in the locker room. All you've done is created a new PR issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It seems the entire debate over #Tester and Dr. Jackson is a case of the White House not doing their job of vetting candidates. Only days after he stepped down, they are finding answers to accusations from former staff and members of Congress.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso There always seems to be several guys available in the second and third round, which is why I hated how much they gave up for Josh Allen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 I was hoping for Rosen. Then again, I wanted them to sit back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety Seriously. I'm surprised by the trade, but he was top 10 talent. Wish we hadn't traded up for Allen, but oh well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With the news that @68INCOGNITO is hanging them up, I hope they stay put in the first round. They have several holes, and now the need at OL is even more crucial. 2 picks in the top 22 will be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone else obsessed with every mock draft that comes out before the #NFLDraft? If it's just me, forget I asked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I might be the only one to think this, but I'm hoping the Bills stay put at #12 and keep their other first round pick. That allows them to still likely take a QB (if they want) and grab either a LB or someone else in the 20s. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha This one may have been a slight improvement on the straight lavender I did a couple days ago. Very spring...now it'll probably start snowing again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chamomile and lavender gin cocktails are a good idea. #CraftCocktails<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's it's all about transparency, why release one memo and not the other? Especially, when your own Justice Dept and FBI (hand picked director) objected to the one you released?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New cocktail. A twist on a NY sour that incorporates several other flavors. #craftcocktails  https://t.co/zLZfme5Yk5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's almost 5pm, there's snow on the ground, and it's #InternationalScotchDay...I'll be doing my best to celebrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...this happened! Thanks to the amazing staff, who is all staying on, we were able to make this happen.  https://t.co/YKY4BHzsqz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Yeah, it didn't seem like it's out of the ordinary, but Byrd certainly didn't have an easy task this year. Who knows, maybe we'll find out it was more the talent than the coach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright @ChrisTrapasso tell me that I should feel differently about the shake up at the DB coach for the Bills? Does this just look like they downgraded the coach for a college buddy of McDermott's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Definitely didn't think it was Eric Wood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoughts to @EWood70 on what's obviously an incredibly difficult day. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/txWP9QPznA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tsuj10 Did you forget to link to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdavhill @darcangel21 I think Tyrod was just at the Raptors Basketball game. I'm actually wondering if it turns out to be Cordy Glenn or Charles Clay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJCervi @SalSports I think they're saying it could be a career ending injury, which is the reason for the presser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDobbyn @TerryMcAuliffe @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Yes, I know his background, and know he grew up not far from where I sit now. I've liked him well before he became a name in the VA Gov race. That said, it's an easy hit right out of the gate with "Clinton money" when you're the one raising it. Like him, but easy shot right away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDobbyn @TerryMcAuliffe @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden While I agree that I like him as well, I think the ties to the Clinton's are too much. I can see an ad run over and over of him in a Hawaiian shirt drinking, then a mention of the Clintons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always great to see these sort of additions.  https://t.co/iAlJEuwMGO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sen. Johnson wasn't there another Wisconsin Senator who once made accusations that he couldn't back-up? Before dumping fuel on every fire that benefits your beliefs, maybe you should act like a Senator and work on getting facts first.  https://t.co/1QqUQQS7TL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @TyrodTaylor I'm with you, but I think for an 0-16 team they have a chance to jump and win 4-5 games with the right person. Several high draft picks could drastically turn the team around. Also, Josh Gordon and young receivers could pull some surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remain completely confused why we're debating funding for a wall. #Trump was very clear, along with his chanting supporters, that Mexico was going to pay for it. NOT US Tax Payers. #Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso And apparently so have a lifetime supply of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I really hope the Bills give @TyrodTaylor at least one more year. A new OC and more familiarity with the receivers will help. I hope Alex Smith goes to Cleveland and helps transition for a new QB. They'd love him right away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Alex Smith, I feel like he got a raw deal in SF, but for anyone who thinks he's some amazing QB just started paying attention this past year. Taking away the first year with Dennison, Tyrod and Smith aren't that far off in passing stats. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, 2 bankrupt companies requested the tariffs? So...basically if you go bankrupt you should just ask to punish your competition as a chance to survive. Another job killing action.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>New cocktail idea with coffee bean infused Vermouth. #cocktails #coffee  https://t.co/b4sOgUISLX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 Agreed. His lack of play calling experience always seemed to make it a questionable hire.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 It's just sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hearing so many people complain about "lazy immigrants" and how they won't contribute. When many of our relatives were coming to the US, I wonder what people thought of their countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally hours of #IBSOrlando. Great show, but I'll be happy to get home tomorrow. Bring on the snow #Buffalo!  https://t.co/Le7RT35IJB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Busy week at #IBSOrlando. Sounds like I'll return to a snowstorm in Buffalo.  https://t.co/wE8BGda7PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spending the week in Orlando for #IBSOrlando. The weather will be a big change from the last week in #WNY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you burn jerseys and cheer when players you dislike end up hurt, you're not a real fan, you were probably one of the few Bills' fans not trying to lift Norwood up after the "wide right" too. Just remember, your biggest accomplishment on game day was turning on the tv. #Bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter who the QB for the #Bills is in 2018, you have to hand it to #Tyrod. For a team that was supposed to "tank" he made several plays that kept the Bills in games. They ended the drought. Personally, I wish they'd find an OC that would build around Tyrod, but oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs My dream scenario would be a win over the Patriots to make the AFC Championship. If that happens, anything else is just extra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knows how far the #Bills will make it in the playoffs, but could you imagine the the potential path to the SB: Beat your former coach who abruptly left (Jags), go to NE and win, then beat the Titans in a Music City Miracle rematch. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #Trump need to trade #DACA for #TheWall. Didn't he promise everyone Mexico was paying for it? Or is this a @TheMAURYShow moment when he hear "that was a lie"?  https://t.co/gF9FQxyYxa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delta So, I'm trying to book another flight out for Sunday, while keeping my return flight. I don't want to book another flight and then find out that my entire thing was canceled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My unconditional love of @Delta is dwindling. Trying to change my departure from Monday to Sunday, and they're telling me I have a non-refundable ticket. After being dropped 3xs, I finally waited on hold for 20 minutes only to be sent to the exist interview on my experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically #Trump says fake news when there are negative reports about what staffers have said about him. After the recent #FireandFury quotes he's threatening legal action against #Bannon. Are we supposed to assume all of these quotes are true then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 You and several of the comments are spot on. Bills fans are so excited they're donating to different organizations. Seems we should praise the fans rather than knocking them down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably some good motivation. I would note that the Bills beat a couple of the other playoff bound teams.  https://t.co/J3mRQCCzY4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love or hate Tyrod Taylor or any of the other Buffalo Bills players, but no matter what they collectively pulled together to make the playoffs. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well...that's one way to get some upstate votes.  https://t.co/Gy1NV6Yl3x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is probably good for many people.  https://t.co/NfrNuJhxIu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fox News must be pretty excited as of late. They were able to get their sexual harassment and payouts done before the #MeToo movement began. Now they can just point fingers at liberals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump just said it's the largest tax cut in our history. Umm no. I believe it's actually the 8th largest, when you take inflation into account. Celebrate the tax cut, but don't lie about it.  https://t.co/MbBQd6bEm1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone wondering if voting matters, just look at Virginia. Literally 1 vote just changed the balance of the Senate. #VAPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety Wow! Tough day for your running backs. I actually played against Gurley in my one league...it's safe to assume I didn't end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety Clearly you shouldn't listen to me. I'm barely in my one game, and with Antonio Brown likely done, I probably am too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I'm counting on him scoring at least a TD. Tyrod is going to need to push the ball down field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merry Christmas #BillsMafia Kelvin Benjamin is playing. Nice to give Tyrod a big target in such a mammoth game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Need to be in Philadelphia by 430 and I've been stuck in the airport line for just long enough to likely miss my 1pm flight. @AmericanAir want to hold a plane for me. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that depending on who you read, the Bills are either in or out of the 6th spot. @ESPN says they're in the 6th spot, others have them in the 8th. Anyone know who's right? @ChrisTrapasso<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't often agree with @WalshFreedom, but civil discourse often means we realize both individuals/parties simply disagree on the best path. This statement below doesn't surprise me, it's some of the comments that assume he's a liberal pundit that do. Do you know Joe Walsh?  https://t.co/gMDvIU7VUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Al Franken is making the right decision in resigning. While he didn't admit "guilt" of every accusation, this is a statement that we need to listen to accusers, and not demonize them like many have for years. #MeToo #AlFranken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With declining support, #Franken has a unique opportunity to give a speech throwing himself under the bus, while taking others like Moore and Trump with him. It could be another step in the #MeToo movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After watching Roy Moore's spokesman and her interview with @andersoncooper, I'm convinced she knows more about Doug Jones than she does her own boss. #AlabamaSenateRace  https://t.co/zzQr74VSJY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For everyone having agreeing with Steve Bannon in his criticism of Mitt Romney not having military service, are you also critical of #Trump for avoiding Vietnam? It's not about politics, it's about being consistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @DCMinute @SipTommyrotter We actually have everything of theirs on the shelf right now, including their new whiskey that I just picked up. You're welcome to try any of the others on Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMaroneyNBA @darcangel21 This is the best argument for Gronk being a bully then. He's 6'6 265+-, White is 5'11 175. He finally took it out, but not on someone his own size. Get frustrated, push someone extra hard next time. Don't blindside someone, when they are already facedown after a play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The argument over the #MasterpieceCakeShop is not the same as the right to deny placing a derogatory message on a cake. The wrongdoing is with denying to sell the cake to certain people, based on their sexual orientation. The baker could refuse a certain msg on the cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still can't buy that the travel ban wasn't just a political ploy for supporters. It's been around 10 months since it was originally put in place. What's been done in those 10 months by the admin, to fix our vetting process? I imagine nothing.  #SupremeCourt #TravelBan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For Bills fans who have been calling for Eli as the '18 QB, I wonder how often they watch him play. His YPA are lower than Tyrods, he barely has more tds, and turns the ball over more than twice as much, all in a pass heavy offense. #Billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear it seems like no one told him he's the coach of the Sun "Devils".  https://t.co/v4caPiUCdY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm more excited about #HouseofCards now than I have been in awhile. It's time for Robin Wright to lead the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @TIME I agree with you. Mueller theoretically makes sense in 2018, but not this year. Kaep certainly makes sense, funny enough Trump helped to keep his profile high. I just think, in terms of impact, #Metoo wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the @TIME Person of the Year announcement around the corner, the short list is pretty remarkable. While there's a case for each, I have to say #MeToo has my vote (if we could vote). The movement has created a platform that seems to be providing the shelter so many need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's pretend White is on the ground injured when #Gronk goes at his back with his arm. He got lucky that he was just slow getting up. Nice apology, but how about you don't pull moves like that and then you won't need to give one. #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is BS. Who in the world are these refs? If you're not calling that a 4th down, you're measuring. #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time Tyrod has a big play I'm convinced it's coming back on a penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsFoodAlex To me, this is just like the one game benching of Tyrod. It places blame on a team leader, when there were others who were essentially given a pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsFoodAlex While I still can't believe benching Eli, if they wanted a look at another qb then play Davis Webb in the fourth quarter. Smith made no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations Ben McAdoo! You benched a staple in NY football for someone who's done anything but succeed (while leaving a rookie on the bench), claimed it was about winning, and might soon be out of a job. Caps off an awful week for Giants football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bills like this, on both sides, show why all members should be forced to watch "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."  https://t.co/GXQ5fHuuxu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha See you next weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety Honestly everyone is split. I'm starting him and hoping he airs it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think someone should tell Tennessee to stop releasing the names of people their interviewing. Interview several over a week period, then work out a deal. At this current rate, it seems like everyday they are mentioning another person likely to turn them down. #Vols<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tennessee fans, I don't think Lane wants to come coach your team if he's mocking you guys like this. #Vols  https://t.co/ZXhhiptTfG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's a list from @Forbes on the wealthiest sports team owners. You can assume they hate Washington fans, since they put Jerry Jones and Bob Kraft at #16, with Lerner as the name.  https://t.co/jPWNAf2q3y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Ben McAdoo have a coaching job at the end of the year? Unless we all of a sudden see Davis Webb take over and show promise, I think he's on the chopping block before the final game. #EliManning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Agreed. Geno is never going to be anything besides a backup. The move just makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Yeah, the logic that Geno gives them a better chance to win is idiotic. Webb would make complete sense, if they're thinking of drafting a QB in the 1st round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso How dare you use facts to eliminate the possibility of a conspiracy or NCAA Football scandal. Come on man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdell3 Yes, he lacks 'slickness', but it also seems that he might lack a basic understanding of why he's running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Obamatomic Yep. It seemed like someone who woke up and just decided to run for office, having no real clue why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Ret. Col. Lee Busby on #MorningJoe about his Alabama Senate Race write-in campaign, and he's interesting... He seems either uncomfortable in front of a camera, or like he doesn't have a clue what he's doing. #AlabamaSenateRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems important to remember Tyrod Taylor is 6-4, this year. With several wins when no one thought they had a chance. Not perfect today, but I liked that they were more aggressive on 1st downs. He missed some, but made some too. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the sake of giving Tyrod a chance, I really hope his weapons and OL are healthy. Rooting for Kelvin Benjamin! #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #ThanksgivingEve and Sean McDermott started the holiday off right by naming @TyrodTaylor the starter for Sunday. Hoping he turns things around, and the defense figures out how to stop someone. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If McDermott decides to start Peterman again, and he goes out and tosses 3 INTs with another loss, is the coach's job all of a sudden in jeopardy? #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha These are great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I just hope the coach comes to his senses and they put Tyrod back in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations!  https://t.co/9wQ4gBCeMh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I caught this. It's true. I think it's a decision I'll never understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 I would agree. I truly think they just need to emphasize he needs to push the ball downfield. Do that and open up holes for Shady. No reason they shouldn't be able to win the next 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjmesq1 @4RosesBourbon If you think it's ruining it, you're not doing it right. It only shows the diversity of the beverage, and all it can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems safe to say if McDermott decides Peterman is going to start against the Chiefs, he's also telling us there is no hope of the playoffs and don't bother watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs And if you look again, it's 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Curran @4RosesBourbon 2 oz Four Roses Small Batch .5 oz Coffee Liqueur  .25 oz (Simple Syrup) 2 large dashes of orange bitters Flamed orange garnish over a large ice cube<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was a really fun experiment. Can we put Tyrod in and see what he can do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops I went first 2 and Fitz. I got lucky that Thompson had a td.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that could be one of the worst first series for the Bills all year. Hopefully the injury doesn't turn out to be that bad. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SJ_Gill As McCoy stated, the entire offense wasn't playing well and this surprised them all. It seemed like the "team first" mentality was lost in this one. I'm sure Tyrod gave up the 500 rushing yards over the last two weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe I'm saying this, but I like this piece from @mikerodak. Maybe Tyrod isn't the future, but now would appear to be the wrong time for this move.  https://t.co/BafiPhDa6L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, can we assume @PapaJohns thought everyone would cheer for them criticizing the NFL players, and now their margin has fallen. Could this just be them playing the sales game? #NFLProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeifertESPN Yeah, i think this is pretty inaccurate. Fans have been split for awhile. If he had continued to start, you could've completely reversed that same tweet. I just hope Peterman does a better job stopping the run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Yep. It's just shocking to me. I get that some people hate him, but change the play-calling if that's the concern. In all seriousness, if your defense gives up 500 yards rushing in 2 games, don't tell me it's the quarterbacks fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Everyone loves how the Bills have truly become this team first and One Buffalo. Yet, this move casts blame on a single player. The Bills were never going to be in the game giving up 47 points. It's not like the Saints are the Browns.  https://t.co/3NVo4EVxls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I don't know that I like this move. They finally get a healthy offense. This seems more like a decision from a coach on the hot seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bills coaches went on and on about how good the Saints D played and why Tyrod would remain the starter. What exactly changed in 2 days? If Peterman doesn't succeed, what then?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is old news, but important. If we blame mental illness for some shootings, why revoke this #backgroundcheck?  https://t.co/aCv2eKzlYU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's cool to think about the #Bills being playoff bound, but the first step is a win against the Saints. The season is 1 wk at a time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCtravelgirl They really should expand to rural upstate NY. It would be greatly appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 Yep, once again what you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daylight Savings is just awful. Now I wake up at 5:30am...  https://t.co/QrZvuVjxfZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard gun laws won't work, because murder is illegal and people still do that. So...maybe we should consider ways to help this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Al and Chris might want to stick to football and avoid discussing #NFLProtests. They sound like 2 guys who just woke up from decades ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best cocktail from our #Mezcal fun last night. This includes mezcal, mole bitters, and chili powder on top, among other things. #cocktails  https://t.co/GpEPBvNfXP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Donna Brazile thought everything at the DNC was bad enough to later write about it in a book, why didn't she resign after finding out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mont_Ale16 Yeah, I don't blame you. It's great for political insiders to write books, but do it years after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Honestly, we need Bernie to make a decision on what he's doing ASAP. Then they need him to immediately back a candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs They should work on small donations from a wider audience. Start talking about how many donors they have, rather than over all amount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Yeah, that being said, EVERYONE needs to stop talking about Hillary. Dems tell Trump let the election go, but Ds still won't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't entirely understand the uproar over #DNC debt. The #RNC was 23M in the hole after the '10 elections. This is nothing new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donna Brazile is a smart political insider. Releasing a book, at this time, only makes me think she's trying to improve her reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @DiGiornoPizza has a strong Twitter game. Papa John's now has multiple people to blame for their declining sales (look in the mirror).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 days of missing #FedEx. 1st day I'm in the barn, immediately call, but they wouldn't attempt again. 2nd day I run a work errand, and miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're having friends over for some #Mezcal cocktails tonight. Do you have any favorites drinks or types of Mezcal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad the Bills have the mindset they do this year. I can trust McDermott is keeping the team focused on the Jets, not playoffs. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to retweet this, because it was my exact thought after reading several comments immediately after the shooting.  https://t.co/MsxJXOtfEy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING NEWS: A lot of the information people relay about the #Manhattan shooting won't be true. You don't need to share fallacies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Halloween #BillsMafia. Beane said no deals this morning, then landed this one. 3rd and 7th rounder for KB.  https://t.co/YxW8M3B10w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While it does appear as though #POTUS might be scared of Dinosaurs, #FLOTUS nails the reaction. I'm sure the kid had a chuckle. #Halloween  https://t.co/Y2nD3zeKHl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @Netflix dropped the ball with the #HouseOfCards. They should've dropped Spacey and let Robin Wright sail the ship.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now you know. #EIFS  https://t.co/pqYN2kjr4T<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @StepOutBFLO You'll just have to come to the farm sometime. This is our backyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinsnyder12 You get it until you're in a serious relationship...then comes the advice about marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Lemon works well, if you want something more like an Old Fashioned you could do a 2 oz and .5 oz with a flamed orange (if possible).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha If you have anymore you can do a couple 3 ingredient mixes with honey syrup or maple and lemon. Those are two easier ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sen. Cassidy just clarified Pres. #Trump speaks in hyperbole, so it's basically impossible to take anything he says at face value.  https://t.co/rZg6PL6lN8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha At this point I should ask what you decided to do with it? What other ingredients do you have on hand and how boozy do you like drinks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, people actually felt like they couldn't say #MerryChristmas over the last several years, I'm sure all of you actually stopped saying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't do all of these, did fall ever really happen?  https://t.co/9Y1hqniEKX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one way to play to your base.  https://t.co/HaQK0pYR5x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ironic to hear @FoxNews talking so much about the people who enabled #Weinstein, and believe many didn't know about Roger Ailes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UNC proves what good lawyers can do. $18M in legal fees are all it took.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rosecollins Agreed. In the game of trying to find time to manage different accounts, Instagram made things easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Instagram stories was the perfect alternative, as people were wondering how effective Snapchat was to their brands.  https://t.co/ne4ZmQgUyP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon @BenSasse Agreed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I don't know that I could ever get to a point to vote for @BenSasse, but I'd certainly root for him and respect him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha JFK, Bill Clinton, Trump, we seem to create excuses for those we like and condemn the others. Just a little head, locker room talk, and more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of people commenting on #Weinstein that have turned a blind eye to others because of their political beliefs is ridiculous.  https://t.co/MzaLro4wT4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if debates between Rep. Dan Donovan (I vote w/ Trump 90% of the time) and Michael Grimm (wasn't me) will involve images like this...  https://t.co/wnOGP9gPKp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Ditka doesn't think there's been oppression in the last 100 years? Example of Ditka looking...  https://t.co/aRC292Gqw9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I think Barnidge makes a lot of sense, right now. Though I love the idea of Logan Thomas making the best of an opportunity. #Wishfulthinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I want to argue that Cam Newton has matured and gets a bad rap, he goes and acts like this...  https://t.co/EIIXNv8YO4  https://t.co/YOVHqikiiG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever thought about leaving the White House? #Tillerson  https://t.co/4SUECpgbsw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbbySandrs @cahill_diarmuid They are certainly all over the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After one sentence of briefing by #Tillerson he's officially not saying anything: "I still think he's a moron, but that's cool."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cahill_diarmuid @AbbySandrs It's a parody account...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone really think #Tillerson is going to say anything other than he and #Trump have a great relationship? "Just here to say we cool."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPembroke How are you guys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPembroke We're having a blast. We've got some exciting things planned for the next 6 months. Just bought our house, now just a lot of projects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You can't regulate evil". If this is how people really feel, are they also comfortable assuming the US is that much more evil than others?  https://t.co/PlOWXemZ0w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPembroke HA! I've actually been hitting the gym more frequently to combat these new ideas. This weekend I'm working on candy flavored drinks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindsayKensy Oh wow! Good note, keep an eye on the zipper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I just realized my new favorite fall ingredient for a cocktail is chai simple syrup. #cocktails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindsayKensy Our dog has that same bed. I'm so hoping he doesn't realize he could destroy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A leader doesn't kick someone when they're down, they figure out new ways to pick them up. #PuertoRico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If every team stands with locked arms as a sign of unity and equality, are people going to be upset they don't have a hand on their heart?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a better way to celebrate #NationalCoffeeDay.  https://t.co/cANCGaHJGp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely agree. Everyone knows you kills zombies through the head, not the heart.  https://t.co/zlBo4rVvrk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha A couch bed? You should've stayed in WNY and gone to Ale in Autumn with us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I see you spelled coffee before having a cup...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The death of #HughHefner has some guys thinking they've just seen their last nude woman.  https://t.co/bEXYyNq2qK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkennedy0714 Hopefully this generates several opportunities. Since land is getting scarce, I hope they spoke to perspective businesses about these spots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great piece. It'd be great if a couple non-divisive players could do an interview with a Nightly News host to clearly lay things out. #NFL  https://t.co/Ss8R5sr0Cb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we going to see #StevenSeagal trending every time he offers a political opinion now, or was this just because it was about the NFL?  https://t.co/XJykVXU1Rg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we debate opinions about standing or kneeling, Puerto Rico (part of the US) is without power, food, and under water.  https://t.co/RGzUPBLH00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Down with enlightenment!  https://t.co/nh8G3J3uKn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a sad time when instead of trying to understand why we disagree we rush to assuming others are bad. #StandUp #TakeTheKnee #AllAmericans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This list was too much fun to come up with.  https://t.co/VXWL7s6tcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinHullery @ChrisTrapasso Yes, but then you'd have nothing to comment on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso More importantly, don't be guy that watches sports on couch &amp; claims to be an expert over someone who spends 24/7 doing it as a profession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDobbyn I think this was taken out of context. Pretty sure he also told Trump not to leave the deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha You should try chai infused bourbon next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Jeff Flake, but listening to him discuss #GrahamCassidyBill makes it seem like they're pushing things to states. #MorningJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha That gin is pretty good. We just did a fall gin &amp; tonic with it. Have you had their barrel-aged gin? It packs a punch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Did you infuse it, or is it brown sugar? Some bars still don't make their own, so it's fancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I know where I'm getting my NFL Draft news... (as if anything is changing)  https://t.co/nmI0Ic9Cgu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha So...what's in the glass in the back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Unfortunately the district is far from 50-50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Yep, the district is very difficult. To even get close to 50-50 a well-funded and well-known candidate is likely needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There goes the candidate against Collins. Difficult district. Generic R has a big advantage starting off. #WNY  https://t.co/VoT9H3zl0T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how most of the comments in this thread seem to indicate there is more hate for the @ESPN reporter than the #Bills offense.  https://t.co/aG2AzoM1ck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... I wonder if @johnrobertsFox is trying to say #CanadaFirst ? I live in NY and did as well.  https://t.co/0k9UZx3p4d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 Agreed. The team is built around running effectively. People can hammer Tyrod, but McCoy never got things going either. D looked great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BillsMafia fans continue to post about how to blame for yesterday's loss, I bet the actual players are figuring out how to win a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always frustrating to read the #ESPN #Bills coverage. A great game by the D seems to be a side note, when they can write negative things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're frustrated about the Holmes interference call, ignore it. Here's the face mask just before it. #Billsmafia  https://t.co/9suoQZ2JYX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bills fought hard yesterday. Offensive struggled, but they were there until the end. Hopefully they focus on incorporating the WRs more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billsupdates @MatthewFairburn @RyanTalbotBills Good grades.QB was very difficult, when the running game didn't exist. There was no creativity either, first down was a consistent run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FantasyFootballAdvice Hunter Henry or Cameron Brate? The struggle is real when it's only week 2. #FantasyFootball  https://t.co/Ct63bzxWe8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gus Johnson is slowly making college football amazing, one short pass at a time.  https://t.co/wyWFfiBPs0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 @SpringLakeWine @niagwinetrail @BuffaloBloggers @BuffaloNiagara @LockportJournal @BuffaloExplore Good, that gives us a lot to work with. Freedom Run, @ArrowheadSpring @ChateauNiagara and of course @OAKESWINERY are all worth trips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobconfer @Mariachi_De_Oro One of our favorite places. Leo does a great job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 @SpringLakeWine @niagwinetrail @BuffaloBloggers @BuffaloNiagara @LockportJournal @BuffaloExplore Which ones? We should get a group together and visit a couple. We could probably arrange a couple things with some of the winemakers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 @SpringLakeWine @niagwinetrail @BuffaloBloggers @BuffaloNiagara @LockportJournal @BuffaloExplore We're still trying to see if we can visit all of the wineries on the trail. I think we have about 5 more to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's cool if you're excited about a wknd of warmer weather, but I'm just over here thinking I want my house to look like this again! #Fall  https://t.co/q9OR8CZrz9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 @rbrColorado @FoxNews It was, you're right. It's a cool story. Though I feel like he's thinking, "I forgot, I hate mowing the lawn."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone claiming they would boycott #JemeleHill or #ESPN actually watch either in the first place?  https://t.co/DYsgm28Wqk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now I'm thinking Eds.  https://t.co/5QewC2qMLa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question for PR folks: Do you recommend any press release services, if so, what's your favorite? @prweb @PRNewswire or others? #PR #media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneEIFS Also crazy how the Dodgers have completely fallen apart. September can make or break teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In '07 #Trump tweeted that Obama was a racist. If #SarahSanders is saying #JameleHill should be fired, what does she think of her boss?  https://t.co/xFbA8wHQrI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikerodak You're off on the Buffalo Bills. Lonzo even jokes about being the oldest on the team. Not by much, but still the oldest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Sadly it's true. The whole thing was a tactic to get the base behind him. In the end, it doesn't do anything to help us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so funny.  https://t.co/u9hazdyyH0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SJ_Gill We have been talking about it. We've got about 8-10 fall drinks we'll publish as soon as we have photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like we might have warmer weather this wknd. Maybe we need to bring back a Tiki drink... #cocktails #rum  https://t.co/GM4U6gezVj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you just need a #cocktail to finish off the day. This has a blend of #bourbon, maple cinnamon syrup, &amp; orange bitters.  https://t.co/BIWmJvvgxt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FantasyFootball draft. I picked Antonio Brown #3, now the long way for another pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I agree. IF these reports are true, it takes away from his ability to fight for the underdog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I think it's more than a slap in the face, because of his justification for retiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha NICE! We are a household hoping Tyrod is healthy. Alix is a bit of a diehard fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha We get together at Alix's dad's place for the game. Lots of food, bills gear, and shouting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs So true. Especially, because he made a big deal about his retirement being tied to outside of football work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is anyone supposed to work when football starts in a couple days? #NFLKickoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're posting about #FakeNews and it didn't come from the Onion or a satire site, it's not fake. It just doesn't relay what you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs It'd be an awfully low blow. Especially, because of the reasoning he used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true, I don't know if this is a bigger slap in the face to the #Bills or the causes he said he was retiring for.  https://t.co/pV4m0J8yyP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Football is unpredictable and no one can really assume how all of these #Bills moves will play out. That said, it's definitely confusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTravisHare I believe the Supreme Court has been pretty direct that the nurse was correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people want to draft a qb, but I was thinking how much I'd love James Washington during last night's game. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great work by the @IntlCodeCouncil! #harvey  https://t.co/R0U5DuuBZW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FoxNews has been vocal about how the #MSM paints a picture of low support for Trump and how it's clearly higher...41% apparently is higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 :) I wonder if it's possible? I'll take your word for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 If you're comfortable admitting that, it's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt about it, I love our hometown! #ILoveNY #WNY  https://t.co/qKw8Iu4srf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RunWineOpine Sadly, the same people attacking her were defending attacks against the Obamas, and those defending her were the ones attacking before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG #Obama wore a tan suit, #Melania wore high heels to get on a plane! What is American coming too?!?! #SMH  https://t.co/pELEFoSWNd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urbanbohemian I've currently got maple in dark rum and some coffee beans in Aperol and Bourbon. Time for fall cocktails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SamInsalaco If you guys make it our way this fall, we'd love to have a drink or stop by a local winery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamInsalaco Thanks. Awesome, yes. Also happy to get back to enjoying other things that were playing second fiddle for several months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to put together my top 20 for fantasy drafts over the next week. Jay Ajaya really confuses me. #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A little hometown pride for #WNY. Here's a historic image of the Hart House Hotel in #MedinaNY. It's a must visit.  https://t.co/Z8qtYRERYd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What would make your list of #bourbon to try before you die?  https://t.co/WsE52qzOU3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like a smart move, if they didn't think he was healthy and didn't fit moving forward. Pick is better than nothing.  https://t.co/2nR3Z57iK9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moral of the story, concussions are bad. That said, @MikeRodak is dramatic. Everyone always says he's not a TT fan.  https://t.co/m3OXld41PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 Here's my thought, at 7-9 last year how are the Bills worse now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the wake of so many frustrated Bills fans, I would say go tryout @StevieJohnson13. If he can produce, it may boost fanbase. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure I was reciting poetry and pointing out all the beer and @OAKESWINERY wine when this photo was taken.  https://t.co/8RDVZJP5oA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 Hilarious! I'm still holding out hope that with everyone counting on a weak season, the Bills will once again disappoint and be competitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW! Now there is a name I forgot. Should've stayed local and gone to Syracuse...says a local Cuse fan.  https://t.co/gH5vRye9XK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 @CutonDime25 Thanks. It was quite the celebration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 @CutonDime25 They were 2-6 w/ Sammy playing. WR was injured all yr, seems easy to think a healthy group might outperform last year's group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 @CutonDime25 Agreed, but I don't think that's an expectation. He's never done that, so why start now. I don't think their offense is much worse than '16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schantzman87 It's certainly difficult to predict. All signs point to a struggle, but they won 7 games last year, and they didn't have much more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBeerNut It's totally possible. There are several QBs though that might be mid-late first round too. I'm hopeful w/ one of the picks the get a WR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm waiting for the Bills to be the shock of the NFL and be a fringe playoff team, a lot of people will be deleting tweets. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, this happened.  https://t.co/GtmM7umfPW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 Every time the Ryan's open their mouths we should cringe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Images like these. You have to wonder if we should be looking toward the younger generation a little more.  https://t.co/YM21HFBIHG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see notes on Matthews. He's a good talent and apparently a real leader in the locker room. I'm confident w/ the moves.  https://t.co/zw46KqQF65<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyhungerford @ChrisTrapasso Watch Watkins get hurt again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nothing else the 2018 draft is going to be a fun one for Bills fans. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking back it's hard to remember Jim Kelly's stats. His best years did come until his 30s. I'm hopeful Tyrod puts doubters to rest soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before Fournette gets ahead of himself, someone should tell him yesterday was a preseason game, it'll get faster.  https://t.co/K5yXhJp95o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I was satisfied with the 1st quarter of Bills play. #2 RB looked solid, Tyrod to Sammy looked good, D was solid. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mont_Ale16 #NationalLazyDay you're doing too much already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeahBuffalo Wow! Great shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love @JayBilas and he's completely right about your article.  https://t.co/Bnr2bMOMVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like #WalMart deserves a 'Come On Man' here. Advertising guns as back to school items, really?  https://t.co/6jNwlEldh1  https://t.co/qYVdBBjoC9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HA! #TweetoftheDay. Leave it to @rmcolker to put a cloud over gorgeous weather.  https://t.co/79faBsWOcF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean Heller has his primary opponent. #Trump supporters feel betrayed even though he voted to repeal, others because he went back and forth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For now, yes. In a couple months from now, "...and the Buffalo Bills have ended their playoff drought." #BillsMafia  https://t.co/Ysko1RBxkR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RapSheet I mean, the garbage plate reference is cool, but that's more Rochester. Wings would probably be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @AnquanBoldin I'm glad they got this done. I hope another ex-49er (@rodstreater80) also makes the team. He's had a great camp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the #BillsMafia @AnquanBoldin. The signing brings some great seniority to the receiving crew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronknights12 Agreed. It's one of those hypocritical things, I think. If the economy had tanked, I'm sure all would be pointing fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since a fed budget runs until the close of Sept, who should claim success or failure for the 1st 8 months of a presidency?  #JobsReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gov. Justice claimed he could no longer help his state as a democrat. Out of curiosity, how does changing his party change what he'll do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@09Lindsay09 Yep, no fun. We got the front door opened, but have no clue where it is now or if it made it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feeling like we're in the batcave. Watching tv and a bat flew in. No clue where it is now.  https://t.co/VuZvEWyNRS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone actually believe #JimJustice was a Dem? He changed parties to get elected and probably feels it's his best way to get reelected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamInsalaco Well, the alternative is not having a Wegmans... $200 isn't that bad when you think of it like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As people chant for immigrants to speak English, I wonder when they're personally going to worry about their grammar.#Immigration #RaiseAct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FoxAndFriends praising #Trump for stock market numbers. Haven't I been told for 8 yrs that it's not an indication on the economic state?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EsotericCD @buffalopundit Ha! I originally tweeted this too, but realized they moved it to July 26th. So, at least he can say he made it almost 1 week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok who had 5 days? That's all it took for the latest hire and fire. Upsetting that we won't see #Scaramucci on #SNL.  https://t.co/OD75yiCTP7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I'm not even going to try and figure out how old I was, or this conversation would drift into me feeling older.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you propose to cut a specific department by $9B, then give them $100K what's the message you're sending? You're not good at math? #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Which makes sense. Moss would be the only guy that I'd also have in mind, but he did only play 2 years (I think).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Kellen Moore makes a lot of sense. Nearly 75% completion his senior year with 40 plus tds. Tough list to create, so many people to consider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creating issues where there isn't one isn't the way to create policies. Maybe it's a distraction, but it's #sad.  https://t.co/JSgyp9Jn1B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While it's a little older, this was our drink for #NationalTequilaDay. It's a blend of tequila, jalapeno, lime, orange bitters, egg white.  https://t.co/iqKO3ZHxLm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will people realize firing AG Sessions won't end Mueller's investigation? The Senate will likely turn right around and reappoint him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sean Spicer resigns and people immediately line up to buy his book that doesn't exist yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today we should thank #SeanSpicer for not resigning until #SNL was on summer break. You're the MVP for all of us enjoying comedy.  https://t.co/Qrs4BWsM2M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I feel like you go to my gym in Medina. I keep turning on MSNBC to see how fast people will change the channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Pretty impressive. We were all set to go to Vera and someone told us to go last minute. The only thing is that it was pretty dead in there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@datadyne007 @ofsevit @universalhub Yeah, I've spent some time looking at it. It seems there were many issues. Another reason it's not permitted in other areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francessmith For the record, the London fire was an ACM not EIFS. EIFS does pass the required fire tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datadyne007 @ofsevit @universalhub EIFS wasn't on this building. The ACM was an exterior insulation, but it's not an exterior insulation and finish system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alix has been on hold now with @NYSEDNews about her teaching certificate for over an hour. Guess the 30 minute wait time wasn't accurate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NonWhiteHat @borismagocsi I think recent stories have said the aluminum composite material used in London is actually banned in US and Germany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1BlackArchitect It wasn't #EIFS. Articles are saying an aluminum composite material which is very different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_lohr In this case it wasn't clad in EIFS. All reports refer to an aluminum composite material, that I believe is banned in the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The act of violence against the #GOP reminds me of the reports during the '10 midterms against Democrats. None of this is OK.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Coffee on the side porch is a wonderful thing.  https://t.co/CR75zb71Rj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @SenatorLankford reminds everyone how #EricHolder didn't answer questions either. Bad politics. Wrong then, wrong now. #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When repeatedly falling back on a policy as justification for not answering questions, you should know what it is. #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW @KamalaHarris is really under #JeffSessions skin. #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HallieJackson @POTUS I think he's going to get yelled at for this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't even know if he likes a Bourne movie? No...YES! #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #JeffSessions wants the committee to ask more questions about how Russian interference impacted the election? #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly Sen. Heinrich doesn't understand that #JeffSessions can only answer questions #Trump wants him to. #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God someone wrote notes for #JeffSessions. He's having a difficult time remembering what he had for dinner. #SessionsHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You've got to feel bad for #JeffSessions. He clearly just doesn't remember anything.  https://t.co/VtGkiZJFOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like #JeffSessions is basically saying he won't be answering many questions, but you should believe everything he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KDM1617 Nope, just that McCoy will probably be pretty disappointed if he decides to go elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KDM1617 Since McCoy did some a big job to recruit Maclin, and they are friends, I imagine he won't be thrilled if he goes to Baltimore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TurboStyle7 She allowed herself to cross the line, just like he did. People can say that they want to hear more from Lonzo, rather than dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurboStyle7 All being said, I'm a Lakers fan, who would really like people to quiet down so we can focus on whether or not Lonzo can ball in the NBA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurboStyle7 I hate to say it, but he's going to invite a lot of negative comments. Right or wrong, he's like a non-stop Sh!t talker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem w/ Levar Ball is that his talk is overshadowing his son's play. I'd like to watch a Lonzo highlight and not have to hear him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Playing with cocktails tonight. Here's a gin, falernum, lime, orange bitters, cucumber, and mint.  https://t.co/lFbTRj9dyT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to spell the flowers! #TGIF now if 5pm could just hurry up.  https://t.co/RrmHNbuyZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha So frustrating! Honestly @Delta has saved me on multiple flights. I'd tweet them if you have any issues. Seriously, miracle workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good, let's put the ENTIRE FBI on the case too.  https://t.co/gKJI5USSG5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCFashionFool Still need to try it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we're looking at a new roof, how does everyone feel about the new #Tesla solar roofs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDobbyn It won't happen, but it'd be great to hear his name as a special prosecutor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindshawkins That sounds awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump really wants to shock everyone, he should keep Andrew #McCabe on as permanent FBI Director. #ComeyFiring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buffalopundit People investigate/question Trump's admin, they get fired (Yates, Comey, Bharara). This just invites another deep throat to come forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This can't be the actual letter...right? #Comey  https://t.co/f2OCoBlXWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The firing of #Comey shows the need for an independent special prosecutor. Put the entire thing to bed, in a non-partisan way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normally I would be a little bummed the weekend is over. However, we finally have sunshine again, so "What's up, Monday!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if #brunch was created to help us all deal with #SundayMorning news stories. It's the weekend, our focus should be mimosas.  https://t.co/GvjQV9ZtwE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a daiquiri, add cherry and orange bitters, then top with @OAKESWINERY. #ThirstyThursday  https://t.co/r1o6d5koSe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Fingers crossed that it turns out to be 60 and sunny. If not, I'll be drinking early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a president who compares immigrants to rapists and murders, and then he invites Rodrigo #Duterte to the White House?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJ_Gill @TaylorLeigh_G Of course. You all are doing a wonderful job. It's certainly not going unnoticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A family that's really pushing for great things in #BuffaloNY. Make sure to read @SJ_Gill and @TaylorLeigh_G  https://t.co/mLo47kqSyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone who really thought the election ended in 2016 should tell  #Trump. None of us want to talk about Clinton, stop bringing her up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpTeachesHistory If John Connor had sent Kyle Reese back to the 1860s the Civil War could've been prevented. Democrats vetoed the plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many people love that Justin Timberlake commented that it's May?  https://t.co/RYs1eLANSt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How would people feel if the Bills signed Christine Michael? Seems like a good balance to Shady. #BillsMafia #GoBills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McDermott has been talking about competition since day 1, now some are trying to continue the story on Tyrod. #Bills  https://t.co/j5Utl9Em3d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no telling how it will translate into W's and L's, but the @buffalobills have had a pretty impressive off-season and draft. #GoBills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how the Bills continue to fill needs in this draft. Wish a couple guys slid, but ready to watch Tyrod breakout. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Would've been great. I'm sitting in an airport waiting on the next pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I was hoping he'd somehow slide to the Bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a sign that we're becoming more stressed out in America? Now you can have a USA stress reliever. #stressedout #a17con  https://t.co/Y1zmbJCl0H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final couple of hours in Orlando, then back to sunny and beautiful #BuffaloNY. Great show, but looking forward to getting home. #A17con  https://t.co/qs1mudGvWz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Slimothy_Mo I don't think Ray Rice is banned. Isn't he just a free agent still? Just that no one wants to sign him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we agree that having TJ announce the #Ravens pick was actually the best selection of the draft? #NFLDraft  https://t.co/oc0hDT7c5h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an exciting draft to be a #Bills fan for, it seems like every time I turn around they are making a move. I'm hoping they grab a LB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Franco Harris going to announce all of the #Steelers picks this draft? #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this pick. I won't even expect anything crazy, just 1/2 of the catches he had last year. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/CH4GHVdFvJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for the advertising awards by @BNPMedia and @ArchRecord. #A17con  https://t.co/QV2CZn4kRN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso You must love this pick then. I hope they pick up someone to help Tyrod in day two, but so far it's hard not to be happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Bills go Foster the first round was a huge win for them. If they ranked Zay that high, things are also looking good. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ several holes and immediate stars in the #NFLDraft I hope the @buffalobills don't go QB #10. Build around what you've got. #Billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddbobsims Good call. Hopefully kids won't be traveling on Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boarding my flight for #A17con in Orlando. Looks like a lot of children are heading to Disney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will #GareonConley slide with these rape allegations? True or not, I imagine a team that's on the fence will pass. #NFLDraft2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Camp David vacations could certainly help to avoid this conflict. Neither would be appropriate, btw.  https://t.co/c7AsZqQN9f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be amazing if they picked him up in the second round. I just feel like they need an offensive weapon and secondary in first 2.  https://t.co/K9lCLmitbw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Instagram is down! Quick we must get on Twitter to share what we all already know! But seriously, still down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @PremierWinesNY I think the Williamsville location is better for the craft cocktail scene, with their overall liquor/spirits selection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @PremierWinesNY We actually were at the one in Amherst, this time. Was thrilled when I realized we had $90 of savings on the wine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you like wine, and don't have a rewards card at @PremierWinesNY you're really missing out. #wine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As people begin to wonder why #Chaffetz isn't running for reelection, might it have something to do w/ being out-raised 3 to 1?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW!  https://t.co/6Nm7cyLgiJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeofNewYORK @BernieSanders @TheDemocrats Probably not, nor is it anything new. He already has an "I" next to his name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With such a need for weapons and secondary help, reaching on a QB at 10 seems to do nothing to make the team better.  https://t.co/doyR20Ly2J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs It's frustrating, especially a lot of people predicted it might happen when they didn't give a second round tender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming Mike G is gone, do you count on the current roster filling the RB2 position? Thoughts #BillsMafia? Do you draft RB2 or 3?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debate over the #BuffaloBills RB2 continues, have to wonder if  anyone can do the job. 2 yrs running, the back-up has looked great. #bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like the current administration is just inviting criticism.  https://t.co/shGUgM42HN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real question for #BillsMafia fans is who doesn't agree with this? For those who don't, you have to wonder if they know who he is.  https://t.co/zzIgRkvQTM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso It figures someone would go after him. I seem to recall most people advocating for the RD2 tender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing dinner and drinks. You should absolutely go here on your next date night. #buffalove  https://t.co/Yf91h2F13K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we should just agree to not rank who's worse and agree that both are bad. #SeanSpicer  https://t.co/mOPKSdnJOp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson You definitely picked a wonderful place to go. I technically still work there, we're heading back in late May.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson It's a wonderful place. I spent 10 yrs there, then we spent 3 years there with our blog running around the area. Still miss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson @NMAAHC As for a cocktail, @2Birds1StoneDC for new creations, Round Robin Bar for historical. @WhotelDC roof for the best view in DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson @NMAAHC Museums are definitely worth it. National Mall at night. @EstadioDC &amp; @LeDiplomateDC are two of the many great restaurants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson Make sure to do the @NMAAHC. It's pretty amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs exactly my point. This just seems like they're doing PR for United now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeejCarlson You should read our blog,  https://t.co/QYYZ4bWznr, we've still got most of our posts from the area up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tomhaberstroh Didn't Jordan only play for 15 seasons? One of which was a half season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhaberstroh This isn't a good comparison. Jordan left basketball for a year and half. It accounts for those games. It's not like he was on the roster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Gorsuch replaces Scalia and people are reacting as though the entire court has shifted. You want to know what's different? #SCOTUS  https://t.co/34ikZ6Ky8A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just out of curiosity, if a #SCOTUS seat opens up in 2020 is the entire Senate going to decide it should remain vacant until after E-day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How many games does Dak play before people are calling for Tony Romo to come out of retirement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confused. Didn't #Trump say he wouldn't accept the presidential salary? That means he has $1 to donate?  https://t.co/qzSupiSsQA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Senate seems to be using the same playbook and look like hypocrites now. Parents should make kids watch as a lesson on what not to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who believe Democrats shouldn't block #Gorsuch should also believe the #NuclearOption is bad for the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, shame on the entire Senate and Pres for getting to this place w/ #Gorsuch for #SCOTUS. Should remain 60 votes and bi-partisan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I'll probably never cheer for them, I'm glad to see a former player like Ewing heading back to Georgetown. Now go lose to #Cuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all those arguing that Gorsuch should get a vote, we're you saying the same about Garland?  #ConfirmGorsuch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shaheen_____ In terms of the money, he'd be just inside the top 15 salaries. A better defense and healthy receivers might be the different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaheen_____ That's why I pointed to 3 specific games. Each were close, and his arm kept them in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaheen_____ also, several of those games when he did throw for more yards, the defense couldn't do anything. (Seattle, Jets, Miami)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaheen_____ or they had OC's that offer run heavy playbooks. It'd be a great argument if we actually had healthy and consistent receivers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BeechmontPole Right, but I go back to the fact that each of these have political commentators and opinion pieces. It's what people watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeechmontPole I think you're going off onto a completely different topic now. There is no doubt that outlets have a lean one way or another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeechmontPole Yes, there are some that have opinion pieces or political commentary, but so do the others, as you stated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bills_12thMan I think @ChrisTrapasso does a nice job justifying why they should keep TT. A healthy team and weapons would help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bills_12thMan They really just need to hope his receivers stay healthy. A new offensive scheme should help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wonder if Knicks fans would rather get #Dolan banned from games, rather than #CharlesOakley.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I bet! We did a jalapeño rum in a dacquri and a tequila for a margarita. It's just fun to try new things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I'd like to do a turkey fat infused bourbon, then combined it with cranberry syrup in an old fashioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha we've done a couple similar, but more fruits and jalapeños. If this works, butter infusions are next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha hoping it turns out. If this works a couple more will follow. Starting with peanut butter in bourbon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheTravisHare He came out against DeVos already, which I think is the important one. She's the one that has a shot to be voted down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTravisHare I think 9 appointees have ever been voted down. I'd rather they focus on getting 1 or 2, that making a statement with each.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTravisHare It might. Sadly, it might on both sides. I think Warner is one of the better Senators who actually wants to get things done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For 8 yrs I've heard the #DOW is not a true sign of the economies progress. Today, I get to hear how the 20K milestone shows #Trump success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to seeing everyone at the @BuffaloBloggers meet-up tonight. Now let's hope this day moves quickly!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevinsnyder12 I think they're trying to tell us that they'll be using a lot of fake news reports, so we should just be prepared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people on Twitter right now: "I love Fox News it's the only honest media. Wait, #ChrisWallace disagrees with #Trump, he's #fakenews."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I agree. Hope you enjoy it. Some of the wines are good, some just sweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha btw- hope you guys have fun with the ice wine. If not for our schedule we were talking about even going over to some wineries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Alix's mom has some homemade jelly that I might be trying out. Anything new is always fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Honestly, I just realized what those were. I want to try and make some of those at our place. Might be a cool change of pace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha All bourbon or rye. Lions Tail was a little bit too much lime, but the others were good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I love the whole classic cocktail approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I did the Lions Tail and Remember the Maine. Alix did the Paper Plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great look at #Bills OC candidates from @ChrisTrapasso. I like all of the guys who might keep Tyrod.   https://t.co/JgheIQp6dn #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @DCMinute does it involve beer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha it's a battle they lost long ago. The public polls are impossible to read because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Rs have a replacement plan for the #ACARepeal then why not wait until you can repeal/replace w/ one stroke? Timing makes it political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that Pegula and the #Bills have a coach, they might want some PR help. Incredible that this story has kept up.  https://t.co/bheMw38XSv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems like the #Bills could free up a lot of money if they just fire their GM. Not even he knows what he does. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/yp7OCjoQZu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Goodbye Orlando, it's time to get back to WNY and some #snow. Weather Gods that's a message for you, bring on some snow. #buffalony<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You don't have to agree with Obama, but you have to agree he's saying everything you want a leader to say. #Obama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to #IBSOrlando for a great week. In the meantime I'm just trying to kick this cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #Cuse finally remember how to play basketball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right...I wonder if he looked in the mirror when saying this.  https://t.co/RqwECPXORb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bills are either going to keep Tyrod and show fans they believe this is a playoff team, or say '2020 playoffs...we hope'. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be great if the #Bills could release statements like they were 100% behind their players. They are making this Tyrod situation worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyrod finished 9th in total QBR, seems to be another reason the @BuffaloBills should build around him rather than starting over. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the next head coach of the #BuffaloBills is...  https://t.co/uxolRPO8PA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urbanbohemian I don't know how true that is. A lot of liberals are pretty upset, pointing out her positions before the last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha it's crazy how difficult it can be. Sometimes being forced to drive in helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha so true!  I woke up and did an hour of work right away, now all I'm thinking about is the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in the grind...I better make another pot of coffee. #TuesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutting the independent ethics office should concern everyone. For those supporting this, go back to bed. #Politics #ethics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs QBs are signing for so much lately. I feel they should build w/ him, rather than paying someone equally a lot to start over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #DougWhaley is correct and the #Bills are close, Tyrod will be back at QB. He's already got the relationships with the team. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for sharing! Great read and I completely agree! Personally, I'm hoping to see Frank Reich as HC and Tyrod back at QB.  https://t.co/LWTcFvyuhq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be great if #DougWhaley would show confidence and support for players and coaches. Show people you support your team! #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doug Whaley, if you speak for ownership and are heading the coaching search, shouldn't you be privy to the Rex/Pegula convo? #Billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems everyone w/ the #BuffaloBills points to someone else. #dougwhaley didn't have a say in #RexRyan being fired, #Lynn didn't with Tyrod.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bills were a couple plays (kicks, defensive stops) from being in the playoffs. Changing the QB would be a head shaker. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/NgETntptFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you miss the playoffs the off-season is the next best thing. New coaching search and top 10 draft pick. Hoping Tyrod stays. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone believes that it's #RussiaHacking except for #Trump. You get to be President no matter what happens with this, you know that- right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lennthompson we actually visited on Tuesday. We split the tour in hopes of being able to try more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha @BlackBirdCider we haven't been in 2 years. Hoping it works. Was going to be the final stop, but they close an hour earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to get out on the @niagwinetrail today! Annual trip to Freedom Run, @BlackBirdCider, and more! #NYWine #wny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha We're heading to the wine trail soon to get started on that plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha alcohol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Trump is America first, then why does he seem to disregard all things America when it comes to #Russia? This isn't politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it's snowing outside, I like to split my time between starring out the window and reading every snowy weather report. #snow  https://t.co/s446riUxLH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I definitely woke up with a smile on my face. Sounds like the next couple of days it will continue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Saddest tweet possible. #RIPCarrie  https://t.co/sSoqXz48Io<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Pegulas really want to see some optimistic #BillsMafia fans give Philly a call about their OC. #FrankReich could certain bring hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs why was he even playing? That was insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Offense finally comes together and the defense and kicker stink. Hope any off season changes address those first. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops still sweating the Gabriel vs Mathews decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FantasyFootball Gods, pick 2: J. Matthews, Dontrelle Inman, and Rishard Matthews #FantasyPlayoffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bflo_mommy we just landed...I have no clue how.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPembroke so so true. I'm just hoping its north enough that the delays don't continue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDCBrunette Agreed! Just hope they don't quit on the season and hand the ball to a rookie who isn't ready.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing that the #Bills path to the playoffs isn't impossible, when you look at what needs to happen. Give #TyrodTaylor the 3 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4JoshReed Even if it's only 35 times it would be great if they came out early and got the ball downfield. See what he can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4JoshReed I think they should spend the next three days letting Tyrod throw the ball. They are so reluctant to do so. Give him 3 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before Election Day: Election is rigged. After Election Day: Election was rigged. Different group of people, same message. #russianhacking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha That's what it is here too. I think the horses are enjoying a little sunshine, since they're finally out walking around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha Get ready for the spring. You'll have one morning where it's 55, and by lunch it's snowing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alix is all over the place. Really proud of the way she's taken the blog to a new level since moving back to #WesternNY  https://t.co/uydYShaPEU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people getting so defensive over #FakeNews sites? Shouldn't we all dislike people doing this for personal gain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msnomir I think you're right, but it will certainly live on. I wouldn't hold it against him to wear it right away as a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BobbyValentine becomes the ambassador to Japan is he going to wear disguises to meetings he's not supposed to be at? #TRUMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people spent as much time doing good as they do spreading #fakenews and conspiracy theories can you imagine the outcomes? #thinkaboutit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraHayesDC Likely tonight for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wild turkey made for a great 'Christmas Story' old fashioned. Sharing more shortly.  https://t.co/oSpv4jpjXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly Yep, I didn't disagree with you on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha I have a feeling we're going to be best friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha he and I will enjoy talking, we'll have you guys over to the farm sometime and we'll share something better than a box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyRaChaCha No...but I would love it if you have it. Basil Hayden, Larceny, Angels Envy, and a couple others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha We have some serious work to do on our stash. We've got fewer bottles of wine that normal, but a couple more bourbons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunapiranha #theworst Btw, I know for a fact, beer tastes better in snowstorms. Just thought you'd like to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please give Medina the higher end of the snow predictions. I'd love to sip some bourbon in a snow pile.  https://t.co/tYRd5ZBtMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly I actually agree here, and when Carson seemingly removed himself from cabinet positions, I thought he'd be back in this spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly If you have 2 unqualified people for a position, but one person is slightly better, it doesn't make them a good pick. That's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly sure, but just because a previous pick wasn't impressive doesn't make them the baseline for all future picks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finding #BasilHayden #bourbon for under $25 seems like a win to me. I guess 1:15 is too early to have a glass...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly That said, I think many of us, myself included, only know Carson as a candidate who had some troubling quotes (for some).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly I think the race issue is based on the confusion of the pick. Some are left scratching their head looking for the justification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making a Christmas simple syrup for some cocktails tonight. This is either going to be good, or you won't hear anything about it. #cocktails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly Sounds like there is some dispute (isn't there always) over where he lived  https://t.co/CxA9w0DHjZ. Hope you're well, Lee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly It's only my opinion, but it seems there are a lot of people qualified if simply living there is what it takes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly if he had been selected as HHS it would've at least made sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly I would argue a lot has probably changed since that time, also Carson pulled himself out of the running due to qualifications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't Ben Carson also claim he wasn't qualified to serve in the cabinet? How many people would hire someone that said the same?  https://t.co/KikwJwISnU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that everyone who has been outspoken against recent rallies, remembers to condemn the #KKK drive as well  https://t.co/HXsbnAvWsN?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #NationalRepealDay! To celebrate I'm thinking of some #bourbon or maybe something local from @OAKESWINERY. #Decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not going to say race was the reason for #BenCarson selection as #HUDSecretary. I honestly don't think either of them knows what HUD is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For children: PROOF that Santa gets letters delivered to Medina! #Believe @TheBuffaloNews @Batavia_Daily @orleans_hub  https://t.co/44EmDWISFj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #LoveActually - 'Let's get the sh!t kicked out of us by love!' #holidays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turnaboutmedia umm...no. I can say I'll probably miss that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks!  https://t.co/AvDx8WH6hK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody should be surprised. Didn't it take forever for people to actually receive a response from Bob Dylan acknowledging the award?  https://t.co/61sKhivLLN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since it's the younger generation coming out for democratic candidates, shouldn't we pick some leadership to reflect that? #DNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has to be said, I watch #MorningJoe for the music before and after commercials. Yes, I do want to hear 'You can call me Al.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jill Stein may quickly go from being hated by a lot of Democrats to being loved, thanked, and praised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFlynn457 you were in our neck of the woods, it was one of the first places in Medina we wrote about on @DCMinute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mariachi_De_Oro Looks delicious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want a free night at a #WNY hotel? Get to Medina and Hart House Hotel this weekend!  https://t.co/rdfJF7NOzB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Essentially after #BenCarson says he's not qualified to be in the cabinet, #Trump wants him for HUD? This is like picking me as an NFL QB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I rarely agree with @mike_pence his response to questions about the #Hamilton statement was spot on. Freedom allows for differences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden for DNC! It allows for the position to be full time, from someone who can relate to many different voters.  https://t.co/uEpdIR8ngW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A snowy farm this morning in #WNY. #farmlife #medinany  https://t.co/PL9Ojh5jZ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continuing to enjoy the random snow photos.  https://t.co/JC4au8U561<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awkward...  https://t.co/1va0f5uyR0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a week of being under the weather, we're celebrating our health with a night in #BuffaloNY. First stop @BPArtCenter. #travelbuf  https://t.co/BJILVzy2Oe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kanye saying he would've voted for #Trump, is like saying the #Cubs are going to win the '16 World Series weeks after they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reports say #JeffSessions has been offered AG. Well... those will be entertaining hearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyday 2 more names are rumored to be #Trump's #SecretaryOfState. I'm sure we'll hear two more tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that @TimRyan is making a run for Minority Leader. Even if he loses, leaders need to be tested, and parties should have options.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThrowbackThursday to 3 months ago when we were officially #WNY residents again. Here's our recap of 1 month in:  https://t.co/TQXmwDgouK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting our first look-taste at @RusPierogi #ruready! #buffalony  https://t.co/I47As1LgIc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahharding22 That makes absolutely no sense. I understand the desire to him him in the administration and in other positions, but really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone have advice for translating a PDF file (28 page guide) into Spanish? Wondering if there is a tool or business. #EnglishtoSpanish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people wonder why there isn't a higher trust for #police in minority communities. Sins of few reflect on many:  https://t.co/y7tCSbxTIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Students skip class all the time. Why did they all of a sudden become spoiled and entitled now that they #protest for certain people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely going to miss #JoeBiden.  https://t.co/Qsm7LUsmV0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are there people with the #confederateflag telling others they lost? Does someone need a history book on the Civil War...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicely said @darcangel21.  https://t.co/XeIN9RwOq2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't the appointment of Steve Bannon send the wrong message in terms of being a President for all people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of great cocktails at #bufcocktailclassic2016. #buffalove @StepOutBFLO  https://t.co/4R0C3JjbSe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking for #FantasyFootball help, pick 2: Ivory, Jeremy Hill, Jordan Matthews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I don't disagree. I just hope that those supporters who don't support these acts realize they need to stand up against them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs @USATODAY I agree, but I hope people take a stand to step in when they see this occurring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter who the President or President-elect is, we can all help to stop these acts. Don't just turn a blind eye.  https://t.co/M8FaTx9zuG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will always support the right to protest, I just hope these efforts are followed up by getting involved to promote change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We lost a great one in #LeonardCohen. This song always seems to come at the right time.   https://t.co/fo64CT9Ej4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little bit of silver lining from the 2016 election and a local race in #Arizona.  https://t.co/9m6tezWfEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I wear a sports coat even though I work from home. You might think I'm dressing up, but in reality I'm FREEZING right now. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's important that #Trump &amp; supporters show that these sort of acts have no part in his admin.  https://t.co/0mZenvRl57 #Canisius #Buffalove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those surprised about the VA results clearly didn't pay attention in 2014. It's going to be a late night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost time to open a bottle of something, the fun is about to begin. Yes I do want to hear about all the exit polling. #WeirdIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly @buffalobills @Deadspin that was a tough one to stomach. Would've been great to only need a field goal at the end. How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...wonder what's going on tonight. Any good TV? #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...Utah is reporting on the entire 'country'?  https://t.co/2hzt86hJRN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that Eric and Donald #Trump both watched to see who their wives voted for. Probably left wondering who @Evan_McMullin is. #ElectionDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep- that's the real deal. Make your voice heard and participate in the process today. #ElectionDay  https://t.co/MUImKyzhOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlholland1 haha! If things were to go south, I'm nervous about the decision to go with bourbon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm...so is #bourbon or #wine a better drink to watch #electionday results with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frost outside has me remembering we need a trip to the mall to buy warmer clothes. #DCWardrobe #Fashion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm...if #Trump had brought @jlo or Jay Z I think it would've been kidnapping, because I don't think they'd come willingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to grab coffee and came back to someone in my spot.  https://t.co/qFvxQjr6LU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilarious! 'Holy Sh&amp;t You've got to Vote'  https://t.co/qSBEYZTP3r #electionday #Vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our #ThirstyThursday is all about the '12 Tannat from @ParadiseSprings in #Virginia. #VAWine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's great to hear #Melania #Trump talk about combating bullies on social media. She was referring to her husband, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fox News reports that #Clinton is heading for an indictment only has me more likely to vote for her. @timkaine has my support. #isitoveryet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great read from @businessinsider. #Millenials are not the most entitled.  https://t.co/XdgkxgTlLj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure to love the leaves all over the ground. #Fall #WesternNY  https://t.co/oz285vTotb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...why are we all acting like #PercyHarvin is the savior for the #Bills? Aren't we looking for healthy players? #gobills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #PercyHarvin really back with the #Bills? I'm hoping for a healthy stint. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/s8SNLiAFqL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still having nightmares about the walk down...  https://t.co/PyuHuxsMNc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...The #KKK officially endorsed #Trump today? 2016 people...2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This report seems to confirm what other security briefings have been rumored to say.  https://t.co/k4I3ElTtKB #Russia #FBI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #HillaryForPrision is trending does that mean there are really that many legal scholars who have thoroughly studied the emails?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trey Gowdy on @Morning_Joe appropriately stating both the email scandal and Russian influence into an election is concerning. #Election2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 either he or Hunter has to have a big game if they expect to score... Wishful thinking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delta we sprinted through the airport and we're the last ones to board. Just hoping our bag mad it too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought waiting for a bag that I need to recheck would be the reason for missing a flight. 20 mins until takeoff. @Delta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delta we're just hoping the plane to Buffalo doesn't leave without us. Waiting for our back to sprint through customs with. #fingerscrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On our plane waiting to de-board in Detroit, then we have 45 mins before our @Delta flight takes off for Buff. Need to clear customs. #delay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how many Republicans are thinking, "even with this October surprise we might still lose this." #Clinton #fbi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markdedrick fair enough. I'll have one for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day in Mexico calls for cocktails...even if it's raining. #Cancun #vacation  https://t.co/RCJWyof0Mp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great time exploring @XplorPark. @VisitMex #vacation  https://t.co/KzZ2TitmKy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When vacationing in #Cancun and the #Bills are on there's only one thing to do. #BillsMafia  https://t.co/481of71jLL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two years ago I made a really good decision and asked this woman to marry me.  https://t.co/9R8LAOMMbn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone else might be excited for the debut of Shaw Lawson, but I'm more eager to see @justinhunter_11 start. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In less than 24 hours we'll be enjoying ourselves in #Cancun with friends. Can't wait to see @DCFashionFool and @thegaytraveler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 When he talks about violence at his rallies and then blames other people, it's laughable. #ItsAlmostOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...is it just stupid to ask how many people are going to protest #JoshBrown playing in the #NFL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real winner was Chris Wallace. Nicely done. #debatenight @FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was Trump scared of Hillary so he hid behind his podium? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace: why should you be elected? Clinton: because I'm running again this guy. Case closed. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was hoping Trump would say, "I'm so rich, after getting elected I'm going to start paying taxes which will retire our debt". #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Clinton realized she was going to have to defend components of our democracy tonight. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could it be that #Trump actually has Alzheimers and he doesn't remember most of what he's said? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump gives a lot of credit to Clinton. He must believe Secretary of State is like supreme leader of the world. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have never seen someone look so sinister while drinking a glass of water. Rubio is off the hook. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's be honest, no one can translate anything that just came from that answer. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump seems to be responding to every question with "Everything is a disaster and look a puppy." #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over under on how many more times #Trump brings up endorsements? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Trump won't believe the security briefings he's receiving what exactly is he planning to do with a foreign policy? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"No you're the puppet!" Are you kidding me??? Where's Kermit, he should make an appearance? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hand it to Chris Wallace so far, he's playing hardball. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to seeing Chris Wallace in action. Hope the first question is "what will you be dressing up as for Halloween?" #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #Trump talks about defending the constitution &amp; #2A, but spends more time bashing what others say and the media (basic #1A rights).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a Look at this...  https://t.co/DZl2DjsRBb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #FoxNews moderates the #debatenight and polls say #Trump loses, does that mean #Fox is also the rigged liberal media?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If some people are convinced there is large scale #VoterFraud why don't they do something to prevent it rather than just complain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DebateNight really means I'll be drinking #bourbon and cider tonight. Cider because I like it, and bourbon because it's stronger than wine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love watching football, but there is no disputing they had issues with viewership before these protests.  https://t.co/8PaJ4R4wk9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raising a glass (or my coffee) to friends in #Canada.  https://t.co/mYmJ42A6CD #tellamericanitsgreat #TellCanadaThanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of curiosity, is #FoxNews part of the 'biased media' Trump supporters are blaming? They seem pretty one sided this cycle too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillsMafia game day! Hoping everyone roots more for the #Bills and a 4th straight win, rather than against #ColinKaepernick. #GoBills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saturday workouts typically means the #gym is empty. #ExcuseToEatMore #snapfitness  https://t.co/xckg0akeXu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to wonder how those defending these comments would react if their daughters or wives were in these situations?  https://t.co/9LYEwDppqF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops at least the Red Sox didn't drag their series to 5. Quick, easy, and back to football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump says he made sexual advances on women, women confirm, #NewYorkTimes reports on it, and #Trump claims they're lying? HUH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To think, at this time 4 years ago #RasmussenPoll had Romney up by 2. Didn't work out too well there either...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new list of places to visit!  https://t.co/vZJG0zx2NP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneejohnson9 Yep...I'd like a girl to wear the regular outfit w/ a mustache and glasses and a sign that says, "Sexy Ken Bone".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs @HillaryClinton comments like these again make me think Giuliani is losing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneejohnson9 apparently there is already a female 'sexy Ken Bone' costume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a couple years he won't remember campaigning for #DonaldTrump either. Or could he not recognize @HillaryClinton with the mask on?  https://t.co/ztaCWFdxnK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had hoped the #Bills would make a move to bring #KarlosWilliams back. Unfortunately, it looks like the Steelers beat them to it. #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As everyone works to compare indecencies of #Trump and #BillClinton, how many realize that it's Hillary running for president? #MIssTeenUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another Bush goes down amid the wrath of #Trump.  https://t.co/VC5IXMY41F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the #RedSox are out, let's go #Nationals! #DClife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the negatives that have come out of this #elections2016 season, can we all agree that #KenBone is one of the bright spots?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure any minute now @glennbeck will be called a liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who are all of these hilarious people behind Chris Matthews on @MSNBC right now. The faces are great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump seems to have admitted he doesn't know how a bill becomes a law. #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. I think Trump forgot the question. 2. The #sniffle is back. #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was #Trump standing on the glass ceiling when @HillaryClinton broke it, because I feel like the floor has fallen out from under him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLPanthersSB in the general sense that's not true. It's not something new. The pt here is that nothing has changed except he's running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #Trump calls Clinton accusers 'losers' in '98, but now that he's running for president he uses them for political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the #Colts GM is blaming the Luck deal for the inability to build a defense? What's to blame for the previous couple of yrs then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breaking News: #Trump opened his mouth and inappropriate things came out...again. #shocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying some Red Vines as I think about the character Gibson Vaughn and that my book arrives tmrw. @MatthewFitz_1  https://t.co/sajTnZQpoU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Karlos Williams might be coming back to #Buffalo. Hope he's back in shape, would love to see him running hard. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear I only have a #Yahoo account for #FantasyFootball.  https://t.co/aUZYV4W2OS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching @FoxNews (yes, shocking), and I just learned there is a Washington times... Did anyone else know this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmchervinsky Westin Bonaventure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just passed a taco truck in LA, do you think they will follow me to the hotel so I can celebrate #NationalTacoDay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the US Government knows all about the #FantasyFootball trades I've been trying to make for years. The secret is out!  https://t.co/MlunIVk04t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You've got to hand it to #GaryJohnson. It only took him about a week to come up with an excuse for not being able to name a foreign leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to #Greenbuild16 in #LosAngeles. Looking forward to some great meetings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When looking back at the entire #Trump campaign, might one consider #Twitter being a bad thing?  https://t.co/TSynwA5D8f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day of office work, then off to #Greenbuild16 with @EIMA_EIFS to showcase #EIFS as the #greenbuilding choice for #architects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a time that I respected Rudy #Guiliani... how long has it been now?  https://t.co/Sqt1yZBYd5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long until #Bills fans call this team Super Bowl bound? #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one time #tyrodtaylor was sacked. Clearly it didn't happen on any of those two plays. #legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A recap of #AleinAutumn from last weekend.  https://t.co/0L33XQ73XZ #craftbeer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some might consider an insult to hear #Hitler comparison. Apparently this leader does it to himself.  https://t.co/fRkr2LtDsf #CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see both @Barboursville and @HermannJWiemer on this list:  https://t.co/x4vKDJtyx0 #NYWine #VAWine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump can't stop worrying about a former Miss Universe and you think he's ready to handle being President? Right...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you're up in arms over #Clinton saying she likes #Merkel, tell me again how #Trump answered the question?   https://t.co/nNwTr45DN3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this really how Rudy and Newt wanted their political careers to end? (Hmm...I think I'm going to talk about beauty pageants with Trump.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great new cocktail menu coming to this #BuffaloNY restaurant. @BuffaloFood @BuffaloBloggers @BuffaloSpree @BuffaloRising @BuffaloEats  https://t.co/Wm4bygbTKd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During our 24 hour #DC trip, I think we saw @senrobportman at the new @NMAAHC. Truly a museum everyone should visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 Alix was just saying that. She's hopeful for 8 years from now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who cares if #GaryJohnson can't name any world leaders... It's not like he's running for President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, basically #Trump was for it before he was against it? #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we need a doctor on the debate stage. The sniffling just won't stop. #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump seems to be sniffling a lot, does he have a disease? He seemed to talk a lot about coughing, but this just won't stop. #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they included 'lies' under #Trump would anyone make it beyond the first 15 minutes of the #Debates2016 ? I'm guessing we know the answer.  https://t.co/D6PqYqFxnG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoungArchitxPDX This is great! Nicely done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KacyKish These moments always make me nervous, because people hear such drastically different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you more likely to have a drink during the #Debates2016 as a game, or so you can make it the full 90 minutes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uSTADIUM The moment you realize the kicking net has the cat-like reflexes you thought you had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 It's going to be eventful... I think the real question will be how often he says he was treated unfairly following tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems almost unreal that Arnold Palmer has passed away. A great legend in sports. Golf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If someone steps on my foot can I take tomorrow off from work? #billsmafia #Askingforafriend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to try this #bourbon as we work on some #autumn cocktails. #angelenvy  https://t.co/IGDQtI2muR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Bills can't beat a QB-less #Patriots next week we should just move onto the 2017 season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I'm going to take a shot in the dark and assume there's only a small number of them who haven't come around to Trump already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I completely agree with you. Cruz must have felt some pressure from others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ted Cruz endorses #Trump for President!!! ...and we're surprised about this why... Must be a slow news day in politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It shouldn't surprise anyone by now, another newspaper has endorsed #Clinton after decades of endorsing #republicans  https://t.co/MiQtuql2Xh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn't it be great if #Trump takes the GOP off the edge, and it's rebirth is what people are looking for in a 3rd party. #fridaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a delicate balance between security and poor business decisions. Having a barking dog at your front door, might be a bad decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting Alix a drink at @PittypatsPorch to further expand her love of #goneWithTheWind. #Atlanta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday football! On the upside the bills won't lose today. #positivethoughts #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chinaraeriddle bet you're nervous watching this #Louisville game. What a nail biter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would likely be must see TV. Pretty funny offer from #MarkCuban.  https://t.co/VC2U2wTJLZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see some moves already taking place in #Buffalo, but #GregRoman seems a little like a scapegoat. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 definitely could be, but they did say he'd be playing through pain all year. Could be a test of toughness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the talk about Sammy Watkins this past week, I'm waiting for a career performance against the Jets. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpTaxesMovieTitles to create excuses for not releasing taxes? Hillary's email title would clearly be 'Deleted Scenes- You've Got Mail'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Trump Jr. not realize that 'ordinary people' are the ones he'll be representing, right? More excuses.   https://t.co/vklaGWVDwZ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An entire list of how things have been going our first month in #WesternNewYork. Video included.  https://t.co/fyPTSA3UGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? Can't we even have a little bit of fun anymore?  https://t.co/IfA28aQJhk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool breeze coming in the window has be contemplating a #bourbon cocktail or nice #wine. Is it really not even 11am yet? #WineWednesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigaCreteInc Ledo Towers in NYC withstood Hurricane Sandy, I'd use that as a more reasonable test when looking at bldg durability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigaCreteInc A building test to check strength against military style guns seems...concerning on where you're building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigaCreteInc this seems pretty resistant...  https://t.co/JHX7L2SML7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm willing to bet that he goes out and has a career game, Thursday. #GoSammyGo #BillsMafia  https://t.co/S1to3YVoDK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of hate being tossed at #Bills players after one game. Seemed like the play calling was overly conservative, hope that changes Thurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Alix has known about #TyrodTaylor since her 1st teaching job. Here's her post! #BillsMafia  https://t.co/4Q1EF2HNau<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NFLSunday means pregames all day, and then #Bills football at 1pm! #GOBills #BIllsmafia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who said building materials can't be fun? This video is going to be great. #EIFSHero #EIFS  https://t.co/jLW0Gm0xxm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buffalopundit sounds like a lot of loyalty to Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many people rolled their eyes at #GaryJohnson this morning, then immediately Googled #Aleppo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon Thanks! A difficult summer there, the humidity makes it so much worse. I'm eager for fall and ready for a snowy winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone needs a hero! Can't wait for the finished product of this #EIFShero video.  https://t.co/QY54pfVBq8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like people are pretty upset with Matt Lauer over the forum last night. Happy I had a fantasy draft and missed the entire thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon Yep! I'm feeling that way too. We moved back home from the DC area, and today, I'm feeling like we're still down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Western New York what is up with this heat advisory. The first day of school apparently means stay inside or by the pool. #WNYWeather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about all the teachers on their first week back at school. (Here's a link to our blog post)  https://t.co/9nmfa4mHeU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if there is anything more amazing than knowing #NFLSunday is back in less than a week! #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always a #MedinaMustang. Great night for a walk by the old stomping grounds. Crazy to think we call this home again.  https://t.co/kyoyqW3WU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you just need to stop and play with the goat. #farmlife  https://t.co/Rs7cUrX6uT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two guys I love watching when it comes to #NBA. Great mention of Sir Charles and Craig Sager.  https://t.co/szIkMo77K6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ all the talk about #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner we need to ask 2 questions: 1. How good are the tacos and 2. Will they have #guacamole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how many people critical of #Kaepernick have looked the other way when players are punished for assault...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJosephBea I have to wonder what the reaction would be if the player was overwhelmingly beloved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rainy days are a blessing when working from home. The sunshine can arrive around lunch and then again around 5pm. #MessageToWeatherGods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor #Vikings and #TeddyBridgewater. I can't help but think there have been more ACL tears this preseason than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look! We found snow in #ADK.  https://t.co/sFek6ZU3G5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walk around in #lakeplacid and noticed this sign. #adk  https://t.co/6rp78EqT4I<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Off to the #Adirondacks tomorrow then #NYSFair on Monday. Really trying to get every bit of NY in this weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Agreed. He had a huge offer on the table, I'm glad the Chargers pulled it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joey Bosa is insane. I'm sure there are plenty of people who weren't drafted that would take a fraction of the SD offer just to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uirealestate That image is actually from 22314, that's Old Town Alexandria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CKPappas Good post. I'd note it's 'insulation' rather than 'insulating'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spending the morning working at the historic Short Factory Cafe in #MedinaNY. #wny  https://t.co/MueM20Dqzo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@constr_material the images of #EIFS are outdated now, here's a recent blog post with more info from @EIMA_EIFS :  https://t.co/5I7jxxVoWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After moving back to #WNY last wknd, we're off to #Buffalo for our first night out. Looking forward to drinks and dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carterWL Ha! I imagine the window will be closed by then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new office view. #wny #farmlife  https://t.co/pYQSmqp9Aw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We finally made it to #WNY. Obviously we needed #buffalowings to celebrate unpacking. #middleport  https://t.co/0kCi8m7UDI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got a truck! Time to start loading this bad boy up and then off to #WNY tomorrow. #movingday #buffalove  https://t.co/d0A9aHUhaW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs @buffalobills You'll love some of the posts we have planned on that topic. Maybe even a fashion shoot in bills attire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's our list of 8 reasons we're thrilled to be heading back to #WNY  https://t.co/sKGtwx4CaW #buffalove  https://t.co/Evtt5YdQlU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DWTS should really go after politicians this yr as contestants. The dancing around questions is astounding. @Morning_Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(On the Blog) 3 years ago Alix wrote this blog post, and now in 3 days we'll actually be home again.  https://t.co/XrVrQ9cTWd #WNY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least there is good news coming from #BillsCamp, it looks like #ShaqLawson will be back between week 6-8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well...let's cancel the rest of #BillsCamp now that we lost #Ragland maybe for the year. Season is looking...stressful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems we've reached the pt that whenever a current/former politician is trending it's safe to think, 'Oh lord, what did they say now?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of injuries at #Billscamp has me wondering if anyone even stretched in the off season. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBuscaglia with all the injuries we probably need to see a lot of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wishing RGIII the best of luck in Cleveland after being named the starter. #nfl  https://t.co/KT40aUWMhs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more Monday of looking out the window at traffic. In one week, I'll be looking out at the horses as I work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brandon Spikes back with the Bills? At this point I'm just cheering for health. #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last Sunday in DC. Off to Mount Vernon then finding a place for brunch, before spending the afternoon packing. Countdown to #WNY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking in every bit of #DC before moving back to #WNY. One week and counting.  https://t.co/SkLHvPE5dC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to @PizzeriaOrso for lunch in #FallsChurch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you think?  https://t.co/DLCAyeWpsi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #NationalIceCreamSandwichDay! Whenever I hear news like this, in my head I say 'Quick, to the bat mobile'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember working in this district before @RepRichardHanna was elected. Bold move, but doing what believes is best.  https://t.co/pnwRAEKV8X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great #NYWine recommendation from #NittanyEpicurean. This time from @OAKESWINERY on the @niagwinetrail.  https://t.co/Bl3G3rtG56<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly We'll all have to see the evidence. I'm just referring to this message, it's already laying the groundwork for that argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling if he loses, this will be the messaging from the Trump campaign.  https://t.co/wUSm9M1rN8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible to think the #election is less than 100 days away, but even more so that yesterday was the last Sunday w/out #football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 haha, yeah we also made that argument... We were explaining the rebirth of Buffalo to some people here, in DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone asked why we were moving to #WesternNY and I guess I have to admit... the cocktails are cheaper. No other reason, just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm...start packing, or avoid it by going to the gym? Gym it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a new column we're doing on the blog. The post includes several articles from blogs and media. #buffalove #DC  https://t.co/JZVyY61cXw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The moment you realize you waited 2 minutes too long to leave work... #dcweather  https://t.co/rbBfho9HB5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wootBre Too funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh hey, I know those two.  https://t.co/dIcYmYR3vS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great meeting to discuss some future campaign ideas for the #EIFS industry at @EIMA_EIFS. Let's just say superheroes are involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly again, don't assume I meant something else. The second part of my comment, I was surprised how quickly charges were brought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rpwalsh They could've just used the headline, 'Person comments with more words than no comment'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly I agree, and I wasn't saying it does. I was only saying it's unfortunate when you hear certain words and assume an outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! It's unfortunate for the family after learning this was ruled a homicide, but charges were awfully fast.  https://t.co/o0QMdkkGls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep seeing articles: 'Aaron Rogers finally talks about brother, Jordan, on #Bachelorette, and offers no comment on family issues.' Huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RsiSocial Nice comparison. We just did one of these at @EIMA_EIFS as well with an infographic published this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, lightening... I'm thinking someone should call the #Ghostbusters, because I have a feeling I know who's there.  https://t.co/SrXZcJgm5Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buffalopundit a lot of pressure is on him in his speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDobbyn just showing support. I know @JeffreyCMcKay has done more than many would even think of on this topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneejohnson9 I'm sure he looks in the mirror and invites himself to things all the time. You're right though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneejohnson9 Sounds like he's upset he doesn't get invites from anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm should we be talking about the time traveler that has clearly appeared from the 1700s??? @Morning_Joe #DNCinPHL  https://t.co/CwUfxcNMN9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a great couple days in Orlando it'll be nice to sleep in our place tonight. 3 weeks left until the move!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump can't touch this. #ClintonKaine   https://t.co/HdHNGdihx1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @timkaine, one of the nicest politicians I've talked with.  https://t.co/FrJsSRPmkW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best thing about attending meetings in Florida is the wonderful air conditioning. Oh the sunshine is cool too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelChelus looks good. Can't wait to be back in my and to try some more wines you've mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early start to the day. Why do I always book early flights... #Florida here i come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon Agreed. Issues like this can be successful when there is a strong will from all those in the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad to see the #BlackLivesMatter and #Police cookout is getting so much press traction. Great community story.  https://t.co/ZUce5xZd82<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I'm sure after about one year I won't be as enthusiastic about the weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasHearon I love it! I know it's disgusting, but I can't wait for snow and lots of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe we're 3 1/2 weeks away from moving home to #WesternNewYork.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how many people that believe the #moonlanding was a hoax are rolling their eyes at the 47 yr anniversary today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GOPconvention or baseball? Shouldn't be that difficult.  https://t.co/lMDKhycN6J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to the #Nationals game. Or as I call it, 'one of the many ways to avoid watching a political convention on tv'.  #politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly It's an unfortunate situation they've put her in. The staff should've been careful, it's obviously not her fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we all started acting like we're on the same team, could you imagine how strong we would be. #PepTalk  https://t.co/YuHIeJyKGy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's official! The brunch music at @BOERestaurant is great. Several people are singing along.#dclife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a day for #BuffaloBills running backs. #KarlosWilliams is suspended and our rookie gets a DWI. Smart thinking guys. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heading to @LeDiplomateDC to celebrate #BastilleDay tonight. #BringOnTheChampagne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottrcolonna thanks! Couldn't agree more. Snow, Bills and EDs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know that a 2 hour video takes forever to upload on #youtube? I'm learning that this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...this is happening.   https://t.co/EXlyUPgqFj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #NationalFrenchFryDay! Looks like it's also National I'm going to need to work out day too. #NeverEnoughFrenchFries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the DC #statehood referendum is going to ballot. DC Council has voted unanimously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the talk of #PokemonGO, this was too good not to share.  https://t.co/cfSnlXXIM5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to smoke some cocktails. @bonfire_dc  https://t.co/Imwni4W8Vd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the injustices in the world at least we can count on #FreeSlurpeeDay until 7pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urbanbohemian Well...we'll give all the info on Wednesday. Some people might guess before then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're sharing some big news on the blog today.  https://t.co/MaB9phVGrN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs we were so over it as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs btw we finished season 3 last night. Looking forward to season 4 now. Hoping with Brody out of the picture we like her more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the greatest. As a Lakers fan he caused me great misery.   https://t.co/vvBmOoOKz2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs we're almost done with season 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continuing the binge of #Homeland while relaxing in bed. #SundayMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Murder does't help anyone. Glad to see #BlackLivesMatter leaders making this obvious, but important point.   https://t.co/Qep55Jk3Qt #dallas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attending #aiasgr16 for @EIMA_EIFS today. #architects  https://t.co/UIpsEGoHdd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wake up to learn we're officially living in a war zone. So many senseless deaths just this week. We can ALL do better.  #PrayforAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird to see opinions about #Comey change so quickly. Have only ever heard positive comments about him, and now people are turning on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you're listening to the many 'experts' on all world and US issues today, this is worth a watch.  https://t.co/Tx3DVAot1o @b_wellington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try harder and do better. Each of us holds the power to change the world, so instead of imagining we know everything, go out and do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>King Street stop lights are out from TC Williams to Beauregard. What a mess!  I've never seen so many close calls. @redbricktown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After one day of hanging out with Trump, Corker has removed his name from the VP Sweepstakes.  https://t.co/6dtt55KpuI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FranconiaCenter for now. Thanks for asking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentuckySpirits I remember reading about all of the changes they had instituted. Wonder if it's helped with sales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CourtneyLynne_ Ha! Thanks. The random ideas we come up with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you really can read #Playboy for the articles.  https://t.co/DYJ1goV3ry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about our hometown in #WNY during this #TravelTuesday. Here's our last post on a favorite coffee house.  https://t.co/7q9nq9cZ25<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just thought I would let you all know that you can thank me now, because I will not be participating in #NationalBikiniDay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting the work week off with an early trip to the mechanic to pick up my car. Seems it's always something. #carproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING #Durant says he's going to Golden State! That team is going to be insane. #NBAFreeAgency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey are true American heroes... #RedDawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sipping coffee and starting the morning off watching the classic Red Dawn. #America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful #BreakingNews that Elie Wiesel has passed away. Night will always be one of the most amazing books I've ever read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Lakers fan I would've loved that addition of #Deng so much more 5 years ago. These contracts are insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Friday! Help us out and follow @DCMinute for the latest fun and randomness. #FF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lotofsnow @OAKESWINERY we'll actually be up from DC and are hoping to attend too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to mention @OAKESWINERY Cider in this list. Our favorite (adult) beverages of the summer.  https://t.co/jN3hc2QKhL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another day another holiday. It's #SocialMediaDay which basically has all of us doing exactly what we do any other day. Tweet, Post, repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Andrew Luck is celebrating his new contract with a #CrystalPepsi tonight... #TheWorldMayNeverKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HeterosexualPrideDay is a day created out of satire that's brought many of us together to talk about why there shouldn't be one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw an add from @NRSC against @PatrickMurphyFL... I think their targeting is off, I live in Virginia. Expanding the electorate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hanging out at booth 233 for #BOMA2016. Maybe a champagne toast should be added to kick off each day. Thoughts?  https://t.co/2veXI1r1EI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeHernly @POTUS doesn't his quote refer to the "frequency" of occurrences? I might be wrong, that's just what I recall. Sad event though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of when they left #MedinaNY years ago. Glad my hometown village is making strides toward success.  https://t.co/2QAW3R8cW1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCazentre @newyorkupstate always enjoy twin trees when in Cuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The moment I saw #BrianWilliams trending I was sure he lied about something. Nope, just #Trump running his mouth again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only I could get my coffee from our favorite #WesternNY coffee shop today...  https://t.co/7q9nq9cZ25 #buffalove  https://t.co/LtmHlpCy08<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waflanagan Seems Trump-like with the last sentence there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this when we find out #IndependenceDay isn't just a movie, but in fact the aliens are coming?  https://t.co/8cvxae7lHo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who serves your favorite pizza in #AlexandriaVA? Here's a list:  https://t.co/rX3goedken #extraordinaryalx  https://t.co/x5M3Zw27Av<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFF_Mike fair enough. I'm going under the believe that the breakdown will be similar to last year (200 for McCoy, 100 for Karlos)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFF_Mike I thought you were ranking the collective bunch. It seems they have 4 guys that could all contribute. Agree about Williams too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For friends in #Buffalo it looks like the festivals are here again! #Buffalove  https://t.co/LuRq10vQWw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFF_Mike Buffalo at 16? After others are writing about them as the top?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cory_Moniz @ChrisTrapasso Jackson and Reed have battled injuries and Garcon has seen a decline in receptions and yards. Who knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I threw this off a friend down here (lifelong DC sports fan) and he quickly explains the weakness of each. No confidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thrilled that we just found a case of #CherryBlossom @StrongbowUS in our apartment.  https://t.co/vXiNaYAtvI  https://t.co/s3TNQtAXEa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whpatterson Must have been an easy accusation to make for the Speaker.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_DianaMitchell Great article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must follow a lot of #BillsMafia fan accounts, because I've seen news of the #Bills winning the Stanley Cup about 100 times in China.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs My mother is an R and has the basic idea that if Trump is elected she will see him on the ballot again, which she doesn't like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs At least the people I'm referring to are life-long republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I have some friends who can't bring themselves to support Hillary, so they are just avoiding the presidential race. Just crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone should tell #BobDole he can in fact right in George Washington, so he doesn't NEED to vote for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP to the great Gordie Howe. The hockey and sports community lost another great.  https://t.co/IXmax0lggr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sbjalexva are you from the area? We're both from the small village of Medina.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbjalexva We haven't done any of their special events. Alix and I (@DCminute) have written about our trips there, but nothing special.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did @Morning_Joe just play Excitable Boy during a clip of Trump. Wonder how people have read those lyrics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hollyloooyah amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Paul Ryan has made it official that he'll be voting for Trump. Not sure if this is surprising...  https://t.co/Is2nSgtnEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the #Carlton should be the official dance of #DCMinuteHH. Hope to see everyone at @BastilleVa tonight.  https://t.co/9dQhEEgCxq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the crowd goes wild! #MichelinGuideDC   https://t.co/90IXKs00gK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...North Korea actually endorsed Trump for President? Well, I mean if he's good enough for their leader we should all get in line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who cares if the #Bills have a media policy, the amount Rex and Rob Ryan run their mouths the media will be getting plenty of content.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikerobb38 @ForTheWin My whole point is how the guy gets fired, and then condemns his former employer for employing racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikerobb38 @ForTheWin I think those are up for interpretation, but I think you've gone in a different direction from my original post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikerobb38 @ForTheWin BUT you can get upset on how someone decides to voice them, especially if you believe it's damaging your brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anyway the @buffalobills can hire Kevin Costner for the day? I really like what he did with that Browns team in #DraftDay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikerobb38 @ForTheWin Sure. I think with Schilling, specifically, they've probably had issues with him for awhile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikerobb38 @ForTheWin Agreed. However, now he's not an employee and it seems he's just trying to throw dirt, because it got canned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting look at reseeding the remaining NCAA teams in #MarchMadness  https://t.co/YfoGZLPAqG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today seems like Richardson's coming out party. Great game thus far by #Cuse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many #Duke fans were convinced they had lost at halftime, but are saying #NationalChampionship now? #AskingforaFriend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got to hand it to Lindsey Graham. He dislikes #Trump so much he's willing to bite his tongue and hold his nose to help Cruz. #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of people wishing Alix was also coming to pick them up at the airport.   https://t.co/0IN7zQBKVW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy to understand why #Chicago is called the Windy City.  https://t.co/0FRU2LGGfQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is there a very creepy looking figure in the background???   https://t.co/XDLn1hhA9w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SGerock probably not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTMenu not sure how, but they got in. 10 seed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how, but #Cuse is dancing! #MarchMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yskNewOrleans pretty sure you reversed the score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the city of Detroit is able to get out of this hole soon. Difficult to think teachers will relocate there.  https://t.co/hUHVvha6rG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe it's been 19 years since Biggie Smalls was gunned down. Always a great artist.  https://t.co/oRhRwRhHpL #NotoriousBIG #RAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bills finally agree to terms with Incognito. Now let's win in the draft.  https://t.co/Vf56Qv3yA6 #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TogaDowntowner I have, but it's been awhile. Not exactly on the way for us from DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djshesay Seems like a pretty good idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rpwalsh I shouldn't included that hashtag in the tweet. Nice addition and catch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sad to see "She a HOE" trending on #InternationalWomenDay. Can we try a little better today and see if it catches on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wow! These look good.   https://t.co/9cT1SBPhLO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it means ending the EJ Manuel era in Buffalo, I would gladly take RGIII to back up Taylor. #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs you're definitely beating me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aparnakris it's so hard to stop watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time for episode 2 of #HouseOfCards. #bingewatching  https://t.co/wSe52wnpgh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeanneSciolto so jealous. Haven't started yet!!! Hmm...could I pull an all nighter...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying an old fashioned at @MagnoliasOnKing in #AlexandriaVA. Thanks God for happy hour! #extraordinaryalx  https://t.co/HAtF2xjBlk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TogaDowntowner I'm not the one to ask on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could we talk about the fact that someone wanted to have this mounted on their wall after not reporting they had it?  https://t.co/I9y5pGMjjl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TogaDowntowner @810Meadworks The maple tap was great over the holidays.  https://t.co/OFLhH19dVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeanneSciolto Seriously. I mean, I want to get at least halfway through by Monday so people are spoiling the first couple episodes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks a lot #DCSnow!!! If you had only managed to do your job and shut things down I could binge on #HouseofCards today. Instead, work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TogaDowntowner Always love the shirt factory cafe for coffee and @810Meadworks! We always love going home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In one week we'll be driving to #UpstateNY for a weekend in Medina with family! Hoping for spring and not winter. #WNY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jessicajfranco Very good tip.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rebeccagrants @USATODAYsports @MLB I'm hopeful for a Red Sox 1st place finish...just not overly confident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Kozody Great. I've got one in mind right away. Any specific topics or platforms you're looking at?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Legends of the Hidden Temple is coming back!?!?! It really is #SuperTuesday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddbobsims I hope Trump picks him as VP then compliments his energy and knowledge of foreign policy. I mean, it's completely believable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Kozody if you're still interested in learning more on the #socialmedia topic, I'll bring a couple good reads home with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the release of Mario Williams, I hope the #Bills go and make some solid moves. Resign OL and solidify the D.  https://t.co/A6p0IDfwKs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always smart to keep an eye on what your competitors are doing on #socialmedia  https://t.co/jfOMoissJk @SMExaminer #marketing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs @dcfoodsafety @KelloggCompany yes, chips are awful! It's why @Pringles are safe, you know how many are there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety @KelloggCompany it's a reason we struggle to buy cereal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Chris Collins has endorsed Trump... I have some republican family members who wont' be happy with their rep.  https://t.co/ucgdimLXBw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry to admit this, but i will be skipping #CPAC this year due to a conflict. I should also admit, I don't know when CPAC is. #Rubio<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love how many people are tweeting about Bob Dole and his relevance. Are we all making him more relevant by offering commentary?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryK0ng @BarDecoDC I thought you would appreciate that. I'm always intrigued when I see Bacon and Bourbon together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With cufflinks and and stripped socks on...not that those things have anything to do with this. #DCLife   https://t.co/q2vvhWBqvT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I would love #bacon in my #cocktail. @BarDecoDC  https://t.co/UhWfR1Wfe6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where could one get orgeat syrup in the DC area? #cocktails #DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM @lmchervinsky honestly between campaigns and press releases that have my number I let a lot go to voicemail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM @lmchervinsky I tend to think "You again?" is appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@K_AnnM @lmchervinsky really? If I don't know them, I usually give them the "STOP CALLING! Wait, who is this?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding What's even better is that @HouseofCards commented on the Hill's Tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWSHLobbyist here's a Congressman from our neck of the woods in NY calling on Goodell to #ChangetheName.  https://t.co/9NMGU5jriI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuffTreasures Yes, definitely. Loved the images of WNY that you've posted. Always love getting back up there, when possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGlimpses @TeddyBullyDC agreed. I really liked the old fashioned collection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ednever an oversight, yes. Seems people all of a sudden started making something of it, when it's months old though. Insider baseball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dionnadorsey If you can't trust yourself, you probably won't be able to trust anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ednever The story was much of nothing.  https://t.co/NOMbUYc2Xa is his campaign site, it was never  https://t.co/7k2aSPeWxl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting read, since I'm working on new Facebook plans for work. Take a look at Facebook and users by country.   https://t.co/YDlIxqGtgE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety Now that's cold! My parents are in town this weekend and are leaving single digits for 20s, they're excited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety You definitely had the cold worse than us. After 8 years being here, I'm starting to get colder each winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @dcfoodsafety If we could just add a little snow now. It is definitely a bit chilly. I'm trying to be tough without a coat- bad decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM I'll probably have someone apologize for having a nut allergy, but secretly be celebrating that fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM I think I'm going to make lightly sugared cookies with Swedish fish and nuts in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM I should do a test on my office and bring in homemade candy that tastes awful to see how people respond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM But the red and pinks are the best. I mean, I guess I could settle for orange, if I have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Office character represents your #SUNY school. #NewPaltz is spot on. I was nervous about @SUNYOswego.  https://t.co/D7zi9r2y66<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for the shoutout!   https://t.co/bZBnTOp22R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBlouin It really seems that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cam went up to Peyton and congratulated him after losing. Remember what Peyton did after losing to Brees in SBXLIV?  https://t.co/qX0Km1RmyL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindsayStuart09 I just hate that the conversation today has been about Cam not being to the level people wanted, when that D was so great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindsayStuart09 I think 15-1 is an accomplishment no matter who you are. Just like the Broncos losing to Oakland, loses can happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Denver's D was just unstoppable.   https://t.co/FPjIjwuO2b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We loved the @subaru_usa commercial.   https://t.co/uCdBlx68a2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As critics continue to bash Cam and his Super Bowl performance, they are missing the point on how good the Denver D was this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops agreed. Unless something crazy happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Von Miller is trying to show he should be the MVP. #SuperBowl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDCBrunette @MikeyMiller13 ahh...so you support that placement at #7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisjmitchell not happy with your placement at #6? Maybe a list of "douchebags" created the list of names that doesn't include theirs...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@revmagdalen I agree. I think a lot of people are trying to ignore it's happening, but instead it's just allowing it to continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegaytraveler @Masa14DC @r_ratino these look amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if it's possible to modify losing #Powerball tickets from last night...asking for a friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just out of curiosity, how far are we going to let this go?  https://t.co/FsTe6LB9Ku #Oregonstandoff #bundy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Yes, great conversation. Have a wonderful rest of your day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Which again, I say is completely fine. We're all entitled to certain options based on education and experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Yes, but that's another issue. Anything that is potentially insured could result in the payment of a loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella which is fine. I think as long as people are staying educated and up to date, it's OK to disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Obviously, I'm only speaking in terms of the US since some places run the risk of the concerns you raised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella There have been a variety of case studies and tests done this last decade showing advancements w/ EIFS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella I'm very familiar with FM. EIFS is actually in the International codes now (since 2009).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Oh fun, we all come from somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella It's exactly right, there are so many fights out there. We do a lot of work with codes to make sure things are being followed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella I run the public affairs for the EIFS assoc. in the US. I'm always interested in what people are saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Anything can be sold or marketed as one thing when it's not. Unfortunately we have to rely on people to know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Understandable. Again, it's why I make the comment about materials being tested and up to code.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella I've been following it for a couple weeks, this one finally gave some more of the information. Thanks for the dialogue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella It's a reason that the fire tests that a building like this should've gone under are some of the many EIFS has passed in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella I'm not arguing any of that. "Non-approved", "untested", or any term like that should give pause to people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella Everything being published seems to indicate an insulated aluminum panel system. There was a failure in testing, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBossman102 Sounds like it was an aluminum panel system and not EIFS.  https://t.co/5rMAMSe8mW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fdomenella wasn't it an aluminum panel system and not EIFS?  https://t.co/5rMAMSe8mW #EIFS passes the fire tests included here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he does.   https://t.co/ZYQhGMABNl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I agree with that. 10-6 puts us in, especially with the Jets at the end. 9-7 and we need to get lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I'm sure glad we have Tyrod Taylor. I'm just hoping the defense shows up for a playoff run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope to see everyone on Wednesday at @BistrotRoyal for #DCMinuteHH. #Extraordinaryalx   https://t.co/RMqgEabXVt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_AnnM were you eliminated from your fantasy football playoffs too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs Yep, I would have to agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm...not really the time to miss an extra point. Great drive by Tyrod Taylor, which it took more time. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Refreshing #ESPN online for updates on the #Bills game. Nice quick td for Tyrod and Wakins. #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this little #boutiquehotel in #MedinaNY. Hard to believe it's part of the #smalltown  https://t.co/khd9qyGfof #WNY @orleans_hub<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy birthday @BTMenu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyFlawless thanks! Can't wait to see you soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure Alix nailed it with this list. Each of these is definitely true. #lists   https://t.co/ogTGRWbEmj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laetitiabrock At home with cocktails, dinner, and relaxing. Between upcoming parties and happy hours there will be enough going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RT @ashuppy House just cleared a Senate bill to reauthorize EPA assistance for rural water systems, rare bipartisan support for an EPA...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3 weeks and we'll be in #MedinaNY! Can't wait to spend 2 weeks at home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There go the #bills committing penalties on big plays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety unfortunately he's been on a roster for weeks. I hate when you drop someone and then they go crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sellwithpmg you too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sellwithpmg I'm nervous, I've got Karlos Williams and am up by 10. My opponent has Tyrod. I'd rather have a #Bills win though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some #MondayMotivation...the #Bills play tonight! #BillsMafia #InTyrodWeTrust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a weekend in #WNY and #Syracuse, I'm eagerly awaiting the holidays so we can go back for more. #medinaNY #Snow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just about out of here to spend the next 8 hours in the car. Thankfully it's with @DCMinute. Ready for a wknd in #UpstateNY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you ever want to get really down just read articles on anything trending during the day. Violence, racism, and hate always do the trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chic_Heroine It is so good! We went to the premiere and might have to get started before it is released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING NEWS: A professional wrestler (#BillyGunn) is fired for doing #steroids... How is this news? I always thought they all juiced.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding completely agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The refs have got to be blind when it comes to spotting the ball tonight. This is nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Karlos Williams! #billsmafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Guacamole, chicken (#BuffaloSauce), and tots...oh and a beer. Yep, it's #BillsvsJets tonight and that's our dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New #EIFS project selected for #design.   https://t.co/rFzof4U2W9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @PlateLsOrdinary @DCMinute I don't look at it like having to deal with it, more enjoying it. It's all positive, so why not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety @NFLInjuryNws thanks for this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety sadly, no. Our league tends to waste no time on free agents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I picked up Eddie Lacy in a trade 2 was ago, hoping he turns it around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfoodsafety I had a good week and moved up to 4th after losing 4 in a row earlier in the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding I'm not entirely sure in the end. The argument of skill vs chance is difficult for both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding I don't disagree with that, which was my point. This was one step out of their comfort zone, which was small already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding Is anyone really surprised by the ruling? Fantasy Football itself is a fine line, this seemed to be one step over it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddbobsims HA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As they attempt to "fix" the #GOPdebate a whole host of new issues are being created. #shocking   https://t.co/dJYIenKFS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddbobsims job reports probably kill jobs too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAbo32 It's insane. We're looking at possibly 78 degrees in DC today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding I've got Eifert and Dalton starting in my league today, feeling comfortable after the first game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should I be concerned that it's empty? #MercyStreetPBS #alexandriava  https://t.co/1VTkw3j88Y<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vinasana @DCMinute @ronalynveronica YES, definitely! Wonderful seeing you last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs My boss also is on a lot of mailings, so they continue to send him bumper stickers. I've got 4 now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I guess it depends on what you do and how serious it is. After working politics for awhile it's a common conversation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that's a defensive possession! #BillsMafia @Szulander<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddbobsims More classes were just announced. We had a blast when we did it.   https://t.co/M4jeWrexhB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bills are 22nd against the pass and 4th against the run. Imagine if they could get the pass rush fixed.  https://t.co/wxRDMekrHL #BillsMafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeanneSciolto @InovaHealth But it's nice and chilly here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Virginia_Delish would be even more impressive if I won all four of those games instead of just scoring a lot of points.Fantasy can be weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Virginia_Delish I'm going on the 4th week where I've scored the 2nd or 3rd highest in my league and I've played the top 1 or 2 team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Virginia_Delish hmm...probably a stiff cocktail after likely losing my 4th in a row. One of the highest scoring teams in my league too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs that could be. The unsportsmanlike penalties are uncalled for though, they have just seemed boneheaded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs agreed. They had a top 3 defense entering the year and squashed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BringBackSchwartz campaign in #Buffalo. The defense currently can't stop anyone and there's only one difference.   https://t.co/GOG2dI6Aym<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redbricktown @eatmasonsocial I hope they live up to the hype of your dreams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're heading back to @eatmasonsocial tonight in #AlexandriaVA. What's your favorite dish and cocktail?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else find it funny that #DrinkBeerDay comes just before #NationalCoffeeDay? Of course you'll need #coffee from all the #beer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SandyPembroke ha! Nope, just good ole DC baseball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaclyn_oconnell I'm waiting to see if they realize they are doing it, or even if they are the author of the tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it when people favorite their own tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertHarding So true. He does know the Constitution better than the current justices...or so he seems to believe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs I agree. Sounds like Papelbon was yelling at him from the dugout when he flew out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_kucko...and they decided to show Bears vs Seahawks in the DC area. Thankfully there are bars nearby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliza_jacobs It was a very embarrassing moment for them. Sadly, that will be a moment that depicts the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #Papelbon is being paid by the Yankees to frustrate #Harper so when he's a free agent he signs with them. Sad wknd for DC baseball.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom what's done is done though. At least the Victory Center is getting a tenant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom agreed. Transit was best at GSA in FX, with Victory being second. Mark never made sense from that standpoint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom candidly, I always thought Victory Ct would win, construction timing was a factor and it seemed to be in their corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom Some of the things I heard afterwards about the justification by the army made sense, but obviously not for anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom we were pretty confident that the GSA location was the best for tax purposes and transit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom maybe. I was in the room for several of the meetings with the decision-makers. It wasn't the best process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_chapman99 @AlexandriaVAMom I was working for the FX BOS at the time where the GSA Warehouse is located. Army made the call, no one else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 I think this type of conversation is difficult to have in 140 characters on twitter. Enjoy your Monday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 you've never had a friend make an inappropriate comment in private, among friends, that they shouldn't say in public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 It was dumb either way, but if that's their relationship we can't change it. I continue to say it shouldn't have been said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 so it could've been an "average joke" if it were done in private between only those 2. Since the director said it was funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 ...each other, but not in public. We've all had friends make inappropriate comments before in private, not on a public platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 I never called it an "average joke". I've only said it was in poor taste. It's a joke that could be told between 2 friends who know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 The director, who he said it to, thought it was funny. So it would be fine to say in private to one another. Not in public like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 I think the point is that a friend can tell another friend a joke. Again I'd say it was in poor taste and he shouldn't have done it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr1738 He clearly said it toward a single individual, BUT it was done in poor taste either way. Shouldn't have been on stage like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn't that #SeanPenn told a bad joke, it's that there was no context for it. They're good friends and the director said it was funny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hamsterjockey HAHA! This was my big week of byes, so far I'm lucky to have put up the points I did. 0 points out of my TE and 3 from flex.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carterWL Hope you're able to make it. I was glad I got out without issues. Just a lot of rain in #DC this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess it's sad that I just got to #Vegas and I'm only thinking about getting to a TV in a couple hours to watch the #CusevsND game! #CUSE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 We mock it here, but they shut down early and then if something hits no issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 Everyone knew there was going to be a storm. They should've closed things early, if nothing had hit, it would've still been safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 i agree with him. It's the fault of the state for not knowing how to prepare. Va is the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's #Cuse game has me nervous. These trap games, before a big one are always tough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that this article is calling the #ACC a "southern conference", seems like some people want are confused.  http://t.co/lsqLk9X55a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 Oh btw, it was the football coach not Boeheim. He said 2 inches of snow is soft, can anyone really argue with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 HAHA. So, "apparently" he said something about snow and GA? Seems like someone probably asked him a question and he was honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 I'm assuming you never watch basketball in really don't know anything about him. no clue what context is either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 to what part? I know you couldn't be comparing the weather in Syracuse and Georgia. And certainly Basketball wise Cuse wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 they haven't lost all year seems like a guy who can talk. Cuse also gets the second most amount of snow in a year they beat GA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1LibertarianMom @cdawn94 exactly. The public locations are endless that people get married at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdawn94 @1LibertarianMom @FoxNews i was more commenting on individual people. most of the outlets are saying both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best #HIMYM in at least a year. Great episode. @HIMYM_CBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dexhandle @HIMYM_CBS Agreed. They continued to say wait for episode 200. I just hope it keeps up now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird, not often that you root for the person to not say yes to a proposal. #HIMYM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think all of the slow #HIMYM episodes are going to really speed up tonight, and a lot is going to be thrown at viewers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to hear the mother is the reason the odds are 2 out of 3. #NakedMan #HIMYM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HIMYM 200th episode and Mitch is doing the Naked Man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone objecting to the Gay Marriages at the #GRAMMYs realizes half of them were straight couples too, right? #SameLove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1LibertarianMom @cdawn94 @FoxNews So true. More people to need to notice that half the people were straight as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not the appropriate time to start voicing opinions about guns. With a shooting that just took place, maybe give it a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really trying to think about important things today. What kind of #wine to open on a Friday night. Decisions decisions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraLang and now he's the leading Republican in the 2016 field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @kobebryant made the All Star game, being injured most of the year, and Dwight missed it after playing all year. HILARIOUS! #NBAAllStar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbova17 At least he's saying that too. He was telling voters to select the younger guys who deserve it this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celebrating #Restaurantweek in #AlexandriaVA tonight, with dinner at Overwood. Haven't been yet, but heard good things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/abdVlxd6y2 Great public official speech in support of #gaymarriage. He addresses many arguments of opponents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might not be pro-life myself, but have to give credit to those who bundled up and fought back the cold in the #marchforlife today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's cold outside, so I'm pretty sure staying in for the night is perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidRutz Makes sense though. Christie is being talked about as a Presidential candidate, Davis as a governor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resplatt123 you must know her personally. Sounds like you have a lot of personal info on her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #WendyDavis was living alone with her child at 19, even though the divorce wasn't final, is she not a single mother? Does it matter?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like the Seahawks or not, Richard Sherman showed there was little reason to respect him tonight. Great corner but a great jerk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brady missed some open guys. Are we going to see a comeback?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sit down Brady! Big sack Denver!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuntsmanAbby @JonHuntsman @Sen_JoeManchin @MarkMNoLabels @Morning_Joe @7 @NoLabelsOrg definitely looking forward to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominicgabello I think they are chanting "Lets go Owls" but it sounds like "Lets go Orange". The refs are BC fans for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I shouldn't be surprised that was a foul too. ALL BALL! #Cuse #Myhomecourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously BC is going to shoot up 3s, why not try defending them? #cuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Tough to get charges these day" wonder when @syrbasketball will get a call, even that "block" on Fair was led with a BC arm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CJ Fair just looks frustrated with a pass like that. 16 minutes left, don't be stupid. #Cuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cuse BC is lucky with some calls this half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Between poor decisions by Cuse and awful calls by the refs, this game is going to give me a heart attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boys 2 Men on #HIMYM may have made the episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frank Reich moving up to OC for the chargers? Is this the former Bills Reich? Good for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sonomacutrer Thanks for the information!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any recommendations on a car place in Ballston? All I really need done is oil and inspection. Just don't want some random thing to pop up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably bad timing for Christie poll numbers with #bridgegate, RNC is polling '16 candidates now, can't imagine this will be his high.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Christie is really saying a lot about the Mayor from Fort Lee. I can't wait for the email showing they were pursuing his endorsement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntsmanAbby He really better hope it's not, but I would agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Christie just referred to himself as a "candidate" then said "Governor", makes it sound like he's  running for office, not running a gov't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Christie is going to Fort Lee to apologize to the Mayor.. I'm guessing he'll get an F off in return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChrisChristie better really hope no other emails or calls pop up showing other people on his staff knew about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso @mattymelts A little funny. Didn't he go in and review the 'Bama offense before the Oklahoma game? Didn't really help much...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, gun owners expect their gun to sometimes go off randomly? As long as you're following safety steps, it's OK?  http://t.co/k9odaTIFV8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Completely agree. I'm still a little surprised after 2 qbs went down for him this yr and they traded Richardson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After an #Ontario #wine last night from @Stratuswines we're moving back to the @niagwinetrail tonight with something from @OAKESWINERY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even with Maddux getting elected, how does someone not vote for him? What did he fail to do that deserves someone passing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to Maddux, Glavine and the Big Hurt for getting into the #HOF today. Glad a power hitter was elected, in this era.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravineswine Of course. Easily one of my fav NY Wineries. Looking forward to the '10 Pinot Noir this wknd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope everyone is safe in @SUNYOswego just saw photos on #MorningJoe. I really don't miss those winters walking to class at @SUNYOswegoProbz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or does it seem that JPMorgan Chase is always agreeing to settle on something worth over $1.5 billion. Is this OK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, incredible back and forth. Does Christ Davis now save the game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso replay makes it look like the left hand gets the face mask too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that not a horse collar???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy stats seeing what Tre Mason does in big games. A lot of solid games, especially against 'Bama, Missouri, LSU, and tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking another completed pass up the middle for Auburn. When is someone from FSU going to be there? #BCSChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lis_Smith @DanJGross @PTWalzak Well at least they get a long off season now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Nah they always call stuff like that in college. All you really need to do is look and point, and you're screwed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chucktodd @morningmoneyben You can't taunt the other sideline, it's consistent. It was just the one individual toward the Auburn bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BIG MISTAKE! When are these guys going to learn that stupid moves in a football game could cost you quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible how small Manziel looks compared to Tebow. #TitleTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso Can't be more obvious than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winston's 20th bday is today, what a day it would be with a victory. #BCSChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping this #BCSChampionship turns out to be as entertaining as some of the other games so far. That drop doesn't help #Auburn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always difficult to go back to work after 2 weeks off. I'm pretty sure I'll be going to sleep immediately upon returning home today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NalshSays I definitely enjoyed it too. I thought they were going to pull it off when they got the ball back, I laughed at the INT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Treadmill time then jumping into a suit for my cousin's #wedding today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two incredible #collegefootball games last night. Glad I stayed up for those. #BCS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...Clay Aiken is getting ready to run for Congress!?!?! I can't wait to see if he sings his way through the ads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notlarrysabato Sounds like that wasn't the case. He contacted her, which is why she's gone quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we talk more about opening a winery there seems to be only one thing to do... Drink #wine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ordered some books on small businesses and starting a #winery. Continuing to talk about this topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can #Georgia beat #Nebraska without Murray at QB? I can't figure out if Neb is that bad or if GA is solid all around. #NebVSGA #Gatorbowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso especially if they are rookies. Seems like it used to be the QB played backup for a yr to learn, now they are thrown right in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheWalkingDeadMarathon for a little longer, then off to split our time between several family members, before heading back on Sunday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FINALLY!!! We beat Mario 3 today on NES. Oh yes, the classic #Nintendo one, 23 years in the making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackBirdCider great time for sure. Look forward to going back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thinking I need to start playing the lottery to win a couple million so I can do everything we want with opening a #winery &amp; #brewery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can talk about J. Parker all day long, but what about T. Ennis? Fr PG leading the #2 team with a great Ass/TO ratio p/g. @CUSE @espn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops You'll be OK. I promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many playoff scenarios from today's games. Not even sure I can keep them straight. #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain Agreed, can't disrespect someone for making a decision based on family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain THought I heard that last year, with his son or something like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain I definitely thought there was a major draw to the Pats. Also, isn't there some desire to not move around with family..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain That's how I feel. Wonder if he's a 2 year guy after that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain I'm not the biggest #PennState fan obviously, but I definitely root for them. My fingers are crossed he stays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain is it the end of the Bill O'Brien era? #HoustonTexas #PennState<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some great champagnes last night but came home with some #FingerLakes Pinot Noirs and a Riesling instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Champagne tasting in #RochesterNY today. #centurywine #wine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great day of research through the #NiagaraWineTrail in #WNY. 1st time I've ever done a cider tasting like the one at @BlackBirdCider #Wine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets see if anyone can answer this, in a new #wine region in the US (outside CA), how much would it cost to start a #winery?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First phase of #Christmas is done now. Second starting in a couple hours, then maybe a Harlem Shake video tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MERRYCHRISTMAS Everyone! Make sure to drink your ovaltine. #Achristmasstory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played #Utah! Certainly a great #Christmas gift to many of your residents. #LGBT #GayMarriage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing 2 nights of #Octagon #VAWine. Tonight is the '09 and tomorrow is the '06. Bringing VA to NY this holiday season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you believe in Santa?  http://t.co/R9vNkgI6Pj Maybe you should believe a little more this year. #Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heading to the annual #ChristmasEve party with the family soon. Gift exchanges and lots of #wine and #beer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that #JamalCharles is wearing a #Christmas sweater as he arrives for the KC game today. Tis the season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2012 Norton from #ParadiseSprings #winery is out and it's good! Nice way to start the 2 wk stay in #NY. #VAWine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2013TaughtMe #DuckDynasty isn't actually about ducks or the show dynasty. Not impressed now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone shut up about the 1st amendment crap. This is another case where reactions are based on what side it helps. #Robertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love mtgs in #DC when there is very little traffic on the way. Always a good start.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you put a cheap wine in a decanter before serving, is it all of a sudden better? #Cheapwine #Wine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heading to @TuscanaWest for dinner tonight. Always great food, I just always eat too much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FNWinery That's what I thought! He's a big fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlakeWP @dccc A lot of Rs are likely to jump in. R's won the district in the recent Governor's race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frank Wolf not seeking reelection. Certainly makes VA-10 an interesting one to watch now. @johnfoustva  http://t.co/pNNgxAEhwS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mont_Ale16 Ellsbury might turn out good, but he was a huge frustration in Boston. Always getting hurt... I think he's getting too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mont_Ale16 Roberts got $2M for one year, when he hasn't even played 1/3rd of the games over the last 4 seasons. Sorry but I'd be frustrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently to be a #NYYankee these days you just need to miss a lot of games over the last couple years.  http://t.co/9lj660d0Jl #MLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far Niente Chardonnary from the boss man for Xmas. Always enjoy getting #wine during the holidays, lord knows I'll drink enough of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>tough start to the week in Massachusetts. Bombs and guns being reported at universities...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saturday we head to #NY can't come soon enough. #Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FakeJanVesely feel free to tweet for @TimHops and how old he is today, use #TimIsOld with whatever you say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For @TimHops birthday we're creating a hashtag of #TimIsOld feel free to let him know today. He might only be 31, but he looks 75.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Christmas cookie day. So many to make, so little time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcopeland Just awful. All too often this news is coming out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's getting sad that with the amount of school shootings in the news this year, they are becoming less of a surprise. Just sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great time at the @CarriageHouseAM last night for #CocktailWars. Looking forward to going back there again. Great place if you haven't been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck to @johnfoustva in his congressional run for VA-10. Always a steady voice on the FX Board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow what a day in #DC there is the Ryan-Murray budget agreement in addition to the #Redskins going with Cousins over #RGIII, what's next???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe #Christmas is 2 weeks away. Here's a gift idea, how about a #whiskey bouquet?  http://t.co/jI0vraYM7c #25DaysofChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's got to be tough being a Redskins fan: RGIII getting benched for Cousins, coach/owner issues, and well that whole #redskins name thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if I'm more excited that Pope Francis won Person of the Year, or that Snowden lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexandriaVAMom @DCMinute Haha! It's OK, I'm sure there is no need to worry about another snow day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetsyNBC @davidaxelrod @DomenicoNBC @NBCNews Seems that this is why he should win the award. He gives everyone a little bit to love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pope Francis was definitely the right choice for Time's person of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why, but I'm hooked on #ChicagoFire. Wonder how they are going to save this fire house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cameron_Gray Ted Cruz was there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to the mixology competition in #DC tomorrow. #Cocktailwars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at that, it's actually snowing outside. Was starting to wonder if this was going to be like last year when it just rained. #VASnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on snow day! For fun lets all sleep in and not work until Wednesday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always a good moment when your friend sends you a photo from the bar on Friday night and you aren't doing anything embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if Shanahan will start using the Jim Graham line, “I certainly wish I hadn’t said what I said, if I said it” to discuss all rumors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe just goofed the LG and AG elects for VA. Herring and Northram photos were reversed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already more snow than i expected. Another reason i should be a weatherman. #dcsnow #alexandriava  http://t.co/mGoyFGXg5Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible how there is no stress when you miss your #FantasyPlayoffs. Now I can just worry about #Christmas gifts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT'S SNOWING! Weird how in #DC you get excited about seeing it in the air, in Upstate NY you barely notice that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just cuz Cano wanted 200M+, don't take a shot at Pedroia for taking a smaller deal when 110M is still dough, and he stays where he wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that some Yankee fans are saying Pedroia was forced to sign his deal earlier in the yr with the Sox for 110M, as if it's a bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLBattles When did $170M become not enough money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laetitiabrock @DCMinute @jesshagadorn @NalshSays @Hagadorn_ This one is 1/2 dive bar with huge beers and 1/2 Chinese restaurant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I fell for the "I'm pregnant" on facebook today, so there is a raccoon in my bedroom now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mont_Ale16 Nolan turns 30 soon as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NalshSays That's what I figured. I mean 29 was really just too in between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the 30s must be a great time, I was just given 6 black balloons from coworkers, saying it's all downhill from here. Black is in, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I'm able to walk through a grocery store first thing in the morning and not grab donuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHops hoping your #TarHeels can pull this off. #UNCvsMSU you need some more wins before #Cuse beats you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to using the $90 worth of gift cards Al got me for @TotalWine this week. #Wine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More news on the continued growth of #VAWine in the US.  http://t.co/7IFwRb8yQf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FantasyHounds definitely seemed like the right idea and everyone seemed to pick Bolden. Go figure Roddy White would go off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter Do they expect to split time or is one favored to play over the other?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WorldAIDSDay is today. Always remembering those loved ones we've lost to the awful disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone have faith in Michael Crabtree putting up big numbers in his debut? #Fantasyfootball #FantasyFootballProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottRobinson83 my fear is that they won't even start Ridley or give him much of a chance after all the butterfingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who to start in the flex: Ridley, Brandon Bolden, Roddy White, or benny cunningham? #FantasyFootballProblems #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packing the bags so we can hopefully have a smooth drive back to #DC today. No traffic No traffic No traffic...hope that works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 decades down and many more to go. Looks like I'll give this whole 30 thing a try. #thirtysomething #birthdays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spending the final day of my 20s watching as much #collegefootball as possible. @CollegeGameDay is one of the wonderful parts of Fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ small businesses in #MedinaNY, heading down to Main St this afternoon for holiday festivities and #SmallBusinessSaturday #WesternNY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With so many rival games tonight, I'm hoping at least one upset happens today. Will the title game really be #Alabama and #FLState?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freedom Run winery definitely some of the best wine along the Niagara wine trail. Several wonderful wines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QB time, #JoshMcCown #AndrewLuck or #MattFlynn #FantasyFootball McCown has the best matchup, Luck the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy #Thanksgiving everyone. Safe travels and crossing my fingers for no "bad" stomachaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else feel like a highlighter threw up on the Baylor Bears? #CusevsBay I've already got a headache from staring at the court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baylor must not have gotten the msg that #Christmas is coming early this year, starting in Maui. #CusevsBaylor @JayBilas @Cuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 11 hours in the car, with rain, sleet, then snow, I'm glad to be passing out. #holidaytravel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FakeJanVesely good luck to whoever you root for Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FakeJanVesely driving to ny in stormy weather. Just saw an update, i don't get nervous yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at snow in Pennsylvania. Here comes the fun part of the drive. #holidaytravel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notlarrysabato You've got to wonder about the logic there. Agreed with the call but the guy with the ball made no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major fail the #Collegegameday commercial, #Michigan Heisman winner @DesmondHoward saying "Ohio State" continuously. #BigTen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the #49ers need to do is win and I can win my office pool for the wk. After my awful showing in #Fantasyfootball this would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to find a couple bottles on the shelf to take home for #Thanksgiving. #VAwine #Frenchwine #NYWine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With blood coming down from CJ Fair's face, there wasn't a foul? Are these replacement refs? #Collegebasketball @Cuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next great defensive feat for Cuse to accomplish...stop other teams from making 3s! #cusebasketball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it that Syracuse has gotten Minnesota to turn it over 10 times and they are only up by 1? #CUSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain The porter with pumpkin pie sounds pretty much right on. Interesting since all the talk is always about #wine pairings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wait, family guy killed off #Brian??? Awful news to start the holiday season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well looks like you shouldn't turn your back on the #governor while he has golf clubs. #walkingdead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad I benched Julius Thomas now that he's inactive, figures of the 3 i considered I'd pick the one without a score. #Fantasyfootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst part about #FantasyFootball is when you see your bench players putting up pts and your starters doing nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BjostNYM I'm ion the same vote. Picked up Carlson to replace JT. Going to be upset if he plays now and well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the food in my future this wk, it's time to hit the gym. #Thanksgiving #turkeydaypreparation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's good that #OregonDucks players didn't want to play in the #RoseBowl this year, because they are showing they don't deserve to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a disappointing feeling it would be to love the #Bulls, after all the ads of #DRose coming back and he's hurt again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game #Knockout is ridiculous, call it what it is, #assault. Punching a stranger and calling it something else doesn't make it OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently #CBS has some copyright notices on the #Cronkite clip to different sites, it's here if you want to see it.  http://t.co/gRP5HHiClU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Purchased my first #Christmas gift and heard #Christmas music on the radio, it's official, the holiday season is here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confused that #AROD thinks his defense was so good, you mean he actually stayed this time to listen to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CreighDeeds Can't even imagine, prayers to you and your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From the survey we did last wk on top #Thanksgiving foods.  http://t.co/lq9gEew0vM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a couple sub par seasons, maybe #ARod doesn't want us to realize he played that poorly while on PEDs. Embarassing when they dont work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ARod when you continue with these outbursts and try to jump off topic and blame other people, it doesn't help you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OswegoSA good luck with the search. I believe the position may have been created when I was there. Certainly was an active one then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLove1104 @MatthewBerryTMR Though I really hope Vereen doesn't get much playing time, but only because I have Ridley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TransgenderRemembranceDay is today. Before Macklemore nailed it, this song hit hard with powerful lyrics. #equality  http://t.co/YiLZNZyqP4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LisaLove1104 @MatthewBerryTMR Both Lacy's last 4 wks and projections for his next 4 beat Bell. TR is nonexistent. Who will be your #2 RB?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCdebbie Noticed it was #WorldToiletDay which scares me a little on how people are celebrating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thoughts and prayers to the Deeds family. #Virginia #Virginasenate  http://t.co/7zzhWGX2JK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised Ridley is benched right now. He's been great over the last 4 weeks. #Patriots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso I'm glad he missed last night. I need 3 more points for a win this week. Ridley's fumble didn't help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could it be possible for #Cuse to make some of these free throws? How can you hit a 15 ft jumper but not a freebee. #OrangeNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is such a difficult time. #Cuse and #HIMYM are on at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HIMYM Never say "no drama" around Barney, or you've just opened the door to drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need 9 total pts between Amendola and Ridley tonight. Can't believe I'm saying this but Go #Patriots! #FANTASYFOOTBALL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep seeing ads for this thing, #Intuit, that you hook up to your phone and can swipe CCs for payment. Aren't they just copying @Square ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissyRar You might want to change your password on Twitter, you clearly got hacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if we get #Bama and #FSU in the National Champ game, I hope we get a lot of good bowl games instead of just hoping that one is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, I'm ready for the Governor love fest to end. Are they trying to make people think he's not nuts? #Walkingdead He'll take your daughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairMinton @StuartScott I think there are some #49ers fans who still wish he had. The yr was easily forgotten for him, but I agree with u.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartScott @BlairMinton It's a great pt that Alex Smith is underrated. His great start, last year especially, is easily forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice stats for #JackTaylor. Though when he goes on about the team effort, I have to laugh. What did they do to help other than not shoot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Al just said she was going to make a night snack of cinnamon rolls...this really is a good night. #latenightsnacks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a great afternoon at @ParadiseSprings it's back to relax and watch #WalkingDead and the #Mentalist. Great Sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Love_Seat_Coach White got the TD, but if Amendola gets at least 80 yards he'll top the points of White.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Love_Seat_Coach Went with Amendola because of Carolina's secondary over the past couple wks. Late comment on @ESPNNFL did it for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LateRdSleeper TB has given up points the last few weeks, but White makes me nervous. SD is the same, but Wallace hasn't done much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LateRdSleeper That's what I was leaning toward as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FantasyFootballProblems Need to choose 1 to play, Roddy White, Amendola, or Mike Wallace? Welker is my other receiver. #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relaxing morning with coffee then off for some #VAwine at Paradise Springs later on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm feeling like a trendsetter, I liked #sriracha before there were tshirts telling me how cool it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FakeJanVesely haha #Cuse are going to win. Obviously i hate the acc but the real BE is no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope #Cuse stays in the game for more than the first possession today! #CusevsFSU #upsetsaturday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So if the #Dolphins took "immediate action" when they found out Incognito harassed a woman at a club, why is he on the leadership council?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we replace 1:46 with 4:46 so i can get out of here and head to #HappyHour? #DC #Oldtownalexandria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A wknd of #Cuse! #NCAA bball starts tonight and then tomorrow we're off to the #CusevsMD game. #orangenation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must be unAmerican, because I voted for @TerryMcAuliffe even after I was told he would ruin America. Interesting campaign tactic. #VAGov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coach_Shafer @CuseFootball Can't wait for a big win this wknd. Only benefit to #CUSE in the ACC is we get to see more games by #DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bleufishcat @PolitiFact Should've published the entire article instead of just headlines and the opening paragraphs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember you can't judge EW Jackson by anything he's said at church, because he's not running for "Minister of #Virginia..." #eday13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is the day we find out EW Jackson isn't really the candidate for LG right? I mean all the stuff about, oh right he's denied everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you voted yet today? #ElectionDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great timing by the #NRA and their #guncontrol tweet earlier today, as another shooter enters a populated area. #Howmanymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary reports coming from the Paramus Mall. Seems the new norm is major cities or populated areas terrorized by #guns. #guncontrol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a #Lakers fan it's tough to root for the Rockets or the #LAClippers but holy CHRIS PAUL and the Clips. 42 pts overall and he has 9assists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad i didn't have anyone in #fantasyfootball playing tonight, they would've probably gotten hurt too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if we didn't spend time making things political or complicated, if we'd be as smart as kids too. #gaymarriage  http://t.co/o9tkz1ZBHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems when someone is so adamant that they are innocent that they turn out being guilty. #Dolphins hear vm from Incognito w/ racial slur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to a couple on their first date, at the bar. 40s and he likely won't be getting another. Playing mr big shot. #peoplewatching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Aaron Rogers is doing the #Movember thing. Maybe it'll bring him some luck this month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirkHerbstreit you're killing me, had to pick Wake over #Cuse today! Really hoping you're wrong today. #WFvsCuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My father is growing a #mustache for #Movember. Can't wait to see a photo of this. #NoShaveNovember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wacha is a beast. I'm nowhere near a Cards fan, but he pitched great in the post season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what a sports day, #RedSox looking good and Michael Carter-Williams tears up the Heat in his Debut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you know how many rookies have had 9 steals in their debut? 1 and he's Michael Carter Williams. #OrangeNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Collier you said that too early. 20-12-9 Big steal just now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it too late for Michael Carter-Williams to return for another year at @Cuse? Looking forward to seeing Ennis play, but damn MCW. #Orange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love the numbers Michael Carter-Williams is putting up. Great debut for the former Orange! #Orangenation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do McCarver and Buck just rotate saying obvious things then copy what the other one says?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, who thought MCW could shoot? Great start so far. #orangenation #NBARookies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is David Freese the twin of Jay Cutler? #Worldseries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't it seem like celebrities always believe checking themselves into #rehab will solve everything. Doesn't quite work like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gen. Hayden on @Morning_Joe saying what everyone is, that these #spying allegations is common practice among all countries. #scandals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 6 tonight! Hope I can get through the day. #worldseries PLEASE NO GAME 7!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the dupont #metro st supports @HRC. #dc  http://t.co/WJwpZ36cMx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to freak if the #worldseries goes to 7 and a kid dressed as Babe Ruth comes to our door on #Halloween. #RedSox @MLB @espn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mtgs in #DC thank god for wonderful weather! #autumn Now hopefully they have #halloween candy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the RTs @IAM_LAPIZ @OG_SWAAAANK @KrisMart92<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Red Sox love to make things tight. I would love to do a study of the blood pressure of Sox fans during playoffs. #worldseries #RedSox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>driving to Baltimore to testify in a public hearing. it is probably wishful thinking the traffic doesn't slow me down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great event the Dog Park in #AlexandriaVA today. We saw a dog dressed as both Superman and Wonderwoman. #MustLoveDogs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain I wouldn't doubt it if you couldn't name more than 3 other places in Old Town. You love Eamonn's. It's good, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure to follow @DCMinute tell us all the places we should be going that we're not. Tmrw is Barboursville then Old Town #alexandriava<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter as a #RedSox fan you should know how superstitious we all are. Never say something like this during a #worldseries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FF @TiffanyVu11 @CoburnMike @winemap @OTBoutiques @cpcowy #HappyFriday, hopefully 5pm comes quick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...did I miss #Halloween? #Christmas is trending right now and not a holiday I thought was 6 days from now... Please tell me it's Friday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems @ParadiseSprings should be on this list, the closest winery to #DC and has a Gov Cup along with Gold Medals.  http://t.co/e75ykxJCba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much is too much to pay for #pumpkins? We had the choice to shop local and spend $70-80 on 2, or 2/$10 at Giant. #ShopLocal #MoneyTalks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow am I ever excited to say this, Happy #ChampagneDay! Are you pulling out any sparkling wine tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an unfortunate #NYCMayor race, their debates are one guy that just wants the job and another who thinks everyone is picking on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilarious video, could they brilliant? #Massachusetts #Ylvis #whatdoesafoxsay  https://t.co/dGWYJzLIvT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #halloween just around the corner some great stuff going on. We're going to @Barboursville Sat then #AlexandriaVA in the evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heyfrase isn't that sexual harassment? Before just flipping out I'd be talking to a lawyer and getting the pay day from the idiot boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoburnMike it'll definitely be funny if the first pitch we see from the Cardinals tonight has a bigger curve than anything possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a minute there I thought #Lester was about to play #ChristianGrey from what was trending. #WorldSeries #RedSoxNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cards GM definitely taking the high road, saying the Lester glove issue is a non-issue. #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you spend $10 at King St Blues today you get a free hot bowl of SOUP!!! I'll race you there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Buster_ESPN Probably the real stat of the game thus far, unless he only throws about 5 in the next inning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like 2004 #RedSox scoring in the first inning! Get on the Cards quick, they can obviously score. #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umps thankfully got that one right. @RedSox #WorldSeries first inning and we already have a controversial call. Both teams can be upset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day for #Arlington, #Microbreweries are great, looks like a gain for #Alexandriava  http://t.co/Jvibl7du6W #beer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiver wire blues, when you're 4th in line and the 3 people you want get picked before your spot. #FantasyFootballProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialinAlex @SocialInFairfax @SocialArlington Help us out and #Follow @DCMinute Your RTs have always been appreciated too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a changing of the guard in the #SEC or could it be they collectively aren't as strong? Defenses have certainly been down. #NCAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to hear the widespread support for this girl against the #bullying acts of others. #antibullying  http://t.co/7HTicXWbFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to the awful calls the last two possessions by the #CUSEvsGT refs. same hits being called against #Cuse uncalled against GT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well Stephen A smith hates the @espn poll that had @kobebryant #25 in the world. He's right, it's nuts! #LakerNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedSox I know a win is a win, but I'm concerns that another 1 run game will give all of us fans a heart attack. TY for your consideration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Help us have fun in #DC and follow @DCminute! What #restaurants should we try and #bars should we kick back at. Cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carmelo wants to be a free agent, sounds like he wants to be a laker! #nba #lalakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irRIZZistible @_FantasyInsider Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cuse looking strong at preseason #7 can't wait to get the season underway. #Orangenation #ACC here we come!  http://t.co/xCQPLYcqvi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irRIZZistible @_FantasyInsider might be a little early to consider Moreno as grand. They are still pass first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irRIZZistible @_FantasyInsider you know DeSean Jackson is the #1 receiver in the NFL right now, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently @tomhanks wants to be in a #Superhero movie, someone give the guy a role, no matter what he does it always seems good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nick Foles or Andrew Luck this weekend? #FantasyFootballProblems #FantasyFooball #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to a trip to @NageBistro in DC tomorrow afternoon/evening. The bar menu continues to be a hidden secret in #WashingtonDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you didn't think Dwight Howard had an ego problem... How many numbers get retired when the guy is active? @espn  http://t.co/0RE3WsuIym<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is your favorite restaurant #wine list in the #WashingtonDC Metro area? #AlexandriaVA #Fairfax #ArlingtonVA #Washington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the #Shutdown continuing the Speaker had a great opportunity to end things, instead he allowed a single outside group to control him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm all about great #Halloween costumes, always hated the copout of "sexy" costumes. This #buzzfeed has it right!  http://t.co/NNtUskYipP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe I think people ignore the negatives of more parties just as much, as though there is no chance they will just be the tea party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WalkingDead started, #RedSox came back and won, and my #FantasyFootball team is winning! What a weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah @RedSox know how to come back at the hands of Papi. Is anyone actually surprised about that? Didn't think so. #mlbplayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when did that become interference. Looks like NC state is getting some help today. #orangenation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO way would I pick against AP this week. With a heavy heart he'll match the Favre performance after he lost his father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 I didn't say it would be a letdown, I'm speaking in the general protesting sense. Number predictions are always tough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 causes aside, we'll see how many show up. Often numbers are inflated before. Will be very interesting to see the pics &amp; tally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 "Large" always seems to be the interesting word when it comes to DC protests. All relative in this town.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the follow @followAlberto Have a great Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow adults spend around $1.2B on #Halloween Costumes. Weird seeing as how costumes seem to get smaller every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 hey now, I didn't say anything against making a statement. Relax a little. DC is a great place, protests happen every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 ...#WashingtonDC to show us people still loved the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarry231 I would hope the point of just about everything right now is to end the #shutdown. Not so sure we needed #truckers in...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...also isn't the point to end the #shutdown? So isn't #T2SDA picking the wrong acronym? #Truckers 2 #SHUTdown #America...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What am i missing with #T2SDA? Don't the #truckers realize #WashingtonDC has more than just #politicians and people need to get to work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoughts and Prayers to AP and his family. The guy who did this should probably run, he may have forgotten who AP is... 1/2 OX 1/2 Flash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caferenaissanc we definitely will. Sounds wonderul. #wine #FF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I'm in favor of a smaller group, so it's actually a conversation, do any of these people support a clean CR?.  http://t.co/qfbeh01J7z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the RTs @KingStBluegrass @WashStarOnline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingStBluegrass Thanks for the follow! When we start posting on the blog we'll make sure to get out and see you play again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see this clarification  http://t.co/lGXImzYCFR "T.M" was what caused it all, figures...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannybarefoot Thanks for sharing. Glad to see this correction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Follow Alix's and my new bit of fun @DCMinute as we venture through the #wine #food and all things #WashingtonDC fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frustrating to see both Virginia Gov candidates having scandals surrounding them. Are the days of high ethics over?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kid went above and beyond to stand up against #bullying He's cool in my book. #bullyingproject #openyoureyes  http://t.co/jjHUTKIqiU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #ProBowlUniforms look like Oregon Ducks vs Miami Hurricanes. I'm sure this fashion change will help make the game relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though San Diego has character, you can't be a night out in #WashingtonDC. Can't wait to be back on the East Coast later this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up 2-1 Dodgers are bringing Kershaw back after 3 days rest? I get you'll have Greinke in game 5, but SERIOUSLY?!?! Here's Atlanta's chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Freeman to the Vikings, TJ Yates replaces Schaub to finish game, a guy named Tuel in Buffalo? Weird day in #football<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final stop on #datenight, the W hotel in #WashDC for a drink.  http://t.co/fQD8bqnmQl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hunterw Wow, it took 7 minutes? Seems as tech savvy as they are it could've been faster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso agreed with disruptions, don't want to fall into the trap that the #Jets have been so good at getting into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisTrapasso is it time to bring in Josh Freeman?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would bet the former Gov Huntsman could provide some tips to getting Utah back on top. VA on top!  http://t.co/QHN2dbhYR9 … @HuntsmanAbby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OTBoutiques Bayou Room for drinks then Warehouse for dinner. Probably stop at the Dog Park before, so the pups are happy when we get home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DateNight tonight with my beautiful lady. Drinks and dinner in Old Town #Alexandria. Always a wonderful place after a long week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to the @Kaneshow I know now that #October3rd is significant. Thankfully I don't need to watch the movie Mean Girls now to learn that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boehner should give a very passionate speech about ending partisan divide, then put this bill on the floor #shutdown  http://t.co/sfgyWhwzhc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible to see all the personal not professional attacks people are making about members of Congress as though they know them. #shutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #Obamacare funded, doesn't that mean Harry Reid can help more than just one child with cancer? Just pass a clean bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy #vawinemonth! First bottle for me is the '10 #nebbiolo from #Barboursville.  http://t.co/woswElCH0o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't need #Obamacare, I'll take care of you #shutdownpickuplines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally had the @Barboursville Brut Rose last night to kick off #VAWineMonth today. If you haven't you must try it. #VaWine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>House gives Senate a bill they were told was DOA for the #shutdown, now they act shocked that the Senate voted against it. Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packed tent for @Barboursville #vawine  http://t.co/MCznJxAKQp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop at @Barboursville before the wknd festival at smith mountain lake. #vawine  http://t.co/nzln35pd8U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This lady shouldn't be allowed at the ballpark. She took a ball from a little kid, major no no. @ESPN not top plays  http://t.co/XSRKlAwrCj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Mike Lee I am your father" -Ted Cruz, in a Darth Vader voice, during his 21 hour speech. I think he was getting tired...really tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible interview by @WillieGeist with MJFox. Moving to hear him mention his father and how Fox acted as an inspiration. @Morning_Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to Smith Mountain Lake #vawine Festival with @Barboursville this weekend. If you're going make sure to come by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of worrying about working out a deal, it seems Ted Cruz is still stuck on fighting a bill that was passed before he got elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opened the 2010 Meritage from Freedom Run Winery last night. Some hidden gems in the @niagwinetrail in NY, if you haven't been, GO! #NYwine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people start using terms like "tebowesque" performance to describe you, you know you're getting benched. Sorry Josh Freeman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Burger King releases low cal fries? If I go order them and either get 1 total fry or an empty fry pack, I'm going to be disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the RT @KingStBluegrass Had some great #VAWine this weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little #vawine for the #Emmys. @Barboursville has a great brut.  http://t.co/3VCBXtJA2z<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vawinetime @GreatMeadowFnd Glad you were able to stop by Barboursville for a tasting. Hope you enjoyed the festival! #VAwine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cboyd_1 Nice. Breaux makes some great wine. Their Cab Franc is incredible. #VAWine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barboursville Maybe they were implying the '09 Octagon deserved both the '12 and '13 Gov Cups, and were too excited to clarify. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Friday! @VAWineFest this weekend, make sure to visit the @Barboursville tents. Gov Cup 09 Octagon will be in attendance. #Vawine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really hope the power outage isn't the start of the zombie invasion, I'm too tired for that to start tonight. #zombieapocalypse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost power in #Ballston, would've loved to have been able to finish cooking dinner. @DomVAPower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to be interesting to see what the pending #MLB suspensions look like. Will Ryan Braun or ARod win an appeal?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know we are supposed to hate the Commissioner, but nice work David Stern. You definitely played along and had some fun.#NBADraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WojYahooNBA You mean, Jrue for a first round in 2014 and Noel. Might be a couple years to see who won this trade. #NBADRAFT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND HE'S BACK, "Your enthusiasm seems to be dwindling" -Stern says to the quieting boos. #NBADraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Stern just keeps getting better. When he walks out to the "boos" he waves and smiles. #NBADraft He's more entertaining than the draft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We had to explain to our international guests that booing in the US is a sign of respect" -David Stern #NBADraft @NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Stern is hilarious tonight! He's playing with the moment embodying the "booing" fans. #NBADraft<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alfie510 yeah I would bet they are paying attention too, however they are exhausted from the lack of sleep now that they are awake. #PROP8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealCeeCeeRose Roberts has already determined that tomorrow is the last day of the session, instead of using Thursday as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCeeCeeRose haha! Yes, very much so. Might be taking off tomorrow morning to go into DC for the decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SCOTUS will FINALLY rule on #marriageequality tomorrow, then will instruct major networks how to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCeeCeeRose #prop8 and #DOMA will be the last two cases, on the final day of their session. Hopefully they make it a good day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DickieV @KingJames I don't know about that. Turnovers in clutch moments don't scream King. Should thank Ray Allen and a no call on a foul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to a lucky no call on a foul, Lebron didn't turn the game over, with his turnovers. He seems to complain whenever he loses the ball.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Protect those criminals and make sure we don't approve the bipartisan Manchin-Toomey amendment...wait that doesn't make sense.  #commonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the @NRA supported background checks, does that mean they supported limiting the 2nd amend? Since they are saying it's a violations now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marriageequality approved in NZ. Where are the days that Congress can get excited about passing something together?  http://t.co/b2diYOoEmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe Appears some members of Cong. have lost their way in remembering who they represent, 87% support this.  http://t.co/bxRQId7lIQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy town, i mean Westboro Bapt church, plan to picket the funerals of those lost in the #bostonmarathon bombings. They blame gay rights...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've got to think @kobebryant is going to help the #Lakers win. He's got to be better than any other guard if we got him a wheel chair.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ManofSteel comes out in 2 months, is it too early to go wait in line at the theater? #Superman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #FriendsReunion that has @NBC confirming, might be another hoax. Seriously, they are having fun with this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow #FriendsReunion happening, @nbc confirms   http://t.co/STGyRxH8QK Can't wait for the return of a great #Thanksgiving episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great seeing so many signs around the #RedSox from both #Boston and the #ClevelandIndians in support of the horrible acts. #faithinhumanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the new low hit for #Congress if they get get anything done on #Guncontrol? I mean even opposition to background checks. Seriously!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLove1104 Thanks for the RT. You were right, classy move. Might actually watch some of a #Yankees game now. If the Sox aren't playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rorivera27 Sorry to say it's not the first thing he's said. Using the #BostonMarathon as a platform to vote against #ImmigrationReform.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theironscurtain I wonder what the best way to utilize the words "have got" would be? Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several in the media really need to keep their mouths shut today. Stop assuming who is to blame if you really don't know. #BostonMarathon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanByers @politico Doesn't it only add to the politicizing when it's reported like this? Fewer people that read it, the less traction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such sad news coming out of the #BostonMarathon. Thoughts and prayers to everyone there or has family friends there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Barboursville @VApourhouse How many wines have been poured for both the Queen and dinner with POTUS? Octagon is great with a story to tell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how many people actually think if the Senate passes any form of a #guncontrol bill they will lose their guns. Seriously?!?<|endoftext|>
