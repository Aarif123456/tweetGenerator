<|startoftext|>@brettjenkins @eamonxofarrell @jussie1972 @MrHennigan @lukasgage How hard is it to understand? The British refer to it as the British Isles (coz they like to claim things that aren't their's) however this is a term not recognized by the Irish Republic government. Therefore for all official documents the area is referred to as 'these isles'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FAIreland @SecondCaptains It'll be all be grand lads. Or maybe we should start asking some proper questions here. Hoofing the ball or slow pointless/zero intensity possession shouldn't be our only options.

<|startoftext|>@JohnOShea1993 We weren't playing decent sides. Bulgaria are shockingly poor. Wales and Finland are not great at all either. Slovakia were there for the taking.

<|startoftext|>@irishstuey @IainDale I'm usually against such anarchy and destruction but I think given what's going on, it is helping to highlight what an elitist and racist bastard Churchill was. It's the first time I've seen Churchill being described that way outside of certain circles. I say carry on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an Irish person, it makes me happy to see Churchill being described a racist, xenophobic, horrible elitist. His history with the Irish, Indians and Muslims is abhorrent.  Most English, Canadians and Americans are just never told this.  #ChurchillWasRacist #Churchill<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl fair enough. So I guess you have a problem with Clint Eastwood &amp; Kelsey Grammer publicly backing Republicans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl referring to 'big Republicans' not conservatives. There is a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl My previous tweet states his actual words, he 'probably wouldn't like them if he met them or would have different opinions'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl if u read any of the articles u will see that he never says he hates anyone. It was @DuCrusoe who misquoted him &amp; added the hate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl Also when I quoted Affleck, I used is actual published words. Never used the word basically or paraphrase him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl if they did &amp; plumbers just plumbed, writers just wrote fiction &amp; I just made cartoons about happy elves, we'd be all the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl Oh did I say the word hate? To which tweet were you responding? I do not wish to be misquoted or anyone to be misinformed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl I don't see him use the word hate. He says he probably wouldn't like them if he met them or would have different opinions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl @DuCrusoe yes, but how is he being irresponsible. Did he say anything abusive? Did he promote illegal or dangerous activity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl @DuCrusoe He's entitled to his opinion. Can't really see how that's him abusing anything really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuCrusoe Perhaps for some added dramatic effect, right? :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuCrusoe Also I think you may have slightly misquoted Affleck and exaggerated his statement. Then added a few of your own words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okpatgirl @DuCrusoe Not sure why u put free in quotes but ok. So please enlighten me. How exactly is he abusing his fame &amp; access to mics?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petesonearth 2nd video down. That way is quite assways. But CAT is an assways program. There may be an easier way but not much help about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth Im sure theres an easier way, u can apply the XML animation 2 a biped then CAT can capture it using this  http://t.co/RQN5RHJc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth What's the file type the animation is coming from? Is it another CAT file or motion capture?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth No worries man! I've had problems going from CAT in Max to 2011 to 2012 and it usually looks something like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth ...oh wait nevermind...I was gonna say that it could be something stupid like the pelvis being stuck in an abs layer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth Yeah that's deffo a usual problem ya get in CAT alright. chances are it could be using an older version of Max or CAT. Or...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petesonearth I've used CAT a bit yeah! What ya want to know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallySaysRelaxWell best thing is to not install anything and get someone to help :D<|endoftext|>
