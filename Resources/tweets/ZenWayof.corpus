<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 the "experts" were wrong. AGAIN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKaylaRoseJ yup and gmail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @Shamrock_Gael @jjenas8 Or maybe we just expect the rules to be applied consistantly. They can spend minutes looking for the tiniest of offsides or tiniest of contacts but can't spend 1 min looking at that foul on Salah which was crucial to the goal being scored. Makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzaHierl @KyleKashuv @BlueWave_Lady You don't get it. Antifa basically calls everyone that they disagree with politically fascists which gives them the moral standing to attack anyone they disagree with politically. Most of them couldn't even define fascism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter @ReliableSources "Biden denier" you guys make everything so obvious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Faradayspeaks @carissaavallone @lay_man_ Yet you were happy to throw the term Nazi around. You do realise there aren't many bigger insults you could label someone. Or has the word lost all meaning??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faradayspeaks @carissaavallone You sound ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LAR65 @SteveSchmidtSES @AOC @ProjectLincoln "regular order" is a corrupt system that serves nobody except big money interests. I disagree pretty much 100% with AOC's politics but i'm pretty sure she'd be as against "regular order" as I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BackseatsmanLFC @GrizzKhan I think it must be a kick he was getting lumps kicked out of him the whole game (which makes it stranger why he played for so long). But hopefully once the swelling has gone down it won't be too serious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JodieHMoss @RosaRey33120220 @CullipherGaye @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump reverse the parties and you'd be rightly outraged. Don't be a hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Journalists and big tech basically created the reality that it never happened. Bigger election interference than anything Russia was accused of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec He always gets angry when challenged. What's amazing is Biden repeatidly stated the only reason he decided to run was Charlottesville and the "very fine people" lie. Nobody in the media ever challenged him on his version of what happened there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop They were kicking lumps out of him the whole game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silkysaucesings @DonSwanzey @yousayblah @AdamInHTownTX @mdornic @KateBolduan @linguafrancanyc yeah i see it all the time here, people that will talk about the biases of Fox News while at the same time watching CNN or MSNBC thinking it is fair and balanced coverage. Trump is far from perfect but the one thing he was spot on about is the dangers of the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonSwanzey @silkysaucesings @yousayblah @AdamInHTownTX @mdornic @KateBolduan @linguafrancanyc This is the problem here. Stories were written about Hunter Biden, very credible stories that were sourced with witnesses that went on the record. But Facebook, Twitter, CNN, MSNBC etc.. decided they were going to censor the story. Did that happen with Ivanka Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonSwanzey @silkysaucesings @yousayblah @AdamInHTownTX @mdornic @KateBolduan @linguafrancanyc Were there stories written about Ivanka Trump that Twitter, Facebook and most mainstream news outlets decided to censor? Because that is what happened with the Hunter Biden story and I've never seen it happen to any story before or since...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@massh0Ie @greg_price11 @willchamberlain Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray they knew exactly what they were doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @HallieJackson this is more election interference than was ever proven against any Russian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonSwanzey @AdamInHTownTX @mdornic @KateBolduan @linguafrancanyc they made a decision not to report it because they knew it hurt Biden. Trying to pretend it was Russian propaganda when they knew it was not. That one act is more election interference than was ever proved against Russia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McTeagle74 @Katelyn_Caralle Sure if there's evidence let's see it. No law just flies in the face of the claim they'd severed ties. Failing to keep your FB friends up to date is one thing, responding to posts they make is different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timlongsports What is Ole's footballing philosophy summed up in one paragraph??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McTeagle74 @Katelyn_Caralle why is it whenever there's a story involving a democrat the goto response is always "BUT TRUMP!!"   It's not as if the media isn't covering these stories about Trump or his family. Why the need to deflect immediately. Democrats can do shady stuff too you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodeMonkeyZ the Chinese influence in western politics is the story of the century. I dread to think what we're going to discover in the next decade. It's starting to drip out but I think we'll find an almost complete control of politicians and media in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShariYoungbloo1 @kirishimasK @eminently_me5 @tessbigfoot23 @ArthurSchwartz @DamianRanger1 At the best reading he is someone that is a serial offender of inappropriately touching young children to the point they are visibly upset about it. He's a creep and he should have been told a long time ago it's not acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShariYoungbloo1 @kirishimasK @eminently_me5 @tessbigfoot23 @ArthurSchwartz @DamianRanger1 I'm not claiming Joe Biden is a paedophile but I am claiming he has been highly inappropriate with young children many times caught on video, where he's very clearly making the child highly uncomfortable....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheoSquiresEcho @LivEchoLFC Still can put out a decent team without Gini having to play. Keita needs minutes and you have the 2 youngsters or even Minamino that can play in a midfield 3. We've earnt the right to do it and with the injuries we've had nobody could argue with Klopp for being cautious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchoLFC @TheoSquiresEcho why would Gini who has played more than anyone this season be risked in this meaningless game? makes zero sense and anyone that has him in their team for this one is clueless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCLaurie it's crazy anyone would have Gini anywhere near this game, the same with Robertson, Matip, Fabinho, Henderson and the usual front 4. These same individuals would blow a gasket if Gini picks up a muscle injury in this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader I'm not ignoring anything. Like i said doesn't mean he wasn't a useful idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yazz_Official It takes time to develop a philosophy and Ole is an inexperienced manager but this isn't his first job and you'd think he has some core principles that he likes his teams to apply. But i don't really see anything that suggests these players are being coached well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader you don't know that. Where have I ignored Trump? im talking about Swalwell and the axios story you can play whataboutism if you like but i was commenting on the Swalwell story. Of course whenever something difficult comes up for democrat the go to response is "But Trump!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yazz_Official he has a group of talented players that get results based on their indlividual ability rather than patterns of play that are being drilled into them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yazz_Official he has no identity as a coach. What are his footballing philosophies? how does he want his teams to play? You can tell when teams are coached well even if their results aren't great and Utd don't look like a well coached team....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader it's also much bigger than Swalwell, if you read the article it looks like the Chinese have been trying to influence the democratic party in California for years and who knows what influence they were able to buy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader you don't get it, you don't have to be knowingly cooperative to be compromised. If he was having a sexual relationship with this spy it's not too difficult to see how he could have been compromised. She also donated to his campaign where did that money come from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader possibly yes, did you dismiss the Trump stuff as easily as you seem to be dismissing it because its a democrat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfwarrior1 @GOPLeader Have you ever heard of the term "useful idiot?" it doesn't matter if he was knowingly complicit, he took money from a Chinese spy and who knows what else they got up to that might have compromised him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamBenney0 @GrizzKhan yeah feels that way with him and Keita that's 2 midfielders we haven't been able to rely on to stay fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan do you think he has a future here? it kind of feels like the team has evolved past him in terms of the midfield 3, and he's never really impressed in the front 3. I get what he offers when he's fit and on form but that hasn't happened very often since he signed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC_Wahome 5 subs means they might get a little game time for fitness reasons but i don't see us risking anyone we're going to need in the next few weeks. nor should we really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_KCee @TheKop_com @LFC_Wahome don't have to register anyone under 21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKop_com absolutely no need to risk anyone in the 1st team squad. I know you don't want to get a big defeat but this game means nothing in terms of the group and it's much more important to give our first team players a decent rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan The odds for a Midtjyland win are looking mighty interesting given the team we'll probably put out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro they'll both mega money and there's no way Floyd will agree to this fight unless its a glorified sparring session which he will win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyjc09 @LFCLaurie @AnfieldEdition Adrian had his moments with the ball at his feet during those games. Yes he made some good saves but he also made mistakes. I agree you have to be play it down but the way he's come into the team and been almost faultless is very impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyjc09 @LFCLaurie @AnfieldEdition playing in the 1st team is different. The way we dominate most games you only have one or two big moments in terms of saves and most of the work will be with the ball, and in that regard he's very good and ahead of Adrian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_tomkins when Thiago is available it should give him more license to get forward and he's shown throughout his career he can get goals. I hope we can get him to sign a new contract, such a key player that will be difficult to replace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mahirsahmed @IakoVas @LFCTransferRoom @le_Parisien I think it's pretty certain one (or two) of the front 3 will be sold. They are reaching that age where you starting to see their value decrease and so the optimal time to sell will be next summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DelwynSJ @LFCTransferRoom @le_Parisien I'm not sure FSG are business people and they'll calculate the business aspect of the fee and wages. In terms of footballing ability of course we'd want him and the age profile fits in terms of spending big money. Is mbappe a Nike athlete??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabrielSterling @GaSecofState When two of the individuals in the video have been identified and their social media is extremely partisan excuse me for not trusting them to undertake a fair process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ah_i_c @ScottAdamsSays 2 of the individuals have been identified and surprise surprise they are highly partisan. They need to be questioned under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgetPhetasy @AsheSchow don't kid yourself, they'll be using Trump as their excuse for everything they do for at least the next 2 years and we know most of the media will do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmeraldRobinson the individuals in the video need to be questioned under oath. We already know two of them are highly partisan, how can you trust they undertook a fair process??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Q_RedPillWorld @Cernovich the people in the video need to be questioned under threat of perjury. We know their biases and they were left in a room for hours to count votes, you can't trust they were being fair. Looking at her social media it also looks like she was involved with validating signatures too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @Q_RedPillWorld The lady in the purple is Ruby Freeman. She needs to answer some questions. Her social media makes it very clear where her political alegences lie. Why would you trust such partisans to undertake a fair process??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karolin70611166 @greg_price11 Funny because during the debates she called him racist and when asked said she believed his accuser. I guess that wasn't a big enough disagreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChadwickD @Cernovich you'd have to work hard to find someone that is truly independent in the US at the moment. Just because someone might be called an "independent" poll watcher does not mean they don't have biases or lean to one party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool just what we need right now. If we can get through the next few weeks, get Thiago, Keita, Shaq etc.. back we'll be in a much better situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MS73568 @TRHLofficial Yeah what makes it more suspect is you have vastly different results in neighbouring areas with very similar demographics. That should not be the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MS73568 @TRHLofficial if you look at where those extra votes are coming from its almost exclusively key swing states and specific parts of those states. In most places he's underperforming and then he's massively over performing in certain places that conveniently he needed to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BazaJ77 @GrizzKhan I think it gets disallowed in the PL. Not sure if they use a margin for error it would have been interesting to see the lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardinthebay @SimonBrundish No im just saying for some teams it would be convenient to have a break at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Edhiggs_ @SimonBrundish Yup. It would actually be a positive for Liverpool if they had to cancel a game. The players get a week off and 2 or 3 a couple of weeks away get ready to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thoraz06 @Herding__cats @TWashingtonWeb @yashar Lol he was only appointed special counsel in October. No way he's finished. You're confusing this with the other investigations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidPsbdivinyl @PresidentGulag @JackPosobiec @Project_Veritas Why would you want to defend CNN? It blows my mind that you'd hear that audio and immediately leap to the defence of a multi million dollar corporation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blackmyre @EliLake the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC @JerryDunleavy not according to Mueller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC because Trump famously fired Mueller and stopped his investigation. (oh wait)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett agree it was a calculated gamble he obviously didn't trust the other players on the bench. Henderson and Gini had to stay on for their experience and in terms of midfield where you might have wanted fresh legs who was there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro if you don't look very hard you're technically telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonBrundish Isn't this open to abuse. If you're a team like Liverpool that have 3 or 4 players a couple of weeks from returning it would be very convenient to have an outbreak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ron_burgundy_7 @SteveDeaceShow Politicians are hypocrites is that a shock to you? The media on the other hand should not be partisan and if you think CNN would be covering this the same way if everything was the same except for the parties then you're lying to yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench This has been the case for a long time and it's coming from both parties. Let's not pretend the democrats haven't been using incredibly inflammatory language for the past 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_mahler__ @Peoples_Pundit Everything is partisan. You only have to look at the politics of the judge to know what they'll do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bulletsandsteel @StevenSkelton1 @DavidAFrench That's not a signature check. You should listen to what @Barnes_Law has to say about Georgia, they have lied about the process and proper signature checks have not been done...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IFDrinkLib @wayninja1 @DavidAFrench You should read what @Barnes_Law has to say about Georgia. He was lied to in terms of the sort of audit that would be undertaken. Every state should want maximum transparency so there is faith in the process. At the moment that faith has never been lower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zerohedge down 1% in the past 24hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayaburgess @OllieHolt22 This is it. We have faith in the goal line technology. But the offside technology cannot capture the precise moment a pass is made yet it is implemented  as if it can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKevinPalmer this is the problem with VAR. They'll look for tiny contact in the area yet on every single corner you see players being wrestled and having their shirts grabbed very clearly and they never do anything about it. It's enforced in a very random way that nobody seems to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNM1Michael @RealKevinPalmer he wasn't offside when the foul was commited. Also the only reason his arms were in the position they were which caused to him to be offside was because he was trying to get free from being held.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers Im in favour of something like they're doing in Holland. Add a margin of error in there even if it's just a few cms and if the 2 lines touch then it's not offside. They can't capture the precise moment the pass is played anyway so it's not an exact science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redpaul78 @StanCollymore Klopp won't care about this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMoonCarl Good chance to accumulate more, faster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidowen24 @talkSPORT @TonyCascarino62 yeah they basically freeze on the moment of contact. If the referee watches the whole incident and sees Wellbeck go down about 2 sec afterwards it paints a different picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers Doesn't help he's filling in for a generational player that is redefining the position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom Right back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiesears1989 @GaryLineker take your bias out of the equation and if you polled most football fans I think a large majority would say their enjoyment of the game has decreased because of the way VAR is being used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiesears1989 @GaryLineker lol how many VAR penalties did Liverpool get last season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker @TheDesKelly when England lose a few key players for the Euros due to fatigue related injuries we'll come back and revisit this sentiment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore Doing it occasionally is sustainable. The CL teams are going to be playing 2 games a week for the whole season. You never had to do that. Any sports scientist will tell you fatigue is the main cause of muscle injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daz_SE25 @StanCollymore Talk to a sports scientist about the difference a few hours can make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore Just interested if you've spoken to any sports scientist that would agree with you on this, just one??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acynicalterrier @StanCollymore You only have to watch a game from 10 years ago to see how its changed, not that those players weren't at the peak of their fitness but the intensity at the top level isn't the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett And when England lose some key players before the Euros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamMcGuire90 Do you think we should target a RB in January as well as a CB?? Seems to be the biggest drop off when Trent isn't there and Milner doesn't fill in. Would also give us a lot of options if we have another RB we can trust. Would free up Milner, and Fabinho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_scottsaunders Do BT choose the games that go in the 12.30 slot or is that dictated to them? I think that's the point he was missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDesKelly honest question, do BT choose which games get the 12.30 slot or is that dictated to them by the PL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streeperazi @GrizzKhan @benhainess That's not the point, the point is the current offside technology isn't 100% accurate but they act as if it is. There should be a margin of error given to the attacker. Look at how they do it in Holland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johngibbonsblog don't worry they'll be complaining when England lose a few players for the Euros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartlettM96 @Jay82_LFC @GaryLineker @TheDesKelly he's been talking about this for years, especially the xmas period in England, almost since he arrived in the PL. It's ok, England will lose some key players for the Euros and then maybe something will be done (it won't)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore 70-80 games?? when?? the game has never been more intense if you watch a game from 10 years ago and compare it it's like a different sport. Klopp has been talking about this almost since he arrived in the PL especially the xmas period, this isn't new from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore there are lots of things companies CAN do under the terms of the contract, that doesn't mean they should do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore nobody is arguing they can't do it. The argument is they should try and use common sense in certain situations. The broadcasters need the clubs too, the quality of the product will suffer if they best players aren't playing or can't perform at their best level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore when England lose a bunch of key players for the Euros maybe then something will be done? but i doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore the Utd manager made the exact same point a few weeks ago and Klopp has been making this point for years. This isn't a normal season Stan, the players haven't had a proper pre-season yet they are expected to play in a condensed season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore treat them with very little respect. All it takes is a little common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore ok what would happen if one club decided not to sign up to the contract Stan? it wouldn't make any difference. The clubs are not wrong for having an expectation to be treated fairly. We want our club sides to do well in Europe, we want the national teams to do well yet we...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colin_a_mcbride @BassTunedToRed it would be Karma if England picked up a few key injuries before the Euros due to this type of short term thinking. Player welfare should be the #1 priority at the moment, you want the best players playing to the best of their ability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamcasey86 @empireofthekop when the home nations lose a bunch of key players for the Euros because they've been run into the ground maybe they'll understand the importance of player welfare. Without the top players playing there is no quality product.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_tomkins yeah there is no consistency. There are using super slo motion to find the smallest amount of contact in the penalty area yet an over the ball foul that you know will look terrible slowed down isn't even looked at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @benhainess the offsides are more frustrating because you know the technology isn't perfect. They cannot accurately tell when the pass is made yet they'll disallow a goal when it's a matter of centimetres. There needs to be a margin of error on offsides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch they can't accurately show when the pass was made (due to frame rates) so if you can't with 100% accuracy tell when the ball was played how can you give an offside when its literally centimeteres. There has to be some margin of error on the use of VAR for offsides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Football will never be an exact science in terms of the officiating, but they are trying to pretend it is and it's spoiling the game. The Robertson one for me you can justify but the offsides that are given by milimetres are the ones they need to have a look at because...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @HarrySymeou @benhainess basically that is what it has come to when the incident goes to VAR. They slow it right down and even a tiny bit of contact is deemed a foul and penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benhainess nowhere near the ball is never analysed. There was one in todays game that could easily have been a red and slowed down it would have looked terrible but they hardly ever review those, instead they're looking for tiny bits of contact in the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benhainess when you slow these things down super slo you can invariably find things to justify contact, in this instance it was probably a pen but it's a very soft one. Part of the frustration is they are super critical on this type of incident and then an over the ball tackle that is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benhainess I think the issue is with all of these types of incidents they never show the referee enough of the incident they just show the moment where there might have been contact. Look at the one Fernandes got where he actually fouls the defender but slowed down it looks bad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liveforthepool @paul_tomkins Just add a margin of error in there like they do in the cricket. You can't accurately capture the precise moment the pass is played so it's not an exact science. If it's super close you give the benefit to the attacker even if it's just a few cm margin of error.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirkerslfc4eva @GrizzKhan Biggest drop off in the team at the moment is RB when Milner doesn't fill in. I'd look to get someone like Lamptey, Trent could also end up in midfield if we have better alternatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@15Shazzer @empireofthekop They can't they can only have a best guess. This is why I think there should be a margin of error like in cricket that favours the attacker. It can be a small margin but those really tight ones won't be offside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop yup just taking a fraction of a second too long and in this league that's enough. He'll get the pace of the league in time but at the moment he's getting muscled off the ball too often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tundeb87 @ElliotKnight16 @LFCNxsir @JamesPearceLFC Gini's been holding things together. I'd put Henderson on for Nico, Milner to RB and maybe Jones for Minamino.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan early KO after a midweek evening game is a recipe for disaster. Attitude has to be spot on from the start, felt like we were intentionally low intensity against Atalanta but we can't play that way here. Start fast, get a lead then try and manage the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James97533886 @GrizzKhan he's played a lot of games, more than anyone else in that front 3 while Jota and Firmino got a bit of a break in midweek. It'll be just juggling the minutes of those 4 and picking the freshest 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackSear yeah thought the same but you have to trust that the sports science guys know what they're doing. This is a particularly tough run of games. Sunday / Wednesday then early Saturday / Tuesday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza @RAMRANTS it's pretty scary when you realise what has happened. The Hunter Biden story was the first big example that if big tech, and 99% of the media refuses to cover a story it basically doesn't exist. They are able to create reality for millions of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SexCounseling they'll just pretend it never happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxkeiser @cryptomanran whenever i see a dip like this it makes me happy because it means i can keep accumulating. This time last year this sort of drop would have had me panicked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gradisagrimalte @KimStrassel what was the lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawgirl @RBPundit blackmail isn't a conspiracy theory in DC. It's standard operating procedure. If they have something on you they can control you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathrynanton @pfrady @IngrahamAngle so many happy to rush to judgement in this case when they have a basic understanding of the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathrynanton @pfrady @IngrahamAngle  https://t.co/4yjWA1T289<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pfrady @IngrahamAngle yeah and Sullivan later apologised for those comments. Oh and by the way, the guilty pleas were withdrawn once a bunch of exculpatory evidence that was being suppressed came to light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBPundit more likely they have shit on him. He acts like someone completely compromised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisanfield @jacklusby_ @mattladson @SachinNakrani the team has outgrown Origi. The biggest drop offs we now have are at RB (unless Milner plays there) and in the front 3 if it's not 3 of Salah, Firmino, Mane and Jota.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmaniX2557 @MSNBC @mehdirhasan it's not murder that is a specific legal term and Kyle hasn't been tried yet. Anyone that has viewed the videos in an objective manner can see very clearly he was acting in self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LavaLake77 they haven't but only if government is prepared to do something about it. It's getting pretty scary though, when big tech and 95% of news outlets simply refuse to cover something they are basically creating reality for millions of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Headsnipe011 @SpeakerPelosi @SidneyPowell1 @CatesDuane @rising_serpent @almostjingo @tracybeanz @CarrollQuigley1 I would have a pretty big wager that Pelosi knows very little about the facts of this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim88175969 @ByronYork Trump isn't the first President to pardon someone you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have an opinion on the Michael Flynn pardon I urge you to watch this video from @thevivafrei so many people I've seen comment on this case clearly don't understand the facts. #MichaelFlynn    https://t.co/L2xFj0e7aF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisDudley85 @RepJoeNeguse he's a 3 star general he's done more for the country than you ever will. He was set up because he upset the wrong people and the judge is about as corrupt as it gets. If you've followed this case with any sort of objectivity you'd understand that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJoeNeguse @kpereau he also withdrew those pleas once he hired proper lawyers and a bunch of exculpatory evidence that had been hidden was discovered. You should be more concerned about a completely corrupt judge that wanted to be the judge and the prosecution when there was no longer a case to try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kpereau @ScottAdamsSays because innocent people never plead guilty right Kevin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gailendavid @JackPosobiec @dougmastriano @jack Care to detail the disinformation or just baseless claims?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bucleduckle @JimSoxx @pas_bon @thunder_patriot @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews @GenFlynn It's not unusual for charges to be dropped against someone when new information comes to light that is exculpatory. It is unusual for a judge to want to be prosecutor and judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bucleduckle @JimSoxx @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews Funny how you defend a woman that clearly destroyed evidence that had been subpoenad and you want a 3 star general to go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wdlenz52 @jginfla @coop_coop2020 @rodneycwilson @brhodes Yes exculpatory evidence was found and the judge had to apologise for those comments. You don't think it's wrong for a judge to make a statement like that mid trial?? Sullivan knew he was out of line which is why he apologized. Stop lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffwayne77 @AnfieldWatch yeah he can, his passing is better and his experience just means he plays the position in a smarter way. Neco is enthusiastic but he's not Trent it's the one position where the drop off is the greatest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks they want to see this family man that served his country go to prison just because they hate Trump. It's psychotic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jginfla @coop_coop2020 @rodneycwilson @brhodes and then withdrew his guilty pleas when he had lawyers that were doing their jobs properly and exculpatory evidence that was being withheld was discovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes guilty of what Ben? in the USA you are still innocent until proven guilty by a court. I know Sullivan wants to be prosecutor and judge but that's how it's done and if it is how it's done everyone should be very afraid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffwayne77 @AnfieldWatch he had a poor game but it's difficult when we're used to Trent whose basically redefined that position for us. Neco isn't Trent but we did suffer from both fullbacks being unable to support the attack which left them very isolated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HitThemHiigh @Cernovich look at how 99% of the media is dealing with this, as well as big tech. They are basically creating the reality as we watch and it's working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillayneMC @adamhousley 2017 article. You do know that case against his business partner was thrown out of court right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillayneMC @adamhousley have you followed this trial at all? if you have just wondering what you think of the actions of Judge Sullivan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich you know there's no way they watched that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StaceySupro @BitOBaca @adamhousley you know that case was thrown out of court right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGSRPM @adamhousley a "foreign agent" get a grip mate. Why the thirst to see family men that have served your country with distinction go to prison? it's psychotic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChadPergram has Schiff found that evidence he told us was in plain site of Trump colluding with Russia yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@txt73 @jollllu @marystarsea @Cernovich just saying, an affidavit is a legal document that has serious implications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klcmurphy @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews you guys really are psychotic aren't you. So thirsty to see a family man that served the country with distinction go to prison. After everything we've learnt during this case you'd have to be a psycopath to want that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimSoxx @pas_bon @thunder_patriot @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews @GenFlynn im sure you're happy with a judge throwing out all the norms and wanting to be the prosecution and the judge but it should scare you the precident that sets. With a judge this political and corrupt the only solution is a pardon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimSoxx @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews why are you so thirsty to see this man go to prison?? it's psychotic at this point given everything we know about the case that you'd actively cheer for a family man that served the country with distinction to go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks yup i've asked several what he lied about and nobody can answer. They repeat the same "he pled guilty he should go to prison" answer, as if innocent people have never plead guilty before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atlefthandside @KayKEELY @JerryDunleavy what was the lie?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atlefthandside @JerryDunleavy what do you think of a judge wanting to be prosecution and judge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillayneMC @adamhousley 2017 and that case against his business partner was thrown out of court already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald you really want to ruin peoples lives don't you? And someone that served the country with nothing but honour, something you could never do. What are these heinous crimes? trying to deescalate a situation with the Russians, how dare he!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarbHuber9 @RealSLokhova @realDonaldTrump The charges have been dropped the judge isn't there to be the prosecution and the judge. Sullivan has overstepped his bounds so far it's scary. You don't care but you should this is a horrible precident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParkerMolloy @jaketapper Do you think if she'd heard someone say something similar about Trump she'd have reported it in the same way?? She's a partisan we all know she's a partisan and the next 4 years will just confirm it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerMolloy @jaketapper It's only out of context to the extent that she invented a source for her comments so it could be classed as journalism and not commentary. We all know she's partisan it's hardly a secret....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you take a step back and understand what big tech and parts of the media have managed to accomplish in the past 4 years it really is scary. The shift has already been made to the "soft" reporting on Biden, the next 4 years are going to be interesting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gooseinmyoj @AdamantCats @dannyweinman @burkenbine_mark @ChuckCallesto Yeah when you have a judge that's gone way outside his scope and wants to prosecute as well as judge you have to do things like this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GramB18 @MrBanks76037905 @JackPosobiec When you're not checking the signatures it's pretty easy. Just look at the rejection rates and compare that with 2016 and 2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carra23 @SpursOfficial Mourinho will be encouraging this from all his players. I just wish the media were consistent accross the board. Salah was lambasted just a few weeks ago for a penalty in which he was fouled and exagerated the contact, at least be consistent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ksenijapavlovic @BarackObama i think that's a huge part of it, some of the most common criticisms aimed at Trump are that he doesn't "act presedential" there is a comfort to a lot of people in the familiar, even if the familar is a corrupt system that most people know is corrupt....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeNordon @charliekirk11 the type of evidence that is needed will only be found with a full and proper investigation.

<|startoftext|>@TaylorYoungling @charliekirk11 you have over 100 affidavits and enough statistical anomolies to warrant an investigation.

<|startoftext|>@TaylorYoungling @charliekirk11 you need an investigation to find the sorts of evidence that would satisfy those that think there's nothing to see here. You need a forensic examination of the machines (probably too late now) you need a full proper audit of ballots....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSLokhova @KerriKupecDOJ obviously not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenFlynn @SergeiMillian @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @DineshDSouza they want everything handed to them on a plate. How many so called journalists have done any digging into Dominion?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iemmys @NYGovCuomo enjoy your ratio. This is extremely disrespectful to the 1000's that died because of this mans policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJaunxPatrol @stillgray @PrisonPlanet when you say "facts do matter" it's important to get the facts right yourself. Nobody claimed it was a "Venezuelen gov't operation". The claim is the machines were designed to help Chavez fix an election, and they have a sworn affidavit from someone saying such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClockwrkArnge @secupp @jaketapper all im asking for is tough questions when it is justified. So far he has faced 0 tough questions despite there being several opportunities. We all know what's about to happen though. we saw it on the campaign trail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSherman @PressSec yeah cos spying on an incoming administration is incredibly normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liveandletdyke @JTF5570 @savemejebus0 @KamalaHarris the point is how many of those murders were because the individual was trans?? of course 1 is too many but lets not pretend this is unique to trans individuals. An epidemic suggests it is happening way beyond other gender identities and this is simply not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TammyLawrenz @savemejebus0 @KamalaHarris how many of those murders were hate crimes, how many of those individuals were murdered because they were trans? of course 1 is too many but hate crimes exist everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp @jaketapper I look forward to your profession holding Biden to the same standards you've applied to Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Interesting to contemplate the future when journalists like Jake try and tell us that using executive orders is no big deal when Biden does it but it was the sign of a tyrant when Trump did it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog 1. the court of public opinion is important, you can't let the other side control the narrative completely.   2. nobody should accept anybodies word as gospel but that works both ways. How many journalists claiming there is no evidence have spent any time looking into it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmeraldRobinson about these voting machines years ago but now nobody wants to spend any sort of time looking into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmeraldRobinson they don't take the time to look into the claims or do any sort of investigation themselves and then claim there is no credible evidence. I challenge anyone to spend 2/3 days looking into Dominion and these machines and then say there are no issues. Democrats have raised issues..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth before they present it to the courts, that's just showing your hand to the enemy before you have to. If there is any truth in what she is saying you don't think steps are being taken to wipe machines and destroy evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth They spoke in generalities at the press conference. The affidavits are there for everyone to read. Witnesses are being threatened why would you expose those people to more threats and intimidation? I have no idea what evidence they might have but it makes no sense to present it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRockTheMathGuy @AlfredAston2 @travelingirl68 @oliverdarcy they explained that witnesses were being threatened and why would you want to show your hand to the other side before it goes to court? what trial lawyer would do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylor_jacob @katz_murray @mattyglesias you can't have it both ways, when she was being confirmed we were being warned her faith would dictate her rulings not the law. Here she is applying the law even though it might go against her faith and that's not good enough either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylor_jacob @katz_murray @mattyglesias do you want her to judge from the law or from her faith?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Basin @how2bealady @InfidelAngela @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson this talking point was debunked yesterday, the Trump team have filed 3 cases and one was withdrawn becasue they got the result they wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katz_murray @mattyglesias Imagine thinking there is the same moral question in aborting a baby and sentencing someone who has been found guilty of doing something abhorent to the death penalty. This isn't an argument in favour of the death penalty but there is no equivalence here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReppelJonathan @atensnut @RealSaavedra @SidneyPowell1 I get it, the court of public opinion is important but all you can do really is lay out an overview of your claims which is what they are doing. The affidavits are there for anyone to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReppelJonathan @atensnut @RealSaavedra @SidneyPowell1 Yeah he's wrong. The media are not entitled to see anything before a judge. Not only are there legal implications that would hinder your case if you did that, why would you show your hand to the people you're accusing??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Rawlings @imjdsharp @JackPosobiec And you know this how? How much research have you done on Dominion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RangerDave5 @JackPosobiec Yup the FBI has the power to subpoena machines and documents that these private citizens do not. They absolutely should be doing that if there is a shred of evidence to support the claims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dw_subbed @nosoup4knowles @MattWalshBlog There are signed affidavits you can read online. They laid out the basis of their claims but it is the courts that need to see the evidence first not the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog I get that but why does Tucker think he's entitled to see the evidence before a court?? They already explained there are legal reasons why they can't do that as well as witnesses being threatened etc..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ogallalaknowhow @RPK_ @EmeraldRobinson @DanaPerino @FoxNews @RudyGiuliani @SidneyPowell1 Discovery will be very interesting in that scenario. There's a reason anyone that works for Dominion is trying to erase their online footprint right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EVargasTV They also explained how witnesses and whistleblowers were being attacked and threatened. The media are not entitled to anything. The courts are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EVargasTV They already explained why it would be problematic from a legal standpoint to show what evidence they have to the media before they show it to the courts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alec_rohmer @LyleStewart55 @SidneyPowell1 @RealRLimbaugh They laid out in general what they are claiming they can prove and said they have an affidavit from someone that worked for Dominion. But they also explained why there are legal reasons why they can't produce evidence to the media before it's been presented to the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlfredAston2 @travelingirl68 @oliverdarcy They already explained there are legal reasons why you don't produce evidence to the media before you present it to a court of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilyannaSomes @PastorDScott @DonaldJTrumpJr If you listened to the press conference you'd know that was a debunked talking point. They have not been there to present evidence yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers If you're only argument is these types of conspiracies aren't possible because people can't keep secrets that's a terrible argument. Why not spend 3 days researching Dominion and see what you find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers She wouldn't make the claims she did without the evidence to support what she's saying. Evidence you haven't taken the time to do even a modicum of research into yet you dismiss it out of hand because it is shocking to think it might happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers What facts are you disputing? Are you disputing the history of Dominion? Are you disputing that machines have been used to rig elections?? I get it, it's a huge claim and one that would shake things to their core but Sidney Powell is an extremely serious, lawyer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennElizabethJ @garethEmartin @C_C_Krebs @chrislhayes If you're worried about facts it's important that you get yours straight too and your question was based on something that was not factual that you were corrected on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennElizabethJ @garethEmartin @C_C_Krebs @chrislhayes It was a combative exchange but nothing out of the ordinary. I thought your question was a fair one and it was answered fairly, correcting the false premise that they'd had 25 lawsuits thrown out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennElizabethJ @C_C_Krebs @chrislhayes Your question was based on a false premise that they corrected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny @djross95 @KenGardner11 It's a tough one because the court of public opinion is important but to be honest what sort of evidence is going to sway someone convinced the level of fraud being claimed is impossible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny @djross95 @KenGardner11 They did say in the conference they'd provide an outline of what they are claiming but they'll provide the evidence they have to the courts and not the media because witnesses are being threatened etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjpjpatel @suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson Yet you just drop it into this discussion as if it's a fact. That's a big problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjpjpatel @suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson  https://t.co/6AZhGYLHHq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjpjpatel @suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson Lol the fact you mention the Russian bounties story which has not been verified by the intelligence agencies at all tells me you watch too much MSNBC and CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reblau22 @michaelbd @jaketapper If you watched the conference you'd know that is a debunked talking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oncetfil @MickWest @ConceptualJames But as James said I'm not sure what sort of evidence could be presented now to convince someone who is convinced there is no fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oncetfil @MickWest @ConceptualJames They've alreasy said they will be presenting their evidence to the courts not the media because when they go public witnesses are being threatened and intimidated. It's a problem because winning in the court of public opinion is important...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog You also need access to the machines if that's the basis of one of their main claims those machines need to be seized and forensically examined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HampOldshue @robbysoave What research have you done on Dominian? If you don't think it's possible these machines could have been used to massively distort the results you don't understand them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbysoave What do you know about Dominian Robby? Have you done any independent research on them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XanaduNow12 @JohnW63932268 @robbysoave Because their case doesn't just involve the Dominian machines. This was explained in the press conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks Good they deserve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simongwynn @Josh_Canucks_20 @ggreenwald It was used in the post that started the conversation.  https://t.co/0yDs0Z45fG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZAnon06596102 @ethicalassholeZ @suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson Lol I take it you haven't watched MSNBC lately. Those guys give Alex Jones a run for his money. They've been telling their viewers that Trump is an agent of Russia for 4 years with 0 evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson Of course a big part of being brain washed is you're convinced your worldview is 100% sane while the other side is crazy. They think exactly the same about anyone that watches MSNBC or CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzannechowla @rsarver @EWErickson Do you know how many democrats think Trump is a Russian agent. This isn't unique to the right. Anyone that gets their information from CNN or MSNBC is similarly misinformed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simongwynn @ggreenwald That exists on the left and the right. The difference is I've never seen anyone on the right suggest those they disagree with need to be "rededucated" or "deprogrammed" but I've heard that language a lot on the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@droid0412 @ggreenwald But the left is absolutely fine right and has no questionable  beliefs right? It's just the other side that needs to be rededucated right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simongwynn @ggreenwald How many democrats believe Trump is a Russian asset? That's what CNN and MSNBC have been telling them for 4 years. Do they need to be "rededucated"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryCParkhurst @ggreenwald How many liberals think Trump is a Russian asset? Should they be deprogrammed too??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMiers @DavidOAtkins There are elements to both the left and right that display some of the characteristics of being in a cult. But I've never heard anyone on the right talk about "re-educating" millions of people, it's always you guys. You can't even see your own cult like behaviour it's scary....<|endoftext|>

It seems a very high % of these "errors" only went in one direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidShafer Have any of these "errors" gone in Biden's favour? Just in terms of probability it should be close to 50/50 if these are random errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hhugh02 @B_Call_OD @juliaeleftheri1 @AdamInHTownTX @rewegreatyet @KY79200431 @DavidShafer @ScottAdamsSays a 9,000 "error" in one county. Genuine question can you find one of these errors that went the other way? if it is genuinly human error or machine errors it should be close to a 50/50 split on who is being favoured by these errors right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliaeleftheri1 @AdamInHTownTX @rewegreatyet @KY79200431 @DavidShafer @ScottAdamsSays this is one county and they found a 9,000 vote error you think it's the only one? can you find any of these errors that went the other way? i haven't heard of one "error" that favoured Trump.

<|startoftext|>@AdamEarle11 @kylenabecker it suggests they don't have the ballots to match the totals, which is a pretty big clue that the same ballots were run through machines multiple times. If you don't physically have the correct number of ballots that's a big problem, where are they? if they existed at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MegwaDaniel @LFCTransferRoom he said he had a cramp in his hamstring, i think Klopp would have had a big problem with Clarke if he had played in this one after going 120min just a few days ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hungrybowtie Both of those groups came looking for a fight, they should fight each other and leave people alone that are there just for a rally. When you're wearing body armour and carrying weapons you're not a "random" person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hungrybowtie "Random people" it's clearly 2 sides squaring off I don't see the proud boys attacking families or old people there for a rally. You're not dumb enough not to understand what's happening here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules you won't be the only one. If they think this is going to bring any sympathy to their cause they are just plain stupid. Bullying and attacking old people in groups just shows what a bunch of cowards these people are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CowboyAmsterdam @Cassie84959408 @sooverytired @MZHemingway not aggravating at all. I think you compare it with historical numbers and if there are big anomolies that is circumstantial evidence to look into it a bit more. @Peoples_Pundit did a couple of really in depth shows about this very thing if you have the time it's worth watching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrPanzin @CowboyAmsterdam @Cassie84959408 @sooverytired @MZHemingway no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CowboyAmsterdam @Cassie84959408 @sooverytired @MZHemingway I'm talking about places within the states with abnormally high turnouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cassie84959408 @sooverytired @MZHemingway When you're talking about over 90% in swing states I think it's a big enough anomaly to at least investigate. It shouldn't take long to figure out if there's anything worth looking into or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtwainet @NHATexas @JonahDispatch @MZHemingway @josh_hammer @Jim_Jordan Let's be honest both sides do whatever they can legally to get an advantage. Let's not pretend the democrats don't do everything they can, where they can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sooverytired @MZHemingway it's an anomoly and when there are claims of fraid those sorts of anomolies are circumstantial evidence to warrant deeper investigation. When you get turnouts greater than countries that have mandatory voting in some areas that's a red flag that at least deserves investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtwainet @JonahDispatch @MZHemingway @josh_hammer sure that's what an audit of ballots would show, it would also help if the counting process was observed properly by both parties which doesn't seem to have happened in some places and hundreds of affidavits have been signed claiming that. That would be illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtwainet @JonahDispatch @MZHemingway @josh_hammer absentee ballots are one thing, mass mailing of ballots to tens of millions of people using outdated roll data is another thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch @MZHemingway @josh_hammer and yet the day after election day people are gathered in huge crowds to celebrate the results. People absolutely could have voted in person with the necessary measures taken e.g. masks, distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peoples_Pundit if a high enough percentage are found to be illegally cast you audit more of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peoples_Pundit what sort of % of ballots do you think you'd need to audit to get an idea if a high enough number of them were illegally cast? Surely the most efficient way to do it would be to audit those areas with circumstantial evidence (eg abnormal turnout) and audit maybe 5,000 ballots...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JarrodWeir @Sugar_Tits_Bear The first error is quite common where people think very high tax rates will apply to all their earnings not just part of them, but to think anyone earning over $400,000 pays 0 in taxes under Biden's plan is probably dumber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JarrodWeir @Sugar_Tits_Bear yup they're both wrong but if you're going to act as the intellectual superior you'd better get it right. If she thinks anyone earning under $400k under Biden is paying $0 in tax she's deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sugar_Tits_Bear She needs to use some brain cells if she thinking anyone that earns $400,000 a year is taking home $400,000.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RandPaul yup it's not that time consuming. You go to areas where there is circumstantial evidence e.g. abnormally high turnouts (over 90%) and do an audit of a sample of votes if there is a good number of illegal ballots you increase the number to audit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang do you teach your 8 year old that cheating is ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes yeah everyone knows its the media that decides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@obbiecole @bobclendenin @robbystarbuck @PressSec I think they said there were over 600,000 votes they weren't allowed to observe being counted in PA, that's a lot of votes that need to be looked at. I still haven't heard of a valid reason why that would happen?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRightMelissa @RBReich voting was stopped for a few hours in certain key swing states that is a fact.  affidavits have been signed by registered poll watchers who were not allowed to witness the counting of ballots or they were placed so far away they couldn't do what they have a legal right to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter it takes time (and cooperation) to see if the sort of widespread fraud being claimed is there. But there is enough circumstantial evidence in certain cities and states to warrant a more thorough audit of ballots and maybe examination of machines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pcf4 @JasonHolliday_ @talkSPORT @andros_townsend It's possible both teams held back subs in case there were more players getting muscle injuries.

<|startoftext|>@CathyYoung63 if there is widespread fraud it'll be linked to the computers changing totals, and maybe stuff like mass ballots from dead people or as was discovered yesterday using maiden names from people that had moved states.

<|startoftext|>@andycCAFC @kashp08 @talkSPORT it's possible they both held substitutions back in case there were more muscle injuries. If you make all your subs then you lose another player to injury you're playing a key game with 10 men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobclendenin @robbystarbuck @PressSec If they'd waited they'd have heard that there were over 100 signed affidavits saying Republican poll watchers were stopped from observing the counting of over 600,000 votes. Those affidavits are evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Larrytx2 @JonathanTurley Yup plus sworn affidavits from over 100 individuals saying they were prevented from observing the counting of over 600,000 ballots which is illegal..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers @megynkelly @RichardGrenell Where was the unity from the left when Trump was elected? You never gave him a chance, why should conservatives do something liberals couldn't??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ememess @AshleyRParker @PressSec "The resistance" = 99% of media, Twitter, Google, Facebook, Hollywood, the CIA and FBI. Keep fighting against the system buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker @PressSec Except there is supporting evidence. Signed affidavits from over 100 individuals saying they were not allowed to observe the counting of over 600,000 ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorDurbin What were the US co2 emissions like under Trump? Also unless you get China and India to sign up to your crazy plans it's almost worthless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool He's got 2 weeks. We want him right so he doesn't break down again. Hopefully it'll get better every day between now and the next game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec cc: @jaketapper we know if you actually saw the information you'd lose any plausable deniability for not reporting on it. It's easy to say there is no evidence when you don't even look for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Do you think telling your audience that the President of the USA was likely a Russian agent for 4 years was good for the nation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Worldwide much more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro @DonaldJTrumpJr If they are genuinly random mistakes and glitches it should be close to a 50/50 split in terms of who they benefit. I would like an analysis to see the breakdown of who benefited from these mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter I look forward to CNN asking some tough questions about the Hunter Biden information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast cc: @NateSilver538<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dialoguealways @evaneugenescott @SaintHeartwing @IamSean90 Yeah it's perfectly rational that an ideology that thinks the white race is superior and should dominate all other races would have as its leader a non white individual. Makes perfect sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAPAction All of a sudden executive orders are good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Was there any attempt for unity from liberals immediately after Trump won?? Nope they went immediately to vitriol, never gave him a chance. Why should conservatives stop fighting when they didn't??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VGD_SG Are there any examples at all? I know it's not evidence but when a bunch of "random" events all go one way it's hard to believe it is random.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honest question: how many of these counting errors and computer errors went in the favour of the Republicans / Trump? does anyone have a tally? you'd expect it to be close to 50/50 right?? #Election2020 #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore Klopp has talked about player welfare before Covid, it's obviously something he's concerned about and rightly so. The number of games these players are being put through is insane. Don't cry if England lose key players before the Euros due to muscle injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digiphile @PatrickRuffini The media is absolutely the biggest enemy the people have at the moment, and that is true whether you're on the left or right. Politics is as toxic as I can remember and the media is mostly to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @ScottAdamsSays yup they made that subtle change a few days ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 id stick Firmino on their deepest midfielder (Rodri) the worry of course is they dominate the midfield but if Firmino does that we should be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kristian_Walsh could be more of a traditional 4-4-2, the worry of course is getting overrun in midfield but im guessing Firmino will be sitting on their deepest midfielder so hopefully that doesn't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch shout out to the one white person in that crowd trying hard not to get lynched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qbermensch @BrianNormoyle @ConceptualJames Not evidence in itself but enough of an anomaly to investigate at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qbermensch @BrianNormoyle @ConceptualJames Does stuff like this at least warrant an investigation??   https://t.co/7Anq2SUGJj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper fair enough have a good day. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper again im not saying this is hard evidence but it is evidence. The claim has been there is NO evidence and that is not true. There is more evidence in this story than pretty much any story that's been used to attack Trump for the past 4 years. It warrants further investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper those are from the hard drive. I understand in isolation they could be anything but they are from Hunters phone and email. Nobody has denied their authenticity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper now of course there's no smoking gun but that's what investigations are for and there is more than enough evidence to warrant looking into this matter further and then you might find something more concrete. But it is not a non story which is my broader point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper lol you don't get to decide what is valid or isn't. The fact that Hunter was having these dealings in China and the Ukraine is worrying enough. There is some evidence in the form of emails and text messages where Hunter talks about his dad taking half and "10% for the big guy"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper a prime candidate for blackmail. Are the photos and videos real or are they fake too? There is more than enough enough to warrant an investigation into what was going on with Hunter Biden and these entities in China and the Ukraine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper Evidence that Hunter Biden and his business partners were getting paid by some shady people in China, and the Ukraine and that Joe knew about it and was given a portion of the money. Also evidence that Hunter Biden was involved in some pretty unsavoury stuff which makes him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper there's more than enough to make it a valid story worth investigating and reporting on lets put it that way. For CNN, MSNBC, Facebook, Twitter etc.. to try and completely squash the story is unprecidented. The Atlantic story contained 100% unnamed sources and it was covered...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper the actual emails and texts are there for you to see. It's evidence whether you say it is or not. Now of course there are different types of evidence but it is evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper it's easy to think there's no evidence if you won't spend 5min looking for it. If you follow the person i linked and spend 5 min looking at their tweets from around the 3rd what they found is there. There is much much more but there are so many emails, texts it takes time ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennPellegrino the "resistance" is 95% of media, big tech social media, hollywood, the FBI, the CIA what are they resisting exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper im telling you follow that person and they have highlighted the more important emails. Do you want me to do all the work for you? it's all there on their feed including the actual documents being talked about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper  https://t.co/JZJ5drjWQN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper follow this person @HansMahncke they have accesse to the hard drive and have been doing a deep dive into some of the more important emails etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mind_of_snyder @JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper Sure there's the hard drive full of emails, texts and photos, none of which have been proven to be fake. Then you have all the text messages and emails provided by Tony Bobulinski that have not been shown to be fake, as well as his testimony...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevivafrei it's the language of an abuser. They call people Nazis and racists and white supremacists for 4 years and then say "if you just go along with everything we want to do we can be friends".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremymbarr like the pee tape, Russian collusion, the Atlantic story (all unnamed sources) while at the same time putting a complete blanket on the Hunter Biden story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremymbarr the opposite is true of places like CNN and MSNBC though. Blocking stories because they are not helpful to their "team" is the same as promoting stories that don't have sufficient evidence or aren't credible. CNN is in no place to lecture anybody, the promoted flimsy stories...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper while at the same time failing to cover the Hunter Biden story because they claim there isn't enough "evidence" despite there being plenty of it. It's a convenient way for them to not cover certain stories they don't want to cover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOKeefeIII @jaketapper exactly you do wonder at this point how much evidence it would take for them to grudgingly cover it. As we've seen with the Hunter Biden story there is a 2 tier system when it comes to evidence. They can push an Atlantic story made up entirely of unnamed sources...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HonestyMatterz @danielp_reid @kkyls @DanCrenshawTX Faucci is on the record several times that Trump always listened to their reccomendations. You're being extremely insulting to the 100s of people that have been working around the clock to fight this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBLeTruth probably in the crowds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro expect this from the media for the next 2 years at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novatare_ @BlackUnihorn @BridgetPhetasy In some ways he his, but the ferocity with which the CIA and FBI have gone after him is a big hint that in important ways he isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyBusiness @Jenny_A_Walsh @MattWalshBlog Now he says, if you just go along with everything we want to do we can be friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyBusiness @Jenny_A_Walsh @MattWalshBlog It's basically like being in an abusive relationship, for 4 years conservatives have been called Nazis, racists, white supremacists, Joe himself continued to fan the flames pushing the "fine people" hoax at every opportunity...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentreDude @MattWalshBlog I'm pretty sure Trump made similar comments during his inorgoration about trying to unite the country but always the media sets the narrative and no matter what happens the media will cover for Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lgbtqnation C'mon @ddale8 gonna fact check this?? Or has your 4 year holiday started?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cfrandall @BrandiKruse let me guess "feminist"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainygay1 @chrislhayes is this your 1st election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it's kind of embarassing how many people that really should know better are fawning over the pretty basic rhetoric from Biden as if it makes one jot of difference. How many times can political parties / politicians let you down before you understand the game that's being played?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackUnihorn @BridgetPhetasy they crave the safety of the familiar even if deep down they understand the familiar is a deeply rotten system. Biden has been part of that system for almost 50 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackUnihorn @BridgetPhetasy yeah they are clueless. I do think a big part of it is what I'd call political Stockholm Syndrome. Trump is so unlike any president they've experienced before they'd rather the comfort of the familiar even if the familar is a corrupt system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodkall1 @Acosta he'll be fine, he's about to have a 4 year vacation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore she won't win a vote though, she couldnt get over 5% with democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore in less than 12 months probably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desaintpreux @thevivafrei that's true but even after 4 years he was making mistakes. How did Wray get appointed? he needed a few close people he could trust implicitly and cleaned house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgetPhetasy these people still think they are "the resistance" despite having the support of about 95% of the media, big tech social media, hollywood, and the intelligence agencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevivafrei I think Trump underestimated how deep it goes. He should have cleaned house the moment he had power. It was amazing how many obvious enemies were still there deep in the system even after 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck this is going to be the media for the next 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendreyfuss Kamala thinks Joe Biden is a racist and it didn't stop her from being his running mate. She also said she believes his accuser so she also decided to be the running mate for someone she believes is a rapist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantcairns @BotExemplary @robbysoave there's no way Tulsi gets the support from the DNC sure she'd attract more republicans and independents but if you don't have the full force of the DNC machine behind you that counts for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamonLinker @BridgetPhetasy do dictators (even ones cosplaying) insist on states power during an event like a pandemic which would have been the perfect pretence to be authoritarian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BotExemplary @robbysoave nope they aren't part of the DNC establishment and to beat Trump you needed the DNC establishment behind you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizzyRatcliffe @uk_rants @theJeremyVine That you think not a shred of evidence has been produced says a lot. It might not be enough evidence to take to a court but there is a lot of evidence in many parts of the country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@casinooasis14 @StanCollymore Sure if that's the criteria I guess we can investigate Hunter Biden while we're doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey and she was never asked about it during the campaign. Never asked to justify it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that anger you're feeling as you see the media tell you what reality is, hold on to that and channel it towards fighting this huge machine, because it's not going to get any better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamdm @donlemon don't worry they're about to take a 4 year holiday, they'll be fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trancedance87 @randycohen918 @ProjectLincoln how many new wars were started in the past 4 years?? compare that with other presidents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ferdinand3030 @ComfortablySmug If it wasn't it couldn't have worked out any better.   1. It gave the justification for mass mail in voting.  2. It allowed Joe to stay in his bunker and not have to campaign.  3. It allowed the democrats to not have to talk to about the economy or foreign policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawoftheGator @ComfortablySmug It's harder to cheat when you're looking for it. There needs to be an effort for election reform you'd hope there'd be enough on both sides to get something passed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck They won't, but it's much harder to do that now in the digital age. People don't forget, the internet is forever and their hypocrisy will be there for all to see. Not that it'll stop them but they won't get away with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fdr1942 @maggieNYT Joe is a creep. I get it you hate Trump but let's not pretend someone that is constantly inappropriate with young children is a decent person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randycohen918 @ProjectLincoln Why were you following him in the first place? It's not compulsory you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ftblmichaeI @DanKennett I doubt that just saying the media don't decide when elections are over. This isn't news he had 270 yesterday what matters is what happens in the courts and what evidence (if any) can be produced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sammyt60 @StanCollymore Biden is a creep, I get the dislike for Trump but why anyone would support someone that is openly on video being inappropriate with young children on many occasions is beyond me. The guy is a massive creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett It's far from over the media don't decide when it's over. It's still going to go through the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore How very fascist of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore How will they do that exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar Media outlets don't call elections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaefDLF @Danger_Dad_E3 @ScottAdamsSays You understand your statement is not evidence of anything? Why not evaluate the evidence when it is presented on its merits and go from there. Arguing there couldn't have possibly have been fraud because the dems didn't sweep everything is an illogical argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goggs_ @ScottAdamsSays That's not an argument for there being no fraud. You have to look at the evidence whatever it is and judge it on its merits. Saying "well they didn't sweep everything ergo there was no cheating" is not proof of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth was always going to happen, once he's elected they don't need them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks @mattyglesias @jbarro so there is no distinction between a ballot that has been cast legally and one that has not? or is there no such thing as an illegally cast ballot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @icchinisanshi @DEAvanStraaten @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames in terms of very high voter turnout in certain cities and that is grounds for further investigation. But to get hard evidence you need an audit of the actual ballots and that takes time and transparency in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @icchinisanshi @DEAvanStraaten @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames for someone "commited to reason" that's some strange logic. There can't be fraud because the democrats didn't have a blow out. I agree you need hard evidence to take to a court and so far what we've seen is annocdotal evidence, circumstantial evidence and some anomolies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThousandShores @ungerbn103 @mkraju Yes you need evidence but in order to get hard evidence you need to be able to do an audit on the actual ballots. There is more than enough circumstantial evidence to warrant an audit in certain places with anomalies e.g abnormally high turnouts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ungerbn103 @mkraju correct, recounts are pointless really. You need an audit of the actual votes. What good is recounting illegal ballots? you need to see if there are illegal ballots and if you find a significant amount in a sample you scale up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @VGD_SG @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames yeah it's from the atlantic, the same paper that wrote a hit piece full of entirely unnamed sources. Thats about as bias a source as you'd get. Also check out what the media is like in countries with actual dictators (hint: there aren't articles every day criticsing the dictator)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @noremacback @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames I've never seen a President ridiculed more than Trump by the media. You know what would happen to those people in the media in an actual dictatorship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @noremacback @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames you have no evidence to support that and there is plenty of actual evidence of Trump doing things the complete opposite of what a dictator would do. I suggest you do more reading into what actual dictators do and then compare that with the US as a country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames The power they have through the constitution to make decisions with the support of the federal govt. A wannabe dictator would not have done that. An incompetent dictator would have tried to use it to gain total power but maybe would not have been successful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Secul8r @johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames Do you know the definition of dictator? Dictators have or want total power. Something like a global pandemic would be the prefect pretence to try and establish that power if that was what drove you. Trump however acted almost in the opposite way encouraging the states to use...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmusofficial @ConceptualJames He had a pretty good opportunity to be authoritarian with the pandemic, instead he kept saying it was up to the states to make the decisions. Terrible dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConceptualJames Generally speaking, if you're able to insult someone every day without anything negative happening to you they ain't a dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull I think that's definitely something that should be investigated. Has there been any counting error or computer error that went in the favour of the republicans? If they are random errors it should be close to a 50/50 split right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mannsplaining @SocialistMMA @esaagar Probably the same way someone might think they are part of a "resistance" despite having the support of big tech, Hollywood, most news media, the FBI and CIA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbar9 @Rhed_Naytv @Cernovich yup if you wanted Biden you couldn't have planned it better really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisherofmeh reservoir dogs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger you guys moved very quickly to the list phase. Impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rhed_Naytv @Cernovich Without Covid the push for mass mail in voting wouldn't have been justified.   Without Covid Joe would have been forced to get out of his basement   Without Covid the economy and foreign policy would have been bigger issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Tim can you find out how many of these counting errors and computer errors went in the Republicans favour?? If it's error it should be close to a 50/50 share right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuine question has there been any counting error or computer glitch that favoured Trump or the Republican party?? You'd expect these errors to be close to 50/50 right if they are random errors. #USAelection2020 #USElectionResults2020 #USElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarrisOrg Why wouldn't you wait until you see what evidence is presented. You have started from the assumption there couldn't possibly be fraud, why? If they truly believe there has been they have to duty to fight it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamKav @christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain But of course you need hard evidence to take to a court and anecdotes and blurry videos aren't near enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamKav @christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain Yeah I understand that, but if there is enough anecdotal evidence and annomolies like the very high turnout in Milwaukee it justifies an audit of the actual ballots in those areas....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CillizzaCNN We all know you're about to take another 4 year holiday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain There are parts of the country with anomalies, Milwaukee for example had a very high turnout. It wouldn't take long to have an audit in these areas and see if there is a pattern of fraud. If there isn't fine but an audit should happen in certain places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarrisOrg It'd probably look something like MSNBC and CNN for the last 4 years. Have you even been paying attention??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aseitzwald @AndrewBatesNC I guess this is the first step in the whole uniting the country thing they were talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBPundit It's possible a bunch of votes in Georgia get thrown out too. That's going to court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elle__danelle @redsteeze @bdomenech There are a few moderate dems that won't support packing the supreme court. Not all of them are completely crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoSoJade @CHSommers narrative is key in these types of scenarios. The media can control the narrative greater than ever as we saw over the Hunter Biden story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers the question is if evidence is produced will the media cover it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neontaster @kathrynw5 Covid helped Biden in so many ways...  1. Obviously deaths to 100's of thousands is not good 2. It enabled the push for universal mail in voting 3. It gave Biden an excuse to stay in his basement 4. It allowed the dems to ignore issues like the economy and foriegn policy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hdsyyy116 @goodisanoun @esaagar Yeah that had nothing to do with what I said. You have to do an audit of the actual ballots to see if enough of them are illegal ballots to justify looking further. I already said annecdotes are not good enough to goto court with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks @benshapiro if you audit 10,000 and you find enough that have been cast illegally then you can do a deeper dive into a bigger number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks @benshapiro possibly not many but possibly enough to swing races. It shouldn't take long to go into areas where there are maybe annomolies e.g. unusually high turnouts, more votes than registered voters and do an audit of a sample of ballots...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdsyyy116 @goodisanoun @esaagar but to have a proper audit of the actual ballots you need cooperation from both sides and as much transparency as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdsyyy116 @goodisanoun @esaagar not good enough evidence to take to a court but enough for a closer look so ballots can have a proper audit. Without a proper audit of the actually ballots it's very difficult to obtain the sort of evidence you would need to make a good case to a court room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdsyyy116 @goodisanoun @esaagar how do you know they are false claims? it's been 2 days, there is a lot of annecodotal and circumstantial evidence to suggest there is a case to look into certain places e.g. abnormally high turnouts, more votes than registered voters, dead people voting etc..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arlo_Clarke @shipwreckedcrew yes you have to audit ballots in those areas that are suspect. You don't have to audit them all, do a sample of maybe 5,000-10,000 and if a number of them are shown to be illegal you can do a deeper dive, it shouldn't take long but you need to audit them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Yeah feel like they're being extra cautious with him so he gets a good rest and chance to build up his fitness and any knock to fully heal. If it was a final this week i think he'd be able to play but we have to think long term even if it can be frustrating at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just wondering if Russia interfered in this election that saw Biden get more votes than Obama?? or do we just forget about Russia now? #USElectionResults #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules going through the courts is not something a fascist would do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules Trump is the worst fascist ever! Has a pandemic and doesn't use it to seize control, gets smeared by the media every day and doesn't shut it down. Note to Colbert, if you're able to call your president a fascist without consequence they're not a fascist....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776Stonewall if you audit the actual ballots you might find discrepencies there. I agree simply counting the ballots is pointless if a bunch of the ballots are not legal. You have to figure out if there's evidence of a high number of illegal ballots and if there is do a more intensive count.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 you think he might be one that'll be moved on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gjvhvhg @julie_kelly2 Yeah being equated with some of the most evil people in history is a bit of a turn off and tends to make you a little less likely to want to be friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain This is just one example of something pretty concrete but I agree on its own it's not enough but it's enough to warrant an audit of the actual ballots...   https://t.co/peChgIOxN7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain I agree what you have at the moment are isolated anecdotes and maybe circumstantial evidence of things that on their face are a little suspicious but not hard evidence. But to get that you'd need a proper audit of the actual ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain It's been 2 days to get the sort of evidence you'd need in a court would require an audit of the actual ballots in areas where there is a concern. So just because that hasn't been provided yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain They're not the same in terms of chain of custody. You have to request an absentee ballot. Mail in ballots were just sent en masse to the voter rolls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klopsgg @TweetThisBabe @tomfriedman But to get that you'd need an audit of the actual ballots and for that to happen you'd need cooperation and transparency with the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klopsgg @TweetThisBabe @tomfriedman Id say what you have are some discrepancies in certain key areas e.g over 90% turnouts which is very rare, vote counts that exceed registered voters, dead people voting etc... but yes not hard evidence of widespread fraud that you'd need for a court...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalliCapone @williamlegate @FBI he's lying to you, here's the clip. Tucker didn't call for anything and he's criticising the statement made by someone else.    https://t.co/ACuKoDFRLd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Trump team produces hard evidence of fraud will the media cover it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicole_carroll @USATODAY wonder if you covered the Steele dossier??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mizzy_313 @aliprowl @RichardGrenell it probably wouldn't take that long, if you did a full audit on say 5,000 ballots and there was evidence of fraud you ramp up the numbers. It wouldn't take long to see a pattern of fraud if it was there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch @exjon @snarkandboobs why not wait and see what evidence they produce? it's been 2 days, there is annocdotal evidence which i get isn't enough but if you do an audit of ballots in areas with anomolies it wouldn't take long to find or not find evidence of fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicole_carroll @USATODAY if they provide evidence will you cover it? I agree you need evidence but to get the evidence you need an audit of the ballots and for that to happen you need transparency and cooperation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow bingo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of course you need to provide evidence but that takes time and it also requires cooperation in terms of access to the ballots. If you're able to do an audit on the ballots it wouldn't take long to see if there is evidence of fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to all those saying "there is no evidence" it's been 2 days! In order to gather evidence IF it exists you need to be able to perform a full audit of ballots in those areas where there are anomolies and suspicions. #USElection2020 #USElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasie that's not different to what Trump said :/ of course evidence needs to be produced but it's been 1 day and in order to gather evidence of fraud IF it exists you need to be able to do a proper audit of the ballots in those areas with concerns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klopsgg @TweetThisBabe @tomfriedman it's been 1 day. I agree you need to produce hard evidence not just annocdotal evidence, but to get that evidence you need to be able to do a proper audit of ballots in those areas with anomolies, and to be able to do that you need transparency and cooperation from both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zbyronwolf yes evidence needs to be produced, but i remember a political party claiming Russia stole an election without producing much evidence. Why not wait and see what evidence they produce before deciding it's a "conspiracy theory"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kritrgitr3 @wonkytonkman @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain if you start finding a high number of ballots from people that maybe voted more than once, or people that don't live in the area anymore for example that's evidence of fraud, but you need access to the actual ballot to check that and you need transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kritrgitr3 @wonkytonkman @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain it wouldn't take long to see if there is or isn't evidence of fraud if you do a proper audit on the mail in ballots in those areas where there is concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kritrgitr3 @wonkytonkman @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain that's different to being able to audit the ballots in those areas where there are anomolies. You need to check each individual ballot to see if it's legal, just because a ballot has been counted doesn't mean it's a legal ballot especially with large scale mail in balloting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ombudsman4truth right in order to get "hard evidence" if it exists you need access to the ballots so they can be properly audited, you need transparency in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench yes evidence needs to be provided you just can't make claims like this. But in order to gather evidence you need transparency in the process and you need to be able to audit the ballots in areas you think there might be anomolies. The question is will the media look at evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevrcomplicated @15poundstogo he's right though, you need evidence to support these claims otherwise you have nothing. Just saying things "look wrong" is not enough to challenge this in a court. That doesn't mean mass fraud didn't occur but you have to be able to provide hard evidence if you make that claim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandiKruse irregularities in all the key swing states seems like a concerted effort. But of course you need to show actual evidence. The question is if evidence is produced will the media report on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain if there is resistance to one side being able to audit the process properly how are they supposed to gather evidence? wouldn't you want as much transparency as possible when it comes to the process?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain no but 90% turnouts are extremly rare, and more votes than registered voters is very rare so lets check those places with that type of annomoly. To gather evidence you have to be given fair access to the ballots, and be able to observe the counting process etc..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain and it seems like in certain places that isn't being allowed to happen, despite court orders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain now i accept annocdoatal evidence like that is not evidence you can take to a court but why wouldn't you want to wait and see what evidence they do have and then judge it on it's merits?? transparency would be allowing the other side to properly observe the counting process..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain that's absentee ballots, what about the millions of mail in ballots that were sent out? there has already been many annocdotal examples of issues, e.g. dead people voting, people that voted checking the system and it telling them they didn't etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wonkytonkman @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain im not saying you don't need good evidence, of course you need evidence to prove fraud and if it goes through the courts without evidence it'll end pretty quickly. But why not wait and see what evidence they do have and then judge it on it's merits??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wonkytonkman @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain yes, but when you're taking pretty large steps to stop these ballots being looked at so there can be a proper audit it's difficult to do that. I have yet to hear 1 valid argument why you'd go out of your way to prevent as much transparency as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain nobody is saying you don't need evidence of course you need evidence but it seems you've already made up your mind. If evidence is produced will you judge it without bias?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh_58 @MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain yes, it happens all the time. All im saying in those places where there have been abnormalities e.g. over 90% turnout, more votes than registered voters, large dumps of votes exclusively for one candidate why wouldn't you want as much transparency as possible??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverdarcy if it goes to court evidence will have to be provided. The question is if there is evidence will you guys report on it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BAFCTEXASBRANCH @sharonmbowles @StanCollymore why not wait until evidence is produced. It won't go anywhere in the courts with just speculation and anomolies you need hard evidence of corruption, why not wait and see??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BAFCTEXASBRANCH @sharonmbowles @StanCollymore you obviously haven't paid attention to much US politics if you don't understand the DNC is more than capable of it's own corruption. History is littered with examples of it, but in your mind it's impossible there was voter fraud against Trump because you hate him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 it's going to court anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamZComedy @kylenabecker e.g abnormally high turn outs, more votes cast than registered voters, huge dumps for one canididate why wouldn't you want as much transparency in these places as possible, so ballots can be checked??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamZComedy @kylenabecker nobody can give me one good reason why you wouldn't want as much transparency in the process as possible. Why would you go to court to stop the other side being able to observe the process, what valid reason can you give for that? in areas where there might be irregularities...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamZComedy @kylenabecker sure we need to see evidence of corruption and voter fraud but that wasn't the time for a presentation. But I don't understand the reluctance for as much transparency as possible. Surely you want to make sure the process is as transparent as possible....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarciaW54938409 @dottapurple @MeghanMcCain "no illegal ballots" how do you know that? seriously what evidence do you have for that claim. Of course the Trump team have to produce evidence that there was fraud but you cannot state with any certainty there were no illegal ballots anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BAFCTEXASBRANCH @StanCollymore nice argument. Seriously what is wrong with transparency. Ask yourself why democrats are going to court to try and stop transparency. Can you give me one good reason why you wouldn't want as much transparency as possible??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonmbowles @StanCollymore you need to realise neither the DNC or RNC are whiter than white and there is plenty of historical examples of voter fraud in democratic states. Why not wait until the evidence is presented before deciding there was no fraud?? there have already been many annocodotal examples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonmbowles @StanCollymore the process should be as transparent as possible if one side is trying to make it less transparent you need to ask yourself for what valid reason that can be argued? You've already decided there was no corruption based on nothing but your dislike of Trump....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore why wouldn't you want to wait until the evidence or not is out there? It's possible there was corruption but you've already decided there wasn't based on nothing but your dislike of Trump. I wonder what your take would be if Biden was winning and 140,000 votes dropped for Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @LindseyGrahamSC He's drafting a really strongly worded letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast The only logical reason for not wanting the process to be as transparent as possible is you have something to hide. There is no valid argument for less transparency in this scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze There is no logical reason to try and block republicans from monitoring the process and having a full audit of ballots in those areas which are suspicious. Transparency should be the #1 goal in any election. There's no valid argument against that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze He highlighted the problem with universal mail in voting. He wasn't the only one. Maybe he was right, that's a possibility you know. There needs to be as much transparency over the process otherwise the only logical conclusion is they're worried about what will be found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarrisOrg How do you know this is a waste of time? What evidence do you have? Should illegal ballots be Counted? Should dead people be able to vote. Why not wait until the evidence has been presented??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV There is no logical explanation for doing that unless you're worried about what they'll find. I'd love to hear any sort of argument that is arguing for less transparency in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Kind of like what logical reason could you have for pushing to allow votes with no post mark. The only logical answer is they're hiding something they don't want you to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beaueva_ @TalonZahn @DavieC726 @jeneps @jomalleydillon Do you think illegal votes should be counted? Do you think dead people should be able to vote? If there is evidence of anything illegal it needs to be investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommodoreBTC @julie_kelly2 I think you'll get some moderate democrats voting against something like court packing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar Reaction to a possible Biden Presidency and the money printers going into overdrive!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast it's also about analysing the ballots that have been counted to make sure they are legal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 georgia will go to court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 agree to some extent but they value their jobs ($) above all and something like supporting expanding the supreme court would be the fastest way to losing that. I don't see any republicans supporting that for example and there are probably a few moderate dems that wouldnt either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett its been like this for the last 6-8 months. Riots and protests on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aertherks @NickJFuentes Georgia is going to be contested anyway, expect the dems to lose some votes when that happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore if we're just pulling money out of thin air lets do it forever!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC 1hr ago you had a show talking about how Ole is safe till xmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pwafork it is odd. Trumps vote went up over 5 million I think. But i do find it strange that a candidate that seemed to generate very little enthusiasm has a record vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast When you think about the Coronavirus helped Biden in so many ways...  1. It allowed there to be a push for universal mail in voting 2. It allowed him to stay out of the spotlight 3. It allowed the dems to not have to talk about the economy or foriegn policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT need to act before PSG do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker @RAMRANTS the actual election interference we've seen from certain media outlets as well as Twitter, Facebook and Google dwarfs, even the most extreme claims of the Russian hoaxers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker @RAMRANTS if you actually took the time to sit back and understand what has happened it would probably make you incredibly scared. The media and social media platforms have basically acted as part of a presedential campaign and have been able to protect their candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker @RAMRANTS yup after they completely killed the Hunter Biden story I knew something like this would happen. When you have most of the media covering for your misdeads you can get away with a lot and have very little chance of being held accountable for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_z4ppy @borttaylor @CassandraRules so you (not literally you but your side) call millions of people Nazis, racists and white supremacists for 4 years and now you want to make nice? Don't be surprised if many aren't in the mood to be friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 @FoxNews His show is always posted on YouTube. I think there'll be a lot that don't watch fox anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamMcGuire90 @Trevski_LFC It could be as simple as telling Bobby when he plays to play further up the pitch and be in the middle of the goal more when we attack. Hopefully he'll see this as a challenge and we'll see the best of him cos he's still a great player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Real sliding doors moment for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Ole has this knack of getting a few good results just when he needs them to keep the pressure off him. Everton usually lay down for Utd but with Ancelloti that won't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden When you've been called a Nazi &amp; racist for 4 years it's kind of difficult to just let that go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gjvhvhg @julie_kelly2 Mate have someone call you a Nazi and white supremacist for 4 years and then ask you to be civil. It's not going to happen. When you call half of the country Nazis they won't forget that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 Sure we called you Nazis and white supremacists for 4 years but now we wanna be friends! Yeah not going to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@criticallearner @secupp @GaryRiger Oh god you still believe that bullshit? It takes about 1min to watch the full clip where he says very clearly "And I'm NOT talking about the neo Nazis and white supremacists" you've been lied to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp Yeah that's not going to happen. You don't call millions of people basically Nazis and white supremacists for 4 years and then try to make nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, despite this record vote he's probably going to squeak past 270 and the democrats won't take the Senate. It makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV They're going to lose so many viewers. I feel for someone like Tucker that's basically been a lone voice over there for months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no way Joe Biden managed to get more votes than any other presidential candidate. His campaign was so lacklustre and there was no enthusiasm for him yet we're supposed to believe he got this record vote??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 Even the weak republicans won't support packing the court and I'm sure a few moderate democrats won't support that either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny Added in the early hours too. If it's not it has the appearance of something dodgy. Why add those votes in the early hours when you've already said you've stopped for the day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmwinther @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump sure 80% isn't 100%  https://t.co/gRN6fdBpWY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keebee17 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Biden's total goes up by almost 140,00 Trumps doesn't move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keebee17 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/dvxwcR5RsX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewKerrNC if there's evidence of voter fraud then it's not an excuse. Why not wait and see the evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump but when you get almost 140,000 votes and 100% are for one candidate that statistically just isn't possible even in very strong Biden areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RanttMedia so almost 140,000 ballots 100% of which go to one candidate is legit?? maybe in China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers @Yascha_Mounk i'm not sure how anyone can have watched what we'e witnessed from the media and big tech and be relaxed about it. They've basically acted as if they are part of one sides campaign. This isn't tough but fair journlism this is a direct attempt to influence an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PetiteNicoco very possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke is it possible it becomes a problem before January?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke And Durham needs to drop something before January so they can't make it dissapear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PradhanArv @cursedIatina @savstorme @waitng4thtdance @seanmdav the only way it's possible is if they grouped all the Biden votes together but i'm not sure why they'd do that. (Well i can think of one reason but it wouldn't be legal)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffonSprouts @sgtvandoodle @seanmdav you don't understand probability then if you think its "very likely" that out of a sample of almost 140,000, 100% of them are for the same person. Even where Biden is strongest he's getting maybe 80%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@savstorme @waitng4thtdance @seanmdav even in those areas where Biden is the strongest you're talking 80/20 so to have 140,000 votes and all of them to be for one person just isn't statistically possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonluvsmaddy @GrantNeubauer @JakeSherman @dccc :/ yeah good luck with that. If you want to mobolise the right like you've never seen before try that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EpicPopsicle65 @jtsurff35 @sgtvandoodle @seanmdav im sure you wouldnt be suspicious if 140,000 turned up all for Trump right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valdark2 @MargaretIva972 @MattWalshBlog mail in is different to absentee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtsurff35 @sgtvandoodle @seanmdav yeah unless theres only 1 candidate nobody gets 100% of the vote in a sample of 140,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgtvandoodle @seanmdav maybe in Russia that sort of thing might happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgtvandoodle @seanmdav what are the odds you count almost 140,000 ballots and 100% of them are for the same person??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waitng4thtdance @seanmdav and 100% of them were for Biden out of almost 140,000 seriously?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott it's difficult to get any of this done with a Republican senate though. Court packing for example would not be possible as im sure there are a few moderarte democrats that couldn't support it. The more they push when they clearly don't have a mandate the worse it'll be in 2022..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhinsTweets @tomselliott or Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StateofusAll in a way it's worse because they're pretending to be a voice for conservatives while several of their people are acticely trying to undermine a republican president. At least with CNN and MSNBC they don't hide their left bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport pretty much yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore the US / UK relationship is bigger than any individual. But Biden has always been a globalist and he's been part of the system for almost 50 years so yeah he probably likes the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantNeubauer @JakeSherman @dccc Trump will run again in 2024<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quintus74689745 @TimAlberta both sides think a coup happened, both sides probably have legitimate reason for thinking that. The loser is everyone. Politics is toxic and it's not getting any better anytime soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he also looked really angry because he knows once the narrative is set that he's lost, which the media will parrot incessantly it's very difficult to overcome that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen again to what Trump said a few hours ago, at a time when it was looking positive for him. He knew exactly what was going to happen he even mentioned "finding 140,000 votes at 4am" #Trump2020 #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@towntro @carolyn86452721 @FoxNews yup, they don't speak for most conservatives at this point. Except for a couple of individuals that are the exception there. They deserve a fast death for what they did. Trump was battling 95% of the media and the big conservative outlet didn't support him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadJockey @darknight307 @Timcast they might try that but it doesn't tend to happen with ex presidents.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReginaldPGrant @neontaster then they lose a tonne of seats in the midterms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 I don't see Trump going quietly if he genuinly thinks its been stolen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foundationif @MattWalshBlog yeah that was their only attack really, they didn't have to touch the economy or foreign policy. It also allowed Joe to stay hidden for a huge amount of time which only benefited him. If China wanted Biden they couldn't have planned it any better 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Trump was fighting a media that was basically part of the Biden campaign. We all know how influential the media is it's a huge obstacle to overcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MargaretIva972 @MattWalshBlog you can vote absentee ballot and there is a well established process to make that a much better system, less prone to fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeywakey16 It now looks like Biden is in the hot seat and its much easier criticising than being the person and party responsible. We know it's going to be a disaster and that only wakes up more and more people. I wouldn't be surprised to see Trump run again in 2024 should Biden win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeywakey16 he also knew the media were basically campaigning for him. As well as social media. It's a huge story that probably is never going to be fully understood but the problem with this type of sabotage is freedom always finds a way and maybe it'll take 4 years maybe longer but it will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MortChristenson @AGHamilton29 we'll see I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darknight307 @Timcast the Senate which is looking likely. Biden really isn't an impressive person, he inspires no passion from anyone. He's a globalist that's been part of the swamp for almost 50 years. I can honestly see Trump running again in 2024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darknight307 @Timcast yup, the country is divided more than ever, this is just going to make it worse. Politics is so toxic right now, there is no working together for the greater good, no compromise. The left won't be happy with Biden cos he won't be able to get anything substantial done if R's hold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast but what happens after that? We know the media will do Biden's job for him but we also know Trump isn't someone that will just go away quietly if he thinks it's been stolen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark Trump has had basically 95% of the media actively working against him, it's one thing to be hard but fair but they have basically been campaigning for Biden. Should Biden squeak over the line they've probably killed the goose that laid the golden egg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottCIarke @LFC @Thiago6 this will be a popular question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasHOOPER4 @mfoxhunter @Timcast he'll be basically the same age Biden is now won't he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MortChristenson @AGHamilton29 which is a lot, given the current climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mfoxhunter @Timcast if Biden squeaks over the line I can see Trump starting a rival conservative media company. I can also see him running again in 2024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke yup they threw everything they had at him and at best Biden is going to squeak over the line. I can seriously see 4 years of disaster under Biden and Trump running again in 2024. He might even start a media company to rival Fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiverpoolLinda @northcoastblog @HotlineJosh the country has been split between conservative and liberal for a long time, its always going to be close in terms of the makeup of the country. Biden is a terrible candidate too, basically a globalist career politican that's been part of the system for almost50 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northcoastblog @HotlineJosh you should, you have one of the most devisive presidents every, a pandemic that hit months out from an election and the full force of 90% of the media supporting you and you might crawl over the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan yup top quality player, a midfield of Thiago, Henderson and Wijnaldum is a very good midfield. (assuming Fabinho plays more as a CB this season)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so Trump 2024 then? to save us all from socialism? #Election2020 #Trump2020 #trump2024<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEricCarmen @boogaloo_miss @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson they deserve to go the way of CNN and MSNBC after this. They don't speak for Conservatives at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck whoever is president after this, you're going to have 50% of the country thinking it was stolen. Politics is so toxic at the moment there is no compromise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjhasson They'll spin it like 2016 and tell us that actually their models were very accurate. The entire industry should just disappear it serves no useful purpose at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarrisOrg Also votes cast AFTER the polls close or with no post mark should not be counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarrisOrg Nobody is saying don't count every legal vote but you can call races before every vote is counted when the maths doesn't work anymore and a few states were getting very close to that point when they stopped counting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveyD99 @mkraju @PamelaBrownCNN Races are called all the time before every vote is counted. When the math just doesn't work you can call a race before all the votes are counted. Trump was basically at that point in a few states and they stopped counting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders @Coded_omoluabi As long as ballots not post marked at all aren't counted I agree every legal vote should be counted. But you can call states before every vote is counted when the maths just doesn't add up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsInkPanther @BenjaminHeds @benshapiro Imagine if these numbers were reversed and Trump was claiming he's going to win these states.  https://t.co/dkGIF5EuS4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hcesd @ZekeJMiller Trump said he may lose it but they called it too early. They can be technically right but still have called it early. No one else called it when Fox did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dystopiandy @paulsperry_ You can still call a race when not all the votes have been counted if one of the candidates has a lead which is mathematically impossible to overturn. We're close to that scenario in a few states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GainsGod420 @NuanceBro The numbers aren't there. We know how much of these states have reported. The maths just doesn't add up for Biden unless they mysteriously find 10s of thousands of votes. (Which might happen)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mckaycoppins @JonahDispatch Biden did something similar with much less legitimacy than Trump. That's more irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro Is it close though? Seems like Trump was on the verge of winning and they stopped counting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite It'll goto the supreme court most likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wtfisupbro @Lawandsportsguy @AdamInHTownTX @benshapiro @BridgetPhetasy The numbers just aren't there in Georgia even best case scenario for Biden he gets maybe 80,000 but he's behind almost 120,000 and that's best case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsInkPanther @BenjaminHeds @benshapiro Trump said "as far as I'm concerned we've already won" and he's right, if they hadn't stopped counting he was about to win. The numbers just aren't there in states like Georgia even if you use a best case scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch Biden said it looked like they were going to win when that's just not true. The numbers just aren't there unless something dodgy happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch Why stop the count when he's on the verge of winning??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Why stop counting when he's basically on the verge of winning??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminHeds @benshapiro Your candidate said he was looking good for a win when that's not true. Sure Trump hasn't won yet but he has a much more valid claim to victory than Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch @rhyswilliams01 He's gonna put on a couple of stone next preseason and be a monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathMayo Those pesky irksome things like taking away your 2A rights, supporting late term abortions, increasing your taxes and packing the supreme court with liberal judges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadfelixg And taking your guns, increasing your taxes, packing the supreme court and supporting late term abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricNeudel @brianstelter @oliverdarcy @ReliableSources lol ok enough said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricNeudel @brianstelter @oliverdarcy @ReliableSources let me guess you think CNN and MSNBC are fair and balanced news networks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twincessmama6 @DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr yeah that was after months had passed without anything being agreed. I agree both sides are responsible for compromising and coming up with something they could both agree with. But politics is so toxic at the moment nobody wants to give the other side a "win" meanwhile we lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr i've looked into it, and voter fraud is a potential problem when you have more mail in votes than ever before. It doesn't take many votes to swing some of these races. Everyone should want a fair election where every legal vote is counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prince77Lala whatever happens the sun will rise tomorrow and life will go on. All you can do is keep fighting for what you believe in, and love and look after the people in your own little community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cappeye @DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr im talking about rioting and looting not terorist violence. You've seen what's been happening the last 6 months right? that's why windows are being boarded up. That has been mostly the left (unless you think BLM protesters are mostly on the right?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twincessmama6 @DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr and they couldn't agree on a package. You can blame both sides for that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twincessmama6 @DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr wanting only legal votes to be counted is not stopping votes being counted. I'm sure you don't want laws in place that almost encourages voter fraud do you?   also it's not up to Trump to deliver a stimulus package that is up to Pelosi and her Republican opposite to agree upon...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta will a Biden administration pull the wall down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr i wish you well too, but to be factual there are people on the left that have signalled they won't accept a Trump win. I could send you a bunch of links but it probably won't matter. Have a good day and nice talking to you. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hahaharmon @esaagar depends on who writes the history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prince77Lala its political Stockholm Syndrome. They would rather feel safe in the "old system" even though deep down most people know its a corrupt system, than feel uneasy with someone that acts in a way no President has ever before. It's all they have ever known and it makes them feel safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr I get it, you hate Trump and that is clouding everything else, but the left is far from innocent in how America is right now. I could show you comments from Pelosi, Hilary and Biden's team about not accepting the result and it doesn't matter to you because you've already decided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr lol yeah that's because the left is threatening violence in DC if he wins. Trump voters don't tend to riot and loot. (some might but the vast majority are on the left). And all he said is he wants a fair election. I've seen comments from both sides about not accepting the results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar hard years of a Biden Presidency, Trump runs again and wins in 2024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar And exposing the media for the partisan hacks they are (on both sides). Do you think if Biden wins we go back to "normal" or has Trump smashed normal for good? I guess it depends what comes after Trump for the RNC. I still wouldn't be surprised to see Biden win and after 4....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray i fear you're underestimating the levels of corruption we're dealing with. We've had a glimpse of it but really they're not even hiding it at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr a return to "normal" is a return to the system that most of us realise is a broken, corrupt, immoral system. But it's all we have ever known and there is comfort in that familairity when compared to someone like Trump that doesn't act like any President we've ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleLovell7 @Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr he's not started any news wars and at least talks about talking to enemies not fighting them unless you have no other option. Biden is a creature of DC he will surround himself with those people that have been there for decades behind the curtain...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spencer_MOOD @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr probably not, but it'll go back to the way it was, which for lots of people is a comforting thought, but the reality is the way it was is a corrupt system, supported by mindless wars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eduardo_dudu2 @OOdegbesan @WinWithJMC @WillieGeist @GOP they haven't thought that far ahead. They just want power, forever whatever the cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OOdegbesan @WinWithJMC @WillieGeist @GOP yay one party state!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComfortablySmug we missed a trick simply not playing this on a loop for 4 years. It would be a landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott the Hunter Biden story is by far the biggest because of the coordinated effort by traditional media, social media and a politcial party to suppress a newsworthy story. I fear this is the start of something we will see more of in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec part of me thinks that most people weren't ready for Trump and a break from the ways things have always been done and they prefer that familiarity even if its a system that is broken and corrupt it still feels safe to them because it's all they have known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec what do you think happens if it doesn't go our way today? I have this nagging feeling that all this media manipulation and deep state attacks against Trump is going to work. He's been under attack like no President i've ever seen before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to all my conservative friends stressing about the result today, I understand, but remember sometimes it needs to get really dark before people understand what's happening and maybe it'll take 4 years of Joe for that to happen. But ultimately freedom always wins. #USElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc so it's not Russian disinformation now?? ok now you've moved onto the next step take a look at EVERYTHING that's on that laptop and not just the one or 2 messages between Joe and Hunter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>voting for a restriction in the 2A, late term abortions, higher taxes and stacking the supreme court to own Trump. If you support those things you are not a conservative whatever you might want to call yourself. #USElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp @JoeBiden so you're voting for someone that has openly stated he'll take your guns, supports late term abortion, will increase your taxes and will probably stack the supreme court to solidify power. Some conservative you are!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johniadarola @morninggloria Body shaming is fine when we do it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGoknicks @fredwardgibings @esaagar Oh and he's probably going to increase your taxes. Any "conservative" that can support that isn't a conservative or they're very stupid and have been duped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredwardgibings @GGoknicks @esaagar Would a conservative vote for someone that openly talks about taking your guns? Is pro abortion and is probably gonna to pack the supreme court?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Shouldn't he be asked "hard questions" before he becomes President or is that too much to ask??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithELaughlin @TimAlberta Yay one party state!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays They'll blame Russia again and say he cheated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveKrak @chrislhayes  https://t.co/DnzgO02bN1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes why are you wrong about almost everything? there was a video that we could all watch.  https://t.co/xfJYoAqndG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjkusaf @DaleTL @RichardGrenell @JoshShapiroPA the key is "legal vote"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxBoot If Biden does win I hope you'll be prepared to admit you were wrong if his presidency goes as I expect it will. I think you're too far gone to admit you could be wrong, but people won't forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanDeanWright it's interesting how so many are more comfortable with the establishment because it's all they've known, and even though they know its a corrupt system they'd prefer that to something new because they are afraid of something different....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaleTL @RichardGrenell @JoshShapiroPA How can he say who will win or lose before the votes are counted? Nobody is against every legal vote being counted but the AG is saying the result is already decided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximiliankratz @TimRunsHisMouth @HillaryClinton and then spent the next 4 years saying she only lost cos of Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mxgicmo i think Spurs are being told to do this sort of thing. And with VAR giving really soft penalties if there's any sort of contact you can't really blame them. Look at the one Rashford got the other week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mxgicmo that Son one is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afcPat415 @johncrossmirror @OllieHolt22 If you aren't getting penalties because you've tried to stay on your feet what else are you supposed to do? I'm not sure why Salah has been singled out here in a week when we've seen much softer penalties given. But i guess he's not England's golden boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBruce96454761 @MarshallCohen @TrinityMustache the FBI and CIA are not your friends. I remember when the left was rightly very suspicious of the intelligence agencies, now they have people like Brennan and Clapper who lied under oath as CNN experts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallCohen yes we know the FBI is part of the swamp, thanks for reminding us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zachary_Cohen could you be more patronising?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>some people are more comfortable in a system that is deeply corrupt and wrong because it feels "normal" it is all they have known and they feel comfortable in that familiarity even if they understand it is a deeply unpleasant system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @Kwaku_TVB with 5 subs maybe start with Robbo since it's going to be a tough game and Tsimikas is just coming back. Maybe give Robbo 60.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mg81992 @joshtpm yeah Biden won't be running anything if he becomes President. It's pretty clear who holds the power in the democrat party at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm if you can't see the problems with Biden and the left in general, you're just a blind fool or being willfully ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marie936 @BreitbartNews It's amazing how people will so willingly drop any moral beliefs they have because someone on their "team" is involved. You would not dismiss this type of behavior from anyone you didn't like why is it different from someone you do like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop think he was training by himself since the Everton game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@masonscott_1 @JamesPearceLFC He's a good option for teams like West Ham that will sit back and be direct because he's a monster in the air, but a team like City play quick 1-2's and use good movement and in that type of game i think he'd struggle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breaking911 CC: @ddale8 wanna fact check this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 has Trump called White Supremacists "very fine people"? has Trump never denounced white supremacy? did Trump call soldiers "losers" these are all claims made by Biden in the last few weeks, have you fact checked any of them??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCMbM @DanKennett when we get Thiago, Keita, Fabinho, back we still have a tonne of quality in the midfield area and lots of options for the front 3. As we saw against Villa that high line playing offside has its problems too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCMbM @DanKennett I just think we're going to play a slightly different way but that doesn't mean it can't be as effective. A little deeper defensive line but with Thiago in the team hopefully we can win games through midfield control and brilliance from the front 3....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett With Thiago and Henderson in particular giving us that control and relying on moments from the front 3 and the creativity of Thiago and the fullbacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett It's possible Thiago could help with a few of those issues. Especially since he's a part of the puzzle we didn't have last season so he should add things that weren't there last season. Maybe we'll become a bit more pragmatic looking to control the game through the midfield...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreasIsaksso1 @DanKennett Remember if we get to January in decent shape we can sign a CB. Not that I expect us to deviate from the long term plans but CB must have been a position we've been looking to strengthen and maybe we'll push that deal forward 6 months??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom Gonna say Phillips, was a monster in the air and hardly put a foot wrong. Jota was superb too when he came on and Henderson and Gini worked very hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maxi_1892 Would have hoped to see him on the bench but if he's 75% fit probably not worth the risk given our current injury state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldEdition @JamesPearceLFC Matip is basically dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErlendSognli @CLakers91 @DaveOCKOP Can only be that Phillips has more experience but I think it's harsh on Williams whose done well in the couple of games he's played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meiselasb @Meidas_Staci You do realise there are photos from the same event. You're making Alex Jones sound sane, get help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericcervini Busted. You're the one trying to push the black truck off the road.   https://t.co/RDAfYWpxKm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Once again Jake is wrong. Look at whose trying to push who off the road. (Clue the black truck is in his lane)   https://t.co/RDAfYWpxKm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper You'll highlight this based on 1 (biased) person account but you won't mention Toby Bobulinski once. It's clear you're basically part of the Biden campaign at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaliforniaPanda @CNN Some news for your little newsletter @brianstelter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyglesias Everyone is so politicised at the moment you can't trust anybody to be "fair". They are all looking out for their own team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigStrongGeek @LordSMacharius @Malcolm_fleX48 "He was asking for it"  "She shouldn't have been drunk or wearing a short skirt"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke The frustrating thing is nobody asks a follow up even something as simple as "are you saying the emails and photos are fake".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BayesianLeif @IMHO1969 @brhodes Do tell us what the emails actually mean o wise one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan I'm excited to see Thiago, I hope he plays. Like Alonso he's one of those players that makes you feel safe when they're in the team plus he's just a joy to watch for any fan of football. You get the impression he steps into the pitch thinking he owns it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikyto_ @AnfieldWatch Id just trust Williams though he's been fine so far and if Thiago plays I'd expect more midfield control than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikyto_ @AnfieldWatch Think he could play left of a 3 but you lose so much from him going forward I'm not sure why you'd do it. Plus I'm not sure who you'd play as a left wingback in that formation, Milner maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC Even if someone asks him any of those questions he just refuses to answer and the journalist just let's it go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevW1962 @RaheemKassam agree to some degree but imagine what video, photos, emails a foreign country might have on him and then imagibe how that could be used to control Joe Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rainman_I_Am @Made_In_Japan76 @literally_putin @SurlyBull @redsteeze What do you think that story says?? have you read it? you do understand it's not talking about the laptop? you do understand it's not talking about Tony Bobulinski? you do understand it doesn't even debunk the actual information provided in the dossier its talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlapjackFpl @wak_bast @Liddellpool there's rumours but nothing solid. He had his achilles stepped on at the end of the CL game and was limping. He'll probably play if it's just bruising but he might not be risked given the circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wak_bast @Liddellpool i'd go Henderson, Thiago, Wijnaldum for this game. Especiall if Salah is injured you don't want to overload the front positions we'll need some on the bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieZipperer @realredbault7t1 they didn't even debunk the contents of the dossier they are talking about. All they did was show the author was using a pseudonym and a fake photo, they didn't disprove any of the contents of what they were sharing and in fact probably got a lot of people to look at the info..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool would be huge. He's our most important player now with the VVD injury becasue he allows us to control the midfield to an elite level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksenijapavlovic Tony Bobulinski. I've already seen Maddow commenting on it, so expect her to breathlessly amplify it and promote it as if it debunks the whole Hunter Biden story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksenijapavlovic that confirmation bias takes over from reason and logic and actually reading the story. They'll simply link it in response to anything relating to the Hunter Biden story. It'll be interesting to see what media outlets amplify this story while completely ignoring the laptop and ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksenijapavlovic The good news is i'm seeing lots of people that understand this and are calling it out for what it is. I do think it's aimed more at those on the left though trying to give them the impression the Hunter Biden story has been debunked and because they really want to believe this..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PazuzuPetals @attornatus @Cernovich It's simply showing that they used a fake name and fake photos. But they don't tackle any of the information in that dossier. It's purpose is to make people think the laptop has been debunked when the article isn't even about the laptop or Tony Bobulinski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PazuzuPetals @attornatus @Cernovich That's proof that one person talked about it. But I hadn't seen anyone on my tl talk about it and I follow many on the right. But the bigger point is it's not debunking the laptop, it's not debunking Tony Bobulinski, it's not even debunking the actual contents of the dossier...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polyfurcation @Cernovich But it's main purpose is to try and trick people on the left that there's nothing in the Hunter Biden story and they'll have liberal media helping them to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polyfurcation @Cernovich The funny part is the story doesn't even debunk the dossier they're talking about. Nowhere do they debunk the information it provides, all they do is show it was written under a pseudonym with a fake photo :/ hardly a shock given its nature....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polyfurcation @Cernovich They released a story "debunking" some dossier on Hunter that hardly anyone was talking about to try and fool idiots into thinking they were talking about the laptop story so when someone mentions it they'll link that article and say it's been debunked...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Because the media have shown themselves to be basically part of the DNC at this point as have Twitter and Facebook. The censoring of this story is probably a bigger story than the story itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rainman_I_Am @SurlyBull @redsteeze It is designed for simpletons like you to read and think they're debunking the Hunter Biden laptop story when it's not even about the Hunter Biden laptop. Looks like it's working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rainman_I_Am @SurlyBull @redsteeze You do realise that has nothing to do with the laptop or the information from Tony Bobulinski right?? Also that article doesn't even address the information in the "dossier" just that it used a fake name and fake photos...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezerttitan @CassandraRules And the fact this doesn't even debunk the contents of the dossier and the claims it makes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules They didn't even debunk it. They don't address the actual contents of the "dossier" just that it used fake names / photos which isn't that surprising given its nature. Lots of the contents are actually supported by other evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyAis @loganclarkhall @Lifeblood_6 It is a story designed to make you think they're talking about the laptop story though which lets you know the type of duplicitous media we're dealing with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyAis @loganclarkhall @Lifeblood_6 Nope. It's about a dossier I'd not heard of before and nobody on my tl was talking about. The article doesn't even debunk any of the details of the dossier just that the authors name isn't real and the photo is a computer generated image :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revmagdalen @MontyBoa99 @VadaVotes @TuckerCarlson What does this have to do with the laptop or the information from Tony Bobulinski??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontyBoa99 @TuckerCarlson Dossier it is talking about. All it's saying is the name attributed to it isn't a real person. But it's not unusual for information like this to be given anonymously. But it's nothing to do with the laptop but I guess it's working since you think it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontyBoa99 @TuckerCarlson Yeah what does that have to do with the laptop? Or Tony Bobulinski? Nobody was talking about that dossier that story is designed to make you think the Hunter Biden laptop story has been debunked when it's not even about the laptop. The story also doesn't debunk one fact in the...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcgT @tshell @ChrisChambie @justinhendrix Evidence of this? Are they his photos/videos??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonCoryell3 @justinhendrix You do realise this has nothing to do with what Tucker has been talking about? It's designed to make you think it is so I guess it worked. But read the article, it's about a dossier I've not seen anyone talk about NOT the laptop or Tony Bobulinski information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_jayne8 @seanmdav @BaldingsWorld You didn't read it did you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomassOHOK @Surabees @DonaldJTrumpJr You didn't read the article did you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeBernaerts @Surabees @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah you do realise that has nothing to do with the laptop or the information from Tony Bobulinski right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebbieSVA @Surabees @DonaldJTrumpJr You didn't read it did you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesKosur You didn't read the article did you?? This has nothing to do with the laptop or the emails from his business partner or Tony Bobulinski. Nice try though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissieRuff @Surabees @DonaldJTrumpJr You didn't read the article did you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auggiecat1 @AdamSerwer @chrislhayes Whose had the ability to live freely taken from them??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLeadCNN @ArletteSaenz Gonna cover the fact there's an active investigation open on Hunter Biden and has been since 2019??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auggiecat1 @AdamSerwer @chrislhayes But posts like this just confirm what I've seen for the last 4 years. Lots of people on the left do think they are morally superior to those on the right. It's not just a difference in ideology anymore they genuibky believe conservatives want to do people harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auggiecat1 @AdamSerwer @chrislhayes Spoken like someone that lives in a bubble. Conservatives have plenty of reasons to be worried about a Biden Presidency. Maybe they're worried more about the people controlling Biden than Biden himself but suggest "nothing bad" will happen just shows your ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WintonCapPtnrs @willchamberlain Also lucky the person asking the question immediately backs down and let's them get away with such an arrogant response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain The media let's them get away with it so they'll keep doing it. It was the same with the court packing question now this. The media's response to the Hunter Biden story is a bigger story than the Hunter Biden story. (And the Hunter Biden story should be huge)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum I bet this sounded clever when you were going over it in your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum Lol "I don't think it's a coincidence that this group of men I grouped together myself contains no women." (Spoiler: the federalist has many female writers)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xeljawn @edburmila he doesn't need to read it, he's already decided it's full of "false things"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edburmila @DavidAstinWalsh "publish false things" what was false in what he was going to publish??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWebbLFC @RobCadenceTD I'd play Williams but it would be a concern if Antonio is fit with his physicality. But he's looked good when he's played and the benefit of an inexperienced player coming in is they focus on the basics so he's not going to try and do anything crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericowensdc @ggreenwald @NoahCRothman CNN, MSNBC, ABC haven't even mentioned Tony Bobulinski. If that doesn't bother you as a journalist I don't know what will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sjeet98647746 @COYG_Sibusiso @PatrickTimmons1 yeah pretty much the whole game. Leipzig had all the possession and most of the attacking threat until it went 2-0 then they fell apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamhousley Even when it involves corruption at the highest level. It should be the death nail for CNN and MSNBC but I doubt it will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamhousley They had some sort of excuse with the laptop (even though it was a terrible excuse) but for CNN, MSNBC etc.. not to mention Bobulinski once in the past few days is a huge story in itself. It's basically confirmation that certain media will cover for a political party...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamhousley It's becoming a bigger story than the Biden story which is probably one of the biggest political scandals ever. But the failure of most of the media to even talk about Tony Bobulinski is scandalous....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnhpage @ksenijapavlovic @JoeBiden The letter was also connected to China not Russia by the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnhpage @ksenijapavlovic @JoeBiden So now you're taking Putin's word as gospel 😂 you can't make this shit up. One minute Putin is spreading disinformation but when it's something you want to believe you trust him!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sjeet98647746 @COYG_Sibusiso @PatrickTimmons1 Just don't pretend Ole is some front foot attacking coach. I think he'd like to be but at the moment all your good wins come when you sit back and counter. Utd struggle when they have to force the play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sjeet98647746 @COYG_Sibusiso @PatrickTimmons1 I watched the game mate, both teams sat back and wanted to play on the counter. Even yesterday's game Utd were setup to contain and until the 2nd goal they were being dominated in terms of possession and forcing the play. It's a perfectly valid way to play...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sjeet98647746 @COYG_Sibusiso @PatrickTimmons1 You were both pretty defensive, Utd looked the more likely in the last 20 but before then it was pretty dire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sjeet98647746 @COYG_Sibusiso @PatrickTimmons1 Utd sit back too, lets not pretend Ole plays this expansive football. Look what happened v Chelsea, 2 teams playing for a draw, it'll be similar against Arsenal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum Nobody cares Joe is allowed to do his own thing and his numbers speak for themselves. He's kicking your ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV As social media platforms to try and suppress this is as big a scandal as I can think of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV Because they want him to win and that means covering up his corruption until after the election. It's one of the biggest stories I can remember when you actually sit back and think about it. The Biden stuff alone is a huge story, but the actions of most news outlets as well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSZaidEsq @ChuckRossDC @AndrewKerrNC No matter where they come from if they are genuine that cannot be disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSZaidEsq @ChuckRossDC @AndrewKerrNC Disinformation by it's very definition means something that isn't true that is meant to mislead. If the emails, texts, photos etc.. are authentic how can that be disinformation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaesarSalodin @Macro__Business @two_plus_twins @kyledcheney The case has been dropped in case you hadn't noticed. The judge can't be the judge and prosecution. If Sullivan continues to put off what he should do he'll get a pardon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>gonna fact check this? @jack @ddale8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kirk4Defiance @EliLake @jack @nypost the claims of Tony Bobulinski are not connected to the laptop. His evidence is seperate of that and so that destroys that talking point that you can't report on it because of the provenence of the laptop. The only question that matters is whether the information is true or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kirk4Defiance @EliLake @jack @nypost Even if that story isn't accurate (it still has more evidence supporting it than any other theory) the key question is whether the contents of the hard drive are real or not. If they are real where it came from is almost irrelevant. Also...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Airyaman67 @Calibamawife @redsteeze That goes the other way too. Lots of people trying to ignore him because they want to protect Biden. Confirmation bias works both ways but he's produced much more evidence than anyone saying this is Russian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverdarcy @BretBaier Obama lied several times during his little speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett Those teams not in Europe or in the Europa have an edge in terms of being able to get decent rest. Hopefully we can qualify as quickly as possible and get players back ASAP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tontochorley @empireofthekop Robertson as usual gave his all too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers It's a very weak team when you look at whose on the pitch at the moment. We need bodies back quickly, I'd get Gini and Firminho on for Origi &amp; Minamino to try and get a bit more control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisRaab3 @BrandiKruse to add Supreme Court Justices to consolodate power on the supreme court. It's basically changing the rules of the game mid game because you don't like the score but they have shown to be ruthless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRaab3 @BrandiKruse the worry would be that democrats are so intent on consolidating power they'll pack the court and also give the vote to millions of illegal aliens or add to the EC making the US in effect a 1 party state. It hasn't taken long after ACB's confirmation that they are openly calling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToddWalker__ @BrandiKruse if Obama had had a majority in the senate he would have got his justice. Just like if the roles were reversed here the democrats would 100% fill the spot. Both sides are hyprocrites and do whatever suits their team but let's not pretend one side is acting out of principle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandiKruse there's also no doubt if the roles were reversed the democrats would have absolutely filled this seat. It's basically changing the rules of the game, mid game because you don't like the way it's currently going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer the country to fight back against the one party rule. Be careful what you wish for and be careful what you sacrafice to get power at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer that might work for a few years but you'd be basically silencing almost 50% of the country and that won't end well for anyone. People don't want to live in 1 party states, they escape 1 party states to come to the US. If the democrats did that it wouldn't take long over 50% of...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer Fine, but remember this. If the democratic party do whatever it takes to consolodate power it's very possible the US would be in effect a 1 party state through packing the court and giving the vote to millions of illegal aliens....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer To simplify: My principles change to suit whatever needs to be done to have power and I don't care what precidents we have to break to get it. This is basically wanting to change the rules of the game mid game because you don't like the way it's going....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdysl72 @RichLowry Serious question if the roles were reversed do you think the democrats would have filled that spot??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Aren't you supposed to be a conservative?? I get it you hate Trump but I didn't realise you also wanted liberal judges on the supreme court. Just call yourself a liberal and be done with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donbob01 @Wismyseminole @B_Salvi @benshapiro A few years under a 1 party rule can change that really fast. Be careful what you wish for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOOL_NELSON She wouldn't even know who he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlayerZeke @jaketapper Sure Joe just got a bit confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Ok it's much better if he thought George Lopez was the President and he was trying to stop "4 more years of George" Lopez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mills_just @danielsgoldman @DonaldJTrumpJr sure, lots of the emails have been corroborated by other people in the email chains. Also some of the meetings mentioned in the emails have been corroborated through other means. We also have 2 of Hunters ex business partners now on the record validating the emails..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurrealALincoln @PressSec @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump You honestly think if it was just blank pages 60min wouldn't have said so?? you can't be that stupid. Just because the first couple of pages were blank doesn't mean the rest of it was (I can't believe i have to say that)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pheadrick @JackPosobiec you mean the super secret account that was disclosed on his tax returns to the IRS??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield Over an hour of that! that was painful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BannedHat @guypbenson @SenSchumer Well that is missing the precident part but let's see what happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionessAngenita @CassandraRules Even if that were true (it isn't) just imagine if this were about Trump and Don Jr with exactly the same evidence. Do you honestly think the media wouldn't be going absolutely crazy over the story??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneunderscore__ @mcuban @JackPosobiec has offered to show the hard drive to journalists on the left including @jaketapper ask him to show you what he has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newsbreak54321 @CJlegalBeagle @CassandraRules You mean the "secret" bank account that is listed on his tax returns? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VKsempireofdirt @CassandraRules You're assuming this is all there is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flantastic4 @NatashaBertrand ignoring that Joe is implicated in some of the texts / emails. The photos and videos and a problem for national security reasons. What other videos / photos do Russia or China have that could be used to blackmail Joe if he became President?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan Thiago will be better. He's probably already our most important player with VVD injured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@refinedmess @adamhousley There's a work receipt with what looks like Hunters signature on it. You do realise that your theory is far more complex and unlikely than the idea that Hunter dropped off the laptop and never collected it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_CarltonCole9 @piersmorgan @jack Your problem is this story has much more than just allegations. We have emails, photos, text messages, signed documents and on the record witnesses that confirm parts of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@refinedmess @adamhousley He's not talking about the FBI he's talking about Hunters lawyer contacting the repairman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielsgoldman @DonaldJTrumpJr Show your evidence that this is Russian disinformation or sit down.  https://t.co/PpTXkmCShA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sedition_Quinn @prageru i guess in a way death is the ultimate freedom so you have a point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomDS1986 @craiglasvega @TheRedmenTV yeah id have gone for Suarez but he's not retired!! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craiglasvega @TheRedmenTV i only didn't say Barnes because our current wide players are pretty good :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV to play in the current team I'd go...  Gerrard - could play in several positions in the current setup and his quality speaks for itself  Hansen - comfortable on the ball, quick and superb 1 v 1 defender  Rush - Defended from the front, absolutely lethal in front of goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldEdition I'd try 4-2-3-1 I think Minamino is better as a 10 and if Thiago is fit him and Henderson should be able to control the midfield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec He's afraid of what he'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mullymt @jmarktucker @DavidAFrench @JackPosobiec Well put it this way it states pretty clearly "the chairman" is Biden.   The person stated there was no evidence in the emails that joe was "the chairman" but there is evidence in the text messages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmarktucker @DavidAFrench @JackPosobiec She needed to read the text messages.  https://t.co/waypVBT0HJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Not really she hasn't read the text messages apparently.  https://t.co/e2LrHOd0Cs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke Sadly what will get people's attention is any videos/ photos of a compromising or illegal nature. It's very difficult to argue that photos or videos have been faked and it would force the media to report on it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec There's much more to this story than the laptop now so that line of attack doesn't cut it anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke unfortuneately the photos are much harder for people to claim are fake. Of course it depends on the contents of the photos but it might be the only way for certain people to take notice of this story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaefieldDude @Timcast Yeah he never called Mexicans rapists, and he didn't ban all Muslims, both claims are lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmsindallas @Alyssa_Milano Did you expect her to say anything else? She dropped all her "principles" about the me too movement for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fyungong @ctwilliamsiii @davereaboi  https://t.co/EDKd2XCvhm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davereaboi Especially since he used the term a lot when the wall and mass illegal immigration was a really big issue. I'm sure someone could clip together all the times he's used it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast And where he calls the proud boys poor boys and also makes at least 2 claims that have been debunked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizRNC That was glorious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperEgg3000 @SteveKrak Yup the problem is when you take away their ability to chop and clip the interview to get the sound bites they want it just looks strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast And Trump knew immediately it was a huge mistake and jumped all over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Trumps been using it for a long time whenever he's talked about illegal immigration, which was one of the key issues just last year. It's amazing to me that so many hadn't heard it before but it does highlight their ignorance in terms of the immigration issue in general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VancityHerb @loomdalini @tommyxtopher she's not 15, and the Cohen character doesn't suugest she's 15 until the end of the clip that's the whole joke / setup. There's nothing to suggest Rudy thought she was 15 when all this was happening. The acctress is 24 or 25 she doesn't look 15.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaPresto the funny part is i've seen so many liberals acting all offended that he touched her around the waist. They should see what Joe Biden is on camera doing to women and young girls when it comes to touching!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jev2DaMaximum @jenvanlaar he's been using that term for years when it comes to illegal immigration, it's amazing how many people are still ignorant of its meaning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guypbenson Possibly the claim it's Russian disinformation is itself Russian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 Including people like Faucci who would have had a huge role in dictating the approach taken. But many people have worked around the clock to try and deal with the issue and their efforts are being minimised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSean90 This should have been his response to this line of attack right at the beginning I think I've heard him use it occasionally but nowhere near enough.

<|startoftext|>@IlpalaGaming @ExcelHamdal @followingstaars @tylerpager @AndrewBatesNC I just think it's funny that Joe's defence is "I didn't include my dodgy dealings on my tax returns" as if that clears it all up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExcelHamdal @followingstaars @tylerpager @AndrewBatesNC Let's wait and see what's on those phones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juju_bad @tylerpager @AhmedBaba_ @AndrewBatesNC Lol yeah cos dodgy dealings are always included in tax returns!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@followingstaars @tylerpager @AndrewBatesNC Yeah cos money laundered is always declared on taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what stage of grief will the liberal media be in after this statement?? #Hunterbidenlaptop #HunterBiden #JoeBiden #TonyBobulinski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec Than any anti Trump story the media has run with in the past 4 years. So this whole attempt to pretend there's nothing worth reporting or even investigating is highly suspicious and probably a bigger story than the actual Hunter Biden story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec 2019? A little bit more evidence has come to light since then in case you hadn't noticed. I'm not making a judgement on this but this pretence that it's a non story is telling in itself. It absolutely is something worth looking into and it contains more actual evidence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec How the hell do I know where the AG is :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec You can just say it's fake as if that proves anything but you can't say why it's fake or show anything to support what you're saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec The emails and text messages have been corroborated by people on the email chain. Hunters former business partner just released a bunch of info and agreed to hand over everything he has. You can cover your eyes and put your hands over your eyes but that doesn't make it fake...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec You've presented zero evidence to support your claims that it's not real. During the past week more and more information has been released, from other sources other than the laptop. There is a tonne of evidence to look at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert07230392 @vanbudha @PJMcIlvaine @JerryBruv @JoeBiden :/ the IRS are the people that deal with taxes it was disclosed to them. That's not secret!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WyattDerpy @statFutures @Tom_Winter There's plenty of reporting they could do if they wanted to. Has anyone asked Hunter if the emails are real? They could talk to the 2 people that have come forward on the record, Hunters ex business partner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @BKobishop @JackPosobiec Its a talking point to ask for any evidence to support your claims??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert07230392 @vanbudha @PJMcIlvaine @JerryBruv @JoeBiden Again HE included the bank account on his tax return. How is that secret?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert07230392 @vanbudha @PJMcIlvaine @JerryBruv @JoeBiden That's been going on for years he's under audit. But the records for his businesses are public information anyone can go check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert07230392 @vanbudha @PJMcIlvaine @JerryBruv @JoeBiden Please explain how its a "secret" account if it's listed on his tax returns to the IRS??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4rgrls @benshapiro Lol yeah that's not how money laundering works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec You didn't clarify anything. You offer nothing. The emails are real, the documents are real, the text messages are real, the photos are real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec The emails have been corroborated by others on the chain. The FBI confirmed the case. What evidence do you have that it's all fake?? Anything at all??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec By the way nobody has debunked any of these documents you're just saying I don't believe they're true cos I could create them on my computer!! That's not a counter argument. The documents have been corroborated by other pieces of evidence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec The FBI confirmed the case by the way the case # checks out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec Lol ok what about the statement from his ex business partner today and the text messages he released?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanoLewis @JackPosobiec Not to mention the latest emails/ text messages don't come from the laptop they come directly from his ex business partner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GolfinBum @johnrobertsFox Are the emails real or not that's the only question. What evidence do you have to think Tony Bobulinski's emails aren't authentic??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreggJarrett They also said this...  https://t.co/0v3TksKXKR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c60735707 @BryanDeanWright He's also flat out lied that he was never involved in Hunters business dealings. Not a crime but makes you wonder why he lied and what else is he lying about??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oaklandzoo22 @Conservative_X1 @CarlosTrastama1 @redsteeze Was the money from China on his taxes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketeater @megynkelly @johnrobertsFox Well when the media won't do their jobs you have to do it for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realJosephRich @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump They'll know after tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlosTrastama1 @oaklandzoo22 @redsteeze Why did he lie about having anything to do with Hunters business dealings??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oaklandzoo22 @redsteeze Does this mean it's not Russian disinfo anymore? Next stage "it doesn't matter he wasn't VP" it's like the stages of grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oaklandzoo22 @redsteeze Joe did lie about not being involved in Hunters business dealings what else has he lied about? Also confirms the source and there'll be more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KenDilanianNBC 3. Why don't you talk to Bevan Cooney?  4. Why don't you talk to Tony Bobulinski?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenDilanianNBC Here you go I'll give you some help.  1. Why don't you ask Hunter Biden if the emails are authentic?  2. Why don't you ask Joe Biden if the emails are authentic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes It's ok we can watch it unedited you don't have to try and tell us what to think. ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster Story they've reported on breathlessly in the past 4 years. Yet this is the one story that apparently doesn't merit even being looked at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheH2 @neontaster It began and ended for just one story. They've reported far less credible stories after the Hunter Biden story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster What's priceless is it applies to just one story (that has actually been verified) I've seen several other stories with far less credibility being reported on after the Hunter Biden one. The Hunter Biden story actually has a tonne of evidence compared to pretty much any other...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/wfmeOIzh8c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightWingM @Hagstrom_Anders @60Minutes It's very difficult to verify something you choose to ignore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck One person on the record is more than that story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 This story has far more evidence than ANY anti Trump story that's been published in the past 4 years. And yet the media are trying to pretend it doesn't meet their oh so strict standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noula20828087 @greg_price11 @NunbergSam No you voted for the guy that got kick backs from Hunter Biden who was making millions from his position as VP. Good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akashonwhitney @seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell I'm still waiting for his evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaushV The new information from Hunters former business partner is not coming via Guiloani, it's not from a laptop repairman and it corroborates a lot of the initial story as well as adding new information to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaushV The Hunter Biden story has emails, documents, text messages, and now confirmation from on the record sources. Not saying it's proven but it's far from a non story and warrants investigation from any serious journalist....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaushV How can a story that has been shown to be pretty much 100% bullshit (The Steele dossier) be more credible than something most "journalists" are refusing to even investigate??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell I'm still waiting by the way for all this evidence  you have that it's Russian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell Text messages and now witnesses going on the record to confirm the emails content. You're skeptical of that but believe a story with no evidence at all. It's laughable how easily you turn your skepticism on and off when it's convenient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell It's very funny to me how you believe the story it was shopped around. I read that story and it contained 2 unnamed sources and no actual evidence to support any of the claims made in it. Yet you instantly believe that and not the other story which has emails, photos, documents..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RwSlocum @Neoavatara @Tracinski @neontaster @baseballcrank If this exact same story involved Trump and his son do you honestly believe it would be reported in the same way??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RwSlocum @Neoavatara @Tracinski @neontaster @baseballcrank The problem is there is actual evidence that warrants investigating and witnesses now on the record that can be questioned. This is not a baseless story far from it. The only issue here is it hurts Biden and we both know that is the only reason they're trying to bury this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ignorem62281500 @Neoavatara @Tracinski @neontaster @baseballcrank Except this story actually has evidence and witnesses that can be investigated. It's not made up completely of unnamed sources. There is more than enough actual evidence to make this story reportable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tracinski @neontaster @baseballcrank Yes you have to examine the evidence with due diligence and investigate properly but to claim there is "no basis" for this story which the NPR and rolling stone have claimed is just plain wrong and you can only conclude they're trying to protect Biden which isn't their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tracinski @neontaster @baseballcrank The problem is there is more actual evidence that supports this story than ANY anti Trump story the media has run with in the last 4 years. You have emails, documents, photos, text messages, confirmation of the emails by on the record witnesses....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell Provide your evidence that you said is plentiful. Sure the timing is for political effect but you could say the same about the Trump tax story. That doesn't make it any less true or at the least worthy of investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RollingStone "Baseless" = more actual evidence than any anti Trump story the media has run with for the past 4 years. Emails, documents, photos, corroborating witnesses that are on the record (not unnamed) text messages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell Even the ex spooks that signed the letter a few days ago had to admit they don't have any actual evidence and this is the best you've got. It's laughable.  https://t.co/pJLUHnz3qO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell  https://t.co/O02rDjFFDJ  Is this also Russian disinformation?? What evidence (which is the word you used) that this is Russian disinformation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell Are the emails real? Are the photos real? Is the work slip signed by Hunter real? Is the recent admission by Hunters former business partner also Russian disinformation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seweso @LWN_ @RichardGrenell What authorities?? Because Ratcliff was pretty clear there is no intelligence that this is Russian disinformation and that was verified by the FBI....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LWN_ @RichardGrenell There's more actual evidence for this story than anything the media has run with that is anti Trump. Emails, photos, corroborating witnesses on the record (not unnamed) to claim it isn't worthy of covering is an admission npr is basically an extension of Biden's campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPRpubliceditor There's more evidence for this story being true than any anti Trump story you've run with in the past 4 years. You have a duty as journalists to ask questions and dig a little. But we all know you're basically an extension of the Biden campaign at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @brianstelter @susanferrechio Brian Stelter isn't a serious person. He is a charictature of the very worst type of journalist. Pretending to be a media firefighter searching for ethics and proper reporting while only focusing on one side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes reverse the situation and mull over whether the democrats would give a Republican anything they didn't have to. Lets not pretend this happens on one side. If the democrats have the power they'll absolutely use it to the fullest extent they can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain There is a lot of similar footage of Trump but the media refuses to show the human side of him. If you look you'll find it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seungminkim for everyone of those photos you could find someone that was hurt by the ACA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattC03 @BowlNamedJames @mallen2010 @Acosta :/ secret implies he was trying to hide it. The IRS have access to it all. Also just because he has a bank account in China doesn't mean anything! it has been explained perfectly clearly and the account hasn't been used since 2015.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnrigsby128 @phillyrich1 @Jeff4life56 @megynkelly @kwelkernbc @NBCNews you do realise this super secret bank account was listed on his tax return?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff4life56 @megynkelly @kwelkernbc @NBCNews yeah cos Trump is never asked about Covid and he's never been asked about his taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>king of the trolls. gotta love the "magnificently brilliant" bit in quotes. (he's probably quoting himself!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden every country has flaws and things in it's past which they might not be proud of, but overall the US has been a beacon to the rest of the world on so many important things. Stop doing down your country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boldandbawdy not neccsarily, it's far too simplistic to say they both have dealt with China ergo it's both similar types of corruption. You have to judge each instance on it's merits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boldandbawdy depends on how they deal with China. Don't forget before he became President Trump was a businessman so it's normal for him to deal with other countries. Joe on the other hand has been in politics for 40+ years. It's not necessarily the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boldandbawdy @esaagar yeah mean the super secret bank account that was listed on his tax returns?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomelandDems Yeah because @ProjectLincoln is going to amplify a story that helps Trump. Their sole purpose is to hurt him and they were pushing the Iranian propaganda story about the Proud Boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BowlNamedJames @MattC03 @mallen2010 @Acosta When his taxes were released a few weeks ago it was confirmed he is still under audit. I'm still waiting for someone to explain how a bank account listed on tax returns given to the IRS is a secret account??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hahnalytics @awprokop Ask yourself why you're super skeptical over the original story but believe this story. Read the story it uses 2 unnamed sources and contains 0 evidence to support any of the claims it makes. If you're going to be skeptical that's good but be consistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awprokop "Person" this is so so amusing. Everyone is super careful over the original story but has no problem believing stuff like this which uses 2 unnamed sources and contains zero evidence to support any of the claims. If we're going to be super skeptical over this stuff be consistent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul @AndrewBatesNC @shustry So you're super cautious about the original story about Hunter but have no problem sharing and believing wholesale, a story that uses 2 unnamed sources and contains 0 actual evidence to support any of the claims it mskes?? Good work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielsgoldman @ProjectLincoln amplified the initial story. Their sole purpose is to hurt Trump. Case closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway Bingo!! You only have to look at who was pushing the original story. @ProjectLincoln @maddow @Amy_Siskind basically a whose who of people with TDS. They now want us to believe they were pushing a story that would help Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellie9 @MZHemingway You mean the super secret bank account that was on his tax return??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usatodayDC Good job pushing Iranian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Lv424hHnM2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blue check marks - why would the story about the proud boys hurt Trump?? Look at who amplified the original story @ProjectLincoln @maddow @USATODAY @Amy_Siskind yeah these guys love spreading stories that help Trump #Iran #Ratcliffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC You only have to look at who was spreading the story to see of course it was designed to hurt Trump! You think @ProjectLincoln @maddow etc.. were amplifying this story to help Trump!??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielsgoldman You can't be this stupid. They knew the anti Trump media would jump all over this story (they did) and it was a way of linking Trump to threatening voters. You think that doesn't attempt to damage him??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool for that moment Joe was all Liverpool fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden if only 4 people showed up it wouldn't look so stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAMandel @ChuckRossDC the story uses 2 unnamed sources and no actual evidence at all!! isn't it amazing how the same people being ultra cautious over the Hunter Biden story swallow this story with no problem at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC this is the 2nd time I've seen that story posted as if it confirms anything. It's funny how people that are being oh so careful about the Hunter Biden story have no problem believing this story from Time which contains 2 unnamed sources and zero actual evidence of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikercarpenter you know it's hilarious how you guys are being oh so careful about the Hunter Biden story but have no trouble believing this story which cites 2 unnamed sources and zero actual evidence. You can't even pretend to be consistent!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realPius_A_Has @scarlettrabe @Yamiche yeah they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scarlettrabe @Yamiche yeah because they tried to pin it on a pro Trump group. Just look how many people spread the story that it was the Proud Boys behind this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart  https://t.co/nCEUCUgCNW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind good job spreading Iranian disinformation Amy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart so Iran trying to use disinformation against a pro Trump group is somehow helping Trump?? That's some big brain logic there Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln pushing Iranian propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwamurai @davereaboi short, bald man syndrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 lets ask @FrankLuntz if this is a real email.    https://t.co/MHtx5INAgf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 (spoiler altert some people on the emails have already confirmed they are real emails). just because you want this to go away doesn't mean it's not worth investigating, you don't get to decide what is or isn't newsworthy and neither does twitter or facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 :/ funny that nobody on the Biden team has disputed the authenticity of 1 email. Nobody has claimed they are fake or have been manipulated in any way. Did you see the ones released today?? others on the email chain can confirm or deny they if they are real or not...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @greg_price11 that's not even remotely true. are the photos real? and it matters because the content of some of the emails suggest Hunter was using his fathers position to sell influence. that is relevant to this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 I also find it extremely funny how you're being very careful about this story yet you have swallowed hook line and sinker the story you linked which contains 2 unnamed sources and no actual evidence at all!! lol at least try and be consistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 why obviously? they were apparently handed over to the FBI in 2019 and the FBI has confirmed they have the hard drives. Again it's irrelevant where they came from if they are authentic emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @greg_price11 focus on the emails and photos and whether they are real or not, the rest is irrelevant really. If the emails are authentic it's irrelevant where they came from. The intelligence agencies have come out and said so far there is no intelligence linking Russia to these emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scientz351 @Majesticethic @Pattie3C @wawasense @greg_price11 You didn't read it did you? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattC03 @mallen2010 @Acosta :/ lol because he's under audit? Fact is a bank account that is listed on his tax returns cannot be described as secret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattC03 @mallen2010 @Acosta The IRS has had them. How is that a secret account??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattC03 @mallen2010 @Acosta The Chinese bank account was listed on his tax returns. Not very secret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta So secret it was on his tax returns??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickroberts317 It's not your fault a bunch of liberal blue check marks are incredibly stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexPlatzzer1 @invictis117 @redsteeze Good come back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobeShaw1 @greg_price11 And it would be a felony if Rudy thought she was 15 and acted inappropriately. This is exactly how paedophiles are caught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobeShaw1 @greg_price11 Where did you hear he was led to believe she was 15??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where does it say he thought she was 15?? All I've read is at the END of the incident Cohen bursts the room and says "she's 15" would love to see your evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexPlatzzer1 @invictis117 @redsteeze Can you read?? At the end of the incident Cohen bursts into the room and says "she's 15" not at the beginning at the end. Unless you think Cohen caught a felony on tape and instead of go-to the police decided to put it in a comedy??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Just think of the logic. If Rudy was doing something inappropriate &amp; illegal they are saying Cohen decided not to go to the police but instead include the felony in a comedy film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexPlatzzer1 @invictis117 @redsteeze Lol yeah Rudy didn't think she was 15 though, it's made very clear if you read the report. Or are you so dumb to think Cohen would video tape a crime and instead of reporting it to the police stick it in a comedy film??  https://t.co/MyTZxdtOK4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila @DanKennett Yup he'll give an element of control we haven't had before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexPlatzzer1 @invictis117 @redsteeze She's 24<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatermelonBloke @drvox @CurtisHouck @maddow @SRuhle @freedlander @W7VOA Correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drvox @CurtisHouck @maddow @SRuhle @freedlander @W7VOA Keep going dude, all you're doing is proving you have zero journalistic integrity (but we alreasy knew that). Let's hope Rudy doesn't sue you all for slander.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@invictis117 @redsteeze  https://t.co/pNgQTF4XAC  This person is on the left and has seen the scene in question...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clasavie @freedlander This person isn't on the right and has seen the film...   https://t.co/pNgQTF4XAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey Is the target on the right or left?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle Keep going, all you're doing is proving how low your journalistic standards are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers 3. Alison come back ASAP 4. Thiago is already our most important player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @redsteeze So something only has to be plausible? There's no duty to actually check it's factual??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow The fact you choose to believe this says everything. If you're a viewer of her show understand this is the level of checking she does before amplifying a story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendreyfuss Rudy gonna be rich (richer) due to a bunch of blue check marks that couldn't resist jumping on based on 1 still photo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apostate1123 @stillgray @LisaBritton @robbysoave "Conspiracy theory"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like it's back to the heavy metal!! #AJXLIV #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apostate1123 @stillgray @LisaBritton @robbysoave It's very possible that the context is key here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apostate1123 @stillgray @LisaBritton @robbysoave Well a liberal was just caught jerking off during a work call and I've seen about 6 articles defending him in the last 24hrs. There's no suggestion in the articles Rudy did anything illegal and without the context it's impossible to know. But given what we know about Cohen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eduarpack @JackPosobiec I don't think they're panicking I just think they're trying to highlight another Twitter double standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eduarpack @JackPosobiec If he thought she was 15 before Sasha burst through the door he didn't stop anything. Although nobody knows the context, one still photo doesn't tell us anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eduarpack @JackPosobiec You think if he inadvertently recorded Rudy doing something illegal he'd put the footage in a comedy movie and not goto the police? Don't be silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To anyone hinting that Rudy was inappropriate with someone he thought was 15, if that was true Sasha Baron Cohen would be obligated to goto the police not put the footage in a comedy movie!! Don't be so willfully stupid!! #Borat2 #Guiliani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 @PaulSenior1 Thought it was because of covid 19?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJDJ18 @JackPosobiec Right. Seems pretty clear to me. And the fact is if it went how certain people are suggesting Cohen would have been obligated to take it to the police not include it in a movie!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eduarpack @JackPosobiec If it was worse Cohen would have a responsibility to report it to the police not put it in a movie. If Rudy thought she was 15 and did anything inappropriate that's a criminal offense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eduarpack @JackPosobiec Not sure why, from the articles I've read it seems pretty clear Rudy does not believe she's 15 until after it's all happened when Cohen burst into the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hokusai699 @JackPosobiec Yeah that article makes it much clearer it's very unlikely he thought she was 15 until Cohen burst into the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@el_jeb @ChiefJu72141263 @Zac_Petkanas Can you just accuse someone of being a paedophile with impunity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dooboo19951704 @JackPosobiec Especially when you're libeling a lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec It's obvious what's happened Sasha is using this actress in his film and in the film she's playing a 15 year old. She's 24 or 25. Whatever happened with Rudy hinges on whether or not he thought she was 15 and whatever he did (one still isn't proof of anything)...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Def_Koyshard @GettingNumb @Cernovich The police have confirmed this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selfdeclaredref Not smart to libel a lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dooboo19951704 @JackPosobiec There's nothing to suggest he thought she was 15. Read the article. It's only after whatever happened, happens that the comedian burst into the room saying "she's 15"  https://t.co/KE6LgpMofQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaddad51 @Cernovich Yeah but that only applies if Rudy thought she was 15 and acted inappropriately. There's nothing in the article to suggest that in fact it seems pretty clear it's not until after whatever happened, happened that the comedian burst into the room saying "she's 15"  https://t.co/2P7XjxJkaG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryWilley8 @B52Malmet Yes but read the paragraph i posted. There's nothing to suggest he thought she was 15 until the comedian burst into the room and said "she's 15". That was after all the other stuff happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryWilley8 @B52Malmet Where does it say he thought she was 15??  https://t.co/FAndczy3GT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitehouse_247 @B52Malmet Id be careful who you libel (especially a lawyer) there's nothing to suggest he thought she was underage until afterwards.  https://t.co/mjg4kyJkmZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GettingNumb @Cernovich You have no idea what videos / photos they have of Hunter. But something was given to the police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ALyricalLife_ @tvisgreat @HeathmHughes @DebraMessing The way it's written it seems like Giuliani wasn't told she was 15 until afterwards. It sounds gross because the girl in question is in her early 20s but that's not illegal. If he was told she was 15 before all that it's a different matter.  https://t.co/nGfvOqGFFR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TallentPhyllis @badkitty251 @DebraMessing @Knarfeoz Depends, if he thought she was 15 and he behaved inappropriately that's obviously potentially criminal. But if he wasn't told how old she was until the comedian burst into the room while it's pretty gross if he was flirting etc.. that's not illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec A bet a bunch of those are her press pack too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josh_hammer Lots of wars and business as usual. But with someone that acts the way we've been conditioned to think politicians should act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCrock_ @ChuckRossDC @peterjhasson Lol the evidence is the evidence either the emails and photos are real or they're not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway He's getting confused with that letter signed by a bunch of former spooks like Brennan and Clapper. The letter which said this...  https://t.co/6XpdJuVLhl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidPriess My favourite part..  https://t.co/Nqop7KQhPU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray It's not that they don't care, it's that they know it's damaging to Joe so they're not going to talk about it and hope it blows over. This is what they try and do, set the narrative as to what is important and what isn't but that doesn't make it so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast when you have 95% of the media working against you, plus those career people within and around government it's not easy. If there were fair coverage it wouldn't even be close right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Watch_LFC @indykaila if true it means we have to sign someone in January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec yup he's confusing them with the people that signed the letter that said this...  https://t.co/cYqQPTWSEI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarainitaly @tomselliott @JoeBiden @RonJohnsonWI They're all ex spooks that have no access to the intelligence. They're just trying to carry water for Joe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Malcolm_fleX48 if the democrats are forced to take on more of her platform that makes them less electable with most americans not more electable. people in their early 20's might like the idea of free stuff but most americans understand what those sorts of policies mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Malcolm_fleX48 the problem is that following is still small when you look at the country as a whole and her ideas might be popular with younger people but that doesn't translate to most americans. I'd say she is going to be much more of a problem for the democrat establishment than republicans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @aronberg @nypost It's getting to the point where this is such a dishonest take you have to wonder if the theory that this is Russian disonformation is itself Russian disinformation. @Aronberg are you knowingly spreading Russian disinformation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill My favourite part of the letter...  https://t.co/cvvnKAJHz7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm starting to think the theory that the Hunter Biden story is Russian disinformation is actually Russian disinformation. They clearly would prefer a Biden win because he's so weak. #Hunterbidenlaptop #HunterBidenEmails #HunterBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenjleblanc @Peoples_Pundit @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Can you find it from a few months ago?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kierangs1 @JackPosobiec I'm starting to think the narrative that this is Russian disinformation is itself Russian disinformation because they want Biden to win. Why are you repeating Russian disinformation??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Such a hack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were in any doubt Twitter is trying to interfere in this election. While they continue to suppress the Hunter Biden story the Trump corporation having a bank account in China is a promoted story :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @peterjhasson It should be the DNC that is afraid of her. If her ideas become democratic policy I don't think that GOP will be too concerned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate @ggreenwald They know when pushed they have no substance to any of their claims but they also know they'll get plenty of support from others without any pushback. 30min with someone like Glenn and they would be completely exposed for what they are, which is basically fire fighters for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnvrs @aaronjmate @ggreenwald @nytimes The Atlantic story too was all unnamed sources and over a dozen people went on the record within about 24hrs to dispute it but it didn't stop certain media outlets running with it as fact. And Biden even made an attack ad based on the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filmschool789 @neontaster In other words we have zero evidence for the things we're claiming but we're going to claim it anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filmschool789 @neontaster Oh and by the way, my favourite part of that letter...  https://t.co/dDBjG6YxIO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filmschool789 @neontaster :/ that article doesn't disprove anything. Simple question, are the emails authentic or not??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @matthewjdowd @HeathMayo @srlourdes What does this mean??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenD00911536 @GeorgeWept @HeathMayo @MelissaAmour72 How do you overturn packing the court? And giving illegal aliens the right to vote so you never lose?? If you really hold conservative values you're voting for your own extinction and everything you say you disagree with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMcclinch @0ryuge @Susan_Hennessey You honestly believe Schumer wouldn't fill this seat if the democrats were in this same situation? You're lying to yourself if you think they wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey Isn't it obvious? They want to make sure they appoint a judge that ideologically is in line with them and don't want to risk losing an election and having a judge appointed that is not in line with them ideologically. Exactly what the democrats would do if the roles were reversed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey 🤔 you're not this stupid (I hope) but in case you are...  Filling a vacancy to the 9 person supreme court is not the same as adding seats to the supreme court with the sole purpose of manufacturing yourself a majority of ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Happy Birthday!! Is Joe Biden still racist??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen Now do your narrative where "the Russians did it!!" And see how rediculous that sounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filmschool789 @neontaster It's easy to make fun of the narrative by exaggerating it for effect but let's hear how the counter narrative goes where the Russians are doing all this and see how ridiculous that all sounds given what we do know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filmschool789 @neontaster Because people think it's strange the laptop was dropped off where it was that's not evidence of anything. There is a receipt for the transaction with Hunters signature on it, if that is fake come out and say it's fake! Nobody has come out and said that the emails aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sloughdespond @willchamberlain  https://t.co/GL252FFLfQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Joe isn't going on the record because the media have signalled to him that he won't need to go on the record. The media are failing in doing their jobs and when one reporter does Joe just brushes him off because he knows he won't face any pushback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEBassett @jonronson just to give you one very recent example, Biden constantly says the reason he decided to run was because Trump called white supmreacists and neo nazis "very fine people" this lie has been debunked years ago yet he continues to say it with no fact checking when he does...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEBassett @jonronson that might be a valid argument if Biden hadn't been actively promoting several lines of attack against Trump that are based on stories that have either been debunked many, many times or have no evidence to support them...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood Evidence the Hunter Biden story is Russian disinformation? Because even those trying to carry water for Joe have to admit they have no actual evidence to support those claims.  https://t.co/VGwtUT661h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter Yeah no big deal, the moderator is a partisan, they've changed the topics to be discussed taking away foriegn policy (how convenient), and they've changed the rules whereby they can mute peoples microphones which mean's they can't actually debate each other.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@riojabaja419 @ProblematicPick @AngryZan @MenendezDenise @MZHemingway @FoxNews Ratcliff said today there is no intelligence that the Hunter Biden emails are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riojabaja419 @AngryZan @ProblematicPick @MenendezDenise @MZHemingway @FoxNews Sure so let's investigate. You could always start by just asking Hunter if they're his. We do know his ex business partner gave journalists access to his email account and some of the key emails have been validated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryZan @ProblematicPick @riojabaja419 @MenendezDenise @MZHemingway @FoxNews Doesn't really matter who dropped it off. What matters is are the emails authentic or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riojabaja419 @ProblematicPick @MenendezDenise @MZHemingway @FoxNews I'm not the FBI, it looks similar to other signatures of his. Some corroborating evidence is the contact between Hunters lawyer and the repairman.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MenendezDenise @MZHemingway @FoxNews You obviously haven't read the emails if you don't understand why this also involves Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Yeah I'm not paying to read it. Screenshot the relevant part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness except you don't know it's lies. And you certainly aren't privvy to intelligence that Ratcliff isn't so I'm not sure why you are saying it's obviously false that the intelligence agencies don't have any evidence the Hunter story is Russian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness No need for that sort of abuse dude. Just uncalled for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness How do you know he's wrong that there has been no credible intelligence that suggests it's Russian disinformation? What intelligence do you have access to to dispute this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness And lots of "sketchy" stories get published and the media report on them. Remember the Atlantic story full of unnamed sources that was disputed almost immediately by around a dozen people on the record?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Who is saying Ratcliff is wrong and what is their evidence? Considering he has access to intelligence that most people don't I'd be interested to hear why he's incorrect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness The Breitbart story that had emails linked to China came directly from the email account of Hunters former business partner, no laptop repairman in sight. You're moving the goalposts when the only focus shoukd be whether the emails are genuine or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness The only thing that matters is whether or not the emails are authentic or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness It's a moot point anyway you were the one that brought her up as proof the story isn't true, when that's not proof of anything.

<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Yeah the one that was one of Hilarys goto reporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonkarl good job, is that the last time you asked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo Trump needs to ask as many questions as possible and let Joe try and answer them. Get him off script as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness you mean Maggie Haberman that was in the Clinton emails as a journalist the Clinton's used to spread stories? that Maggie Haberman??   it's very difficult to know because outside a few outlets nobody wants to ask any questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness kind of like the "it's the Russians!!" counter narrative, that one sounds awfully familiar too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness investigate the claims rather than making assumptions before the evidence has been examined we'll probably get to the bottom of this story quickly. But nobody wants to dig a little because they are obviously protecting Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness evaluate the evidence on its merits, you think all those reporters at the Atlantic or NY Times are not biased against Trump? didn't seem to matter to the liberal media that reported those stories enthusuastically but not this story. If journlists would just do their jobs and...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness on the record sources within 24 hrs. They had no problem reporting that story but this one is a no no. The fact it's damaging to Biden has nothing to do with that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness yeah that's the reason the left wing media isn't reporting this. Nothing to do with it being damaging to Biden right? Because that left wing media had no problem reporting a story from the Atlantic that consisted entirely of unnamed sources which was disputed by over a dozen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster yup and he provides zero evidence to support his claim that this is obvious Russian disinformation, other than the speculation of people like Schiff, Brennan and Clapper who are proven liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaysSimonson @ChuckRossDC David Frum has access to no intelligence reports he provides no evidence for any of the claims he's making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness you think the Trump tax story wasn't dropped at a convenient time politically? that's politics, doesn't make the story less true if it is true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Those were Hilary's emails. Why aren't you prepared to investigate if the emails are genuine? because if they are they certainly raise many national security risks that need to be investigated. This can be both a true story and politically motivated in terms of the timing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feed37122 @davidfrum if people like Schiff are making statements like the intelligence agencies know this is Russian disinformation Ratcliffe has a duty to correct that if it is not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum :/ so you can make statements supported by zero evidence i.e this is obvious Russian disinformation, but when the DNI says on the record there has been no intelligence to support this you just ignore it and say he can't be trusted. Let's see your evidence to support your claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness could be but there's no evidence of that so far. I've seen the emails, photos, receipt of the transaction and an email from Hunter's lawyer to the repairman. I've seen nothing to supports the idea this is Russian disinformation other than the speculation of some known liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcnamee_kevin @ByronYork so you're ok with Schiff just stating it's Russian disinformation with no need to back up those statements? Oh and by the way Ratcliffe just destroyed little Schiffs conspiracy theory. Either put up the evidence or say nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foolie02 @AlexBlakeFL @lunostero @esaagar what isn't real?  are the emails real? are the photos real? is the receipt for the computer work real? is the email from Hunter's lawyer to the repairman real?   if none of that is real lets see the evidence. a statement from Hunter would be something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinW46729680 @FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness it's not but if the emails have been created and if documents have been forged the easiest thing in the world for Hunter to do is come out and say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @Gmoneyrocks1 @realannapaulina agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @Gmoneyrocks1 @realannapaulina yeah we all know about his drug problems.  It's the selling access to Joe part and making millions of dollars in the process from Ukraine and China that's the problem. If the emails are genuine it is a massive national security issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBlakeFL @lunostero @esaagar that's a good question. The FBI has had this hard drive since 2019 apparently. Those questions have been asked of Wray in the last couple of days, lets see what excuse he has for burying this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @Gmoneyrocks1 @realannapaulina ok answer these questions with evidence to support the answers if you have it.  1. Are the emails real or not? 2. Are the photos real? 3. Is the receipt provided by the repairman with Hunters name and signature on it real? 4. Is the email from Hunter's lawyer to repairman real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lunostero @esaagar what evidence is there that this is Russian disinformation apart from the speculation of known liars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lunostero @esaagar Likely not is not good enough when you're talking about national security issues.  1. Are the emails real? 2. Are the photos real? 3. Is the receipt for the work with Hunters signature on it real? 4. Is the email from Hunter's lawyer to the repairman real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar yup that's the crux of the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@o2bnobx @esaagar weird when the intelligence agencies say something you don't like you just say "I don't believe you". I assume you have lots of evidence that supports this is Russian disinformation? lets see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @Gmoneyrocks1 @realannapaulina :/ that's not an argument. There is a receipt from that repair shop with Hunter's signature on it. There is an email from Hunter's solicitor to that repairman. Just because it sounds crazy doesn't mean it's not true, especially when there is evidence to support the claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreestyleMusic_ @mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness yup ive not seen any claims from the Biden camp that any of the emails have been created and aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr He's seen the evidence it's there in plain sight he just can't produce it right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @realannapaulina lets see your evidence that shows it's Russian disinformation (you have evidence right?)  are the emails real? are the photos real? is the receipt with Hunter's signature on it real? is the email from Hunters lawyer to the repairman real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness are the emails real? are the photos real? is the receipt with Hunters signature on it real? is the email from Hunters lawyer to the repairman real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirror_miranda @MariaBartiromo @DNI_Ratcliffe @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness then show us your evidence to prove otherwise? it's very easy now to just go Russia, Russia, because certain individuals have created that narrative. But it's not good enough to just say it, where is your evidence that Russia is behind this and to what extent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden if you truly believe this why would you call a lid on things until Thursday?? if the stakes are this high you're being irresponsible by not being out there every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@15poundstogo it would be easier to list who isn't spreading this. The usual suspects that told you the Steele dossier was credible are now telling you the Hunter Biden story is all Russian disinformation (with zero evidence)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mumsabo @thinksmallfund @Pam21285015 @robreiner What are you afraid of? because don't listen to the people telling you if Trump loses he won't leave office etc.. because they are trying to scare you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfMJCleveland @JoeBiden @FDRLST they're going to try though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @JoeNBC @nypost 4. Certain media just dispute the story out of hand and call it Russian disinformation, ignoring the evidence presented and offering no evidence to support their own claims. Joe Biden is asked 1 question by 1 reporter about this and he brushes them off. Hunter has been asked 0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @JoeNBC @nypost 3. The NY Post story, includes photos, emails, receipts of the supposed transaction between Hunter and the computer repair shop. Has not been disputed by Hunter Biden, and nobody has disputed the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @JoeNBC @nypost 2. People that were on the trip in question including people like John Bolton who are hardly Trump fans disputed key aspects of the story, yet certain media outlets (like @JoeNBC ) ran with it as if it were true with no checking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @JoeNBC @nypost Compare how certain media outlets are treating this story with the Atlantic story.  1. The Atlantic Story, all unnamed sources which was disputed by over a dozen people who went on the record within about 24hrs to dispute key parts of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceLFC exactly, in cricket and rugby you hear the process of decisions being checked and made. Would add a layer of accountability if we get to hear the process in action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDoyleSport this is actually the bigger punishment for Everton, if he missed 3 games he probably wouldn't get back into the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mumsabo @thinksmallfund @Pam21285015 @robreiner stop listening to CNN and MSNBC they are trying to scare you and it's working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum @nypost David is better than you so David can just say things without any evidence to support what he's saying and be convinced he's right. David knows best despite all that we know about David going back decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurnTheTapeOff @aaronjmate Obvious how?? Has he denied it? We do have a receipt for the transaction with what looks Hunters signature on it. Plus Hunters lawyer did contact the repair shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastingCantrips @GoldSaltFlour You know Hunter could come out and say he never took his laptops to that repair shop, he could come out and say they aren't his emails but he hasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastingCantrips @GoldSaltFlour So he never took the laptop to the repair shop?? I guess that's why his lawyer contacted the repair shop and asked for the hard drives?? I guess that's why there's a receipt with his signature on it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics If the rumoured photos are real Hunters going to have a hard time explaining how they're Russian disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majorsheese @AnfieldWatch Time for Joe to step up and become a leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett There's always the option to sign someone in January if we absolutely have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett instead of VVD spraying the ball from deep Thiago can do that, and Fabinho is a decent passer too from CB. I think maybe we might need to take a slightly different approach but the team defended pretty well against a dangerous Everton team yesterday...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett Fabinho should be treated as  CB first and midfielder 2nd at the moment, hopefully he can develop more for that position. Given Thiago's performance yesterday if he stays fit we should get a lot more control in midfield which should hopefully take pressure off the defence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rising_serpent Bingo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Another win for Everton, Pickford misses 3 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_yazek @MikeFeller1 @TimMurtaugh Lol you've got zero evidence of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_yazek @TimMurtaugh Good job we've got documents that can be verified and not just accusations (kind of like a few recent stories I can remember being published)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sammavs @ChrisDJackson @neeratanden No proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdoodlie1994 @RBReich Lol one party state!! Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers if we do have a target for next year (Upamecano maybe) we might move for them in January if it is the season. With Thiago playing the way he did yesterday if he can stay fit it takes us up a level in terms of controlling games and that should take pressure off the defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoscoeBDavis1 the emails for the Brietbart story came directly from his former business partners email account. No laptop repairman involved at all!! If you believe this is all Russia I guess Hunter was business partners with a Russian spy while Joe was VP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PiperK @gatewaypundit The Breitbart story contained emails directly from Hunter Biden's former business partner's email account. No PC repairman involved. So if we're to believe your theory that this is the Russians! Hunter Biden was business partner with a Russian spy while his dad was VP 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oakjon @Kingairpilot68 @som3thingwicked @NoDaTeddi @TuckerCarlson Sorry that last sentence wasn't aimed at you but the people convinced it's Russian disinfo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oakjon @Kingairpilot68 @som3thingwicked @NoDaTeddi @TuckerCarlson The emails used in the Breitbart story didn't even come from the laptop they came directly from Hunter Biden's former business partners email account. So if your theory is true Hunter Biden was business partners for years with a Russian spy while his dad was VP 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy isn't part of the media's job to verify by asking questions. It'd be nice to have Hunter Biden on the record with some pretty simple questions e.g.  1. Are the emails genuine? 2. Did you take your laptops to that guy for him to fix?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbaneseJoe @ChuckRossDC anything else to your much more plausible scenario??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbaneseJoe @ChuckRossDC now go over your scenario, which im assuming involves Russian agents planting fake emails on Hunter Bidens laptops (how did they get them) and then getting those laptops to some repair guy who hands them over to the FBI in 2019. Oh and they faked a receipt with Hunters signature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BustedFlush @ChuckRossDC the repair guy has provided proof. He's provided the receipt for the transaction signed by Hunter, and we also have the email correspondence between him and Hunter's lawyer where he asked for the hard drives back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BustedFlush @ChuckRossDC this repair guy is a Russian agent? what's your more sane theory? But Chuck is correct Hunter can simply confirm or deny he sent his laptops to that repair shop and save everyone a lot of speculation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BustedFlush @ChuckRossDC so you are saying Hunter dropping off his laptops and forgetting about them (for which we have seen the receipt for the transactions signed by Hunter) is more far fetched than the Russians planting fake emails onto Hunter's laptop and then what??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy I will, I help care for my father who has dementia so I gotta go right now but I'll read it when I have the chance. Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy I'll give it a read when I have the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy @DavidAFrench If they were fake the best person to be able to prove it quickly would be Hunter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy That's not accurate either. The claim is he was fired because he was incompetent and lots of other countries wanted him fired nobody is claiming he was fired because he wouldn't investigate Burisma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy I wasn't the one making the claim. Just trying to stay accurate. That's not the first person I've spoke to that claimed Biden pushed for an investigation into Burisma; he did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy  https://t.co/tQJslin6DR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy Umm the tweet I was replying to made that claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy Lol Hunters lawyer contacted the repair shop to get the laptops back!! Why do that if he never left them there in the first place??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @sinsiddh @JerryDunleavy That's not the same as Biden pushing for an investigation into Burisma, you know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench @JerryDunleavy How do you know that hasn't happened??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy Lol. Is the receipt a Russian fake? Was it someone else that went to the FBI about this a year ago?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sinsiddh @SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy When did Biden push for Burisma to be investigated?  You're the 2nd person to claim that, the 1st person couldn't back up that statement with evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy Explain to me why it's obviously false? Have you seen the receipt signed by Hunter? Have you seen the message from hunters lawyer asking for the laptops back? We also know the repairman contacted the FBI about this in 2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy And what are the obvious false claims and what evidence do you have they are obviously false?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy I've seen several reports that the key emails have been verified including one report that said they were verified by someone also on the email chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deaton1999 @ErikKSchultz2 @DavidAFrench "All" better tell Mueller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkScreenFiend @JerryDunleavy They could have still done analysis of the emails that's independent of the chain of custody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richarlison97 @Recibo_CRF That photo literally proves nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy The assumption is the post hasn't done due diligence on the emails. What is that based on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipGarey @JerryDunleavy @neontaster "Tabloids"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Who says they haven't verified the emails??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanKennett Still amazed it wasn't shown to Oliver to look at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentArthur2017 @daveweigel Spoiler alert the primary sub source was a suspected Russian spy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svdate he's on camera talking about how he got him fired. The part that is debatable is whether he was fired because he was investigating Bursema.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool for some reason im more concerned about Thiago. I think we all knew VVD was probably serious given the nature of the tackle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool any news on Thiago?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRoll566 @Jimmcnary @JohnGalt20161 @aaronjmate  https://t.co/y5ovqBtXxJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRoll566 @Jimmcnary @JohnGalt20161 @aaronjmate you investigate. remember Don Jr was interviewed for about 17hrs for his 30min meeting. Why is Hunter Biden above being questioned about the contents of the emails if they are genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRoll566 @Jimmcnary @JohnGalt20161 @aaronjmate was Hunter getting paid for access to Joe? did Joe get any of the money Hunter was paid by the Ukranian and Chinese entities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EC9728 @DaveOCKOP @beINSPORTS_EN its highly possible given the nature of the challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch wouldn't be surprising given the nature of the foul. Hopefully others can step up and in January we might have to go for someone we had targeted for next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch shouldn't he have asked the referee to take a look?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klopp called that one of our best away performances since he's been manager. @Thiago6 first away game that isn't a coincidence. The level of control and creativity he gave us was another level. Gonna enjoy every game he plays and hopefully the injury isn't too bad 🤞 #Thiago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinJRea1990 @EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 ?? There was a very low standard when it comes to the Steele dossier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 You can look into both but the first question that needs to be answered is are the emails authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 What if the FBI had this hard drive in 2019 and buried it?? Someone needs to look into the FBI handling of this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool I heard it was a cut? Not great but better than ligament damage. Would tie in with Klopp saying it "looked bad".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 Lol sure let's investigate the whole thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 How the information was collected is secondary to if it's authentic or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 No it wouldn't Hunter could also volunteer to help an investigation. If the emails have been created somehow you'd think he'd be the perfect person to be able to prove that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 Yeah except it's not "random things" you're talking about selling access to the VP, and making millions from China. Sure validate the emails, one way to help do that is ask Hunter Biden if they are authentic or not (as well as a more forensic approach)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lainiesgotapun @kc2fargo @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 @IgnatiusPost @DavidCornDC Yeah not me. I know exactly the sort of shady stuff these agencies have been doing for decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 :/ if you're investigating this story it would be perfectly reasonable to question all those people as well as Hunter Biden. Why is Hunter Biden immune from answering questions??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 But questioning the people in question is also an investigation tool. Have them tell you under oath their version of what happened etc.. that's perfectly valid for an investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 Sure I think the repair guy did send the FBI a copy of the hard drive in 2019, but there are other ways to check the validity of emails since there are other people on the email chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lainiesgotapun @kc2fargo @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 @IgnatiusPost @DavidCornDC Yeah that says more about left wing Twitter mate. When did you guys start taking the word of the CIA and FBI? I remember when liberals were rightly skeptical of the intelligence agencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllaPee2003 @SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 One way to do that is ask the people involved. Ask Hunter if they are his emails. But sure I agree this needs to be properly investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lainiesgotapun @kc2fargo @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 I've read the stories funnily enough they've been rushed out by the same people that pushed the Steele dossier lol @IgnatiusPost @DavidCornDC nothing of substance in any of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kc2fargo @Lainiesgotapun @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 If you read the reports there's nothing of substance in them. They're trying hard to downplay it but if the emails are genuine it's impossible not to ask more questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaybles_07 @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 Yeah it's not the same. Let's investigate and ask questions. If you're a Democrat it seems like it's offensive to even ask legitimate questions now. How did that happen??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT Lots of speculation in those posts and no actual evidence provided. Let's investigate and see if the emails are real? Nobody from the Biden team has disputed their authenticity. If the emails are real it absolutely should be investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lainiesgotapun @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 I've read them, nothing that disproves the emails aren't authentic. Lots of speculation from people that aren't IT experts. But I've also seen other reports where the authenticity of the emails has been corroborated by others on the email chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaybles_07 @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 And they had some shady stuff going with China, but no big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 What actual evidence do you have that the emails aren't authentic. Because if they are the rest is mute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurrealALincoln @jmonies27 @NateSilver538 It's scary how easily you'll parrot the cover story. "It's the Russians" with zero actual evidence other than the words of people that lied to you about the Steele dossier and "journalists" that covered for them....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lainiesgotapun @julie_kelly2 @NateSilver538 Not even Biden's team has said the emails are forgeries what evidence do you have they are? You know somebody that was in the email chain has confirmed they are real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonasVevatne @ViktorFagerLFC @Harry1499 Yeah I'm aware of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quilts4veterans @mermaidgirl10 @ksenijapavlovic By Dustin Miller from  https://t.co/IKVCXtAT7x nobody from the Biden team have disputed the authenticity of the emails. And they have been verified by other people that were on the email chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldEdition David Coote needs to explain himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViktorFagerLFC @Harry1499 That could mean there's bruising or something. Adrenalin can keep you playing through injury but unlikely it's super serious given he played on. Might miss a week or two though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M2Madness It's like they've completely forgot about Epstein.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyfirmino @JamesPearceLFC Yeah that red line is nowhere near Mane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV Thiago just top quality. Can't wait to watch him every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceLFC Gonna enjoy watching him so much. Different class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlGray2 @JamesPearceLFC That red line is nowhere near any part of Mane!???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawbeau94 @ViktorFagerLFC Ugh ok. It did look terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BabySharkDooDo5 @mmdaadiaz @Odyssia2 @ChasetopherJabs @eugenegu @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Yeah because we didn't have a full investigation of Trump/ Russia. Let's have something similar for Biden/ Ukraine, Biden / China and whatever else is uncovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViktorFagerLFC He walked off though so that's good news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foolie02 @LinmuWho @FunkoHunter @Amy_Siskind @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews A separate party that is on the email chain. You know every person on that email chain will have copies of the emails. Also nobody from Biden's team has disputed that the emails are real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedmondRoleV2 @RohanCoop @AyreJon @btsportfootball So you can 2 foot someone if they're offside??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLang94 @11matrob @JamesPearceLFC So you can punch someone as long as they're offside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foolie02 @LinmuWho @FunkoHunter @Amy_Siskind @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews The validity of the emails was confirmed by a separate party that was part of the email chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmdaadiaz @Odyssia2 @ChasetopherJabs @eugenegu @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews What about the story in Breitbart. Those emails came from hunters former business partner. And while it is an if at the moment, if the emails are genuine it absolutely should be investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sadydoyle Once again some of the most vile, abuse aimed at women on my timeline comes from so called feminists and progressives, towards conservative women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmdaadiaz @Odyssia2 @ChasetopherJabs @eugenegu @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Further investigation is being very disingenuous. If the emails are real it's very worrying and a huge security risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmdaadiaz @Odyssia2 @ChasetopherJabs @eugenegu @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Yeah that article does not dispute the emails are real. And the Breitbart story had emails relating to China not Ukraine. If those emails are genuine, Hunter needs to answer some questions as does Joe. I'm not accusing them of anything but to pretend this isn't worthy of....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lowestar78 @GrizzKhan 2 sitting midfielders might free up Trent a bit more. He's not got forward as much as last season, part of that is teams targeting him but if we have 2 sitting deeper in gives us more cover for the counter attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bardamukitty1 @DrewHolden360 yes, it looks like he's used Hunter as a way to make himself very wealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanderingStrngr @CoriWood @adamhousley it is cute that you still trust the intelligence agencies after everything we've found out not only in the past 4 years but the decades previously. I remember when the left was highly suspcious of the CIA and FBI now it seems like you believe everything they tell you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanderingStrngr @CoriWood @adamhousley this was buried by the FBI, they've already shown to be highly political. But that does not support your point unless the FBI says they looked at the emails and found them to be fake and they haven't done that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanderingStrngr @CoriWood @adamhousley The FBI haven't disputed the authenticity of the emails. The haven't come out and said we've analysed the emails and found them to be fake. Why they sat on this and did nothing is certainly something that needs to be investigated  and I have no faith in Wray so im not surprised..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanderingStrngr @CoriWood @adamhousley The FBI have had it since 2019 keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Evidence for this? Is your evidence the word of people that have lied about everything? Are the emails real or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinmuWho @FunkoHunter @Amy_Siskind @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews The key questions should be are the emails real or not. And nothing that has been reported has proven the emails aren't real. In fact their authenticity has been confirmed further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinmuWho @FunkoHunter @Amy_Siskind @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews You're asking the wrong questions. What we do know is that guy did have ownership of the laptops there is a signed receipt for them. Why Hunter decided to use that shop is irrelevant if he did use that shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odyssia2 @ChasetopherJabs @eugenegu @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Lol the story has not been debunked at all. Please show me where the validity of the emails have been debunked? In fact their authenticity has been confirmed further in the past day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanderingStrngr @CoriWood @adamhousley Ok but nobody has claimed some of the emails aren't authentic. The Biden team haven't claimed that. And like I said people on the email chain which include the emails that are problematic have confirmed they are authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarmineSabia @BoKnowsNews @TheSteveHolzer @CBSNews This retweet is still up.  https://t.co/W1ahdcInH4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Equateall @YNB @BoKnowsNews The people that lied to her about Steele told her and she believed them because she wants to believe Joe isn't corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB @TheSteveHolzer @BoKnowsNews Ask yourself what evidence you've been provided that this is a Russian smear. Now ask yourself why you have chosen to believe something that has zero evidence supporting it right now instead of asking if the emails are genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaronVonL @CarmineSabia @BoKnowsNews @TheSteveHolzer @CBSNews They key question at the moment should be are the emails real or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaronVonL @CarmineSabia @BoKnowsNews @TheSteveHolzer @CBSNews They've provided zero evidence for this claim but know enough people want to believe Joe is innocent and they have enough people in the media willing to spread that narrative....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawyerkev @themarketswork Yup also @davidcoen rushed something out. They treat people for fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themarketswork I've seen rushed stories from @IgnatiusPost and @DavidCornDC about this story getting the old team back I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebradfordfile You underestimate the media's ability to completely ignore this story and actively cover up for him or spread a counter narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emerald1910 Keep going mate, I see you and hear you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to top it all off the people that are telling them that are the very same people that told them the Steele dossier was accurate Intel. You really couldn't make it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's scary how so many people confidently state that the Hunter Biden stories are Russian disinformation with no evidence to support it. #Hunterbidenlaptop #HunterBiden #HunterLaptop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbinMD @edokeefe And to top it all off the people telling you it's Russian disinformation are the very same people that told you to believe the Steele dossier. You just can't make this up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbinMD @edokeefe The speed at which so many people have just accepted this is Russian disinformation is really scary. You won't be able to point to one piece of good evidence to support this but you'll believe it because you want to believe it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jalexa1218 @edokeefe What about the story isn't true? Try and be specific if you can thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MGC_Skyre @SpringAyn @ASAPLizzie @debdrens Has there been an investigation into Joe and China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedMojaveStudio @dadawg77 @MarkDice @GlennKesslerWP @IgnatiusPost Other people were on the email chains and they have confirmed they are authentic emails. Honestly if the emails are real it doesn't really matter where they came from lets address the contents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedMojaveStudio @dadawg77 @MarkDice @GlennKesslerWP @IgnatiusPost Yeah that's not proof of anything. Show me the proof linking this to Russia. Show me the proof the emails aren't genuine. Show me the proof the emails from the Breitbart story aren't genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dadawg77 @MarkDice @GlennKesslerWP @IgnatiusPost "Everyone" you mean the same people that pushed the Steele dossier are saying with zero evidence this is Russia. Excuse me if I don't believe known liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewHolden360 It looks like Hunter has been profiting off Joe's position and Joe has received his fair share through Hunter. That is a huge story when Joe could be president in a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewHolden360 Yeah a father's love for his troubled son is not something to be making fun of, but I do think it goes some way to explain why Joe has let this happen and keeps covering for Hunter. He's blinded by his love for his son to the point he's allowed his son to severely compromise him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhyIsKorisTaken @KBULTRA0 @mtracey Yeah selling access to China is so boring. Who cares if the person that could be president is using his family to sell access and become very wealthy in the process. Such a boring story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaoTizer @LeadLantern @dbongino Other people on the email chain have confirmed they are authentic emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoriWood @adamhousley There were other people on the email chains. They have confirmed the emails are real. You know when multiple people are on the same email chain there are multiple copies of said email chain. Ask yourself why nobody on team Biden has said the emails aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wayne_K_Smith @ModestoPhoto @AP What about the Breitbart story involving China. Those emails came from hunters old business partner. What's your excuse for that?? Also other people on the emails from the post story have confirmed they are authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays The Breitbart story is very clear where the emails involving China came from. And other people on the emails from the post story have confirmed they are authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThinSkinTrump @brhodes I'm going to report this for targeted harassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThinSkinTrump @brhodes What evidence do you have this isn't true? You do know the emails are being verified by others on the email chain. And the Breitbart story emails came directly from an ex business partner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmydon @heckyessica Yeah that's understandable but that father's love for a son is also a big weakness if it means Joe has allowed Hunter to take advantage of his position and also profit from it via Hunter. That's not good and provides a massive security risk for someone that could be president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jimmcnary @JohnGalt20161 @aaronjmate Are the emails real or not? If they're real Joe has questions to answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tags7453 @neeratanden Please explain what about it is fake?? Is the Breitbart story that uses emails from hunters old business partner also from Russia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisjohnson @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah I'm from the UK. Good job Sherlock Holmes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill Have a good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Those emails weren't hacked or stolen by the way. And before you reply with "its Breitbart" try reading the story first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee More to chew over...   https://t.co/8YukehYFdk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill Nice goal post shifting there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill Ok you can't be helped. There are lots of legitimate things to criticise him for without having to keep lying about something you can disprove very easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill And yes there were plenty of people there to protest the taking down of confederate statues who were not white supremacists or neo Nazis and plenty of people protesting them that weren't antifa black bloc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill Start from around 2min<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOMAD_NP @VERBAL_CHANCLA @WiseAssSatire @thehill  https://t.co/JuLk1Pl8uC  Sigh it's only the most debunked thing he's accused of saying.   "And I'm not talking about the white supremacists or neo Nazis because they should be condemned completely".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom Any thoughts on this Tom??   https://t.co/QThfZ8c0Cx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisjohnson @DonaldJTrumpJr Very easy to explain, people lie when they goto these town halls. You think she's the first person to do this?? What do you want to happen to this woman of colour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr But, but someone that liked Trump was in the audience for his town hall!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayCaruso If only there was a moderator that could have followed up on that statement and dug a little deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom Normal people....  https://t.co/zAZIgbNzUy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney So you'll comment on this but nothing on Twitter and Facebook censorship??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog If only there was some sort of moderator that could ask follow up questions and dig a little deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Obviously not saying any such tape should be released but there are scenarios where it could and should seriously hurt Biden's chances. E.g if he knew about it and helped cover it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog What if involves a minor and Joe helped cover it up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Fair enough, have a good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee The contents of the emails if they are genuine is more then enough to ask more questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee No it's not evidence but if they were fake emails wouldn't you want that known right at the beginning of this story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee ok so the lawyer hasn't denied the authenticity of any of the emails, because there was no denial of the emails in that article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee yeah i missed that can you link me to the statement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee sure but that needs to be looked at right. Nobody has asked Hunter if they are real. Nobody has asked Joe if he is saying the emails are fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee lets see if the emails are real. You know somebody could just ask Hunter and see what he says. If the emails are real the rest is mute really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee  https://t.co/VkzJy0RWbk  not proof I know but this guy is well connected. It's certainly more than you are going on to believe the emails are fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee you think they would have very strongly come out and said "the emails aren't real" it's not difficult to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee the emails are the claims, someone should be asking Hunter about them and Joe about them, Joe did a town hall yesterday and it wasn't even mentioned. You're basing your belief the emails are fake on nothing really. Bidens team did not say the emails are fake if they were don't...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee that warranted the action that Facebook and Twitter took, nothing at all other than they knew it was damaging to Biden and tried to censor it. Let's investigate the claims and see if it is worth following up on. You seem to have already decided it's fake, based on what??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee have some questions to answer to. But completely censoring the story is not the way to deal with it. I can't remember another story in the past 2 years this has happened to can you? There is nothing substantially different in the post story, in terms of the structure of the story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee that's not my point. My point is if the photos are real it suggests they do have access to some highly personal information of Hunters. Let's validate or not the emails, lets ask Hunter if the emails are real and get him on the record. If the emails are real certain people do...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee i'm all for people digging into the emails, lets see if they are real or not. Somebody could you know actually do journalism and ask Hunter Biden if they are real or not. The photos of Hunter are real right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee im not saying I trust the NY post story. But there was nothing in that story that was so different to other stories we've seen in the past 4 years that warranted it being completely shut down by facebook and twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Ok well lets find out if they are fake. Biden's team has not claimed they are fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee There have been more then 1 email. Pay attention. Did you see the emails that involved China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee I've seen nobody from the Biden team dispute the authenticity of the emails which you'd think they would have done if they are not real emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee All I'm saying is that all that really matters with this story is are the emails real or not. If they are fake emails it's a non story. But if the emails are real emails then some people certainly need to clarify a few things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Yeah that's not the same thing lol. You said Biden pushed for an investigation on Burisma he did not. The article is speculating that Biden being on the board might bring more scrutiny but it's just speculation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Wrong, they said there was no meeting on Joe's official calender. When did Biden push for Burisma to be investigated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee The FBI had this in 2019 it's certainly a good question as to why they sat on it for so long. The FBI haven't said the emails aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster Hmm he's pretty media savvy I'm not so sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Even though it's politico so a highly biased source who will of course help spin for Biden there's nothing in there denying the authenticity of the emails. Also they provide zero evidence this is Russian disinformation it's just the standard response nowadays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Yeah like I said they haven't said the emails aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Sure it's political in the timing. Doesn't mean the emails aren't real. You think the Trump tax story wasn't dropped at a politically convenient time?? Nobody from the Biden team has denied authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Just a few weeks ago the Atlantic ran a story consisting entirely on unnamed sources. That story was disputed almost immediately by around 20 people that went on the record. That story wasn't censored at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee What about the post story is "blatantly false"? You still can't answer that. The post story had photos and documents and emails. Nobody from the Biden team has claimed the emails are fake...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee The FBI have not commented on this they haven't said the e-mails aren't genuine that's just conjecture on your part. Nobody from the Biden team has denied the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee I'm open to whether or not the emails are real or not that is basically the crux of this story. If they are genuine it is absolutely a story worth reporting on and asking more questions about. The Biden campaign made a statement and they have not denied the emails are genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChoosySuzy @AntiBladder @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Lol sure. Hilary not campaigning in key states had nothing to do with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee So you don't have a list? Can you name me 1 other story from a mainstream media outlet that was dealt with in this way since 2018??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Can you explain what parts of the post story are incorrect? Are the emails real or not? Are the photos of Hunter real or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Do you have a list of all the stories that fell foul of this policy from 2018?? Would be interesting to see if there's a pattern to them. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntiBladder @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee He beat Hilary thanks in part to his understanding how the media game is played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorCandiru @CeWayne89 @greggutfeld "Support" he helped write the bill. Didn't hear Bill Clinton's former press secretary mention that. It should be the moderators job to push a little and Biden gets none of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntiBladder @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee He knows how to play the game better than anyone I've seen and the proof is in the pudding. More people will be aware of the Hunter Biden story and what Twitter and Facebook did because of Trump. The media is obsessed with him and he knows this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntiBladder @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee If you haven't noticed he's the most media savvy president we've ever had I don't know what to say. Whether you like him or not he understands the media he understands social media (which is why he tweets all the time).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog And @RadioFreeTom is acting as if he should get a Pulitzer for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adlez_Navi @RichieD76 @SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Nobody's scared but Twitter and Facebook coordinated to suppress the story lol. Is there another story they've done this with??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonPeetz @colinbraude @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Lol you don't get it. All the blue check marks that won't be able to resist commenting on this are simply bringing more attention to what Twitter and Facebook did. That's what Trump wants. There are elements of truth in all good satire that's why it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkbarTirmizey @TheSecondJoker @neontaster Blue check marks won't be able to resist commenting on this which will only bring the essence of the issue to more people. The Babylon bee is satire but all satire is based on an element of truth otherwise it doesn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkbarTirmizey @TheSecondJoker @neontaster He does it all the time intentionally misspelling words because he knows blue check marks won't be able to resist commenting which brings more eyes to the thing in question...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom Lol you think this is important?? I'm  shocked Tom that some people that claim to be independent voters in these town halls aren't!! Doing the Lord's work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch He knows what he's doing. He knows blue check marks won't be able to resist commenting on it and that just brings more attention to Hunter Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast He knows what he's doing Tim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum What evidence do you have that this is Russian disinformation?? The Biden campaign has not denied the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamGeorgeFulton @inc_undertaker @davidfrum You don't think the moderator could have pushed back on Joe?? There were plenty of occassions but it never happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield So yes Biden is on tape saying $1 billion was being withheld until that individual was fired but he didn't say he was being fired for investigating Burisma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield The caveat is so far it's not been proven the reason the prosecutor was fired was because he was investigating Burisma. It's a slimy way to fact check the whole Ukraine thing using lawyer speak..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanchait @ggreenwald Are the emails real?? That is the crux of the issue the rest is all speculation at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMRMullen @alextdaugherty @seungminkim @realDonaldTrump @MayraJoli Oh and by the way while this was going on Joe Biden was holding a town hall moderated by Bill Clinton's former press secretary 😂 I see that doesn't bother you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMRMullen @alextdaugherty @seungminkim @realDonaldTrump @MayraJoli Did she ask a question?? Biden has had the easiest ride possible from the media and you still hate it that 1 Trump supporter got into a town hall and nodded!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizgarbus @sarahcpr You know what'll also get you really mad. Bill Clinton's former press secretary is "moderating" a town hall with the democrat candidate for president!! Fancy that!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizgarbus @sarahcpr Why?? You don't think there a democrats acting as independents in Biden's town halls? Didn't a bunch of "independents" get outed as registered democrats just a few weeks ago, did that fill you with rage too??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktumulty @cspan @SteveScully 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @SavannahGuthrie They know, they just like to pretend he hasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drstef @AriFleischer It'd be nice to have some follow up from the moderator e.g when Joe says he supports 8 year olds transitioning I'd like the moderator to dig deeper. Or when he says police should aim for legs I'd like him to be challenged on his statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vijaya Can you list all of the stories that have fallen foul of this policy since 2018, thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom Tom did you do the same when other "undecided" voters were shown to have been registered democrats?? Or is it only mijoirity women you go after??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesseKellyDC If only there were a moderator there who could ask follow up questions when someone makes an ignorant statement and push back against it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Benaskren It's like this every time so it's no surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GPIngersoll Every person that does this sort of thing with Trump acts in exactly the same way. Trump basically has to debate the moderator while Joe gets softball after softball with zero push back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks It's a standard contract you'd sign for a computer repair. It's not as if he was tricked into signing something that isn't standard practice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler @MattWalshBlog You should be!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarriageKids @BMarchetich @RyanLizza What about it is fake? Are the emails real? The Biden campaign have not denied the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanLizza Evidence it was stolen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMStedman Are the emails real? Are the photos of Hunter real? Are the videos of Hunter real? The Biden team did not dispute the authenticity of the emails in their statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danaiolos @LisaHagan7 If the email is real it's going to take a lot of creativity to come up with a scenario that isn't nefarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinjm1 Why hasn't the Biden team denied the authenticity of the emails if they are fake? They had the chance to do that yesterday and didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@writerfortheweb @justinjm1 A crack addict?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze B is probably worse but since there is a cross over between people that used to work for the Democrat party now having key roles at Facebook and Twitter that call probably didn't need to be made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@businessinsider Are the emails real or not, where they came from is less important. If they are real what does it matter where they came from anyway??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Sense__ @EliLake @MichaelRapaport  https://t.co/IMIP4vw7nn  Shouldn't be difficult to prove this one way or another. But as it stands currently the Biden campaign have not denied the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Sense__ @EliLake @MichaelRapaport Ok well this is the crux of the issue proving whether the emails are real or not. Biden's statement did not address this yesterday which is quite telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shoefaceblue @JDF1109 @EliLake Are the emails real or not. That really is the most important question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Sense__ @EliLake @MichaelRapaport That's less important than whether or not the emails are real or not. That's the crux of the matter if they are real emails then we have a big problem. The statement from Biden yesterday did not dispute the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChefBlaser @TeslaTunnel @EliLake It really hasn't been. The only "debunking" has been the claim that the Ukranian prosecutor was not fired because he was investigating Burisma. But nobody has proved the emails aren't real and the Biden statement did not challenge their authenticity which is quite telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChefBlaser @EliLake How do you know it's fake?? Are the emails real or not? The Biden campaign have not denied the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Bingo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hattiemdurant @meenaharris Why would you think that!? You're deranged, seek help please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true heads need to roll (they won't)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorganSilva3 Good old circular reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanJRobinson Cc: @ConceptualJames @HPluckrose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petestrzok @RepDougCollins are the emails real or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZZZJazzy The contencious part is whether it was done because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma. Notice this has very little to do with the posts story. They haven't said the emails aren't genuine which is the crux of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC makes you wonder what else Rudy has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrspeterson72 @benshapiro tell. They didn't deny the authenticity of the emails and they made a very carefully worded statement about Biden meeting the guy in question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrspeterson72 @benshapiro i'm not saying the story should be censored im saying before we make accusations we should make sure they are based on facts. I understand that standard isn't always applied but that doesn't mean we can't try and be better. The Biden team response to the story is a pretty big...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro position as VP to make himself and his family very wealthy as well as using his family name to buy "favours" for others. The blackmail potential alone if certain hostile actors have this information is a big enough story by itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro they're both pretty big stories although we have to wait until the Biden stuff has been proven correct but yeah the censorship of that story is probably more far reaching and more dangerous long term. But lets not downplay the possibility that Hunter Biden used his fathers...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawleyMO @TuckerCarlson @HawleyMO could you make sure to ask @jack to give you a full list of the stories that have fallen foul of this 2018 policy when you get to talk to him. I think it'll be enlightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog It would be very enlightening to see every story that has fallen foul of this 2018 policy. Cc @jack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beaud113 @GowerRobbie @NormOrnstein @alfranken @SenatorLeahy No I'm not the one fantasizing about Schiff going after supreme court justices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLastRefuge2 If the policy has been around since 2018 it'd be interesting to see a list of stories that have fallen foul of the policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asomer @redsteeze Yeah I saw that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GowerRobbie @NormOrnstein @alfranken @SenatorLeahy You really want to be fascists don't you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killfile @redsteeze yeah which is pretty telling in itself. There was no denial from the Biden campaign that the emails were authentic and some strange phrasing about no meeting in his official schedule. Often it's what they don't say that is interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze the only fact checking ive seen is they repeat that there is no evidence Biden helped get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine because he was investigating Burisma. Nothing about the details n the WP story, nothing about the authenticity of the emails etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atensnut @boogaloo_miss and Trump was impeached over stuff connected to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atensnut @boogaloo_miss they had it for a very long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot more to come, either the emails are real or they're not. If they're not lets see the evidence.   Emails reveal how Hunter Biden tried to cash in big with Chinese firm  https://t.co/QZVenTgeTq via @nypost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelixSturgeon @ggreenwald That's fair I've seen that too. Ok apologies for labelling you a Democrat. My point was every major establishment institution is against Trump the media, Hollywood, big tech monopolies, yet people try and pretend they are some sort of resistance. They are the mainstream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelixSturgeon @ggreenwald Ok your political ideology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarrMass @mallen2010 @GlennKesslerWP Should be easy to link where they've done this can you share it please? I'm particularly interested in the denial that the emails aren't real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JbkJbk1234 @robbysoave What evidence is there it was hacked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomdunn @DynamicAnalysis @ggreenwald @ChrisCornillie The emails specifically talk about Hunter using his influence. If the emails are real it is a big issue. And there's more to come according to Rudy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCornillie @ggreenwald A drug addict multi millionaire?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelixSturgeon @ggreenwald You have the media You have Hollywood You have big tech monopolies   You are NOT the resistance. You are siding with the establishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc Whether that bit is true or not the emails strongly suggest Hunter was being paid for access to the VP.  Are the emails real or not??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LostMyInvite @bariweiss Also what evidence do you have this information was obtained through hacking??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LostMyInvite @bariweiss Do you think this policy has been applied fairly? It would be nice to have a list of all the stories this policy has been used on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgross2812 @bariweiss What disinformation? Are the emails real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes What part of the story is disinformation? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jack @nypost Can you list all of the stories this policy has been applied to??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Hot take<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/qu79mS415J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/7ZKyVGYzsZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goreadalready @CSmall088 @samstein  https://t.co/CAqmrghtOj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @HawleyMO they are similar but not in direct competition with each other. They are both monoplies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @HawleyMO yeah facebook and twitter arent the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @HawleyMO yes, twitter and facebook are monopolies they absolutely fit that definition. So brave of you to come out in support of billion dollar companies though that are deciding what is and isn't newsworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goreadalready @CSmall088 @samstein yeah, thats not why they blocked it, they let fake stories run all the time. Keep watching there's more to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoopersTulpa @MomentoAnima @guypbenson yeah that's called circular reporting where they all verify each other. None of them went on the record did they? meanwhile around 20 people did go on the record including people that were on the trip in question and directly refuted key parts of that story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @HawleyMO yeah i wouldnt bet on that. Its really sad that because they favour your side (at the moment) this doesn't bother you. Monopolies deciding what is or isn't relevant news, monopolies deciding what is valid reporting and what isn't. You do understand the danger of that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goreadalready @CSmall088 @samstein lol that makes no sense. Now everyone will think the emails are genuine. And i've seen nobody provide any evidence that the emails themselves are fake. If they were fake all it would have taken is Biden to say so during the statement they made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr When those private companies become monopolies and they start deciding what people should or shouldn't see yes it's a massive problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr It's sad you don't care because they favour your team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr You need to follow @HawleyMO the legislation has already been drafted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr They screwed up today, they can be legislated against.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Where did trumps tax info come from? Also where is your evidence this information was stolen?? According to the story the laptop was left at the repair shop past the 30 days. That's not stolen information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr You don't think that choosing to censor a story that is damaging to a presidential candidate is election interference?? When big tech decides what stories can be shared and what can't they are absolutely interfering in the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoopersTulpa @MomentoAnima @guypbenson There was circular verification and none of them went on the record. About 20 people did go on the record to dispute the story including people like John Bolton that are hardly fans of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr What Facebook and Twitter did today is more election interference than Russia got up to in 2016, it's a very big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok I care so that's one more than nobody and Facebook and Twitter cared enough to take unprecedented steps to try and censor this story. That's now a bigger story than the Hunter Biden story and believe me lots of people do care about big tech censorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@budgiesmuggle45 @kpoulsen @nypost But they made a point to talk about the meeting but not the emails. The emails are key, if they are fake there is no story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Maybe they knew more is coming and panicked? Rudy says they have stuff for the next 5 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goreadalready @CSmall088 @samstein But they did respond and they did not dispute the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kpoulsen @nypost Why do you think the Biden statement did not dispute the authenticity of the emails? If they were fake you'd think they'd say that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Just because you say nobody cares about this story doesn't make it so. If Hunter Biden was using his father's position to make shady deals that is a big story whether you like it or not. I get it your team is being accused of something and you don't like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStrangerInThe1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok just to be accurate, the Biden team released a statement that said there was no meeting according to his official schedule. That's not the same as saying there was no meeting. They also did not dispute the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Popehat Are the emails real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickjnewman @nortouQ @SohrabAhmari @YahooFinance You should pass that onto Mueller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr Bye Mr Alternative Fax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebekahkfreitas @DonaldJTrumpJr The key question should be are the emails real. I've heard nothing from Biden that disputes their authenticity. Also have you heard of Google? You can find all sorts of information on there including phone numbers for lawyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr Lol ✌ very productive discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw @daveblend Since you're a lawyer I'm sure accuracy is important to you and what they actually said was they checked his schedule from that time frame and there was no meeting on his schedule. I notice they also did not refute the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr :/ lol the panic is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MomentoAnima @guypbenson The Atlantic ran a story a few weeks ago totally comprising of "unnamed sources" guess who didn't censure that story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffyJM @SusanLetournea6 @DonaldJTrumpJr The Biden team released a statement that said there was no meeting according to his official schedule. That's not the same as saying there was no meeting. They also did not dispute the authenticity of the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr Often with these types of statements what they don't say is more interesting than what they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveblend @DonaldJTrumpJr You're not being accurate. The Biden team released a statement that said there was no meeting according to his official schedule. That's not the same as saying there was no meeting. They also did not dispute the authenticity of the emails...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanLetournea6 @DonaldJTrumpJr Can you link me where it's been debunked thanks? I'd like to see the evidence that the emails aren't real. Thanks again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ @MaxBoot @RichardGrenell Aren't you the person that said it was really difficult to get a FISA warrant??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goreadalready @CSmall088 @samstein I can't but it's not difficult if you're a tech expert. I saw the Biden comments on the story and they never mentioned that the emails weren't real. You'd think they'd say that if they were fake wouldn't you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSmall088 @samstein Can you link me the evidence that the emails are fake? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZanderNassikas @j_arthur_bloom @politicalelle Yeah that's what I'm saying the key question is are the e-mails real? The Biden team made a statement and nowhere in it did they say the emails were fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidCornDC Is the email real? That's a key question. I haven't seen Biden claim the email is fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterLaPrade @Olivianuzzi What part of the story is not factual??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leslie_h_b @Olivianuzzi What part of the story is disinformation?? What did you think of the Atlantic story a few weeks ago??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZanderNassikas @j_arthur_bloom @politicalelle The emails / photos are evidence they had access to some personal information. Nobody has claimed the email isn't real. Now compare this with the Atlantic story a few weeks ago that consisted entirely of unnamed sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sydrasmith @wawasense @greg_price11 Yup. Judge the evidence on its merits is the email real or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @HawleyMO @Facebook What did you think of the Atlantic story a few weeks ago. That was heavily disputed, did Facebook censor it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UapostropheR @willchamberlain What about it is fake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wawasense @greg_price11 Giuliani said there's much more going to be released over the next 5 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yair_Rosenberg @MZHemingway Yup they screwed up on this one, not only bringing more sunlight to the story but showing their clear bias in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasf_Jasf @MusingDave @yashar What part of the story is false?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr They are covering it up right before our eyes. Unfortunately for them all that'll do is bring more people to the story while pulling back the curtain once and for all on their clear bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanchait The question should be are they real or not? The Biden statement did not deny the accuracy of the email. Sunlight on shady dealings is a good thing Jonathan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The attempted suppression of the Hunter Biden story by Twitter and Facebook is only going to bring more light to it. #HuntersEmails #HunterBidenEmails #hunterbiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultiseo @pandaliiiife @benshapiro all im saying is lets investigate the claims. It's not difficult to verify the email and see if it is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultiseo @pandaliiiife @benshapiro you obviously don't know what zen means then. All i'm saying is that this is a story that shouldn't be dismissed out of hand which is what you seemed to want to do. You have no way of knowing how accurate it is either yet you seem to have made up your mind....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymstone could you list all of the stories you've applied this principle to? it would be interesting to see if a pattern emerges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaykayokay2020 @AdPowPow @NatashaBertrand based on reviewing his official schedule. So a meeting that wasn't written in his official schedule could have taken place. Also they don't deny the authenticity of the email itself which is interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec yup what they don't say is more important than what they do say. They don't deny the validity of the email.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec they didn't deny the validity of the email.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaykayokay2020 @AdPowPow @NatashaBertrand lol i notice they never denied the accuracy of the email. All they said was there was not a meeting on Bidens official schedule, that doesn't mean a meeting never took place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatashaBertrand so they didn't deny the emails are real, and they don't deny a meeting took place only that there wasn't one on the official schedule. Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaBritton some of the most abusive comments I see on my twitter are aimed at conservative women from so called feminists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar i've tried to end this conversation politely and yet you continue to tweet at me, that story has nothing to do with anything we were talking about. Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymstone enjoy the ratio, all this is going to do is alert more people to this story and highlight your clear bias and interference 3 weeks before an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @jmurph692 @esaagar therefore it's obviously true right? lol. Such a weak argument, i think we're wasting each others time, have a good day. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar :/ Yeah you have nothing in terms of actual evidence all you have is "if it weren't true he would sue, therefore it's true" and "the only reason people refuted it is because they are afraid" that is pure speculation and is such a bad argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @jmurph692 @esaagar the 20 plus people that came out and refuted the story including people on the trip in question that directly contradicted claims the atlantic story makes is another way of setting the record straight without having to go to court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar :/ what i wrote really wasn't complicated but I can simplify it for you if you like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar yes you can sue but according to you if you choose not to that means you're guilty of what you are being accused of. Such a stupid argument. Why not judge the evidence provided on both sides?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar is a good enough standard for this type of story. There is far more evidence on the side of this story being bs, because you have people that have gone on the record to refute key parts of it, including people like John Bolton whose not a big Trump fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar ok he was accused of something with zero evidence other than "unnamed sources". And according to you unless he takes them to court it means he's guilty of what he's accused of? what about the burden of proof on the people making the claim? do you think unnamed sources...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar you are advocating for completly flipping the legal standard where someone that is accused of something has to prove their innocence and the people doing to accusing don't have to prove anything. Scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar that's the completeness of your argument? if someone does not sue it means they are guilty. You must see that is a terrible argument is basically blames the victim. It also places the burden on the accused to prove their innocence and not the accuser to prove guilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar and you completely dismiss this story within hours of it being posted before any digging has been done into whether it is true or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar You believe a story with 0 on the record sources that has been refuted by over a dozen people many of whom were with Trump when this is supposed to have happened, including people like John Bolton who refuted key aspects of the story...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymstone What did Facebook do with the Atlantic story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar Trump denied the story and about 20 people refuted it. I don't think the president should be wasting his time suing newspapers but if your argument is anyone that doesn't sue for a story is guilty it's a terrible argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveNotFear42 @esaagar Why doesn't Hilary Clinton sue the people that say she has people killed? I think you know the answer :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultiseo @pandaliiiife @benshapiro Do they send selfies of them passed out with a crack pipe or stuff of a sexual nature? My point is the photos are obviously extremely personal and would suggest they had access to some personal information. Sure not evidence which is why journalists need to dig and find out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC Those photos suggest they have personal information of Hunter. It shouldn't be difficult to verify the email correspondence. Of course someone could ask Hunter if it's genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboyangels @esaagar Seems like Comey did. He testified under oath he didn't bother asking who Steele's source was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar The same people that pushed the Atlantic story as if it's proven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultiseo @pandaliiiife @benshapiro The photos are of Hunter right? Would suggest they do have his hard drive. Shouldn't be difficult to verify the validity of the correspondence of course actual journalists could ask him if they're genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paultiseo @benshapiro I bet you believed the Atlanta story. Things like emails can be verified so why not wait for experts to look into it rather than dismiss it out of hand?? Has anybody asked Hunter if the emails are real??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Keep carrying water Kyle. An actual journalist would be asking questions about this story not desperately trying to downplay it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Did you share the Atlantic story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw @ThomboyD Let me guess, you believed the Atlantic story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller When you're used to having no push back this is how you react.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's someone that asked whether Guam was at risk from capsizing and they aren't the dumbest person in Washington #BarrettHearing #BarrettHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino And that includes the dude that asked whether Guam could capsize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LooMPK @SouthPoint1000 @mkraju @tedcruz exactly the same would be true of any democratic nominee to the supreme court. They pick idealogues that they align with politically. This isn't some great secret, there is big money funding extremely liberal judges all accross america too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LooMPK @SouthPoint1000 @mkraju @tedcruz nope but interesting he's not concerned with "dark money" that's helping to push an agenda he supports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayBrook1 @mkraju lol ill summarise it for you...  https://t.co/0LXHfjrzBR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthPoint1000 @mkraju and then @tedcruz highlighted his rank hypocricy in about 5min.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Whitehouse talking about George Soros?? #ACBHearings #ACB #ACBconfirmation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my3monkees Yup for every anecdote they have to support it you could easily find one that highlights its inadequacies. Our cheapest coverage was a similar price and it basically didn't cover us for anything. We decided to take the penalty instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMur67617612 @benshapiro Lol you know the graph is pure manipulation of statistics. Why start in June? Also it covers cases not deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomaskenn since you talked about deaths I've another fancy little graphic for you...   https://t.co/78vb4JnahV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomaskenn 1. they used June as a starting point for a reason.  2. this shows cases not deaths 3. have a look at deaths per capita<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanTho98192182 It's even more ironic when you see he mixed up 56% with 54% even though he'd been given the 56% number seconds earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewFoldi @KamalaHarris do you still think Joe Biden is a racist? Do you still believe the woman that accused Joe of raping her? What is a woman?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Legalator @KamalaHarris #AskKamala do you still think Joe Biden is a racist? Do you still believe the woman that accused Joe of raping her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @timkaine Why doesn't he say that then instead of I'll let you know after the election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyBaumeist1 @abigailmarone @SteveGuest Try and answer this honestly. If the roles were reversed do you think the democrats would fill this vacancy??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigailmarone Imagine if we had a media that challenged both sides consistently. This is what happens when Biden's team is asked proper questions which are followed up properly. And they are always found wanting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather I see you got the new talking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@golferdawn @JRubinBlogger @OrrChris @Susan_Hennessey The problem is this was an issue raised by democrats not Trump. It was people like Schumer and Pelosi that said nothing is off the table, it's a valid question to ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray Sargon should sue again for this.  https://t.co/X3MV307OXV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rahvyn311 @Timcast @Foster_Freak The problem is if you attend of these protests where antifa black bloc are present, fascist basically means anyone they disagree with politically. You can see how that might be problematic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules  https://t.co/RdkiMEUkbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro  https://t.co/RdkiMEUkbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimboa25 @jontalotta @guypbenson Yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jontalotta @guypbenson Try and answer this honestly. Do you think if the situation were reversed the democrats would fill the vacancy??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster By dodging republicans can draw the valid conclusion that they're dodging a very simple yes or no because they plan to do it so it can still be used effectively to motivate conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@germanrlopez The problem is by dodging is the republicans can take that as a yes and still rile up their base. It's a completely valid conclusion to draw that not answering a very simple yes or no question suggests they plan to do it but don't want to say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregmitrovich @germanrlopez Every conservative I know cares about the supreme court, to the point many will hold their nose to vote for Trump to stop it being packed by liberal ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Fact check?? Cc @ddale8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SemiramisRising @AdamInHTownTX @DeniseShearin @jeneps So if Trump wins you'll be ok with him adding a few extra supreme court judges? Haven't you learnt the lessons of Harry Reid??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeneps He said it wasn't constitutional if they filled the spot, care to fact check that statement??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhark1 @4social_justice @Acyn Sure there's nothing unconstitutional about filling the seat. And to pretend the democrats wouldn't do the same in the same scenario is being disingenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4social_justice @Acyn Do you honestly think Schumer and Pelosi wouldn't fill this seat if there were a democratic president?? Both sides are hypocrites let's not pretend otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeizenbergBB @Timcast Yeah I get that, this way though the left can't be sure they'll do it and the republicans can argue a non answer means they will. Seems like the worst of both worlds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisherofmeh @JoeBiden You don't deserve to know mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeizenbergBB @Timcast I guess but by not answering it the republicans can take that as a yes and use it to get conservatives out to vote. The supreme court is a massive issue for most conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orhodeda @Timcast That might be true but one thing that will motivate conservatives even those that hate Trump is the supreme court. Those conservative principles on issues like abortion, the 2A are much bigger than Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast The supreme court is going to be packed with liberal ideologues. By not answering the question it's fair to make the inference they intend to do it. The supreme court is a huge issue for conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast I'd love to know which strategist thought this was the best way to approach this issue. If you're part of Trumps campaign you've got to hammer this point. There are a good number of conservatives that don't like Trump and won't vote for him that will if they think there's a risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaleandSpinach @DNDDPM @RichardGrenell No I'm saying they won't vote Trump but if they think the supreme court is going to be backed with liberal ideologues they will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatme123 @ARSquared @ArthurSchwartz His base might be fine with it but there are probably a decent number of republicans that don't like Trump that will hold their nose and vote for him if they think Biden will pack the supreme court with liberal ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaleandSpinach @DNDDPM @RichardGrenell By not answering the question it allows the republicans to run on the theory that he will and that might scare enough conservatives to whom the supreme court is a huge issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaleandSpinach @DNDDPM @RichardGrenell I think it's a terrible strategy. One thing that might make a bunch of republicans that don't like Trump, hold their noses and vote for him is the idea that Biden is going to pack the supreme court with liberal ideologues....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRHLofficial Right Said Fred?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwindheim @RoverGrover @RadioFreeTom Just out of interest where do you get your news from??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenoCow @RadioFreeTom How do you stop left wing media bias? Have you seen CNN or MSNBC lately. If you think this is only a fox news problem it's because you're living in a bubble or don't care because you agree with them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper helpful. I'm not sure how we get back to something like normalcy in terms of political disagreements but if you think it's going away when Trump is no longer president you're kidding yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper :/ this is the rhetoric lots of people hear every day on CNN, and MSNBC that rhetoric has an effect on how liberals see conservatives.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper There is plenty of extreme language on the left.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper But we were talking about the incident in Michigan and so far I've seen nothing linking these people to the Republican party or Trump.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper Extreme rhetoric on the left and right has possible dangerous implications.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper There was plenty of anti Republican sentiment from Bernie and one of his supporters shot a bunch of republicans.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper i don't think you needed Trump for people to think that.

<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper and it was a member of the militia that helped the FBI stop this right? Still haven't seen anything substantial linking this to Trump. Not everything is about Trump you know. There are extremist groups on the right and the left and they're both probably feeling pretty emboldened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper well when you're blaming Trump for this you'd better have something substantial rather than a feeling. The members of this group I've seen were anarchists, anarchists tend not to like government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gallowglass321 @immamajojo @Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GovWhitmer @MSNBC @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews @cspan @ABC @chucktodd @jaketapper so the group was identified in March and Trump tweeted in April and May. Is March before April and May??  https://t.co/CA6IU4Gmpl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci @FoxNews @gretchenwhitmer @realDonaldTrump evidence that they are white supremacists? ive seen evidence that they are anarchists. oh also this...   https://t.co/yDFBtKHuFr  i guess they are time travelling white supremacists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich if you're eldery and a conservative though don't you think the threat of the democrats stacking the surpreme court with liberal idealogues is the sort of thing that will make someone hold their nose and vote for Trump? Those conservative values supercede any individual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands  https://t.co/yDFBtKHuFr  I guess Trumps a time traveller too!! he inspired these guys with a tweet he hadn't even sent when this was planned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog I can't think of a better reason for people to hold their noses and vote for Trump than the thought of the democrats packing the supreme court with liberal ideologues. They've got to hammer this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yup and you have the perfect opportunity to reach those people with the democrats refusing to answer if they'll pack the supreme court...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey Please explain how the press is desperate to prove they are tough on Biden. I've seen no evidence of that, not one bit. If you think asking him if he'll pack the supreme court is being tough that just illustrates how one sided the media has become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MPRadamacue @insipidwanker @neontaster So back to the endless war party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands :/ what is Zen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC And many media outlets will go out of business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands Sure but don't you think the governor should have proof of that before she holds a press conference and spouts it out as it it's a fact??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands Hasn't stopped the governor already blaming Trump. You think that's helpful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelhannaford @JoeTalkShow The proud boys aren't a hate group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands That's your evidence??! This was during a lockdown where the Governer was being incredibly strict, Trump was clearly talking about that. If you're going to blame this on Trump based on that I don't know what else to say...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlwatkin @CamEdwards @scottsands Sure but there's no evidence of this is there?? Or are we just randomly blaming Trump for literally everything that happens at the moment??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitalpoet @philllosoraptor @RoncoJollyHen @DavidAFrench Where did you get the idea he called the virus a hoax? Liberal media? I think you just proved everyone's point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoncoJollyHen @philllosoraptor @DavidAFrench What about on other issues?? Unless you're claiming the liberal media never misleads its viewers??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredgiblet @DaryRezvani Yeah and anarchists in general don't tend to like govt so I doubt they're fans of any president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaryRezvani Also fyi anarchists don't tend to be far right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaryRezvani Yeah I don't think you've spent much time with the far left. I have and I can tell you it doesn't stop at "free" healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Cc: @ddale8 wanna do your job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @jonathanvswan And vote for him more than the idea that Biden is going to pack the supreme court with left wing ideologues. Does he think not saying either way will stop the republicans confirming?? Because if that's his strategy I'm not sure what he's based that on. They will confirm ACB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @jonathanvswan They've already said they're confirming her. This is such a dumb strategy from Biden because the only inference you can make is he will pack the supreme court and I can't think of something  that will motivate those conservatives that don't like Trump to hold their noses...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimStrassel This is such a bad strategy. Can you think of anything that will motivate Trump hating conservatives more to hold their noses and vote for him than the thought of Biden packing the supreme court with far left ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh Many people did die during the protests. You have no idea how many attempts on the presidents life but have been stopped. Let's not forget it's trumps FBI that stopped this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh Sure but his ideology is not right wing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhenson56 @emilyelarsen You're not stupid you know expanding the supreme court is a huge issue and Biden's failure to answer this question is baffling. At it's going to do is motivate conservatives that might not vote for Trump to turn out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimAlberta Looks like at least one of them was an anarchist. Anarchists tend not to be right wing...   https://t.co/0HOqP5DKJF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh Oh and by the way, anarchists don't tend to be on the right...   https://t.co/0HOqP5DKJF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh Remember this guy?  https://t.co/GtjUhNN9bt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh Yeah I guess you've not been paying attention to what's been happening the last few months. If you don't think there are people on the far left prepared to commit violence you must be living in a cave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar You've got to vote for the bill to see what's in the bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antiscarcity @esaagar Who are you taking about here? I think you've got your stories mixed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Such a bizarre stance and they need to be hammered on it. One thing that might motivate conservatives that hate Trump to vote for him is the idea of the democrats packing the supreme court with left wing ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elspethmchugh @brett_hartl @mbieseck Maybe statistically at the moment but to deny what's happening on the far left at the moment is foolish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @neontaster hmm which groups have been targeting law enforcement and federal buildings for the past few months?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wesconsin @AP i think you're going to be disapointed when these people are named. Which groups have been threatening law enforcement and targeting federal buildings for the last few months?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP hmm i wonder what groups have been targeting the police and federal buildings 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_xander7 @AP not the same incident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emptywheel @AdamParkhomenko Remember this guy??  https://t.co/Xp2vpnwwHn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emptywheel @AdamParkhomenko Yeah and the FBI stopped it. Nobody has ever claimed there aren't extremists on the right and left. It's not difficult to condemn both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brett_hartl @mbieseck You know both things can be true right? There can be extreme threats on the right and on the left. It shouldn't be difficult to condemn both.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1 What does that have to do with Zen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_g_graham @GarrettVentry The point is the moderator didn't ask it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Lol this is the first thing I thought of when I saw that clip. MSNBC has basically become infowars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayer @randycohen918 @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok 3 sec. :/ I've seen other reports that Kamala spoke for 2min more, but I've not checked myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC That's Vice President Pence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1 And? You obviously don't know what Zen is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayer @randycohen918 @DonaldJTrumpJr People that timed it say she spoke for approx 2 min more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeadExplodn @funny_Jesus_Nut @davidmweissman @marcorubio Not allowing inspectors into Wuhan for months didn't help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeadExplodn @funny_Jesus_Nut @davidmweissman @marcorubio You don't have to believe covid 19 was created in a lab to understand China could have done much more to contain it within Wuhan and prepare the rest of the world as much as possible....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonkarl If only there was a profession whose job it was to ask these sorts of questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1 I never posted anything in support of anyone. I saw talking about Kamala and her failure to answer a simple question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenBurgis @ComicDaveSmith It's a terrible bluff though because by refusing to answer the republiucans can scare their base that they plan to do it. Even conservatives that hate Trump might hold their nose and vote for him if they think the supreme court will be packed with liberal ideologues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMitrops @VP @KamalaHarris Why didn't you fact check Kamala?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayer @randycohen918 @DonaldJTrumpJr She spoke for longer than him. And she interrupted too, it's a debate that's what happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sternergulch @nchaseteeples @HolmesJosh yeah no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller even MSNBC was like...  https://t.co/aGWA8pdhEr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1 you brought up this ridiculous point. What are you trying to say?? It's quite telling the liberal media want to focus on a fly and not the actual debate, tells me they know Kamala did a terrible job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokeDon @SSads1757 @neontaster but not saying it is the worst of both worlds. Conservatives can use the non answer as saying they're going to pack the courts so you'd better get out and vote, and it might turn off some Bernie / AOC types.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@voodoo_thing @neontaster they may never vote democrat but there will be some that won't vote for Trump so stay home. The supreme court issue is one that might motivate conservatives that don't like Trump to vote rather than stay home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSads1757 @WokeDon @neontaster i think it's the opposite they don't want to motivate conservatives. I think if you look at it as an equation coming out and saying you wont pack the supreme court loses them fewer voters from Bernie, AOC types than saying you will pack the court adds voters to Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokeDon @SSads1757 @neontaster that they will but they don't want to say they will because they know it'll become a big campaign issue. It would be the easiest thing in the world to say no if that was their position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokeDon @SSads1757 @neontaster getting those conservatives out to vote that don't like Trump could be the difference. If they aren't going to do it why the failure to answer a very simple question? whether they will or not their failure to give that question a straight answer certainly gives the impression...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster but there are conservatives that don't like Trump that might be motivated to turn out if they think Biden is going to pack the supreme court with liberal idealogues. They need to hammer this point over an over becasue a failure to answer it clearly makes it pretty obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokeDon @SSads1757 @neontaster its an issue that would get conservatives motivated to vote, even if they dislike Trump, issues like abortion and the 2A are key issues and if they think Biden will pack the supreme court full of liberal ideologues it would motivate some conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster absolutely. Although the repeated failure to answer the question about packing the supreme court is something they have to push. Even conservatives that don't like Trump would turn out for him if they understand a Biden administration would turn the supreme court liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1  https://t.co/8AlwpO0F5U  is this CGI?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@randycohen918 @DonaldJTrumpJr no he was not, they were debating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ijbailey @CHSommers it was a debate, both of them interupted each other it's what you do in a debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1  https://t.co/1S69B7NAPj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_a_1 ??  https://t.co/PfBpNGdexr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger packing the supreme court is so popular neither Biden or Harris can answer a simple yes or no question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRuffalo @KamalaHarris it was a debate, that requires some sort of back and forth. You know this but you're thirsty for likes and retweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr responding to a woman during a debate is now mansplaining. the only way he could have avoided this is saying nothing for a few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddieStan who was the primary source for the Steele dossier that Hilary Clinton paid for??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fireupchips90 @JonahDispatch im not talking about Trump i'm talking about Biden, i realise you can't talk about Biden without mentioning Trump but im not playing that game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala Harris (after avoiding answering the court packing question) "ok, lets talk about packing the court" proceeds to avoid answering the question. #VPDebate #VPDebates2020 #VPDebateTakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fireupchips90 @JonahDispatch lol or someone that knows he has nothing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fireupchips90 @JonahDispatch sure when you get nothing but soft balls its not difficult to look good. But he does ramble on and often lose track of what he's saying. He called time on himself during the democrat debates!! who does that!!??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch watching the town hall with Biden i do think it's a better strategy to let him ramble on rather than interrupt him. He often will say something like "i've been talking too long" or like in one of the democrat debates actually call time on himself!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nchaseteeples @HolmesJosh that's not the point being made. Why would you just announce it before you've talked to the campaigns?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xan_desanctis nah, a fly landed on Pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump if you believe he will be using a teleprompter there are things you can do to throw him off his script and make him look silly. Instead of seeing it as a problem see it as an opportunity to expose how much of a "virtual" candidate he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav if this happens, Trump just needs to go off script as much as possible, ask him stuff he can't plan for and let him talk once he gets going because he always ends up losing his train of thought and going off on a strange tangent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenGe03007175 @HawleyMO and why might it be at 7.9% 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawleyMO It's a pretty simple question to answer no to if you have no plans to do any of that. That neither Biden or Harris can give a clear answer to a simple question pretty much tells you what they'll do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @KamalaHarris @KamalaHQ Good job social distancing 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeadExplodn @mitchellreports @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Lol what is wrong with her tweet. They have continued to avoid answering a very simple yes or no question. It's pretty obvious why, if the answer was no they'd have no trouble saying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atomicdoug @BillOReilly you should have a look at some of the liberal judges that have been appointed. Judge Sullivan is a good place to start. Both sides are filling the courts with ideologues when they get the chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osage25 @KimStrassel And Hilary advised Biden not to concede whatever the result. This is clearly a democratic talking point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump said he had been misrepresented by Steele and that the information was mostly bar room gossip. The FISA court was never made aware of this. They didn't even tell the court the Steele dossier was paid for by the DNC!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump that's not what im talking about, ill accept there was a valid reason to start the investigation. That doesn't mean there were valid reasons to continue it when they kept finding exculpatory evidence. For example, in 2017 the primary source of the steele dossier when questioned..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump meant was there was no documents that said "we have politcial bias" and when he questioned the agents they told him they were not biased. But he makes it very clear especially in terms of withholding information from the FISA court he cannot rule out political bias as a motive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump did you watch the clip I posted, they are his own words not an article about the report. He is very clear he cannot rule out political bias when it comes to certain aspects of the investigation. He said in the report he found no evidence for bias but clarified that all this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump listen to Horowitz's testimony again. He said several times once the exculpatory information was discovered it should have been presented to the FISA court and it was not. In fact it was withheld from the FISA court when the warrants were renewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump whether or not there was a legitimate reason to start the investigation and Horowitz testified the bar for starting an investigation is extremely low, there was certainly reason to pull the breaks once the exculpatory information was found and that did not happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump the new declassified documents might bring into question whether the investigation was legally started, but putting that to one side here's what he said about political bias...   https://t.co/lxmOvIYzEb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump lol Horowitz said he found no evidence of political bias which he clarified as saying when he asked the individuals if they were biased they told him no. But he did also say he could not rule out political bias as an explanation for some of the things that happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump they failed to tell the court all of that so they could spy on Carter Paige and using the 2 step rule spy on the Trump campaign. They knew all along and went along with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump exculpatory information from the court e.g. the fact the steele dossier was paid for opposition research, the fact the primary source of the information was a suspected russian spy, the fact the source under oath testified the information was mostly bar room gossip etc etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump both of those things can be true. They knew right at the beginning that the whole Trump / Russia thing was a Clinton smear campaign and went along with it anyway so they could spy on Trump. They lied several times to the FISA court to get the warrant on Carter Paige and withheld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump by a suspected Russian spy who was known to the intelligence agencies. They ignored all of that and used the dirt to weaponise the intelligence agencies to spy on Carter Paige (illegally) and therefore the Trump campaign because of the 2 step rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jusjules2 @RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump no i didn't say that. Russia (and others) have tried to meddle in the US elections for decades, what is important is the scale and scope of it. But both things can be true, Russia could have meddled in the elections AND Hilary paid for dirt on Trump that was provided....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump yeah not going to disagree with that on both sides they're full of hyprocricy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge you make so many assumptions about me without knowing me. I am not a fan of the intelligence agencies, i am well aware of the shady shit they've done for decades (way before 2001 by the way) the difference is im not defending them because they went after Trump, you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump why do you assume i didn't? you know nothing about me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump the FBI and CIA acted criminally and abused their powers and you're defending them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge you don't care that the intelligence agencies knowingly lied to a FISA court (many times) in order to spy on an American citizen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump :/ didn't you want to know what was in those missing emails?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump using the intelligence agencies to spy on a political campaign by weaponising dirt given to you by a suspected russian spy and paid for by the opposition party should worry you. That it doesn't says a lot. I think we're wasting each others time. Have a good day. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge who wasn't listening? you know nothing about me. Interesting that your morality is so easily manipulated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray @JRubinBlogger  oh dear. this is gold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump lol it's so funny seeing liberals defending the CIA and FBI, i remember when you guys used to be rightly suspicious of them. Now CNN and MSNBC has them on as experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump it's not legal to lie to a FISA court. It's not legal to hide information from a FISA court that might damage your case to get a warrant. There was exculpatory evidence they knew it and they didn't disclose it because they didn't care. They wanted an in to the Trump campaign...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump he was also talking about Russia in that tweet but i see you ignored that bit. But if you believe the recently declassified notes it says part of the reason Hilary tried to link Trump to Russia was to take the heat away from the email stuff, but for me that's secondary...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes who do you think tweets for Biden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump they knew all this and still lied to a FISA court so they could spy on Carter Paige and in effect spy on Trump because of the 2 step rule. If that doesn't concern you I don't know what to say but im not surprised because if its something against Trump you don't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Russia investigation and still using a dossier they knew was sourced by a suspected Russian spy to get access to the Trump campaign. We know Hilary DID pay someone to get dirt on Trump, the source of that information was someone suspected of being a Russian spy 15 years ago!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump you don't get it, this isn't about Hilary's emails. Did you even read the recently declassified notes from Brennan? This is about Hilary trying to link Trump to Russia as a political ploy, the CIA reporting it to Obama so they knew about it but still went ahead with the bogus...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealManInCharge @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump :/ sure, lets just see what the documents say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Why not read the documents and see what they say?? We know your mind is made up and you really don't care but others want to know what they have been hiding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Why are you afraid of declassifications?? We know most of you will just ignore it if it's damaging anyway. But don't you want to know what was happening??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald @MollyJongFast Yeah you don't get it. Hilary DID pay for dirt on Trump and the primary source was a suspected Russian spy who they knew about 15 years ago. They knew all this and still went ahead with their bogus investigation because they wanted an in into the Trump campaign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDemsLeftMe @robbystarbuck Doing something without needing the dems and republicans to agree would be a killer move and really show them up. He should do whatever he can legally to bypass the process because it's obviously stuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonKMetrics @robbystarbuck They didn't ignore it they just don't agree with using the money to bail out failed states, give money to illegal aliens and pass a bunch of election stuff that has nothing to do with covid relief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbystarbuck Trump needs to take whatever action is within his power to help the citizens that doesn't require the dems and republicans to agree because they obviously can't agree on anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckysartor @benshapiro The people aren't getting help, the democrats and republicans can't agree on anything you can blame either side but the fact is both sides are to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kennygee250 @benshapiro Pelosi isn't interested in a deal that doesn't include all her crazy stuff. Not voting for Trump isn't going to get you a cheque, the cheque isn't coming because neither side can agree on anything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV @TMuk_news 9, getting Thiago alone makes it a fantastic window but Jota looks really good so far and we've needed a backup for Robertson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Original_Geezer @indykaila @Sanchooo10 @LFC I'd wager Salah or Mane will be sold next summer. Liverpool try and sell when the player is at top value and age wise it'd make sense. Sancho is also a nike athlete and Nike will probably want a big Nike player at Liverpool.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller You know you can turn off your phone and uninstall Twitter. I think it'd do wonders for your mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch @andrewrobertso5 one of the few that came out of the game with any sort of credit. Never stopped trying and Villa had very little joy down his side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP the opposition a lot of optimism if they can get it right. We control lots of the game but when we give up opportunities often they are very good ones because of the way we play. As we saw yesterday if the pressure from the front and midfield isn't right it's suicidal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP think we'll see a bit more pragmatism with Allison out which isn't a bad thing. With the front 3 we have and the 2 fullbacks plus Thiago to come in a bring more control we should be more than good enough to beat most teams without defending such a high line which does offer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJase @KarlThyer And that's suicidal. But it was a system failure yesterday that started from not getting the right pressure from the front or midfield and the defence couldn't deal with the 1v1s well at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesleaprice @VillaJase @KarlThyer Klopps done it before he won't try and keep the score down when things are going badly he'll always keep pushing because his philosophy is it's 3 points you don't lose more than 3 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJase @KarlThyer Holding a high line is fine if you pressure the man in possession and if you run backwards once the long ball has been played. If it continues to be an issue it's not difficult to defend 10 yards deeper. Several times yesterday they tried to play offside on the halfway line...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJase @KarlThyer There were things Liverpool didn't do. if you don't put pressure on the player with the ball it's easier to play those balls over the top, Liverpool were far too passive in transition where often they'll commit a foul or force the player backwards...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @SaysSimonson @Olivianuzzi  https://t.co/PEypIPoMHR  Is this the part where you pretend you haven't seen your lies debunked??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cudasbob @realtommyheslin @Susan_Hennessey Perfectly rational response. We don't like it that you get to pick a supreme court judge so we're going to make it so we become a one party state if we win. Yeah that'll have no bad consequences.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrPhillipsMD why don't doctors and nurses have to be quarantined for 14 days as soon as they come into contact with a covid patient?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richarlison97 hope your manager doesn't see this, its the sort of arrogant behavious he hates from his players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Ancelloti will hate that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IshEverything @PumpItIH Utd don't have Thiago to drop into this team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think we'll find out half that team have covid? Something wasn't right in terms of the energy and intensity #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers Yup big picture is it's one game and hopefully it has a positive impact and a reminder we need to be focussed every game.   Thiago will be in this team soon and he will take us up another level. Huge wake up call for some players but they have earnt the odd bad day at the office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some positive things to remember after that embarrassment...  1. Thiago will play soon and he will transform this team  2. Often these sorts of results result in a bit of a wake up call and back to basics approach   3. It's one game. 3 points. It's not the end of the world #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half the team have covid it's the only explanation for the lethargy. #VILLIV #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanCare @Knox_Harrington It's easy when the player in possession has no pressure on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers I don't think Allison has much to do with this bar the 1st goal which fair enough did set the tone. But if you can't put more pressure on the man on the ball and you defend so high you've got to be switched on and aggressive and we've been neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanCare @Knox_Harrington When we defend as high as we do 5-10 yards isn't a huge deal. Gotta put more pressure on the passer otherwise you'll be picked off all game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkinOyawale @GraemeKelly1 If we have to defend 5 yards deeper it wouldn't be a bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradLFC78 @MelissaReddy_ The left side in general has been ok, I thought Jota and Robinson have linked up well. But defensively it's been a horror show from almost everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaReddy_ If you aren't putting pressure on the passer holding such a high line is suicidal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaReddy_ No coincidence it's mostly coming down the right. Failure to track runners is a reoccurring theme. Adrian set the tone with his error but you've got to defend smarter...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 You could put Fabinho back there and bring Henderson on. Not sure that'd help much to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 They know, now they're trying to make out the democrats were always super concerned and knew the potential threat, at the same time Nancy Pelosi is telling people to visit Chinatown :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ACitizenOfGlobe @cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore im not a republican. when was travel stopped from China? how many recorded cases were there in the US when they did this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @ACitizenOfGlobe @StanCollymore sure I understand I was replying to the person that said Trump only acted once people were dying. He stopped flights from China when there was 1 recorded case in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LLWilkens @GameJunky81 @SueGfromPGH @newsmax when the former vice president and several elected officials call you Nazis and white supremacists when you're not you absolutely have a case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACitizenOfGlobe @cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore he addressed it right at the beginning what are you talking about? he shut down flights from China in early January. Why do that for something he didn't think existed? remember there was 1 case in america when he did that so it was right at the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACitizenOfGlobe @cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore so let me get this straight? he thought it was a hoax but held daily briefings talking about something he didn't think was real and all the things he was going to do to try and stop the thing he didn't think was real. is that what you're saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore the messaging from the "experts" changed on masks a lot. Trump is damned if he listens to his experts and damned if he doesn't. I've spent a lot of time in Asia so know how effective masks can be too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACitizenOfGlobe @cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore that's wrong. If he thought covid was a hoax why was he holding daily briefings about it?? please explain that one to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore i agree the choices on all sides are extremely depressing. If this is the best we have to offer its a big worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore the US is a little different in that the states are run by governers and so they also made decisions some good some bad. NY for example made some horrible decisions in terms of nursing homes which resulted in 1000s of deaths, Trump had nothing to do with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar remember the troops story?  remember the post office story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esaagar remember the post office scandal? i think that was 2 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore but he never denied the virus, and it makes no sense to think he did. If he thought the virus itself was a hoax why produce ventalators? why produce millions of tests? why hold daily briefings about the thing you say he didn't believe in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore from the WHO changed a lot, i don't see a lot of things that were being suggested he do that he didn't do. Sure now months later people are saying he should have done x or y but they weren't saying it AT THE TIME which is the key part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore lots of that stuff is hindsight, but if you look at what was being talked about at the time which is the important part im not sure what wasn't done that could have been?? the messaging on masks from the experts changed considerably from March to now, the messaging...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore ok but it's very clear he never called the virus itself a democratic hoax he said the way the democrats were politicising it was their new hoax, thats a big difference. We can argue about what more could have been done and i'm sure you can do the same with every country...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny if the stakes weren't so high it'd almost be worth it to see them fade into obscurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore why would he take the action he did for something he thought was a hoax?? it makes no sense but you believe it because you want to believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cr00kedpictures @StanCollymore  https://t.co/zkci1W0qG9  yeah that was debunked ages ago. Listen to what you're saying, you believe he believes the virus is a hoax, yet he held briefings about it every day, authroised the production of 1000s of ventalators, testing etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore what's a covid denier? all of the action the leaders are taking would suggest they don't deny it's existence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phillyrich1 @waltshaub yeah the ad Biden ran based on the Atlantic story was pretty low and nobody has called him out for that. In the debate pretty much everyone of Bidens attacks on Trump was based on a lie that has been debunked many times. But if he's not challenged on it it'll keep happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum i wouldn't be surprised if he already tested positive and they kept it hidden. he's been coughing a lot and very low energy in a lot of appearances,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite his own wife reported on Trumps very clear remarks yesterday! You know he's a hack when Kayleigh read Trumps quotes from yesterday and he said it wasn't good enough because those quotes were "in the past"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth she read a quote from YESTERDAY and that wasn't good enough for @johnrobertsFox he said it was "in the past" :/  how do you even start to comprehend what he's trying to do when a very clear quote from yesterday is not good enough?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Layanaround @minaaasadd @J_bucks99 @Yamiche @johnlegend so there's no emotion attached to the child itself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Layanaround @minaaasadd @J_bucks99 @Yamiche @johnlegend this wasn't late term by the way, i think the mother was half way through the pregnancy. And the emotional response is very telling and I understand it completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crankyeef @J_bucks99 @Yamiche @johnlegend yes and many on the left support abortion right up until the last moment. Maybe now you'll understand why so many find this abhorent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minaaasadd @J_bucks99 @Yamiche @johnlegend the point is many on the left support late term abortions and the argument is "it's not a baby". The emotional outpouring here I think supports the idea that we're talking about more than a lump of cells, or a parasite or whatever term people use to justify abortion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dickc @pt @Jason @coinbase "The revolution" are you 15??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElissaBeth @Cernovich But I've seen no evidence they are a white supremacist group. They have members of every race you can imagine. They are a counter to antifa and tend to show up at the same protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElissaBeth @Cernovich I think they stand for traditional American values although I guess that's subjective. But they've tended to show up when conservative speakers are being protested to provide sort of protection. They're not afraid to meet violence with violence....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere This member would disagree with you...   https://t.co/5vFrcJwjEy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere Also id like to see your evidence that they are a white supremacist group. The group contains individuals of many races.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere It's impressive that you write for the Atlantic and didn't realise it was Joe Biden that "summoned" the name of the Proud Boys...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyblander @Anne74994369 @Brad79722077 @amfuller0912 @DLoesch Except the proud boys are not a white supremacist group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeachBums79 @davidharsanyi the whole question was based on the debunked lie that he said white supremacists were "very fine people". That never happened he condemned them then and he's done it numerous times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherylmhealthmu @The_Rich_Real @jeremyherb @maggieNYT Why would you assume I'd forgotten that. Makes zero difference to my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rwtrott @neontaster Have any evidence that supports the claim they are??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebmy75 @neontaster Anything to support the claim they are??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidharsanyi "And I'm not talking about the white supremacists and neo Nazi's because they should be condemned totally". I'm not sure how much clearer someone can be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster Proud boys isn't a white supremacist group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 It's either that or he's admitting he ignored a bunch of exculpatory evidence. Neither are a good look for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I don't remember" what a waste of time. #Comey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray that's a strange way of admitting there has been violence but ok. Nobody has said the protests haven't been mostly peaceful but there has been violence and looting too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisainNJ @bilgerat @PoliticalShort i notice you never answered my question. Keep trusting the FBI. I remember a time when the left was rightly very suspicious of the intelligence agencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC any chance anything substantial will happen here? Yates threw Comey under the bus a few weeks ago, any chance Comey does something similar to someone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray sure there's never any violence from skinny white boys cosplaying as ninjas right? if you can't be honest about the situation we may as well stop now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray founded in 2007 yeah, so they are a group?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray and i never claimed the proud boys haven't commited violence i said they weren't a white supremacist group. if you live in portland you know exactly what goes down, the violence is on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray so they are a group?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray lol sure thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndroAngelXOX @JohnFugelsang and spoiler altert, there are very few actual fascists in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndroAngelXOX @JohnFugelsang the problem is the definition of "fascist" has been redefined to basically mean anyone they disagree with politically. You can see how that might be problematic no? You can justify violence against anyone if you call them a fascist whether they are or not...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustmeAnybody @julie_kelly2 the proud boys isn't a white supremacist group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray I'm positive there are some individuals that associate themselves with antifa that hold some pretty abhorent beliefs but that doesn't mean antifa stands for those same beliefs does it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Sunflowers @stillgray sure but you know there's a difference between a group containing some racists and a group being about white supremacy, where does it say anywhere from the proud boys that they are a white supremacist group?....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray cos they're not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yazhome @bbeall1 @OregonGovBrown what is a fascist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OregonGovBrown so this individual is a white supremaicst??   https://t.co/FlcgUeuljP  why would a white supremacist group contain people of almost every race?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scott_calhoun23 @eastcoast636 @Odey____444 @vstaff @JoeBiden @RickSantorum  https://t.co/FlcgUeuljP  Are you whitesplaining to this individual?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec the problem is Joe mentions the proud boys who aren't a white supremacist group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonivanGoneWild @JackPosobiec the proud boys aren't a white supremacist group, unless white supremacy groups now include black people, asians, hispanics etc etc...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eastcoast636 @Odey____444 @vstaff @JoeBiden @RickSantorum the proud boys are not white supremacists. They're probably one of the most racially diverse groups you'll find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyglesias you don't need to vaccinate everybody though. Certain groups are at a much higher risk rate than others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Probably Milner, with Grujic, Jones, Shaqiri in midfield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott you couldn't find a more mixed race group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schackspelar @asthehosptuRNs @megynkelly Lol. So you have lots of different regional groups calling themselves antifa with a shared  ideology but it's not an organisation. Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schackspelar @asthehosptuRNs @megynkelly You didn't answer me. What is Rose City Antifa?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schackspelar @asthehosptuRNs @megynkelly Yeah he's wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisainNJ @bilgerat @PoliticalShort What is Rose City Antifa? Antifa Seven Hills? Antifa Sacremento? I could go on. They are absolutely organised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asthehosptuRNs @megynkelly What is Rose City Antifa? Antifa Seven Hills? Antifa Sacramento? Etc, etc.. Biden is going to regret that comment because there is absolutely an organisation behind antifa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherylmhealthmu @The_Rich_Real @jeremyherb @maggieNYT the problem is we now know Hilary DID pay for dirt on Trump. And we also now know the primary source for that dirt was a suspected Russian spy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Rich_Real @jeremyherb @maggieNYT you mean like that Russian bounties story? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlaneWith @Warlock32 @JosephMirabile2 @dbongino so if we're to believe your spin, Russia was spreading disinformation that Hilary Clinton was trying to link Trump to Russia which was actaully true even though they didn't know it was true??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlaneWith @Warlock32 @JosephMirabile2 @dbongino the point you're missing. Hilary DID pay for dirt on Trump linking him to Russia. We now know the primary source of that dirt was a suspected Russian spy. The FBI knew about this information back in 2016 and still treated the Steele dossier as if it had any credibility....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMirabile2 @dbongino and here's the problem, Hilary did pay for dirt on Trump linking him to Russia. We now know the primary source for that information was a suspected Russian spy. So if we're to accept this new spin, Russia was spreading disinformation about Hilary that turned out to be true??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaveJaveline @kyledcheney @maggieNYT @AndrewDesiderio debunked how? Hilary did pay someone for dirt on Trump linking him to Russia.

<|startoftext|>@burkhartlaw97 @Anon4Brand @JRubinBlogger @mvhaydencenter @RichardGrenell releasing pertinent information is not weaponising intelligence.

<|startoftext|>@Blueguy40415598 @JoeAce967 The ability to defend yourself from attack is a core moral principle. But this is why you keep losing, it's no longer about ideas you genuinly think you're "better" than the people you disagree with politically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simmy_lad @BergHenryVieira @DaveOCKOP We have a couple of players that pick up niggles like Matip but if you look at most of the squad VVD, Robertson, Gini, the front 3 they just don't miss many games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BergHenryVieira @DaveOCKOP also with the extra options we have in midfield now Klopp can give people like Gini, Keita, Henderson a rest so they can maintain this intensity for much longer without losing quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BergHenryVieira @DaveOCKOP excellent scouting too with so many players that just don't pick up niggly injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 @LFCLaurie think we might see Henderson there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supermills @kylegriffin1 No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV Lots of really good performances but Mane was different class. Gini and Keita worked so hard though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 He was immense but had given everything. Surprised we waited so long to put Taki on. The front 3 plus Keita and Wijnaldum put in a hell of a shift tonight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DPBeachNY @ETBowden @RichardGrenell You mean what Rachel Maddow and CNN were telling their viewers for the past 3 years?? They told everyone the reason he wouldn't release his taxes was because it would show a financial link to Russia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Timcast everybody that employs an accountant is doing the same to some degree. You pay for an accountant because they know the system and know how to use it to your best advantage. Is TDS so bad now people will start feeling sorry for the IRS??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeDotjpeg @ColumbiaBugle we knew all this in 2016. I'm all for a discussion on the tax system which is what should happen. Anyone that employs an accountant does so to work the system to benefit themselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johngibbonsblog most people that employ an accountant do so, so they can use the tax laws to their own advantage. The IRS doesn't get much smpathy from most people the same as Inland Revenue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter We knew this in 2016. It was talked about in the debates with Hilary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlosLozadaWP @brianstelter All of a sudden we're supposed to feel sympathy for the IRS?? Yeah everyone loves the taxman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton they also debunked their own "Trump isn't releasing his taxes because of his financial ties to Russia" narrative. Good job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 most do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AresStopell @rorycooper im sure his accountant didn't use the system to his clients advantage at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rorycooper thats the Republican platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer this article is an arguement for changing the tax system, I don't think many people would be against simplifying it. But most people that file taxes and use an accountant do so because they want to use the system to benefit them as much as possible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IZigger77 @PattyforTrump @_quark_ @mkolken @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump remember when Don Jr was interviewed for 20 hours because of a 30 min meeting about adoption.

<|startoftext|>@PaulMiller1313 @sam_vinograd @PamKeithFL @ProjectLincoln @nytimes like one of your children getting wired $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robin_washburn @sam_vinograd @ProjectLincoln @nytimes and yet the new york times story is very clear there's no financial ties to Russia in his tax returns.

<|startoftext|>@Claymore2211 @verbastardy @blythecreek @artkincell @cheeseheadlucy @TheRickWilson @susannecraig @russbuettner @mmcintire the funny thing is Trump probably leaked these himself because its really a nothingburger and it did show no financial ties to Russia which certain left media outlets have been claiming for the last 3 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@verbastardy @Claymore2211 @blythecreek @artkincell @cheeseheadlucy @TheRickWilson @susannecraig @russbuettner @mmcintire yeah most people don't understand the system and it is designed to be as complicated as possible for the layperson. I'm all for simplfying to tax system but lets not pretend to some extent we all try and work the system to pay as little as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystalball do you employ an accountant? if you do they'll be working the system to save you as much money as possible. The problem is the system everyone that can is trying to take advantage of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blythecreek @verbastardy @artkincell @cheeseheadlucy @TheRickWilson @susannecraig @russbuettner @mmcintire you're trying to pay as little as possible. If you have a problem paying high taxes im not sure a vote for Biden is going to help you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlueJayFarAway1 @DShepherd45 @SchonlauR @softlikewater @davidfrum And what were the democrats saying in 2016?? Shocker both sides are massive hypocrites focused on what benefits them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IllDowhatIWant2 @LarryTayback @CHSommers @JoyAnnReid Whatever it's still bat shit crazy to make this comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IllDowhatIWant2 @LarryTayback @CHSommers @JoyAnnReid She's so oppressed she's about to work on the highest court in the land!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MotherJones Did the handmaids make it to the highest court in the land??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @WajahatAli How is that any different than Hilary Clinton telling Biden not to concede no matter what? Both parties are doing this, the democrats still haven't accepted the results from 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComfortablySmug they should ask the Clintons they know a thing or two about Haiti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaHoule you should ask Hilary Clinton she knows a thing or two about Haiti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaHoule get help, seriously, they've broke you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 Certain key reporters are absolutely in on it. It's not difficult to figure out who if you pay attention to who was being leaked certain stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @VividCase @EliLake If that's aimed at me you missed the point. Without specific examples just saying it was sweeping and systemic means nothing. I'm looking for specific examples that illustrate the scale of the interference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Without having to actually to support those claims with evidence. There's no evidence that Russian interference changed one vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Yeah that doesn't mean anything. I've seen no evidence from anyone that the results were changed by 5% due to Russian interference and without being specific about specific things that were done using terms like sweeping and systematic is just a way to hint at the seriousness...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Any evidence for that or just conjecture?? What does sweeping and systematic mean specifically??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake To what degree did they interfere? because the scale is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake You can find that in the Horowitz report. Even Steeles primary source says it's mostly bs!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake That's in the Horowitz report by the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake They've probably tried to interfere in every election since the 60s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake Remember when the primary sub source was interviewed and admitted Steele misrepresented most of what he told him and that it was mostly bar talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Remember when the primary sub source was interviewed and admitted Steele misrepresented most of what he told him and that it was mostly bar talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake Wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Anthony36 @kylecotner @politico Yeah the DNC using a suspected Russian spy to dig up dirt on Trump is no big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Oh and the wife of the former mayor of Moscow wired a firm co founded by Hunter Biden $3.5 million. There's your Russian collusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @_Sernie_Banders @bobgiann @EliLake Turns out the DNC paid for dirt sourced by someone suspected of being a Russian spy over a decade ago...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake The dossier has not been proved accurate at all and to claim it has means we're wasting our time here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake The more we learn the worse it becomes and people like you have to furiously spin to try and convince yourself it's really not that bad. If this had happened to your team you'd be saying the complete opposite right now. We're clearly wasting each other's time, good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Sernie_Banders @mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake It must be true cos you just said so!! Dude you're clearly invested and no amount of counter evidence is going to make you reconsider. If you're ok with how this all went down I don't know what to say to you....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 It must be so hard for you that we have a president that bypasses you when you refuse to report on a story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake Lol. Keep spinning dude. The FISA applications aren't secret they know what evidence was presented to the courts, Horowitz has seen it. You're just wrong admit it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake  https://t.co/Tl6q4bbzXW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper With good reason why is he sitting on all this evidence??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake Wrong.    https://t.co/93RxO8bUoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake Lol no it hasn't. I see you skipped over the part where Horowitz testified it was the main piece of evidence presented to the FISA court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake  https://t.co/93RxO7UjwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattlogical @bobgiann @EliLake It's been confirmed by Horowitz it was the main piece of evidence presented to the FISA court to get the warrant on Carter Paige, and no it hasn't "largely checked out" that's bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobgiann @EliLake yeah no big deal that the main source for the intel used to spy on a political campaign was a suspected russian spy years previously and the intelligence agencies knew this and ignored it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZekeJMiller he's not wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidharsanyi too much transparency!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays someone like @maddow hasn't stopped talking about Russia for 4 years and now we have evidence of the wife of the former mayor of Moscow wiring $3.5 million to a firm co founded by Hunter Biden and i can guarantee she won't talk about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyledcheney why did Wray sit on this for so long? Transparency is a good thing right? unless it paints your "team" in a negative light i guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tenoannie @kyledcheney @donwinslow disgraceful to shed more light on what was happening? it's called transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Watch_LFC he celebrated that one more than the CL goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emptywheel So none of the released texts are new?  Is it normal practice to get liability insurance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emptywheel Is it normal to get liability insurance??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PancakeBreasts @ArthurSchwartz makes sense, its very likely a code for something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott Still doesn't explain why he did the same for many other days this month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zakkscoffee @JoeMill73489060 @mmpadellan @IngrahamAngle The person that hired the truck has already been found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahDispatch the way he answered the question suggests he interpreted it as not automatically conceding if there were doubts around the result. The fact he brought up national mail in voting supports that he misunderstood the question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettBardo @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman although Hilary went one step further and suggested Biden shouldn't accept the results no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettBardo @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman maybe he didn't answer it as clearly as he could although the question was phrased pretty badly. I don't see any difference to what Trump said here and what Hilary was saying. If there are doubt around the result he won't go quietly, as he shouldn't....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMill73489060 @zakkscoffee @mmpadellan @IngrahamAngle sure, and all the protective gear. Would be interesting to see whose funding it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mookie_dog @bodyhot @norwegian76 @dannydantheman @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman Oregon isn't country wide. There is a difference between a few states doing this that have done it before and have the logistics understood. To doing it nationwide at such short notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BurtsCliff @zakkscoffee @mmpadellan @IngrahamAngle it's both though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodyhot @norwegian76 @dannydantheman @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman Tulsi and others disagree with you (on both sides) to pretend there are no concerns is disingenuous.    https://t.co/RJJtkE9JnD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodyhot @norwegian76 @dannydantheman @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman we've never done universal mail in voting for a national election before. There are legitimate concerns to being able to organise something that complex in such a short space of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow still using the unfounded quote from the Atlantic as if it's fact. Shameless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FabrizioRomano @indykaila first again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zakkscoffee @mmpadellan @IngrahamAngle kind of destroys the myth there is no organisation behind this though right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtValley818_ kind of makes a joke of the narrative that the police are hunting black people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@norwegian76 @dannydantheman @bodyhot @RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman he's saying he's not going to simply accept the result if there is evidence of fraud and universal mail in voting makes it much more likely there will be widespread fraud. Didn't Hilary very recently advise Biden not to concede the election no matter what the result was?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom @dandrezner @NoahCRothman it's really not. If there's evidence of a rigged election both parties have a right to contest it and not merely stand aside. Also didn't Hilary very recently advise Joe not to concede the election no matter the result? that's far more dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dandrezner @NoahCRothman How is that any different from Hilarys "Biden shouldn't concede whatever the outcome" (im paraphrasing) all he's saying is if there's evidence of voter fraud he won't step aside quietly and nobody should in that scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flashhardcor well done for capturing this attempted murder on camera. Hopefully your footage can help identify the culprit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow @tedwheeler Did you see the person that smashed an officer over the head with a baseball bat? that's attempted murder too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC I'm done playing these stupid games with you. It's fine you don't care because it's the son of Biden, I get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC It's ok just say you don't care because it's the son of a Democrat. I'd have much more respect for you if you just admitted your hypocrisy than this mental gymnastics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @TrumpTrainATX @RepLeeZeldin Don Jr was interviewed for hours what are you talking about??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC The "gifts" from the Chinese and wire transfer from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Definitely worth a Mueller style investigation. Need to get Hunter under oath to explain this stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC  https://t.co/ZGipADzYVZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Biden was still VP when this was happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Ok the investment firm he co-founded was wired $3.5 dollars from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. Worth further investigation I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC I think we need a Mueller style investigation to look into it further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Lol yeah no big deal right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC You're really doing this??  https://t.co/NCRPIybJ2F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Not to mention the nice gifts from the Chinese. Worth investigating further I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC He missed the word "son" and then corrected it :/ worth looking into why the wife of the former mayor of Moscow wired Hunter $3.5 million don't you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC Lol it's called a mistype which was quickly corrected. My point is either the dealings of the children of politicians is important or it isn't. You can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You've been in politics for 40+ years!! Spare us the bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradMossEsq @ChuckRossDC And what was your response to the people that said that??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @ChuckRossDC He corrected it in the next tweet. So I guess nobody was interested in what Don Jr was doing right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sinead_OBrien5 @BradMossEsq Was Don Jr running for president?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipperyhero @RadioFreeTom @BradMossEsq When said dad has been in politics for 40 years that's a little different from profiting from building hotels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain @nytimes Republicans pounce...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump they're already running cover for the Biden's. Will any journlist read the report and ask Joe about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain the story failed to mention the $3.5 bank wire. I'm shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smmarrujo @ChristopherJM @AndrewBatesNC @BuzzFeedNews shocked that the buzzfeed reporter failed to mention that in his "report".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suya_Yuvika @smmarrujo @ChristopherJM @AndrewBatesNC @BuzzFeedNews lol the documents are in the report which you'd know if you'd actually read it. Strange the buzzfeed reporter failed to mention that part of the report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristopherJM @BuzzFeedNews no mention of the $3.5 million wired, im shocked!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffWat60745991 @ArthurSchwartz You read it already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC what rules have been broken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drum_PMC @cupofjoe222 @JuddLegum @Susan_Hennessey Yes, yes they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller so if Trump is reelected they'll be ok with him adding a few extra conservative judges to the supreme court??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom @ChelseaFC @LFC it still doesn't feel right without a crowd. Hard to remember its a real game when it feels so low key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conxardox @jimleff @rezaaslan what is the crisis?? elections have consequences, I get it you're mad because your team isn't in control but if it were they'd be doing the exact same thing. Politicians on both sides are hyprocrites, none of them have the moral high ground on this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rezaaslan Reza you won't be burning anything down. You'll expect others to do it for you. I look forward to seeing you on the front lines though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertMaguire_ it's not difficult. Romney is a conservative, Trump will be President for at the most 4 more years. A supreme court judge is a lifetime appointment. Why would Romney want to put in a liberal judge whose most likely going to disagree with him on almost every core issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Cc: @ddale8 wanna fact check this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBadNewsB @ddale8 When the answers are on a teleprompter that's a pretty big clue you know what's coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R11RT @charlesgross99 @rizzo2200 @benshapiro It's really not. And Obama has said plenty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Don_Gato007 @DeepSpace41 @benshapiro Harry Reid has a lot to answer for too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesgross99 @rizzo2200 @benshapiro This isn't difficult, both parties are hypocrites and both parties will do whatever they can to consolidate power. If the roles were reversed the democrats would nominate a replacement and the republicans would complain. But let's not pretend the democrats are any different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephschor @RadioFreeTom @Morning_Joe This idea that it's only the Republican party playing politics is absurd. Was the way impeachment was approached the norm? Was the Kavenaugh confirmation the norm?? Both sides are ruthless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephschor @RadioFreeTom @Morning_Joe Let's not forget the democratic party are threatening to add more supreme court judges just to get the majority as well as other things far outside the norm which will consolidate power...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephschor @RadioFreeTom @Morning_Joe Both parties will do whatever it takes to consolidate power. Let's not pretend the democrats wouldn't look to appoint a new justice if the roles were reversed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1966wall @RobDorsettSky if he improves a lot the £36 million might be a good deal for Liverpool. He needs that first team experience in the PL and Liverpool can't give him that so a buy back clause makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveewash @ITGuy1959 @MoNiicole Yeah both sides are hypocritical but let's not pretend the democrats would hold this position open if the situation were reversed. Everyone is a hypocrite so nobody has the moral high ground here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosalind1485 @Acyn This is why the republicans should confirm now. :/ it's amazing that you don't see how doing this is far more dangerous than anything AOC talked about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom I bet Thiago is pissed he gave away the penalty. He doesn't look happy. That's the sort of mentality that's going to lift everyone up another level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FourLeafNiall @GraemeKelly1 Definitely a genuine option with Thiago so comfortable in the 6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Space will be with the full backs now, get bodies in the box. Could be the perfect way to introduce Thiago with Chelsea a man down and play Henderson further forward #CHELIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleMyers95 @scrowder Most Conservatives don't support late term abortions or attacking people's 2A rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Probably play a little deeper line today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathMayo you're none of those things if you'll vote for a party that supports late term abotions and wants to take away your guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 this season there are a tonne of games in a short period of time, i think we'll see a lot more rotation than usual especially in the midfield. Next season i think he might be off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeadExplodn @Luca_Sadie1 @RepJerryNadler The dems were so nice with Kavenaugh. You think people have forgot that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT Lazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC__Louis @JamesPearceLFC They wanted it all up front, wolves didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6  https://t.co/N7FQLNlGAS  since Abramovich, Chelsea's net spend is actually less than I thought, looks like they have sold pretty well as well as spending a lot. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 what's your total received in sales in the last 5 seasons? how does that compare to what you've spent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 They've both spent £500 million but it's not the same. It's not difficult to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 1 example, net spend matters in terms of squad strength it's not difficult to understand. Are you suggesting a team that spends £500 million but sells players worth £400 million is the same as a team that spends £500 million and sells £0??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 I'm sure liverpool wished they didn't have to sell coutinho or suarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 If you have to sell your best players to fund the purchase of others that's not the same as a club that doesn't have to do that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crackati @ATVG2k20 @LFC @Thiago6 Yes it does. Big difference when you have to sell to buy compared to when you can be bankrolled for £1 billion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila @LFC 1st again Indy!! Well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfMJCleveland It'll be up to Trump to address Biden directly and ask those questions no-one else will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers Definitely feels that way. The sort of player that can elevate everyone around him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anastasiakeeley @aaronjmate Lol so that's a no you can't find any examples of this extremely common behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJJ1981 @TimSpiers @CraigHope_DM Sure but he needs to develop and he's not getting the games at Liverpool. I suppose they could have loaned him but if there is a buy back it's basically the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lcoombes2 @indykaila there are at least 2 his age that are ahead of him at CB. And Trent and Neco both very young ahead of him at RB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJJ1981 @TimSpiers @CraigHope_DM still has a huge amount of developing he needs to do and for someone with so little first team experience £10 million is a lot of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJJ1981 @TimSpiers @CraigHope_DM impossible to say that, a promising 18 year old but there's a huge step up he needs to make. The reality is Trent is going to be our RB for the forseeable future and the staff obviously rate Neco higher....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila @Wolves solid info again Indy well done 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @seanspicer @CrazyInAZ1 @JoeBiden Fact check: liar, liar pants on fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nath_baker94 @NickGrant10 @Liddellpool Think Salah might be off next season. If Utd don't get Sancho I could see us selling salah and getting Sancho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC He's probably right. They're gutless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanKohout @AGHamilton29 making the claim that 0 americans would have died had Trump acted sooner is one worthy of a fact check I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 or falsely claiming Trump has never condemned white supremacy when you know he has on several occassions. Is that not egregious? or running ads using unverified quotes that have been disputed by over 20 people i guess that's not egregious either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 you have no credibility but when you refuse to check both sides you're just making your biases clear to everyone.   I guess making the claim that had Trump acted earlier there could have been no deaths from covid 19 isn't egregious enough for you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@murray_nyc @JoeBiden Yeah because the blue states have been so welcoming to Trump. All relationships are a two way thing and the democrats never gave Trump a chance from day 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdairBlackmore @ChuckRossDC Honestly you can't be that naive can you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traceyjonesroe @ChilliByrd @JackPosobiec I'd suggest we all save that video I'm sure it'll disappear soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV Firmino is going to love playing with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanAageFjortoft and the full backs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedStar1994 @empireofthekop Gives us lots of options. In certain games when we control the ball a lot he can play as a 6 maybe Fabinho could be a CB option. Could play as an 8 with Fabinho as the 6 in tougher games in a 4-2-3-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAnfieldWrap isn't it amazing how 1 signing can completely change the mood and vibe. I think it's an amazing signing not only for the quality of the player we'll be getting but in terms of changing the vibe around the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedStar1994 @empireofthekop we don't play with 3 box to box midfielders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop it's a signing that can transform the way we play like VVD was. Good teams need to evolve and change tactically and Thiago gives that midfield so much class, control and passing ability that we haven't had before. Imagine Thiago feeding the full backs and front 3 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loganclarkhall all this will do is make people look into her claims even more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanceledTee @KU15191 @foolio1977 @YesThatAnna And he's had plenty of opportunity to show off these fascistic tendencies if they were there with riots and a pandemic but he's allowed the state's to run things. Worse fascist ever!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25LFC_ @Simptuation @Liddellpool @FourthOfficial_ You can if there's a buy back clause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25LFC_ @Simptuation @Liddellpool @FourthOfficial_ give us more flexibility. Brewster can only really play the #9, Sarr could play left or right allowing us to play Salah centrally later in games like we've done without losing that pace out wide. I see it as very low risk, if Brewster does well we buy him back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25LFC_ @Simptuation @Liddellpool @FourthOfficial_ if we have that clause there's nothing the player can do. If Brewster does want to leave we could always activate the clause and then sell him for a higher fee assuming his value goes up. Yes Sarr is far from the finished product but he's more developed than Brewster and does...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsAshleeLee @maggieNYT imagine Biden with unscripted questions all tough questions in a town hall hosted by a former Bush advisor! I think a big part of the reason Trump is choosing to take on these sorts of things which he knows will be hostile is to further highlight the difference between the 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartlessRob @TrumpRulzz @RealBasedMAGA @Ezekiel38391 from "learn to code" to "learn to fold"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoePCunningham this is why he's doing it. The contrast is huge. Can you imagine Biden taking unscripted questions from a hostile audience hosted by a former Bush advisor??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neoavatara How do you think Biden's debate prep is going compared to Trump??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25LFC_ @Simptuation @Liddellpool @FourthOfficial_ in the meantime we can use that money to buy someone who is more developed and can add more now to the 1st team like Sarr who would give us a lot more options because he is a genuine wide player it could allow us to move Salah or Mane more centrally as we do from time to time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25LFC_ @Simptuation @Liddellpool @FourthOfficial_ ive read that the buy back would only be £5 million more than we sell him for. So he gets 1 maybe 2 seasons of developing and if he steps up we can buy him back at a time when finances should be better...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAnfieldWrap The question is would he offer more than someone like Sarr if the money is used to sign another forward that can play anywhere in the front 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool further along in their development (Sarr maybe) but if Brewster doesn't develop well we don't have to buy him back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool if the reports of a buy back clause are accurate its a smart move. It's almost lik a glorified loan move if Brewster does well and develops we buy him back for a small amount over what we get for him in maybe 2 years, but get the money now to invest in someone else...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpJew i think this is the only question that's missing. Are they scared for people to see Trump like this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpJew interesting if you goto the ABC youtube page this is the one clip that's missing. It looks like it's there but when you click on the clip it's a different question. 🤔   https://t.co/Jywsbm7m82<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1kingnidge @GraemeKelly1 @Moley_LFC I think we'll use the money to get Sarr who covers more of the front 3 positions and is further in his development. If the reports are accurate we'll also look to get a buy back clause in there so if he does well it's almost like a loan where you get paid up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davereaboi @ChristinaSpecos Let me summarise "learn to fold"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro I think that's the bigger point here. Trump is going into hostile territory and answering very difficult questions, Biden is not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro Often in this type of situation you're not talking to the handpicked audience but those watching. It's also a very good way to highlight the difference between Trump answering very difficult questions and Biden that would never do something like this...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shadihamid look at the difference in engagement between regular americans in both campaigns. Trump is able to draw large crowds whereever he goes, Biden's support is tiny in comparison when he travels. There are other ways to gauge support, polls aren't the only way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadihamid Polls are next to useless we saw that with 2016. I can see the stage being set though for this narrative that Biden is so far clear if he loses it's because of cheating, but that very premise is based on polls that have proven not to be reliable or can be easily manipulated....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexjimithing @oneunderscore__ really? showing 11 year olds in a hyper sexualised way shouldn't make people feel outraged? if the film maker wanted to make a film commentating on the sexualisation of young children she could have done it without having to sexualise young children in the process...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneunderscore__ not really, and please explain how it's "allegedly exploitative images". If people listened to you guys there is nothing wrong so posting the images and video is a way to combat that narrative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRedmenTV gotta give Leeds a lot of credit, I don't think we'll have a more difficult game tactically in terms of having to deal with things in game you aren't used to having to deal with...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAnfieldWrap If we'd been a bit more clinical we should have got the cushion of 2 goals but we didn't and therefore Leeds were always in it. Really impressed by Leeds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dtipson @danielchaitin7 @philipaklein You have to input an incorrect password 10 times for this to happen and the more it happens the longer you have to wait to try again. The whole process would take over 3hrs...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlyssaRosenberg @roddreher while the aim of the film might have been a worthy one i.e a critique on the sexualisation of children.

<|startoftext|>@ScottChevalier8 @SouthernKeeks Not a crime to and stop panic and keep people positive. As long as the people that mattered were taking it seriously that's key.

<|startoftext|>@ScottChevalier8 @SouthernKeeks Telling him. Sure he might have been putting a more positive spin in it but that's not a crime. Just out of interest have you tweeted at all about China misleading the world about this virus with the help of the WHO. To me that seems like a much more serious issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottChevalier8 @SouthernKeeks And when it's very easy to forget. But look at what the WHO were saying in February, look at what the media were reporting in those first few months. If you believe Faucci Trump listened to the experts and his message to the American people was not different to what they were...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottChevalier8 @SouthernKeeks He never called it a hoax he called the democrats politicization of the virus a hoax.

<|startoftext|>@SouthernKeeks Seriously. The ban on travel in January is a pretty big clue it was being taken seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernKeeks The point is bob Woodward didn't think it was serious enough to do that. And he confirmed he didn't interpret as being dangerous.

<|startoftext|>@FrankelPhineus @Catsorange1 @dicey631 @JoeNBC :/ he's been very open about trying to be positive about the and not induce panic.

<|startoftext|>@jjpp2001 people were tested coming back from overseas.

<|startoftext|>@jjpp2001 the problem is, the Chinese government did downplay the virus, we know they did and with the WHO's help they downplayed it to the whole world. But you haven't talked about that once on your feed so spare me your fake outrage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankelPhineus @Catsorange1 @dicey631 @JoeNBC given your outrage i'm assuming if i search your twitter there'll be lots of angry tweets aimed at the chinese government that actually downplayed the severity of the virus at the beginning to the whole world and got us to where we are now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankelPhineus @Catsorange1 @dicey631 @JoeNBC you do understand there is a difference in downplaying the severity of something to avoid panic and not taking that thing seriously?? Trump banned travel from China in January 1 week before that interview, that's a pretty good indicator it was being taken seriously.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jjpp2001 saying he didn't care suggests he did nothing. There is a difference between downplaying things to avoid panic and not caring. Why ban travel from China in January if he didn't care? That was a public policy which told everyone this was serious....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean if Trump downplaying the virus to avoid panic is the crime of the century then what does that make the Chinese government downplaying the severity and risk of the virus at the beginning which allowed it to spread to the point we're at now!! #WoodwardTapes #Woodward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>given the outrage by certain people over Trump saying he downplayed covid 19 to avoid panic, i'm assuming the same people must have numerous tweets being incredibly critical of the Chinese government for downplaying the severity of the virus at the beginning 🤔 #WoodwardTapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjpp2001 Faucci was interviewed yesterday and he said there was no difference in what Trump was telling the american people and what the experts were telling Trump. Trump might have been trying to put a more positive spin on things but that's not a crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjpp2001 :/ you think I haven't heard that? You do understand there's a difference in downplaying something to avoid mass panic and not taking it seriously right? Trump banned flights from China in January a week before that so it's fair to assume they were taking it seriously....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenrabG @BS2KZ @JaniceDean you must be incredibly mad at China right because they downplayed the whole thing from the beginning and let it get to the point we're at now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenrabG @BS2KZ @JaniceDean Faucci is on the record as saying the message Trump was giving the american people was the same message as he was being given by the experts. So he tried to put a positive spin on things and reduce panic, that's not the crime of the century you think it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenrabG @BS2KZ @JaniceDean what could Trump have done that he didn't do? Its very easy to look back and say we could have done this better or that better but looking at what people were saying at the time and what we knew at the time what could he have done different??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaniceDean #1 it's not really a bombshell but the media will pretend it is #2  https://t.co/ySRYPbSOg5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think this aspect of the whole thing would produce much more outrage than Trump saying he didn't want to create a panic (something he said publicly in March). China weren't honest from the start and nobody in the media seems to want to hold them accountable for anything!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So everyone is jumping on the Woodwood interview because Trump told him he downplayed certain aspects of the virus to prevent panic. Meanwhile we know China and the WHO weren't being honest about the severity of the virus way before it got out of control... #WoodwardTapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ignorem62281500 @Neoavatara is trying to hold China accountable for what they didn't do in helping to control this. The WHO was very vocal during the whole pandemic, they were using twitter all the time if they thought Trump wasn't getting the correct message accross it would have been easy to correct him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thx1138_v2 @mallen2010 @Neoavatara  https://t.co/pRnRf9k2QG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thx1138_v2 @mallen2010 @Neoavatara read what the WHO were saying in early February. You think spreading panic would have helped the situation?? I'm going to post an excellent thread that details what people were saying and when, it's very easy to look back and make proclamations about what should have been done..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neoavatara downplaying it to avoid panic is not the same as not taking it seriously though. He could do both. The actions in January are a pretty clear indication it was being taken seriously before he tried to avoid panic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Trying to avoid panic is not the same as not taking something seriously and the actions in January clearly show it was being taken seriously. Also Faucci has just said Trumps messaging didn't differ from what the experts were telling him...   https://t.co/UGf20xzGGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger You don't know this didn't happen. Trump banned travel from China in January, that's a pretty big clue it was being taken seriously earlier. It's interesting you don't seem to blame China at all for their actions, could they have warned countries sooner and been more honest??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Griffislame @michaeljknowles Right the China ban in January is a pretty big clue it was being taken seriously while not wanting to spread panic when lots was still unknown. People were fighting over toilet paper ffs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Griffislame @michaeljknowles To what the experts suggested every step. It's easy to look backwards and say we should have done x or y but what were people saying at the time? That's the key part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Griffislame @michaeljknowles No he said the way they were politicising how he was handling it was their new hoax. Pelosi was visiting China town weeks afterwards, plenty of people were downplaying the seriousness of the threat.

<|startoftext|>@lopizut @meangeneone1 @JoeBiden What action didn't he take that he was being advised to take by the experts?? That should be the key question. Faucci said his message to the American people was not different to what the experts were telling him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missybleu1 @MaxNordau @HillaryClinton Faucci has just said there was no difference in what Trump was telling the American people and what they were telling him. Is Faucci untrustworthy now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missybleu1 @MaxNordau @HillaryClinton The key question should be did he take it seriously and his actions in January banning travel from China suggest he was taking it seriously while at the same time trying not to exacerbate panic....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missybleu1 @MaxNordau @HillaryClinton You do understand there's a difference between downplaying the seriousness of something to not invoke panic and not taking it seriously. People were fighting over toilet paper ffs there was enough panic...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Faiep1982 @ewanvtwo @LFCTransferRoom thats why it makes sense to do it with a buy back clause.

<|startoftext|>@MonitorFc @LFCTransferRoom @SkySports depending on what the buy back clause is it's almost the same as taking out a loan without actually having to borrow the money with the added advantage of us being able to not buy him back if he doesn't develop as well as expected....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jowlsome @scabbyjiz @ConservOmatic @Timcast But that's a dangerous game to play.

<|startoftext|>@jowlsome @scabbyjiz @ConservOmatic @Timcast Still isn't proof of the Atlantic Story.

<|startoftext|>@PearlJam_U2 @jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood Fox News didn't coroborate anything other than a reporter saying the unnamed sources she spoke to confirmed some of the details of the story when told about them, but that's not evidence of anything.

<|startoftext|>@CapitanoMelissa @JoanLorelle @debcon43 @dbongino Sure that's not proof though. Just because it sounds like something he might have said isn't good enough, unless you want that to be the new standard in which case journalism might as well be dead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoanLorelle @debcon43 @dbongino You're missing the point just because she spoke to sources that confirmed some of the Atlantic story that still doesn't make the story true. Sources can make stuff up or put a spin on what they actually saw or heard....<|endoftext|>

I've numerous examples of something similar on video so it's a pattern of behaviour and he's guilty right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules  https://t.co/GJbMtNYxao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jowlsome @scabbyjiz @ConservOmatic @Timcast So he's guilty of something you have no evidence of because he once said something sort of similar? Jeeze I hope you don't live your life that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerbutler10 @JoeBiden Is it also your job to use made up quotes to attack someone?? Is that really the road we're going down now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmanteDePicante @TimRunsHisMouth @JoeBiden Yeah let's get anonymous sources to make up quotes and then use those quotes in an attack ad as if the person actually said it. Is this the road we really want to go down??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceLFC much more intensity after the break. Fabinho is such a slow starter its a tough one for Klopp becasue we can't afford that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heminator it's probably worse it's probably the same anonymous sources being used to confirm these sorts of stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathfyt @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson read this and you'll see why this is a problem...   https://t.co/0nR5izIgLr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathfyt @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson it hasn't been independently confirmed though because we have no idea who these unnamed sources are. All that has happened is the AP say it has been confirmed by their unnamed source and then a fox reporter said her unnamed source confirmed some of it. That's not confirmation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood is it normal to publish and base an entire story of this nature on unnamed sources? i'd like to see all these examples if its common place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood ok so neither side has credibility because we know why the trip was cancelled and its not what that story claims. So both sides have no credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood "unnamed sources told us" is that a good journalistic standard to publish a story like this that is obviously being done to hurt one particular political candicate? if a detrimental story were published about Biden with nothing more than unnamed sources would you trust it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood come to a conclusion about the validity of a claim. If these anonymous sources had documents or recordings that would add credibility to what they are claiming. The bigger point is since when do news organisations publish stories as political as this without more evidence than..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood you're missing the point if there were more evidence to support the claims that obviously brings more credibility to them. e.g. we have seen the corrospondence about the cancellation of that trip that directly contradicts part of the story, that is evidence you can evaluate to...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_neverhave @rabbsugar @Boricua_En_Maui @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump all im saying is "it sounds like something he might say" is not proof of anything, and that seems to be the standard when it comes to this story. People that hate Trump say well it sounds like something he might say therefore im going to belive it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood i don't just take somebody's word for it no. Especially when there are others that were on the trip that contradict the story. Unless he has more evidence than his own recollection its just he said she said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_neverhave @rabbsugar @Boricua_En_Maui @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump yeah and it doesn't mean anything. We have the opinion of others who say the opposite. If this is what passes for journalism nowadays it's not going to end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays anything other than a partisan publication trying to smear the president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays become so wise to their dishonesty and partisanship that it just doesn't work anymore with lots of people. It was so encouraging to see so many people call out this story immediately for it's inadequacies in terms of "evidence" and people realised the story was not proof of...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays one of the gifts the media has given us during this Trump presidency is they have opened so many peoples eyes to the games they play. Maybe 20 years ago this sort of circular reporting and using the same unnamed source to confirm a story might have worked but people have...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FabrizioRomano will this set the ball rolling for Wijnaldum to Barce, then Thiago to Liverpool??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggreenwald @Surabees cc: @KenDilanianNBC hack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_neverhave @rabbsugar @Boricua_En_Maui @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump yeah that's not proof of anything.   I didn't see Joe Biden being inappropriate with that child but I've seen the numerous videos of him so I wouldn't be surprised if he did it. See how that works??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUSBiden46 @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump using only unnamed sources as "proof". It's rediculous, any unbiased rational person knows this isn't proof of anything but it doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUSBiden46 @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump people that have gone on the record that were on the trip that said it didn't happen. Yet the media acts as if this story only has one side and it's been confirmed :/ i can only imagine what some of these people would say if a media outlet ran a disparaging story about them....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUSBiden46 @johnrobertsFox @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump so this is journalism in 2020, a story consisting entirely of unnamed sources, is confirmed by more unnamed sources, and that means it's been confirmed?? Meanwhile we have corrsopondence from the time that directly contradicts a key element of the story, plus around a dozen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieZipperer can you imagine if any of these blue check marks talking about this as if it was true had a defamatory story written about them that only included unnamed sources and nothing else?? I'm sure they'd be really happy about it. But these are the new rules they are creating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McAdooGordon @willchamberlain and Biden is even cutting ads using quotes from these unnamed sources. I'd say unbelievable but it's really not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McAdooGordon @willchamberlain circular reporting, probably all talking to the same sources to confirm the original story, all unnamed with no documentary evidence. In fact the documentary evidence we have directly contradicts a key aspect of the story. Yet the media are running with it as if it is true...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood i'd just like to imagine how you would react if a news outlet wrote a disparaging story about you and the only evidence they presented were "unnamed sources" that's it. No documentary evidence, no audio just unnamed sources. I'm sure you'd be fine with that story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood on the other side you have unnamed sources and no documentary or audio evidence. Yet you trust the latter because you hate Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood directly contradict the story. So if you're looking at evidence you have emails, and corrospondence at the time it was happening that explain clearly why the trip was cancelled and you have a dozen or so people on that trip that say the story is false....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jersey77girl @islaMike @JohnJHarwood lol they really didn't. They have all used unnamed sources. In fact the only people that have gone on the record are the almost dozen people that were on that trip that directly refuted the story, not to mention the documents showing why the trip was cancelled which....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood confirmed using the same unnamed sources. It's called circular reporting and we're wise to your hackery. You guys probably got away with this sort of stuff 20 years ago, but not anymore....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain they don't even realise to lots of Americans this is an endorsement. Trump doesn't have the support of the deep state and career beaurocrats, oh no!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Trump has lost the deep state, oh no!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@51Emmy51 @Petrocat63 @RASwaggard @McFaul Yeah they have 6 unnamed sources!! and they have been coroborated by another 2 unnamed sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashley_buice @ProudLib6 @Magician247 @RealRichardPoe @realDonaldTrump Without it it's just hearsay basically and if you hate Trump you'll choose to believe it and if you like Trump you'll choose not to believe it. But you need more than unnamed sources to have any credibility, especially when these publications are highly partisan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudLib6 @Magician247 @ashley_buice @RealRichardPoe @realDonaldTrump There is no evidence here, nothing but "unnamed sources". What evidence we do have contradicts some of the claims e.g we know the reason the first visit was cancelled and that was confirmed by John Bolton hardly a friend of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudLib6 @Magician247 @ashley_buice @RealRichardPoe @realDonaldTrump In the current highly politicised climate in news reporting it's rational to be very suspicious of a story like this that is full of unnamed sources and where almost a dozen people that were on the trip in question have already said it didn't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudLib6 @Magician247 @ashley_buice @RealRichardPoe @realDonaldTrump Yeah but when the basis of a story are unnamed sources and the story is "verified" by unnamed sources it's very difficult to fact check...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudLib6 @Magician247 @ashley_buice @RealRichardPoe @realDonaldTrump Anonymous sources confirming anonymous sources. Sounds legit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTrumpVirus3 @PeacefulRioting @RabbsE @JohnWHuber @derekahunter Another unnamed source :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabbsE @JohnWHuber @derekahunter Look at how all those "sources" that were talking about Trump being a Russian agent all of a sudden under oath had to admit they had seen no evidence of collusion. When you're anonymous and not under oath you can say anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabbsE @JohnWHuber @derekahunter It's not difficult to imagine there are a number of people happy to spread dirt about Trump, doesn't make it true. That's why naming sources is important so they can be challenged on the facts as they explain them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster Reads like circular reporting to me. Wouldn't be surprised if it's the same "sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenGriffinFNC @JeffreyGoldberg Bolton already debunked this. Keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredlholt we saw that with Russia with people saying one thing when they were on CNN and MSNBC and something different when they were asked under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredlholt it's possible they have "real sources" but it's not difficult to get someone that hates Trump to make up something bad about it and then report on it. A little different when those sources have to repeat that under oath...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere dude if that was you asking the first couple of questions I'd stop preaching to anybody about "real journalism". You just embarassed worse than an twitter post could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kikilani @sahilkapur Meant challenge Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kikilani @sahilkapur Yeah he's not great but he'll change Joe and push back. He knows he's done if he doesn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heminator This will backfire because whatever you might think of Chris Wallace he'll ask challenging questions and push back, and Trump certainly will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere Was that you with the 1st 2 questions?? Please hand in your press pass. Do you legitimately think it's your job to ask questions like that??  https://t.co/Eb0OkGhYtx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsAshleeLee @adamhousley @Peoples_Pundit Like they went into that with any dignity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak ✌ now respect my wishes to end this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahilkapur Not only is Biden clearly aware of the questions in advance ( he looks at notes to answer questions) but the questions are all designed for him to attack Trump. Absolutely nothing to challenge the things he is saying and doing. Chris Wallace won't do that be warned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahilkapur Such a hack. We're not stupid dude but you are insulting the intelligence of everyone that watched that if you think that was a legitimate press conference....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Ok enough we're clearly not going to agree I've tried to end this conversation twice and you've kept going. If you think this is good journalism that's on you but it's really not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Ok one more reply even though ive asked you twice to stop, if you want to talk about false information you might look into the person responsible for the Atlantic story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak  https://t.co/TqAGhICAw2  And now I'm done have a good day. ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak :/ what a weak argument. There is such a thing called evidence. E.g.. we have evidence why that trip was cancelled and it contradicts the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak We're obviously never going to agree and I don't want to waste my time any further have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak It's really not because it's confirmation of nothing. You seriously cannot believe anonymous sources "confirming" other anonymous sources is evidence of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Sure but if that's the basis for your story and other sources directly contradict it then you take it with a pinch of salt. I'd certainly need more evidence. If that's your standard to believe something fine but it's a very flimsy standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Anyone on the record confirming it or all anonymous sources??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak It was confirmed by the AP that cited 2 unnamed sources. It has been refuted by 6 people that were on the specific trip including Bolton all of whom have gone on the record. But sure believe 4 unnamed sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulford21979 @TimRunsHisMouth  https://t.co/kaTsqU43t5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Yeah but the Atlantic story goes much further than that and several people are already on the record disputing it (including Bolton). What you're saying is because it sounds like something that might be true it's true. That's a horrible standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson Unbelievable. Whoever that is needs their credentials revoked. I'd be embarrassed to call myself a journalist after that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth What the hell was that 1st question. Whoever is asking these sorts of questions needs to have their press credentials revoked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarChamberMaid @Shem_Infinite Yeah we both know that'll never happen. Nobody is going to ask him a challenging question until the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 Somebody needs to ask Biden if he would not have shut the economy down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Lol sure Bolton is protecting Trump. His book was written before the Atlantic story so it's fair to say it's accurate unless you have any better evidence??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great timing for Biden to talk about the economy on the day it's announced unemployment has gone down 1.4 million. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak  https://t.co/TlAe2N5J2T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Bolton is no fan of Trump but he's now on the record denying a key part of the story. If you think Bolton's lying that's up to you but it's interesting you'll believe 4 unnamed sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_Calhoun @kurtimus @EWErickson Mr anonymous, Mr Unnamed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkellRob @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson No I didn't, i was making the point that anyone could take something that's in the public sphere and create a story around that using unnamed sources. Just because it sounds plausible doesn't make it so. Journalism still has to mean something otherwise what's the point??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chairface4 @joelpollak Lol 6 people that were on the trip have gone on the record to say it's false. Bolton's book contradicts one of the main parts of the story. But you stick with your 4 unnamed sources and the 2 unnamed sources the AP found. Solid journalism there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HashtagGriswold The 2nd source is probably someone that was read the story in the Atlantic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster Not only that but they're setting new standards (or lack of) that they'll complain about when used against someone they support. If the right attacks a Democrat president in the same way they've gone after Trump they've only themselves to blame. They've changed the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkellRob @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Just because something has a ring of truth to it doesn't make it true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkellRob @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson :/ if you don't think he's not respecting people's boundaries I don't know what to say although the faces of the children say it all. Anyway my point was if someone wrote a story and based it around that footage and used anonymous sources you would he rightly sceptical...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkellRob @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Dozens of examples in that thread that you'll ignore because it's inconvenient to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkellRob @Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson He sure has a lot of grandchildren!!    https://t.co/9lD7dforWB  If you don't think this is inappropriate I don't know what to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec The good news is it happened so quickly it didn't have the chance to gain much traction. They're becoming more and more desperate and lots of people are now much more savvy to the sorts of games they play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catsorange1 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Yeah imagine if someone ran a story on Biden, based on the documented behaviour with young children using unnamed sources. I'm sure the left would be fine with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch @_pauljoyce I wouldn't be so sure. If it's true Klopp has been heavily involved then it's obviously something he wants. My guess is the more relaxed attitude so far is more to do with Thiago's season just finishing. We know he wont be ready to play for a while anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordStanTheSlam @TimMurtaugh @BorisEP :/ sure. It's not his decision to make if his safety can't be assured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordStanTheSlam @TimMurtaugh @BorisEP From Bolton's book...  https://t.co/fPVfr8D4E9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFLJ_MalcomB @ChristineBreas1 @mollysmcdonough @robcrilly Lol you guys. One story falling apart so you seamlessly go to the next one. Shameless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drstarr16 @PlotACourse @petestrzok Also when basic facts claimed in the story can be debunked this easily it brings into question the whole thing...   https://t.co/yR9VQEoaF1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drstarr16 @PlotACourse @petestrzok APs anonymous sources confirmed the Atlantics anonymous sources. That's some great journalism there. Meanwhile I've counted 6 people that were on the trips in question that have gone on the record to deny the story (not anonymously).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimLaPorta @realDonaldTrump @TheAtlantic @AP This isn't journalism 2 anonymous sources one with first hand knowledge whatever that means and another who was told about it, but presumably doesn't have first hand knowledge. So basically anyone that read the Atlantic story could have been your 2nd "source"?  https://t.co/n34NNvRX8K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimLaPorta @realDonaldTrump @TheAtlantic @AP "With knowledge" i.e your anonymous source was told about it by someone else that's anonymous and repeated it to you. Even in your "report" they don't claim first hand knowledge. Hell they probably heard about it from the Atlantic story and their 4 anonymous sources!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustVent6 @JordanKarem1 @PressSec @POTUS I count 4 people that have gone on the record to dispute the story. 4 named people. You choose to believe 4 unnamed sources. This isn't journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcGiller @DavidAFrench @julie_kelly2 @JordanSchachtel @davereaboi @KurtSchlichter I just spoke to an anonymous source that confirmed everything you just said with 100% accuracy. Especially the grifter doofus bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruhoho @guypbenson What is relevant is resisting arrest, fighting with the police, not obeying their commands and making a move into a vehicle which contained young children. Do those things and the chances of the situation escalating increase dramatically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TajButterworth @lyndseyfifield  https://t.co/9lD7dforWB  My point is you can take something public like this and then write a story using unnamed sources around that public video. Is that a credible story??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TajButterworth @lyndseyfifield Yeah he's on camera doing more than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TajButterworth @lyndseyfifield Anonymous sources told me Biden was inappropriately touching children. Given the video we can watch ask yourself if this is credible or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimsciutto Jim I have 4 anonymous sources that told me Biden touches children inappropriately. Given the video we can watch ask yourself if it's credible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJohnsonLaw @jimsciutto 4 anonymous sources. Anyone can do that. That's not journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipFogg71 @realDSteinberg @WallStHappyHour @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol Yeah it's a 2 year old story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jhimmibhob @JohnnyBialy @JonahDispatch @Jhic709365 E.g. someone could take the very public footage of Biden sniffing the hair of young girls and touching them inappropriately and come up with anonymous sources that tell them all sorts of lurid stuff. Would that story have any legs just because it's similar to things we can watch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jhimmibhob @JohnnyBialy @JonahDispatch @Jhic709365 The problem is it's easy to take things that are public and wrap them in "anonymous sources" and then write a story which soubds credible to those that want to believe it because of the public statements....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heckyessica To be fair the AP has confirmed it by one person that won't admit to it, so....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Is this journalism now?? 4 unnamed sources told me Joe Biden is inappropriate with young children it must be true because look at what we can all see on video and it's similar to what my unnamed sources have told me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeattleTam @realDSteinberg @WallStHappyHour @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol Would you automatically believe the word of 4 unnamed sources in that scenario because it bears some similarity to things we can see on video?? What if the anonymous sources went a little further with their accusations is it believable just because of what we know is public??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeattleTam @realDSteinberg @WallStHappyHour @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol What if someone wrote a story using the public footage of Biden sniffing the hair of children and touching them inappropriately and used that as the basis for a story which said 4 unnaamed sources told them he did the same to other children. Would you believe the story??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeattleTam @realDSteinberg @WallStHappyHour @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol Yeah they're using his public statements to try and add some credibility to the story but it's still a story with no named sources. Anybody could do that, how about this....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertjdenault One outlet ran a story with 4 anonymous sources and then someone from the AP said he spoke to an anonymous source who confirmed the story. Is this what passes for journalism nowadays??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDSteinberg @WallStHappyHour @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol I like how how says he can confirm it in its entirety, and then says especially the stuff about John McCain. Like can be extra confirm that bit or does entirety mean something different to him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mchooyah Yeah Mr Anonymous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WallStHappyHour @realDSteinberg @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @ProjectLincoln @BillKristol Yeah the APs anonymous source confirmed the story of 4 anonymous sources. Solid reporting there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ignorem62281500 @CoreyClayton @benshapiro That you think this is proof of anything is hilarious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@angrygenome @CoreyClayton @Ignorem62281500 @benshapiro You could literally do that about anyone, and sprinkle in there something that's on the record to add credibility to it. You wouldn't accept that type of "proof" against a politician you liked but you're willing to accept it cos it's Trump and you hate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angrygenome @CoreyClayton @Ignorem62281500 @benshapiro That's not confirmation of any thing other than that which we all can hear. But if you think stories involving anonymous sources that are "confirmed" by anonymous sources is proof of anything you're kidding yourself. You believe it because you want to believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 I can confirm I have an anonymous source that can confirm what the APs anonymous source said about the 4 anonymous sources the Atlantic used is true. Case closed guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angrygenome @CoreyClayton @Ignorem62281500 @benshapiro Lol another anonymous source confirms the stories of 4 anonymous sources. You've  nailed him!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aliphaire @SheboyganJake @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins I'm not sure why you're defending Pelosi when she clearly fucked up. If this exact same scenario had happened with Melania or Ivanka your head would have exploded through outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aliphaire @SheboyganJake @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins The rest of the country while not practicing what she preaches. It's really not difficult and if she had apologised properly it wouldn't have been much of a big deal but instead she punched down and passed the blame into someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aliphaire @SheboyganJake @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins My argument is Pelosi is a hypocrite, she should have apologised and not blamed the salon owner. It's not a setup when you call the salon to book the appointment, if Pelosi doesn't know the law in her own state that's on her and it's a little worrying since she's lecturing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyb1678 @Amy_Siskind You should see the father's Facebook account!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellbell_b @Amy_Siskind They know this they just play dumb.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo What is it with politicians refusing to accept responsibility for their actions. "Let Covid ambush NY" please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yofinks @scrowder @atrupar I had to block him, I can't his bullshit isn't good for my blood pressure!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules Funny when the person reading the names drops in "these are from 2015 by the way". Who was president in 2015?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway It's such a disingenuous argument. Maybe 15% of eligable voters won't want to vote in person because of covid 19 and being at a higher risk therefore we need universal mail in voting!! No, the 15% can vote absentee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yofinks @scrowder @atrupar @atrupar is probably the biggest hack on this site and there's lots of competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins :/ c'mon no need to do that. The left media will try and destroy this woman I hope she makes it through ok. Pelosi will be fine she's the 3rd most powerful person in the US ffs. Talk about punching down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins I think we both know CNN and MSNBC would have treated it very differently. Have a good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins I just told you it's no big deal really other than very embarrassing for Pelosi. I'll leave you with this thought though, how do you think the media and even yourself might have reacted if this was Melania Trump and she then blamed the salon....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins What actions?? Getting a message from Pelosi asking her to do her hair and agreeing to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Oh and nobody is going to listen to her when she tries to preach about following science or whatever like she did the same day she had her hair done. She has zero credibility on this issue now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Nothing should happen to her, just own up to your mistakes and start practicing what you're preaching or let the rest of the country do what she's doing. She's been shown to be a hypocrite and when caught blamed someone else, it's embarrassing but nothing else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Explain how its a setup when it's Pelosi that contacted the salon and not the other way around. Dude she's a hypocrite which is probably true of 98% of politicians, but it's the failure to take responsibility which is a terrible look for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Lol she said I take responsibility for being set up, c'mon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxNordau @miss_grundy Hell she went on TV the same day she got her hair done preaching about following the rules, following science etc...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aliphaire @SheboyganJake @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins If she didn't break any rules why all the hoopla and why does Pelosi say she was setup?? Honestly I couldn't really care, I know most politicians are hypocrites and it's often one rule for you and one for them but the worst part of the whole thing is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Pelosi was being a hypocrite telling everyone in her state one thing and doing another thing and then when she was caught being a hypocrite she blamed someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @Aliphaire @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins :/ I think you don't understand what set up means. Nobody forced Pelosi to make that appointment, I'm assuming she knew the rules in her own state. How is it a setup when Pelosi made the appointment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowKimbrell @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump There's one person in this thread not arguing in good faith and it's not who you think it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFeinberg If you can't admit the press in a Biden press conference are lobbing him soft balls 99% of the time you're just in denial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFeinberg You can't be this dense. You know exactly the point being made. Biden's "press conferences" are basically tell us how amazing you'll be Joe. Trump faces a hostile press pool that are often just out to ask gotcha questions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sepeku @Blaidd_tx @BlankAddd @laralogan There is video of Kyle and of the first person that got shot during that day. One of them is shown helping injured victims and calmly explaining why he was there the other is dropping the n bomb and agitating...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheboyganJake @DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins That's not an explanation. All I understand is Nancy blaming a business owner for getting caught breaking her own rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidiserson @BTuckertime Explain how its not a joke for us commoners. I get it you hate Trump but it is a joke and it is funny and the fact no-one else used it up to this point makes it even better because it's so simple yet effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DotDotDot_John @kaitlancollins Explain how it was a set up? Did the salon arrange the appointment or did Nancy?? Did Nancy not know the rules in her own state? If not why not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannywallace @davidiserson @BTuckertime And strangely enough I'd not heard anyone else use it before Trump. If the political parties involved were reversed you guys would be loving it. Be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Oh and Trump was interviewed by Wallace for an hour about a month ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull If only someone could get in there and ask a different question to the one they vetted. Then watch Joe read the answer to a question nobody asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattdizwhitlock Cc: @ddale8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you're being criticized for dodging questions from journalists it's not a good luck to have "staff" calling them out. Kinda looks like the questions have been preapproved by the campaign and there suggests Joe already has the answers. #Trump2020 #Biden2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze It's happened every time. Last time he had a list of names he worked through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOrtsen @TimMurtaugh @PressSec That's not the same as having the questions vetted and answers prepared beforehand. You think CNN and MSNBC are giving @PressSec their questions in advance?? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOrtsen @TimMurtaugh @PressSec That's not the answers it's a list of facts that she can call upon when needed. Someone took a photo of that folder and it covers every possible thing she could be asked...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Cc: @ddale8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSmithpolitics1 @SidtheKidd87 One unscripted question and he flubbed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden gets 1 unscripted questions and stumbles to answer it coherently. No wonder they don't want to debate. #Trump2020 #Biden2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze The questions basically amount to "tell us how amazing you'll be as class president".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze The messaging is schizophrenic. Yesterday they were banging on how all the rioting and violence was Trumps fault. Now it's a figment of people's imagination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulkrugman Your messaging is schizophrenic. One minute the riots are Trumps fault the next minute there are no riots make up your minds!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast They'd much prefer a populous that isn't involved in politics and finds it "boring". One of Trumps greatest gifts is to get more people involved whether they support him or not. They want you asleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow Predictive programming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParadisoReale @__kesh__ @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson ok i've changed my mind you are stupid. Police officers don't charge the DA does. Also whatever you want to say, in both cases he is being chased by a mob. I'm not sure why you'd lie about that when we can all watch the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__kesh__ @ParadisoReale @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson he knows hes talking shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParadisoReale @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson dude have you watched both instances? he's running away before he shoots the first person too and is being chased. If you're going to talk in bad faith there's really not much point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParadisoReale @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson Yeah it seems in your reality you can see video of someone running away and claim they aren't running away. Enjoy your reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@check_yellow @redsteeze You don't even need to be armed anyway, you can kill someone with one punch. The key question is who was being the aggressor and whether or not Kyle felt his life was at risk as to whether or not it was self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@check_yellow @redsteeze :/ if you're using said skateboard to beat someone over the head with it becomes a weapon..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill If only you'd had 8 years to do this already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParadisoReale @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson Great argument. ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParadisoReale @paulnumbers01 @guypbenson Yeah he was being chased in both instances. The first incident involving the convicted paedophile he was retreating and being chased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypbenson Cc: @ddale8 c'mon dude do your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielTurnerPTF the proof is how often this was talked about during the convention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidescrollersid @PrisonPlanet they are never held to account because they only talk to their own echo chamber. It;s up to people to hold them accountable if you see them in public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R3dGoner @PrisonPlanet the right to defend yourself. Unless you are against the right to self defence you have no argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R3dGoner @PrisonPlanet yes a skateboard can kill you if someone smacks you over the head with it. And in the first instance it doesn't matter if he is unarmed, you can kill someone with your fists. The question is who was being the aggressor and if you feel like your life is threatened you have...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisVomvos @davereaboi absolutely the President needs to hammer this because then it's much difficult to do it because there'll be immediate pushback when he says it. Its the same with the whole mail in voting thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsox23 @DeadlineWH @Yamiche @NicolleDWallace yes you have it wrong. Do some research you'll find there is a lot more to this story than CNN or MSNBC will tell you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @Yamiche @NicolleDWallace @Yamiche @NicolleDWallace the ability to defend yourself when your life is being threatened is a fundamental human right. Are you suggesting people should not be able to defend themselves??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CFCalexmatt @Fanzinecom :/ no, i was just waiting for someone to say it after I said he'd probably do better in Serie A. I am aware he's played in Serie A and done well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fanzinecom and yes I am aware he played for Napoli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davereaboi the best way to combat this is to shine a light on it now as you are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fanzinecom not a Chelsea fan but you could do the same with any player. He's a little slow I think for the PL but would probably do great in Serie A.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceMChamber @WajahatAli Yeah if she was shot in the back it wasn't by Kyle. Kyle was running away from a mob both times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli Such a lying hack. It took Biden about a month to say much on it. Funny that the Democratic convention just a few days ago didn't even talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveHofstetter You are wrong on almost every point you made here. Though I guess by your own standards anyone at the protests is a communist sympathiser because believe me they're there and if you roll with commies i guess that makes you a commie in your world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajzeigler the people that have watched the videos and are still convinced that self defence doesn't even come into it is astonishing. Ok lets hear the evidence but to see the videos and not even acknowledge there is a case for self defence is extreme gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ahmad_A_Abusada @AnfieldWatch @IanDoyleSport Grujic and Wilson are the 2 obvious ones. 2 players that didn't play 1 min for us last season. If we can sell them and add a player that strengthens the 1st team squad overall we're stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @ScottPresler has done far more for black communites than BLM has with their hundreds of millions in donations. What does that tell you about what their goals are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deaton_cristal @CodyTidwell9 @Mike15424780 @JackPosobiec yeah the convicted peadophile that chased him with a group of people and backed him into a corner. Kyle was retreating in both instances and the mob decided to chase him in both instances. What do you think they were going to do when they caught him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodyjammer @Viper6Ancient @thelastpinkcar @Yamiche You have a very strange relationship with the facts. In both instances he is retreating and being chased by a mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelastpinkcar @Yamiche Explain how its not self defence? Are we supposed to submit to the will of the mob??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers We'll sell Wilson, Grujic and maybe Shaqiri and bring 1 or 2 in. Net spend will be close to 0 but losing those 3 players 2 of whom didn't even feature last season and replacing them with players that will makes us stronger.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1BurtanLafleur1 @dkearnsjr @willchamberlain @ChrisMurphyCT as one of the chasers is moving towards him he shoots him and kills him.

<|startoftext|>@1BurtanLafleur1 @dkearnsjr @willchamberlain @ChrisMurphyCT there are 2 separate incidents, in the first one Kyle says he is stopped by police from returning to the business he is protecting so he is separated from him group, as he is returning to another car lot a group see him and chase him, he runs until he is backed into a corner...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VividConfusion @ChrisMurphyCT @DavidPepper in both instances he is retreating and being chased.

<|startoftext|>@KingCantona14 @esaagar Yeah I saw that. Keep checking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Does he look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingCantona14 @esaagar Yeah you might wanna check who they helped bailed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec I'm sure the fact checkers will be all over this speech. Cc: @ddale8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emzanotti Also that "quote" he keeps repeating from Kellyanne Conway is not accurate and misrepresents what she said. He won't be fact checked of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emzanotti Except the words don't match the action (or lack of)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it telling that not one "journalist" on the left is being critical of Biden and Harris' refusal to take any questions after these speeches. What are they afraid of that they can't even answer questions??? #Biden #Biden2020 #Trump #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZekeJMiller he's forgetting something which I can't quite put my finger on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SidneyPowell1 @GenFlynn keep fighting Sidney, this allows more documents to be released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger @AndrewBatesNC what's it like being one of the Trump reply people AND a Biden reply person!! good job Jennifer you're doubly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden what about left wing violence Joe?? or is that a myth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neontaster It's terrible messaging and it's also not true. The far left hates Biden they just know they can control him. We all know how they operate if Biden meets their demands there will be new demands. Biden will never be woke enough for them and the violence will continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akarl_smith what's this the mafia?? elect our guy or the violence continues!! The far left hates Biden too, they just know they can control him, if Biden gives into their demands they'll just demand more. The violence isn't stopping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes @MaraLiasson when it's happening in exclusively run democratic cities and states its a stark reminder what happens when democrats are in control. Democratic leaders are failing to act to protect their citizens and refuse help because the don't want to give Trump anything positive before Nov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman good job the media will be able to call out her hyprocrisy. Oh wait...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cc @JoyAnnReid your buddy Kamala is posting a link that is helping to bail white supremacist agitators. Better have a word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catholicmom2 @SteveKrak @Surabees @JoyAnnReid They already do that. Check out the Portland police website and see who's being arrested (spoiler alert they aren't white supremacists)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Seriously how is @JoyAnnReid any different to Alex Jones?? She's spreading conspiracy theories about most of the rioting and looting coming from right wing agitators and she's a mainstream host on MSNBC!! Trump has truly broken these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Supersnowtiger @NBCNews person that has been offering to help gain control of the streets from the start (90 days ago). Leaders don't pass the buck. Ted is the leader of Portland and he's failed badly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Supersnowtiger @NBCNews you must be stupid. Antifa runs Portland and the major allows it to happen. He's panicking now because someone was shot dead in the city he's supposed to be running. It's a little late to denounce violence when you've done very little to stop it and then blame it on the one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Most of them hate Biden too. They just know they can control him because the "moderate left" is scared to death of the far left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazyitalian7 @empireofthekop A lot of money has gone on things like improving the stadium, redeveloping the training complex &amp; tying down players to big contracts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazyitalian7 @empireofthekop True. I think that's our model. Look to make world class players, sell them for big money and use that to strengthen the team. Our net spend each year will be low if we can do that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VJD364 @ElpopGolf @clairecmc So why are democratic leaders stopping Trump from helping stop right wing violence 🤔  Why is the left raising millions of dollars to bail out right wing agitators 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElpopGolf @clairecmc Trump has been denouncing the violence for months and offering help to stop it very quickly. The left attacked him for even suggesting it. We aren't stupid we can remember a few weeks back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @JoyAnnReid 2. The left were raising millions of dollars to bail out the people arrested just a few weeks ago. So I guess they were actually raising money to bail white supremacists 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich It makes no sense for a few reasons...  1. Trump has constantly offered to send in the National Guard to stop this and it is democratic leaders that have refused the help. If you believe @JoyAnnReid that means democrats are preventing Trump from stopping right wing agitators..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop The coutinho sale is a huge part of that £145 million for him was amazing business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Where is the proof this individual was a white supremacist?? You'd better be careful with your facts before you defame someone @LLinWood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaTweets Also by their own logic. Trump is offering to send in the national guard to stop white supremacist violence and it's democratic leaders stopping him from doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaTweets They were raising millions of dollars to pay their bail just a few weeks ago. The Biden campaign were donating. And all this time they were raising money to help bail white supremacist Nazis, who knew??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strangeland_Elf @JeremyDBoreing If someone says that to you ask them 2 questions...  1. So Trump wants to send in the national guard to stop white supremacist agitators and democratic governers are stopping him??  2. So the left was raising money to help pay the bail of white supremacists??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realictaylor @redsteeze And by the way please donate to this organisation to help bail out the white supremacist agitators that are getting arrested - the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan So lets get this straight...  1. Trump wants to send in the national guard to arrest right wing agitators but it's democratic leaders stopping him?  2. The left was raising millions of dollars to bail out right wing agitators??  Sounds totally legit.  https://t.co/KdZCGxgOo0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cigarsehole @neontaster The same Trump agents the left was raising millions of dollars to help bail just a few weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin @waltshaub Now the latest lie is the violence is coming from the right. If you goto these places and talk to the people committing the violence they'll tell you why they're doing it, the vast majority of them are extreme left wing anarchist and communist sympathisers, we aren't stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin @waltshaub This switch doesn't fool anyone. The democrats thought the rioting helped them and they were silent, they've seen the polling and know it's hurting them so they've switched but it's too late people saw that you supported it in your silence....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin @waltshaub The VAST majority of the violence is caused by far left anarchists. Unless all you democrats were promoting organisations to help bail out right wing agitators a few months ago??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin You got the new DNC talking point Evan. Only about 2 months too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when antifa rioters that are arrested in Portland are almost immediately released with democrats supporting their bail payments what sort of message does that send?? #TedWheeler #TedWheelerMurders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton all in a few weeks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @jenvanlaar @tedwheeler cc: @ddale8 wow this one's going to keep you busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks nothing to do with them trusting him more, they don't want to give Trump anything positive he can use in November or admit they need his help. They absolutely would take help if offered by a democrat president which is a shameful state of affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork And basically blames the victim :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComfortablySmug i don't think Joe can end it. The far left controls Joe not the other way around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA seems pretty stupid for democratic leaders to give them what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexAllman @ScottAdamsSays hmm 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff So why are democratic governers doing the very thing you say Trump wants them to do?? pretty stupid if you ask me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BungaWillie @iDanSimpson @stillgray blocked by Mr Cartoon man!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iDanSimpson @stillgray he might not have yelled it but someone in his group did. And yes they were the ones doing the chasing, its very clear if you watch the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGHamilton29 cc: @tedwheeler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro they keep making Trumps campaign ads for him. Elections are all about contrasts and you have 1 party that says America is terrible while the other party talks about what makes America great. I know which message plays better with most voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lfcsed_ so does Minamino.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmc1326 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman who was he telling what to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FabrizioRomano no way this gets settled before the end of the transfer window. and nobody is paying his release fee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iDanSimpson @stillgray defending himself by chasing after someone and yelling "we've got a Trumper" yeah that'll hold up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth @ScottPresler has done far more for these communities in just a few years than BLM has done in their entirety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @MrAndyNgo thinking you can stop a 4WD by pushing it, priceless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman as you can see from the video, that guy was acting aggressive all the time he was there. It's not a stretch to imagine him out to target someone he could beat up. Unfortuenately he picked on the wrong person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman yeah the reason is he wanted to beat the crap out of him. Nobody has suggested he did anything wrong prior to this other than being blocked from returning to the car lot he was protecting which left him exposed to the mob. He was retreating until he was trapped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daniela4k @CassandraRules you obviously don't understand what fascist means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpUndead @CassandraRules yup they called him Hitler for merely suggesting to use the national guard. But he didn't take the bait and soon the majority will be begging for him to do something. He's let things run their course knowing this is what was going to happen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules they were hoping he would step in, he's let it run its cause and soon the majority will be begging for him to act and then the left loses any sort of moral superiority they think they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmyjewel @kmorgan26 @MikeNayna I think it's getting close to that point. At some point in time he will have some sort of moral justification to say "i offered to help, you refused and it got worse, now im stepping in" but it makes sense politically to give governers the chance first to take strong action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna they are scared to death to give Trump any sort of credit for stopping this close to an election. But is that a good thing? governers willing to protect their citizens only if it makes a democratic president look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna one thing I would posit though is because all this is happening in Democratic run states and cities it has become highly political, especially this close to an election. It is possible democratic governers would be more likely to accept help from a president Biden because...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna ok i understand your point, but unless you do want your president to be a dictator, given the nature of how America is governed there's not a lot he can do legally other than offer assistance and hope it is accepted....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmyjewel @kmorgan26 @MikeNayna The only moves Trump has left are  1. Do nothing and let the states continue to make the decisions whatever the consequences  2. Ignore the governers that say they don't want help and send in ther national guard (he'll be called Hitler if he does this)  3. Continue to offer help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmyjewel @kmorgan26 @MikeNayna Sure but at what point do you say the help has been offered and refused numerous times so the responsibility is lessened. The problem is lots of the people criticising Trump for these riots are the same people who would call him a fascist if he sent in the national guard...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP left back coming in. I expect 2 or 3 more will leave and that will fund Thiago. All the suggestions are Klopp wants him and I doubt it would have gone this far if we weren't prepared to pay for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP other teams that aren't will need to take a few more risks in terms of spending and hope it works out. What we're doing while frustrating is the responsible approach long term. We'll sell players and use that money to fund any transfers as we saw with Lovren leaving and the...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP You're over simplifying things. Given the current climate with covid 19 it is very risky to spend big on transfers knowing your income is going to be severely limited for the forseeable future. Teams that are in a position of strength (i.e LFC) can be more cautious...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 @FabrizioRomano i don;t think we'll have a positive net spend this summer because of covid but we have 3 or 4 players we can sell to fund this transfer. Nobody knows what's happening behind the scenes, Thiago is still on his holiday and will be probably for another week, there's no rush really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 who says it's out of reach? The player's season has just ended, according to @FabrizioRomano who is usually very reliable, Klopp wants it to happen and we have been in contact with his agent etc... we have to agree to a fee with Bayern....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coded_omoluabi why would Bayern want him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stratago @mcarson1383 @lanaveenker @AP yeah because this is all CGI...   https://t.co/KB6BoMEwr0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 if Thiago goes to Utd it's because we won't spend around 30 milion euros for him and they will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna it is the leaders of the cities and states who are in the positions to make decisions on how it is dealt with so the aftermath is absolutely on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna there is nothing to suggest Biden will be more forceful to these riots than Trump has been. It took him over a month to even acknowledge it was happening. The fact it all of this is happening in democratic run cities and states all with democratic leaders who are responsible...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna If Biden is President do the protests / riots stop?? They happened when he was VP so I have no reason to assume they will. In that case how will a President Biden deal with it? will he be more dictorial than Trump has been? will he overrule governers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna if you grandstand about how you don't need any help and then the very next day you get violent riots and someone getting killed that's on you. That has nothing to do with Trump. If you're looking to make a contrast between Trump and Biden in terms of law and order ask this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna There is clearly politics in play here. In the case of Portland antifa has a massive influence there and law enforcement etc.. are very lenient towards them. The major of Portland was very vocal in his refusal of help offered just yesterday so he is responsible...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan26 @Emmyjewel @MikeNayna think that's a little simplistic. Trump has continually offered to assist these states with support and they have refused. He has been called a fascist for even suggesting using the national guard to try and restore some sort of order. You can't have it both ways....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinthejuice @photogater @MrAndyNgo just out of interest what did you say about the people doing that? and are you consistent with what's going on here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast hopefully the feds that have infiltrated are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrietzkeEdward @AntifailLOL @AJHodgeIV @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman do you think it was just a coincidence that the only people he fired at where the individuals that attacked and threatened him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrietzkeEdward @AntifailLOL @AJHodgeIV @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman his first reaction was to retreat until he was backed into a corner in the 1st incident and until he fell and was being attacked in the 2nd incident. If he was intent on just killing people he would have shot at more than just the people who were attacking him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@og_dthe @mcarson1383 @lanaveenker @AP lol, good one. I judge people on their actions not what they call themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LATiffani1 you just got told off by the President in the nicest possible way!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danny7Gallagher this doesn't make sense. He can sign a pre contract in January but wouldn't sign until the end of the following season. He's already said he's leaving this season so he's not playing at Bayern for another year. Either we pay the £25-30 million or someone else will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcarson1383 @lanaveenker @AP lol no antifa involved. Antifa were certainly celebrating the death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabyrinthWeaver @AP it's always Trumps fault isn't it. Lets not mention that just yesterday the major of Portland refused help from the National Guard and they have consistently been lenient on antifa who basically run that place. No mention of antifa in that article by the way which is telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrietzkeEdward @AntifailLOL @AJHodgeIV @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman "She shouldn't have worn a short skirt, she was asking for it"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anfield1982 @Liddellpool @FabrizioRomano Sure, we shouldn't wait to sell players before making a move. But it probably plays into the timing if we do need to sell to buy we need to make sure there's firm interest in these players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redistrict @ScottPresler  https://t.co/IzToQZalHa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redistrict @ScottPresler  https://t.co/2RpBoExYab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redistrict It's still real lives being destroyed, you shouldn't be so flippant. People see it and worry about it reaching their town or city. Why don't you do some real work like @ScottPresler and look at the very real impact this is having on people's lives...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anfield1982 @Liddellpool @FabrizioRomano According to @FabrizioRomano we've been in contact with his representatives for a while so it's probably just a matter of negotiating the fee. I don't see us with a positive net spend this summer so players will also have to be moved out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anfield1982 @Liddellpool @FabrizioRomano We don't know what's going on behind the scenes. If Klopp wants him I don't see the fee being an issue but we might be trying to negotiate it down a bit or move 1 or 2 players on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertlerone @FabrizioRomano @TalentedThiago @JamesPearceLFC Liverpool is probably the players first choice if they have been in contact with his representatives for a while and Klopp wants him. If the owners don't sanction the funds then he'll look elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lowfunkg @redsteeze @axios They were already moving back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSteveCox @selfdeclaredref  https://t.co/Qu6YCINKDD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSteveCox @selfdeclaredref No she's calling you sweaty. No misspell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool @FabrizioRomano Afterwards. We don't know what's going on behind the scenes but hopefully Thiago has given us his word etc.. then it's up to the negotiators to get it done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toroholmen @Liddellpool If we can't make it happen he'd sign for Utd. They are still a massive club in the CL etc..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liddellpool According to @FabrizioRomano Klopp wants him and we've agreed terms etc.. If that's the case i don't see us missing out over a few million euros. I do think our net spend this summer will be close to 0 so we'll have to sell players to fund this transfer but that can happen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conureCC Do you think burning down businesses, and looting stores is a good strategy to get people to listen to what you're trying to say?? If the goal is change then you have to do things that will help bring about change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qwerty6012 @AnfieldWatch Doesn't mean we won't sign Thiago but the fee will be offset by selling players (probably Wilson, Grujic, maybe Wijnaldum) but we won't have a positive net spend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adbusters @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump thanks you for this kindly reminder to voters who is controlling Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteKopite @deckygall @GraemeKelly1 Agree, we have players we can sell to raise the fee for Thiago, does it matter what way round it happens??selling Grujic and Wilson should pretty much cover it and there's been interest in both players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyjr000 @RichardSmedly @_LibMalcontent @saint_walker74 @MrAndyNgo You made the initial claim when you stated as fact that he carried a gun over state lines, I simply corrected your mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyjr000 @RichardSmedly @_LibMalcontent @saint_walker74 @MrAndyNgo I believe in due process. You've already decided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyjr000 @RichardSmedly @_LibMalcontent @saint_walker74 @MrAndyNgo No we can't all agree with that. I can't talk with someone that obviously is talking in bad faith so have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyjr000 @RichardSmedly @_LibMalcontent @saint_walker74 @MrAndyNgo Let's wait until the trial but that was in the statement released by his lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardSmedly @_LibMalcontent @saint_walker74 @rickyjr000 @MrAndyNgo He didn't transport the weapon it belonged to a friend who lived in the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmc1326 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman No that still doesn't take away your right to defend yourself. Otherwise what you're saying is you should submit to the mob and hope they don't kill you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmc1326 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman The bottom line is the rights of the individual to self defence don't disappear if the mob feel justified in their actions to attack you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sousohumano @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman You're confusing the 1st incident and the 2nd incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sousohumano @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman :/ have you seen the video of the 2nd incident. He's running away and being chased. He falls and they attack him while he's on the ground. One person kicks him in the head, another hits him with a skateboard he defends himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman There's circumstantial evidence though. You've seen the video of the 1st person that was killed right? Acting in an incredibly aggressive way. We've also seen the video of him chasing the shooter not the other way around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sousohumano @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Yeah that doesn't answer my question. What is Rosenbaum doing chasing after him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman What is the moral thing to do when you are retreating from a mob fall and they attack you? You don't think morally you have the right to defend yourself??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thighpictures @Bio_Mchavis @smarthinking99 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Correct, the question I'd like someone that doesn't think the 1st incident is self defence to answer is what was the person doing the chasing doing?? What was their goal?? We've already seen from earlier video that they were in a very aggressive frame of mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman That assumption is pretty much confirmed when they stomp on your head, hit you over the head with a skateboard and point a gun at your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superdavos @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Which video?? He wasn't randomly wandering around pointing his gun at random individuals. He pointed his gun and fired it specifically at people that attacked him first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman If you're open carrying and someone chases after you while you are retreating I think it's a sensible assumption to make that the people doing the chasing are prepared to use deadly force since they are aware that you are but still choose to chase you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sousohumano @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Why is the 1st guy that was shot chasing after him? What is his goal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sousohumano @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Yeah that summary doesn't accurately describe his statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superdavos @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman He wasn't "wandering around threatening people" that's a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman If you want to try and theorise the state of mind of the 2 people involved in the 1st shooting there is evidence that the guy that was killed was acting in an incredibly aggressive way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman He's seen on video chasing the shooter and throwing something at him. He's shot as he's moving towards the shooter, it's safe to assume he didn't have good intentions. There is much more evidence for my scenario than yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @JodoKast1 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman You're making a lot of assumptions though. Here's another scenario, the guy that was chasing him was an aggressive piece of shit. There is video from him earlier in the day where he's acting in an aggressive way, dropping the n bomb and taunting people to shoot him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHurtGod @Crypticshock @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Some sort of sense to try and apprehend him although it's pretty stupid. But in the first incident this is before anyone has been shot and he is the one being chased and backed into a corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHurtGod @Crypticshock @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman He's running away. He was running away in both incidents and in both incidents people are chasing him. Why would you chase after a guy that is open carrying?? Especially the 1st incident I'll grant you for the 2nd one if they thought he'd just murdered someone it might make....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKernel85 @GeoffGlave @BBBE555 @SamHarrisOrg :/ ugh yes you can still leak (even though it's illegal) but what you can't do is selectivity choose what you leak and put your spin on the information. It'll be there in black and white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dywati22 @LFCTransferRoom I agree it's a fine line and we rode our luck a fair bit last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradi1287 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Misdemeanor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmc1326 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Call me stupid but if I feel like my life is in danger I don't chase after the guy running away open carrying. I run in the opposite direction!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman And if the people chasing you, kick you in the head, hit you with a skateboard and point a gun at your head you have every right to defend yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicksKicks3 @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman But we don't know so I'm judging the 2nd incident on what we can see. And what we see is someone open carrying running away, he's not attacking anyone. If someone decides to chase after someone open carrying it's fair to assume they mean to do you deadly harm....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crypticshock @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman And what you are basically saying is if a mob thinks they are justified in chasing you and beating you and possibly killing you even if they are wrong in their assumption you have no right to self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crypticshock @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Also if you are retreating with a gun clearly on show and someone decides to chase after you, it is a fair assumption they intend to do you deadly harm and you can defend yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crypticshock @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Big IF on that first part firstly because nobody really knows what led to the first shooting based on what we've seen so far...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman If that 2nd clip isn't justified self defence then there is no circumstances where self defence is justified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Which part? The 1st shooting I've not seen enough video. The 2nd and 3rd is text book self defence. Why would you say the 2nd and 3rd shootings aren't self defence?? One dude kicks him in the head another hits him with a skateboard and a third is pointing a gun at him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineGuercio @BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman Just keep moving those goal posts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittanyWebb85 @Jeff98088403 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman He was wearing gloves because he was performing duty as a medic. There is video of him helping to treat people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittanyWebb85 @BrandonADaniels @RexChapman He didn't cross state lines with a rifle. The rifle was borrowed from a friend who was from that state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rawbertoh @RichardGrenell The leaks are selective and often a misrepresentation of the actual intelligence. If the intelligence is in writing it's much more difficult to misrepresent it or spin it to suit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie2jay @BBBE555 @SamHarrisOrg If the briefings are in writing they can still be leaked but you can't then spin the details because the details are there in black and white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie2jay @BBBE555 @SamHarrisOrg They leak all the time but spin the details to suit their agenda. The bounties on soldiers leak is a great example where only part of the intelligence is leaked so you get part of the story....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dywati22 @LFCTransferRoom We relied on the brilliance of the fullbacks and front 3 and in a lot of games it was very small margins between a draw and a win. The more top quality players you have the more ways to win you have which can only be a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffGlave @BBBE555 @SamHarrisOrg They are still being briefed but the form of the briefing is changing. Maybe if certain members didn't immediately leak details of intelligence briefings to the press with their spin on top it wouldn't have happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie2jay @BBBE555 @SamHarrisOrg They're still being briefed, but now certain members can't immediately leak to the media with their own spin on top. This is what happens when every intelligence briefing is immediately leaked (illegal by the way)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natureshover @cowboy082478 @SamHarrisOrg It's what happens when certain people immediately leak to the press, with of course their own spin on top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy869 @swartzendruper @clwtweet @ProjectLincoln this is why you keep losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln what's unbelievable is you thinking this makes Trump look bad to any rational non TDS suffering human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annibute @Darren39693324 @jaketapper @AndrewBatesNC ??? This stuff isn't meant to be leaked it's highly sensitive. Unfortunately it's standard procedure now that those briefings are immediately leaked to the press.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acadiaspring @annibute @Darren39693324 @jaketapper @AndrewBatesNC Yup but it cannot be twisted or misrepresented which is what is happening at the moment. Selectively choosing to leak things that benefit you politically and not disclosing anything that might counter that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlittle2010924 @RichardGrenell Will stop them from cherry picking and misrepresenting the information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazyredranting @annibute @Darren39693324 @jaketapper @AndrewBatesNC It could be leaked but it can't be selectively leaked or misrepresented. We've seen it so often where things get leaked but only bits that are politically beneficial and sometimes the intelligence is misrepresented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faizaan67 @lfcsed_ @JackSear None of them controls the midfield like Thiago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annibute @Darren39693324 @jaketapper @AndrewBatesNC Or maybe because the briefings are always leaked to the press with cherry picked information and half truths. They're still being briefed just in writing which makes it harder to spin for political capital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imprisonTrump45 @jaketapper @RepAdamSchiff They aren't being briefed in person because certain individuals keep leaking to the press with their own spin. They will still be briefed but it'll be in writing which is more difficult to spin and cherry pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobOberdorfer @mtaibbi Your privilege is showing mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lfcsed_ @JackSear But he can play the pass before the assist which is just as important. Imagining him feeding the front 3 and 2 fullbacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FalseFMatt Agree he feels like the type of signing that will act as a catalyst to the evolution of the team. Much like VVD improved everyone around him I think Thiago does the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lfcsed_ @DPSD37 @JackSear Caught the last 20min and pens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPSD37 @JackSear Either way it's no surprise that midfield lacked creativity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lfcsed_ @DPSD37 @JackSear Didn't get the chance to watch the game sorry just assumed that's why he was picked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPSD37 @JackSear Didn't get the chance to watch the game sorry just assumed that's why he was picked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirgilVanDickyy @MelissaReddy_ I don't think Melissa has too much sway when it comes to transfers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Some players act as a catalyst for everyone around them, we saw it with Virgil and I think Thiago would have a similar impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Seems like a no brainer, you don't buy players for the sake of it but when a genuine world class player is basically begging you to sign them in a position that needs improving you have to take that opportunity...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make that signing and this Liverpool team can take the next step. Without it they're relying heavily on the front 3 to keep producing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes one player can be a catalyst and improve everyone around them, we saw it with VVD and I think Thiago would do something similar. Someone that will feed the full backs and front 3, there probably isn't a better passer of the ball in the world... #LFC #Liverpoolfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGUHPATRICK10 @AnfieldRd96 @RhianBrewster9 What if we sign Thiago?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>€30 million for a world class player that would help us in terms of controlling the ball and supplying the front 3 seems like such a no brainer I'd be amazed if we didn't make it happen #LFC #Liverpoolfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you need to freshen things up just to stop things getting stale as well as trying to evolve as a team. Thiago looks like the perfect player to help do that as well as offer something we don't currently have.... #LFC #Liverpoolfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom I think you can see what someone like Thiago would offer that we don't really have. Someone that can control the midfield and is a superb passer of the ball. Not to mention freshen things up in terms of competition for places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom Creativity is important, the front 3 need good service to be an influence. Trent is a key part of our game plan and when he's not there we're not the same team....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daddydaynah @m4aubinow @Timcast they are trained to empty their clip I think. You shoot until the threat is neutralised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bezzza_Desta @MattWalshBlog you're talking as if he didn't fight with the police, resist arrest, and make a move into his vehicle. Had none of those happened do you really think he would have been shot?? When you resist arrest and try and run away the chances of something bad happening increase massively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m4aubinow @daddydaynah @Timcast if you fail to comply the chances of something bad happening increase significantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m4aubinow @daddydaynah @Timcast as he was reaching into the vehicle which contained 2 young children. After breaking free from them and resisting arrest. There were a lot of things that led up to that, do you at least accept that?? lesson #1 for anyone should be comply with the police...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackSear @OttawaSouthie think it's also to help Williams on the right defensively since he'll be up againt Aubameyang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADITYATALEKAR1 @MelissaReddy_ think its more a case of playing Milner to help Williams defensively since he'll be up against Aubamayang. If Trent were playing i think we'd see Keita.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 TAA, Henderson, Matip, Ox all genuine 1st team players injured but I agree we could do with another 1 or 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceLFC Milner in there to baby sit Williams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daddydaynah @m4aubinow @Timcast that's not how they're trained. You're trained to aim for the largest area, it's not easy to hit a small target in a split second when that target is also moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGHamilton29 yup, it does give a bit more context about the mindset of the police going to that call. i.e they knew there was an exisitng warrant out for him. This wasn't someone that was breaking up a fight as was first reported and somehow found himself in an altercation with the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weaverXP @MattWalshBlog you don't think its newsworthy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigblueape @m4aubinow @Timcast yeah that ship sailed a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m4aubinow @Timcast it also looks like he had a knife (the police were telling him to drop the knife). You're talking as if the police shot a man in the back who was doing nothing wrong and complying with their demands. He wasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m4aubinow @Timcast they weren't though were they? now we know the reason they were called. We also know he was fighting with the police and resisting arrest. We also know he broke free from the police and made a move into his car where 2 young children were....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow So many people don't watch cable news anymore, those numbers don't include CSpan, Youtube, OAN lots of other ways to watch outside the 6 or 7 networks they count here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steel94010 @ScottAdamsSays you know there were many other ways to watch other than the 6 networks??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump It's amazing what you can say with impunity in a fascist, dictatorship!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dhs64dhs @elecizenson @charliekirk11 "Many"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Citizen_Kryptik @kylegriffin1 They need to tell the Democratic leaders running these cities and states. Those are the people with the power to actually do something about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBraveScott @NuanceBro Not really it'd slow things down. Also no matter what you say in terms of impartiality the fact checks will themselves be subjective. Do we then get a fact checker for the fact checker??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuzzPatterson @ArtValley818_ You're going to need patriots on the right to also show up and make sure people aren't stopped from voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz They want it both ways. The new narrative: Trump is president this is Trumps America. A few weeks ago when Trump was offering to help "dominate" the streets: Trumps a wanabee dictator. They think we're stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @ScottAdamsSays Don Lemon thinks he sounds much smarter than he actually does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow Do you have a link to that full show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aliamjadrizvi I know a lot of journalists took 8 years off when Obama was president but this didn't begin 3 years ago, it's been happening for over a decade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGamblingQB @parscale @CNN @AC360 @realDonaldTrump @ddale8 lol so you're repeating the lie that @ddale8 debunked??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill the left media right now...  https://t.co/XaWTSYIWf5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenyMustikasari @hiddennamebc @KellyannePolls you want a president that is at least able to form their own thoughts whether you agree with them or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenyMustikasari @hiddennamebc @KellyannePolls it is kind of a worry that someone that could become president relies so heavily on notes (that he was probably given to read) Trump at least is able to hold press conferences with tough questions and talk unscripted for over an hour at a time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls why do you have a problem admitting most of the people out protesting and rioting lean left?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls are you joking?? it took Joe over a month to say anything critical of the rioters and looters and most democratic representatives have downplayed it. And yeah the milita that showed up probably lean right, I have no problem admitting that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls It's also happening in exclusively democratic run cities and states so it is democratic governers not controlling what is happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls did you listen back to that video by the way??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls You think those people are voting Republican?? only one party has condemned the looting and rioting unequivocally by the way, the democrats have downplayed it or ignored it as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradySecules Why is he so reliant on notes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>notice how Biden in these last few interviews has relied heavily on notes. Is it any wonder they don't want him debating!! #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020 #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls listen very carefully to what Biden says, and then listen very carefully to what Kellyanne said. They are not the same thing. He's lying to try and make it seem she's encouraging rioting because it helps Trump this is not what she said at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls what did she say?  and please explain how republicans are responsible for BLM protesters rioting? I'd love to hear how that's their fault. Are these individuals not responsible for their actions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hiddennamebc @KellyannePolls and yet he still wasn't precise on her wording. That's a worry when he can't even read something accuratly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dminpink61 @KellyannePolls he couldn't even quote her accurately when he was reading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stateofdenial @TVNewsHQ @KellyannePolls you heard what you wanted to hear keep listening and maybe you'll understand why he's clearly misrepresenting what she is saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tejasdeplorable @ArthurSchwartz @RepMaxineWaters  https://t.co/gaxi22Df7n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain We all know if he did that the same person would be comparing him to Hitler. In fact that already happened when Trump said these governers needed to dominate the streets. They must think we have short memories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller @EricHolder Trump offered to send 500 national guard and the governer refused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller @EricHolder if he did that you'd call him Hitler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BapakZoe @creynol350 @BishesBrew @Yamiche it seems like the bigger your rap sheet the more your life mattered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec remember this one too..   https://t.co/4JPhHGSwLD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurSchwartz @RepMaxineWaters called for it too. They're complicit in what's happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinsmith206 @scrowder and that would stop the riots how??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshdcaplan democrats are encouraging it @AyannaPressley just a few days ago and @RepMaxineWaters months ago. They are encouraging their base to do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind seek help, he's broken you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareCandace @KyleKashuv there are a couple of high profile democrats that asked for this from their base, they are not only complicit through their silence but through their words also.   cc: @AyannaPressley @RepMaxineWaters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro cos they're stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder if they wanted to stop them they would have stopped them. It's happening in democratic run cities and states. It is democratic leaders that have the power to stop the riots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @AbTwo4_ so much love and light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaWNYC keep up the good work Andrea, it's journalism like this the country really needs right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze no wonder they're all acting in a panic. They must be wondering what they have to do to stop him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Can you imagine after everything they've thrown at Trump in the past few years, some of it maybe legitimate criticism but lots of it manufactured outrage and then looking at the polls and it's not working. They have 95% of the media supporting them and it's not working...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @GGoknicks @redsteeze You know when Hilary Clinton called millions of people "deplorables" and Nancy Peolosi called millions of people enemies of the state?  its kind of hard to forget that. The left is not interested in uniting anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow They still don't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotlineJosh He doesn't want to alienate the most influential wing of his party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simplerusername @MattWalshBlog Where is your evidence that he was looking for trouble?? Because there's evidence to the contrary of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWHuber In fact they'll have criticised the mispronounciation of a terrorists name more than they criticised the terrorist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Peace and light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Not weird on some shows it's important, I remember watching Lost with subtitles because often there'd be subtle hints and clues dropped  that you could easily miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creynol350 @BishesBrew @Yamiche if they had acknowledged the murder of David Dorn it would have meant they would also have had to acknowledge that part of these protests was violent and they wouldn't acknowledge that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creynol350 @BishesBrew @Yamiche they could have acknowledged it! He was killed by looters, they were trying to pretend looting and violence wasn't happening so they couldn't talk about it. Unfortuneately looting and violence follows peaceful protests around but to pretend it wasn't happening at all is heinous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Now do the people protesting the convention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BecketAdams The DNC really miss Harvey Weinstein.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyBriteKline @JackPosobiec @JoeBiden So you're ok with Trump going over the heads of democratic governers that refuse to take action?? Or would you call him Hitler if he did that? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJAnton @ArthurSchwartz @JoeBiden Yeah and you'd be calling him Hitler if he did that. Can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate The question is do people think Joe can control the radical left wing of the party?? @RashidaTlaib already told Trevor Noah how they were able to push him far to the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld Yup, if one story sums up what's happening it's this; the left couldn't even talk about, let alone condemn what happened to David Dorn because they were afraid of ruining their "peaceful protesters" narrative. Think about how vile that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Exactly you know the democrats are going to get desperate so they need to keep pushing the pace, painting a positive picture of America while reminding people what the country would look like under the left. Force Biden out of his basement, force him to talk policy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCarltonKing @kittypurrzog Also spreading this DNC talking point that the only way he wins is by cheating is incredibly dangerous. The democrats are alreasy setting the stage for refusing to accept the result if he wins and if that happens things won't end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCarltonKing @kittypurrzog If you listen to CSPAN you'll see how wrong you are. Sure there is a hardcore on the left and right that will never change their minds but if you don't think the riots and violence haven't had an effect on some people that want to feel safe you're kidding yourself....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Took you weeks to say anything negative about the riots but sure you're going to make people feel safe. The rioters are your base and you're all scared to death of them. When Trump talks about restoring order you call him a tyrant, dictator, you can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishesBrew @Yamiche That's some great projection you got going there. The left couldn't even talk about David Dorn because they knew it destroyed their narrative of "peaceful protesters" think about how sick that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AT21496740 @BoscoJankovic1 @RogerAPotter1 @kylegriffin1 @valeries86 And we've already seen governers compare him to Hitler when he offered to restore control in these places :/ you can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarCampgnWatch @ElijahSchaffer Correct, the paedophile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli @vikireed republicans are supporting the right to self defence. Do you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice lol even @tariqnasheed wasn't stupid enough to outright call him a white supremacist. these people deserve to get sued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec yup, the easiest lie to refute and he just brushes over it. It also means the reason Biden cites for running is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer there is footage of one of them clearly agitating beforehand and being very aggressive. If you're looking for circumstantial evidence that particular individual (the first person shot) was clearly in an aggressive frame of mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDonutwizard @RWarehall @Boomieleaks the black man was resisting arrest and fighting with the police trying to restrain him. The minor gave himself up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDonutwizard @RWarehall @Boomieleaks although there are photos of him holding something that could be a knife and the police are shouting at him to "drop the knife"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks @TheDonutwizard lol was wondering this myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull @andersoncooper @ddale8 if this is genuinly the reason Joe decided to run and he's said it many times, he's running based on a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull @andersoncooper dude this was an open goal and you didn't even challenge or push back on this blatant lie. @ddale8 you gonna fact check this?? unless saying "neo nazis and white supremacists should be condemned completely" is not saying anything negative about them....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen read the comments in any post that includes @FLOTUS or @PressSec or @KellyannePolls the left has no problem doing any of those things to conservative women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanStone110 @BishesBrew @ProjectLincoln i challenge you to read the comments in any post that includes @FLOTUS or @PressSec or @KellyannePolls and then try and come back to me with the moral high ground in terms of how the left talks about these women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishesBrew @ProjectLincoln lol i challenge you to read the comments in any post that includes @FLOTUS or @PressSec or @KellyannePolls and then try and come back to me with the moral high ground in terms of how the left talks about these women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDonutwizard @Boomieleaks it kind of wasn't unrelated, the whole reason the police were called was because he showed up somewhere he wasn't supposed to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyannaPressley Calling someone a white supremacist with no evidence. You'd better lawyer up!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmmoertel @redsteeze I'd be careful making statements like this with no evidence. The individual has legal representation now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice He wasn't the only person with a gun there. In fact one of the individuals chasing after him was armed with a pistol. I agree the situation has got out of control and we need calm heads at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomieleaks Right, what happened before the 1st video where he is being chased and has something thrown at him is the main unknown at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KKE_Voulas @LFCTransferRoom @VarskySports His season has just finished so he'd be joining later than everyone else any way. I'm guessing he's on holiday at the moment. I reckon we'll sell a few and get this tied up before the season starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Trump obviously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice That doesn't prove intent to kill someone. He is interviewed before it all happened and he explained why he was there. Sure he should get charged with a misdemeanor for not being old enough to own that weapon but that doesn't take away his right to self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surabees @robbysoave I did warn him @LLinWood is now representing this person lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjs_DC Be careful @LLinWood is representing this person and he loves taking money from people that spread lies about his clients.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Did you see the video of him from earlier that day?? Do you think it's at least possible he was instigating trouble. We've seen the video of him chasing the shooter in the first incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Here is earlier that day, not agitating or anything.    https://t.co/AccFplLele<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Here you go...  https://t.co/mNt8drFA8Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson You know how many of the protesters there were from out of town?? Are they all agitators too?? I can show you what agitating looks like if you like? The paedophile that got shot had been doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog @LLinWood I'm saying he'll have a very good defence team that will present the facts well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Have you seen his rap sheet? Not a nice person. Likes dropping the n bomb too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NazarethII @clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice Yup that's what he'd do if his livelihood was threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog The Facebook posts you can't show me??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC The blue check marks better be careful throwing around those baseless allegations now that @LLinWood is involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zac_Petkanas Cc: @LLinWood another one baselessly calling your client a white supremacist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog @LLinWood is representing him, the same guy that got CNN to pay the Covington kid lots of money. He's in good hands don't worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @jaketapper Better be careful @LLinWood is representing him, and I heard he likes taking CNNs money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Lol sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Alleged?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson Agitating means he was behaving in a way that was trying to get people to react to him. Do you have any examples of that??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Yeah and he'll get off with that charge based on the evidence I've seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog I haven't seen that can you show me where he's joking about killing people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson I can show you examples of the paedophile he shot agitating earlier in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson Examples of him agitating??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog I'm defending people's right to protect property and themselves. Are you saying we don't have that right?? He killed a paedophile who was running after him, I'm not going to lose sleep over that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Sure he might be guilty of a misdemeanor. But that doesn't remove your right to self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog He might be guilty of a misdemeanor if he's not old enough to have that particular gun. But that doesn't take away his right to self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Doesn't matter he is still entitled to defend himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog He is interviewed earlier in the day and explains calmly why he's armed. He's there to clean up the city, protect a business and be a medic if needed. He states very clearly he's armed so he can protect the business and himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Wrong you have no idea of the law. Just because you open carry somewhere doesn't mean you give up your right to self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gay_verse @HartlessTanner @clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice Cos the governors are scared of the mob and have tied their hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@houndsandflowe1 @Wallace_Noll @BWestbrookAZ8 The same paedophile he shot first is in video being aggressive, goading people to shoot him and dropping the n bomb liberally. Not a nice person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@houndsandflowe1 @Wallace_Noll @BWestbrookAZ8 He's being chased before the 1st shooting too and someone threw something at him that looked like a bottle. The paedophile he shot was moving towards him so he probably felt threatened...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson Would you protect your business from a mob that's burning businesses to the ground or just let them take your livelihood from you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog Ok so he was being attacked with a bottle and being chased. So he can defend himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog You don't understand the law. If he felt threatened it's self defence and being chased, hit over the head with a skateboard, kicked in the head and having a gun pointed at him is more than enough reason to feel threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog What did I leave out?? I clearly said there were 2 separate incidents :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog There is video of earlier in the day of the same guy being very aggressive, dropping plenty of n bombs and goading people to shoot him. I won't lose too much sleep over this aggressive paedo getting shot when he's chasing someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog The 1st incident it's less clear what happened but there is video of him being chased and something was thrown at him. Then the guy he shot is moving towards him so it's possible he felt his life was under threat..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog That's what I said. There were 2 incidents the 2nd incident where he is being chased by a mob and was hit by a skateboard etc.. is clearly self defence....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishesBrew @MaxNordau @EWErickson Wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timpranillo @andrew_amarone @EWErickson Would you have been ok with him getting murdered because it could have easily gone that way. What would you do if you're being attacked by a mob? At least one of whom was armed? Just lay there and hope they don't kill you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen Just an fyi: @LLinWood is representing the person you just smeared as a white nationalist and I'm sure he'd love you sue you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoscoJankovic1 @RogerAPotter1 @kylegriffin1 @valeries86 What facts?? Are these riots happening in exclusively democratic run states?? Is it the governers of those states job to protect its citizens?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerAPotter1 @kylegriffin1 @valeries86 The USA is a constitutional republic which means governers are responsible for law and order in their states. And these governers are failing to protect their citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerAPotter1 @kylegriffin1 @valeries86 But if Trump sent in the national guard to deal with the problems (as he has suggested numerous times) you'd be calling him a tyrant, you can't have it both ways....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump 1. The black man wasn't unarmed  2. The black man was resisting arrest and not following police orders  3. The white teen gave himself up to the police.   You're supposed to be a journalist you should know this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetsFan1966 ?? So because I think @ddale8 is a partisan that makes me a cultist?? Please explain that logic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice because he was protecting a business he had connections to after seeing other similar business burnt to the ground the night before. People have a right to defend and protect their livlihoods or are they supposed to sit back and let a mob burn it to the ground?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clae1142 @KennyG1971 @MarkDice because people trying to burn down a business are not acting in a peaceful way and if you're putting yourself in the way of those people you need a means to defend yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull cc: @ddale8 wanna fact check this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyG1971 @MarkDice i wouldn't bet on it, the video footage of the 2nd incident is very clearly a self defence situation. The 1st incident not so clear but plenty to suggest he was feeling threatened too. Also the brilliant @LLinWood has agreed to represent him. He's going to have the best defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyG1971 @MarkDice what was his intent and how do you prove it? He is on video before it all happening calmly explaining why he was there. To protect a business and be a medic if needed. That's evidence of his intent, more evidence than you have that he went there with an intent to shoot people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james1chas3 @Elizabe35971752 @watchman_sp @jackmurphylive @Steve_Sailer This kid is going to get great representation @LLinWood has already volunteered to help. Having so much video footage helps get to the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jorrdeann @silentmoosassin @Jaxm53 @Cernovich Wrong the video you are watching is the 1st shooting. Nobody had been shot at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaxm53 @Cernovich That's the key issue. The 2nd incident is an obvious case of self defence. For the first shooting he is being shot and the guy that's killed gets awfully close to him when he is shot so the shooter would certainly have felt threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenPeterze1 @Caeldeon4 @BrokenRender @Cernovich I think there was a car lot he was protecting I've read varying reports that he was connected to that business in some way. I think that's where the 1st shooting happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenPeterze1 @Caeldeon4 @BrokenRender @Cernovich He was there to help out in a number of ways, the are photos of him helping clean buildings and he's on video saying he was also there to protest businesses which is probably why he came armed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamFraser17 @greg_fann @oliverdarcy @ddale8 @Ddale irony right? (please say you're being ironic)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverdarcy @Yamiche @ddale8 It's funny how people just assume this guy is an authority on anything, just because he says it. He's putting his own spin and bias into all of these "fact checks" and in fact you could easily fact check his fact check and find he's telling you half truths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hiphopjunkie86 @BubbaSmollett @Yamiche "They blame Russia for the loss" please show me the evidence that any interference changed 1 vote from Hilary to Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog One of the mob is pointing a gun at him (the guy he shoots in the arm). It's clear self defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog The 2nd incident is as clear an example of self defence as you'll see. He's running away people are chasing him and trying to hurt him, he gets hit over the head with a skateboard and the mob are clearly out to do him harm....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostcentered @ET20224352 @MattWalshBlog We still don't know the full details of the 1st incident though there is video of someone throwing a Molotov cocktail at him as he is trying to defend the car lot and the mob is trying to destroy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heckyessica It'd be interested to see some of these athletes try and describe the circumstances of what happened. I'd bet it bears little similarity to the facts as we know them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ny2020_jax @DoubleEntendre0 Yes but the facts around the 1st incident are unclear although there is video of someone throwing a Molotov cocktail at him just before the 1st shooting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KariSco61448841 @Cernovich I think the police are trained to empty their clip when they do make the decision to shoot which is why it was 7 shots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhDonnelly @SethAMandel @chrislhayes He won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGradenigo Since Weinstein's kinda tied up, the democrats have lost their production expertise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eyebrows360 @jaredlholt Nothing you said there is supported by the evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredlholt If you're talking about the 2nd incident there's not a more open and shut case of self defence you'll ever see. I know there was another incident but so far no clear footage of what happened there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz @MsAshleeLee Those internal polling numbers must have been terrible!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkippyMcGil @tracybeanz Yup and the media will do their bidding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@golfcat2 @LeBronXGoat @KingJames Except when it comes to what's happening in China right? Then he's a good little lapdog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctitizenx @ElijahSchaffer Yeah I have and they are well trained. Most of these kids aren't although the kid at the center of it all seems really well trained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_blobs @JoeBanks88 @JohnGalt23 @Allison39989220 @MattWalshBlog If you break it down it's mainly young black men so we're talking about maybe 3% of the population committing 50% of violent crime. That should be something that every one is focussed on trying to fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Do you also condemn protesters who bring weapons with them??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet As someone living in the UK that follows US politics more closely than UK politics it really is an eye opener when you see outlets like the BBC blatantly lying when they cover the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe What do you think should happen to people that violate the terms of a tourist visa julia??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaRevolution @Death2Tyrants84 @MattWalshBlog In the 2nd incident he is running AWAY from the mob who are chasing him. This is a clear an example of self defence as you will get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaRevolution @Death2Tyrants84 @MattWalshBlog You do understand in the 2nd incident at least he could have been the one killed? He is being attacked by a group of people one of whom tries to hit him over the head with a skateboard and another whose pointing a pistol at him...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markdbarnes @GaffinMark @KittieGianelli @Cernovich @Barnes_Law @LLinWood 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWHuber This is the only play they have left and they've laid the groundwork. And you know the media will help them. If Biden loses they are going to refuse to accept it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youneedashave Yeah you're probably right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chimpz69 @julie_kelly2 yeah i guess when you're desperate you'll try anything. Probably expect some sort of false flag event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 what else do they have at this point? They must be down to plan Z if that stupid USPS conspiracy is what they went for. The only card they have left is refusing to accept the results if they lose and having the left media support that. Hilary already set the platform for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdGreenberger @KurtSchlichter this is what happens when democratic governers are more afraid of upsetting the mob than protecting their citizens. If Trump sent in the national guard you'd call him a tyrant so it's up to the governers to do their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden tell that to the democratic governers who are submitting to the mob right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterSchiff @SchiffSpencer bet he owns bitcoin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaseEmbree @redsteeze @benshapiro there's video of someone throwing a molotov cocktail at him before the first shooting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer so your solution is to get rid of police? if you're not interested in improving how they behave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer highly disproportionate rate it's very difficult to have a productive conversation about how we can make the situation better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer what are the stated goals of BLM (on their website)? NOBODY is against better policing and trying to prevent people being killed by the police no matter what race they are. But when you start from a premise that is sensationlised i.e that black people are being targeted at a ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT lol would be the most hollow victory ever. Why doen't Pep try and improve the players he already has (all of which he's bought or inherited).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cshemenway @therecount please explain what's aggressive about standing still looking at someone (who approached him)??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottknot @CassandraRules @duckseasonyet correct, it looks like he points the pistol at the kid being chased just before he's shot in the arm too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter it's amazing how they resort to every insult they accuse their political opponents of using. The left preach that there's no such thing as an illegal alien until it suits them. They're happy to throw around racist, xenophobic, and mysoginistic insults if its against the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler but i thought nobody is an illegal alien? your xenophobia is really shining through tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer just curious who do you think is burning down these businesses at the moment??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer just goto the Portland police website they post mugshots of people being arrested every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer did you watch the video? he was being chased by a mob some of whom also had guns (including the guy that was shot in the arm). He was being attacked and had a gun pointed at him so he can defend himself. What led up to that I don't know so im not going to comment on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer they are out on the street burning shit down. there is a difference between protecting your property and just randomly burning stuff down you understand that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer we do know there were plenty of businesses on fire, so lets not pretend businesses weren't being burnt to the ground there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer ok i don't have that information and neither you do so lets hold judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CollinsforGA @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden she also said she believed his accuser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deetruthhurts @Chronik1130 @skottdaltonic @ElijahSchaffer depends what you mean by evidence but he was interviewed by @ElijahSchaffer before it all happened and said he was there to protect property.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blahdiblahblah9 @dh14216893 @ElijahSchaffer ok but they are trained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dh14216893 @ElijahSchaffer but with years of training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TripleTInc1 @Chronik1130 @ElijahSchaffer i think he's 17 if its the person that's been identified. As ive said to others I have no problem with people defending property and themselves. That it has come to this is a indictment on the governer who should be stepping up and allowing trained professionals to do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog this is a clear example of the disconnect these people have. They are living out some sort of fantasy where they don't see the danger in attacking someone with a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott where does @JoeNBC live??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huffmsa @ElijahSchaffer yup no chance. They are hostage to the mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray should be taught in school. I wonder how many cases of someone being killed by a police officer there are when they complied with the orders they were being given?? I know there are still some incidents out there but i'd imagine its a very small number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8bluebird @ElijahSchaffer yup the left want it both ways. If Trump uses the National Guard he'll be called a tyrant but governers aren't stepping up and allowing their police to do their jobs. The governers are the ones that are responsible for this escalation but we know they'll never be called on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chronik1130 @ElijahSchaffer yup as soon as governers stood their police forces down in fear of the mob this was always going to be the outcome. The big issue is too many democratic governers afraid of upsetting these mobs or in some cases actually supporting them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex19673 @ElijahSchaffer trained kids usually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodOfTitsNWine7 @ElijahSchaffer yeah, the democrats position on this is crazy. They want to take your ability to defend yourself away from you while also defunding the police. Its such a stupid position and what we saw last night is what will happen often if it is allowed to be implemented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chronik1130 @ElijahSchaffer chaotic and not ordered or well organised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chronik1130 @ElijahSchaffer im not criticising anyone for trying to defend their property or the property of someone not capable of defending it themselves. But when you have kids doing the protecting and kids on the other side it doesn't end well. What we saw last night is just the beginning and it was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealCopWatch @SwaeLevi @ElijahSchaffer I completely understand their desire to protect their property and the property of others, but what we're seeing right now is not ordered its chaotic and people are dying and more will die unless professionals are allowed to come in and restore some sort of order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realbasedkirby @ElijahSchaffer looked far from ordered from what I saw. Not blaming the individuals for wanting to defend their property from a mob because their elected officials are failing to do what they are supposed to do. But it's not going to end well for anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chronik1130 @ElijahSchaffer the professionals aren't being allowed to do what they're trained to do. Governers are so afraid of upsetting these mobs, and people are dying because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer kids on both sides of this playing grown up games. Professionals need to come in and restore some sort of order.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dannn777 @ESPNFC Other key players like Pique, Busquets, Suarez are in their 30s and they can't be replaced easily. Their transfer dealings have been terrible but how do you replace a once in a generation player??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dannn777 @ESPNFC That club is need of a massive rebuild. Messi is 33, physically he's not Ronaldo so the toll of playing at the highest level for 17 years is starting to catch up with him and he can't carry the team by himself...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ There is a difference between "no racism" and America isn't a racist country. But you know that. You can find examples of racism in EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY so by your logic every country is a racist country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyHroBlakademia @Skyrpex @clamrag @KeziyahL Yeah I hear you, I'm trying to hold out much judgement until more facts are known but I do think there should be a huge emphasis on de-escalation as part of the training.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyHroBlakademia @Skyrpex @clamrag @KeziyahL I agree with you that the police have to be trained better at deescalating these types of situations though and citizens need to be educated better in terms of following orders from the police.

<|startoftext|>@MyHroBlakademia @Skyrpex @clamrag @KeziyahL that's what they're trained to do. As soon as he didn't comply to their commands and made a move into his vehicle they can't wait and see if hes getting a weapon if they wait it's probably too late...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comey funny cos the main message at the DNC convention was how bad a country America is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules This close to an election let them show America who they are. This doesn't play well with most voters and if governers won't do anything to stop it you're going to red pill a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec That woman has more courage than that whole mob combined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keith__farmer @esaagar you just don't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CryptCoinPoodle @esaagar yeah that's kind of his point. People always point to Fox News but CNN, MSNBC, ABC etc.. have been far more partisan recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@King_Coleman @esaagar you just don't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow just ask yourself if he was backing a different candidate how the media would be treating this. This is what Trump means when he calls some media "fake news". They don't treat both sides the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Nothing in either of those links about Biden continuing the "fine people" lie. If you didn't fact check that what else did you miss??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadBigMac @FloatingStools @Skyrpex @MyHroBlakademia @clamrag @KeziyahL If it is true what BLM are suggesting in terms of the police and black people the greatest lesson you could teach a black person when interacting with the police is comply and then if you're upset take action later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadBigMac @FloatingStools @Skyrpex @MyHroBlakademia @clamrag @KeziyahL if someone that has been asked to comply isn't complying and then tries to reach into a vehicle the police are trained to assume they are reaching for a weapon. If you wait and see it's too late....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skyrpex @MyHroBlakademia @clamrag @KeziyahL I read they had already used tasers and it had no effect on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Can we fact check you?? If you make such silly "mistakes" like this why would anyone take anything you say seriously??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise And nobody in the media will call her out for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaysSimonson I wonder who plays Kevin Cleinsmith??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott Journalism in 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulaReidCBS It's also really interesting that you're now trying to interpret what Trump thought he heard to continue this fake story. This isn't close to journalism and it's why fewer people trust you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulaReidCBS So why did Trump repeat the words spygate??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHorseman_99 By his own logic any child that dies in relation to being locked down through suicide which is a real issue is on the conscience of anyone supporting not to go back to school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Pro tip, when calling people dumb try and make your tweet coherant, and not sound like the ramblings of a crazy cat lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGHamilton29 @guypbenson compare how the democrats treat witnesses they don't like to how someone like Sally Yates who has some real serious questions to answer was treated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyTurNBC If certain states opened up for business that number would go down very quickly. But that's not Trumps decision to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustafaOthman70 @asteriskfan @DaveOCKOP @derspiegel We could play a 4-2-3-1 I also think we might see Fabinho at CB for some games when we're dominating the ball then he could play as the 6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC What are you going to do about it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asteriskfan @DaveOCKOP @derspiegel how so? he works hard, wins the ball back regularly, is very good when being pressed and his passing is as good as any player in Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch @derspiegel teams need to evolve and signing Thiago would be a great step towards that evolution. Would give us something we don't really have at the moment, would be interesting to see how he would be used with Fabinho very good in the 6, but such an intelligent player could play 8 im sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wafer_2011 @shipwreckedcrew It's difficult to remove our own prejudices from these sorts of things and it's human nature to gravitate towards opinions we already agree with or want to believe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wafer_2011 @shipwreckedcrew If you want a more rounded view of what's going on I'd certainly recommend following them.

<|startoftext|>@badsciencemonk @KerriKupecDOJ @brianstelter You're really struggling here better quit while you're behind. But keep believing Stelter and his "unnamed sources".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@badsciencemonk @KerriKupecDOJ @brianstelter And whats that got to do with what the original post was about??? When you don't have an answer just deflect! Keep believing humpty dumpty but he's one of the biggest hacks out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wafer_2011 @shipwreckedcrew Not everyone lives in the US. You know Europe's been awake for hours? Australia, NZ, Japan etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badsciencemonk @KerriKupecDOJ @brianstelter Lol Stelter and his "unnamed source". Man you guys are so gullible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ifccian @antisocialshell @IanDoyleSport He's a £140 million player and he hasn't been a regular starter for a team for over a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JILLNW @antisocialshell @IanDoyleSport Right, you'd expect a £140 million player to be a regular starter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antisocialshell @IanDoyleSport He's been a bit part player in all those teams but sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thiago will be playing for a 6 time European Cup winner next season, well done. #Thiago #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Menace20Twenty @LFCTransferRoom @ChampionsLeague Yeah although he can play that too but his switch of play is great and I can see him linking up with Firminho a lot. That pass to the full back is such a key part of our game plan and he's very good at it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @donwinslow  https://t.co/hD0RtAKPJ6  Here you go, now do these....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow It's not difficult to find similar videos of Biden supporters that can't name one policy position he holds. Good job bullying a child though 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom @ChampionsLeague Absolute baller. Can see exactly what he'd add to the team that we don't really have at the moment. Our front 3 and 2 full backs are gonna love playing with him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickFosman @JenAshleyWright he's broken you. Seek help. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenAshleyWright he's really driven you nuts hasn't he? poor thing, please seak help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny remember when the left used to laugh at the Obama tan suit "controversy"? Now they're freaking out about the Rose Garden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when the left used to make fun of the Obama tanned suit "scandal"?? Now they're freaking out about the way Melania has renovated the WH garden! #Trump #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch definitely ready to step up, has shown in the games he's played in the first team and for the U21s that he understands the system really well which is a key thing for any new player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdeeks76 @Maxi_1892 think it's a bit of both. By not signing the contract its a sign Gini might want another challenge and a big signing on fee and Barcelona and playing in La Liga would be the sort of new challenge to tempt someone. Koeman now being manager just makes it more likely (imo)...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKopSings @Maxi_1892 Yup, especially with the Ox injury and Milner maybe only having one season left, we could sign him and keep Wijnaldum knowing he's leaving next season and Milner will probably retire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katierogers @esaagar Opened this thread out of curiosity to see if even something as banal and uncontroversial could be posted without any snarky comments. First few replies nope, even this apparently is a good reason to say something negative about Trump or Melania. Crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truthforu2020 @JarradKushner "Citing an unnamed source..." great journalism Humptey Dumpty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 "Citing an unnamed source..." jeeze really??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SHE_RAH369 @zxy1296 @philthatremains Even Jake Tapper called out this lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate @TheOliverStone @billmaher I remember when the left was rightly sceptical of the intelligence agencies. Now you have people like Brennan and McCabe on CNN and MSNBC as trusted sources. All because they hate Trump and the intelligence agencies went after Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vermontgmg @WSJ When these guys hate you, it's a pretty good sign you're on the right track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich The swamp endorses Biden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistTrump045 @fredgiblet @BonginoReport @atrupar @Facebook :/ it's truly 1984 when a person can say "and I'm not talking about white supremacists and neo Nazis BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE CONDEMNED COMPLETELY" and you interpret that as him voicing support for them. There's no point talking to someone so blinkered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneEyeBlackJack @mgTrumpist @LeeSmithDC He's a terrible liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@demersing @Susan_Hennessey Yeah like all that coverage CNN and MSNBC gave to Cleinsmith pleading guilty right?? Think it was like a total of 30sec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 He's a terrible liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsPL Yup it totally had nothing to do with him and his agent getting a massive signing on fee!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistTrump045 @fredgiblet @BonginoReport @atrupar @Facebook There to protest them. He then in the very next response say "and I'm not talking about neo Nazis or white supremacists because they should be condemned completely".   And you take from that, that he's calling neo nazis and white supremacists fine people?? Really??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistTrump045 @fredgiblet @BonginoReport @atrupar @Facebook Are you being serious?? Listen to what he says. I can't believe i have to explain this but here goes...  When he said "fine people on both sides" he is talking about the people there to protest the removal of confederate statues and the people on the other side that were....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistTrump045 @fredgiblet @BonginoReport @atrupar @Facebook Walking it back in the next paragraph??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays I'm pretty sure that particular hoax is cited as the main reason @BrandonStraka walked away from the Democrat party. After he realised a lot of what he was told by the media about Trump wasn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ipitythepoorfo1 @gramsof_8 @kimjenniesolo @oliverdarcy There is an element of truth to the statement, so a statement with an element of truth to it isn't a lie. Did they omit the phrase "under God" during the pledge of all all allegiance?? Yes on certain occasions they did and on others they didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ipitythepoorfo1 @gramsof_8 @kimjenniesolo @oliverdarcy Depends how you look at it, they could have easily have said "mostly true".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@actual_chaos We know Brennan lied under oath to Congress when talking about the dossier. He's a terrible liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gramsof_8 @kimjenniesolo @oliverdarcy Mostly false i.e they did omit "under God" several times and included it a few times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays If it's live you have a chance to get your message out even though they'll try and talk over you or cut your mic. If it's recorded you've no chance of being represented fairly if it's a message they don't like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiBunny I think the people trying to blame Russia for #AlyssaMilanoIsALie trending are Russian bots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepondontstop @ABC @DavidMuir Trump did shut the economy down as soon as Faucci recommended it. Faucci was very clear about that when asked about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @DavidMuir so the same as Trump. Faucci already said Trump shut the economy down as soon as it was recommended to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieToVest she already has!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman she has no values dude that's what this is all about. How do you go from believe all women always, to Biden's accuser is a liar in a few months??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @Alyssa_Milano dude she doesn't care about you, you're just a prop she can use. Much like her hijacking the metoo movement when it suits and then turning a blind eye when it doesn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo looks like he's been crying. Can the victim sue him if he needs to pay for medical bills?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @RobinRoberts Don't worry as @RashidaTlaib made clear Joe is very malleable, I wouldn't believe a word he says now because the far left of his party has the power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themodalice @rosemcgowan Hidden in plain site when it comes to Joe...   https://t.co/9lD7dforWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phatgb @ReadeAlexandra @rosemcgowan @Alyssa_Milano And I'm sure you'll make excuses for him but just look at how uncomfortable he's making these young girls that he's meeting for the first time. This is not normal behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phatgb @ReadeAlexandra @rosemcgowan @Alyssa_Milano To all those defending Joe take a look at this thread posted way before he was running for president. This sort of behaviour is far past creepy and done in plain site...   https://t.co/9lD7dforWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WokenUp2020 @ElijahSchaffer Yeah that's definitely true of certain ringleaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Thanks @VanJones68 for confirming what every thinking person already knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer To be able to do this night after night means they don't have a job so this probably gives their sad lives some meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer These are clearly people with empty lives that get a sense of identity from doing this. Being part of this scene they are "somebody". They have zero idea how to achieve the things the say they're protesting for but they feel useful...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jefriedberg @TruthSeeker017 @jgblankenship @dazdix @JackPosobiec @oliverdarcy Is that why the conclusion of volume 1 was "the investigation did not find sufficient evidence that the campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The democrats can get a hearing with the postmaster general organised in about a week based on a cockamamie conspiracy theory.

<|startoftext|>@Jefriedberg @TruthSeeker017 @jgblankenship @dazdix @JackPosobiec @oliverdarcy What about volume 1?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCTransferRoom @neiljonesgoal If we can sell Grujic to fund Thiago that's a pretty big upgrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalpower9 @aramrahgozar @JackPosobiec @oliverdarcy Better tell super lawyer Weissmann he missed this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jefriedberg @TruthSeeker017 @jgblankenship @dazdix @JackPosobiec @oliverdarcy Lol you didn't even read the summary if you think it said that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Burrrrrrr4 @Shem_Infinite @oliverdarcy Define worse?? Fox News doesn't hide the fact it's a conservative network. CNN still tries to claim they have no bias. Your failure to acknowledge there is extreme bias on the right and left is pretty telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnaidu @IlenePrusher @oliverdarcy @CahnEmily Do you honestly think this only applies to outlets like fox?? Do you think the vast majority of journalists that cover the president manage to keep their personal politics out of it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ema_truth @AnfieldWatch @Sport_Witness So far he's not signed anything. I hope he does.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MacLoiasagaspie @FizzesD @CaraLee1221 @joelpollak @AnnCoulter @BreitbartNews Wrong.

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Has Rick finished that film yet??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro Definitely something the republicans should be pushing them on, especially since Kamala is on the record as saying she'd use executive order to take "assault weapons" from law abiding citizens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza You think Biden will be better for deficit spending than Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza Yeah because if you're worried about deficits you'd better vote for a Democrat under the control of a bunch of "democratic socialists", that'll fix things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wissa38 @JRubinBlogger @seungminkim @BenSasse the cognitive dissonence here is just amazing. But of course you think you're morally superior so it's not really a surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza and he supports the green new deal which will cost trillions as well as costing hundreds of thousands of jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza the economy under Trump has been fine. Of course the pandemic has changed the landscape but that doesn't take away what was happening before then.

<|startoftext|>@samir4628 @nomad56060053 @LFCTransferRoom @MelissaReddy_ agree he's got one more year in him but at some point his position will need to be replaced. Do you wait until he retires to do it or do you get someone in now and maybe have 1 too many midfielders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza its to do with the status quo, business as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabby_shabby @LFCTransferRoom @MelissaReddy_ Milner will probably retire next season I'd rather have 1 extra midfield player now cos he'll be needed next year, especially if Gini doesn't sign a new contract and leaves on a free. Players of Thiago's ability don't become available often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomad56060053 @LFCTransferRoom @MelissaReddy_ Agree if Gini doesn't sign a contract he leaves on a free next year, Milner is coming to the end of his career. So we might have extra depth in midfield this season but next season he'll be needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza Is governor Cuomo responsible for the 30,000+ deaths or is that Trumps fault too?? This is just another example of a biased media, Cuomo is lauded despite having the worst record by far of any Governer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza You can criticise Trump on how he's dealt with the virus but it wasn't his fault it happened and trying to switch the story to put all of the blame on Trump is another example of a biased media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumbo14055151 @fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza I kind of disagree, not every journalist of course but when you have an obviously partisan media that pretends they're not partisan that's a dangerous thing. And the old status quo means plenty of war for $ and a lot of death comes with that too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza A lot of these Washington journalists just want to go back to the status quo but the status quo means endless wars, and a lot of things people have become fed up with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza Style even if the substance isn't there. Joe Biden has been in politics for over 40 years yet these politicians talk about fundamental problems they failed to address as if it's Trumps fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fels1680_112 @MarkDice @RyanLizza Some people feel comfortable with "business as usual" even if it doesn't really accomplish anything. Part of people's issue with Trump especially in the establishment media is he doesn't talk the way THEY think a president should. They are much more comfortable with a certain...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexkotch what's a Russiagate denier?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanZibel @alexkotch would be nice to see some evidence for some of these claims. I doubt someone like Weissmann who had a much bigegr scope to investigate missed anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wasitthat @atensnut amazing that this is so many peoples go to response when faced with this sort of stuff. Grow up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjmate The idea that someone like Weissman wouldn't have clutched at whatever straw he could have is laughable. The guy has no scrupples and he was given far greater power than anyone on this committee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuitYourBS2 @DominiEastwick @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk also im not sure why every time someone talks about a democrat in a negative way, democrats immediately go to "what about Trump". You know it's possible to condemn both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuitYourBS2 @DominiEastwick @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk wishing someone well can mean many things. Maybe he was referencing Epstein not making it out of jail alive. But there is a difference to saying you wish someone well and saying someone is a wonderful human being and a good friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominiEastwick @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk it's possible she hadn't heard the stories but the chances are she had. How closely did you work with Cosby? and you didn't even hear rumours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arkyshopaholic @SomeBitchIKnow yeah cos nothing says change more than someone that's been in politics for 40+ years and was VP for 8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuclearBallsack @PiraatPedro @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk the actual quote was "wonderful human being, and a good friend". And you have no idea what she did or didn't know about Weinstein when she said this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PiraatPedro @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk FYI she hung out with plenty of Hollywood people and people that knew better about Weinstein. You think Oprah didn't know??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mariah_1007 @TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk it's almost like she's not friends with these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast this tweet will get more likes than those numbers in about 2o min.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheExiled8 @Woj_Pawelczyk LOL yeah right. It was an open secret in Hollywood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog CHANGE - i.e. vote for the guy that's been in politics for 40 years and was VP for 8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow @KurtSchlichter @TimRunsHisMouth I think it's someones 5th grade civics project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alicia_Smith19 Yup it's going to be a nightmare in November it's already determined what's going to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Of course not they didn't even report that he was named in those documents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne It's also hilarious how he's pushing the Biden / Harris launch as a 10/10. It's not difficult when the only media you get is fawning praise and you fail to answer any questions. Great job @andersoncooper pushing back on this gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne This is just horrible from Gore. Not only is he lying about Trump claiming Harris wasn't born in the US he then goes on to use a terrible anology about the mail the only purpose of which is to fan the flames of racial divide even further....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman Yup everyone can vote absentee ballot like Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy Damn you coronavirus for depriving us of seeing  @ProjectLincoln doing the Macarena with Biden!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassybarbara12 @VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump We've never had nationwide mail in voting for a presidential election so it's unknown really what potential problems might arise. But trying to implement it all in less than 3 months is crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer and keep an eye out for locked mail boxes!! they're everywhere apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer ✌️ have a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer so recent mail in elections in NJ and NY have had no issues?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer There is funding for the USPS in the bill the democrats and republicans are currently negotiating. Trump has already said he has no problem with that funding but to get it they have to agree to the whole bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden needs to start his convention speech by holding up a copy of that days newspaper. There's no way they'll let him do it live if they can get away with it!! #Biden #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar about nationwide mail in voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar yeah, sorry to be clear I wasn't accusing you of that, but that is where we are right now with very prominant blue check marks on here sharing those sorts of hysterical stories that can be debunked in minutes. It doesn't help the legitimate discussion...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar especially when that deal includes $1 trillion for democratic states that need to be bailed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar he's already said very clearly if the democrats want their money for USPS they have to agree a deal but that funding is a very small part of a much larger deal and Republicans aren't obligated to just accept whatever deal the democrats put to them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar just look at recent votes in NJ and NY they still don't know who won. To pretend there aren't concerns is being disingenuous. We both know if this election is decided by nationwide mail in voting, neither side is going to accept the result and we won't know who won for months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar ok, so what is your problem? you do realise this conspiracy theory that somehow Trump is taking away mail boxes in California or putting locks on them is just ridiculous. You don't help your argument when it gets hysterical like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer but republicans are not obligated to just agree to whatever deal democrats put forward, especially if it contains $1trillion for democratic run states that need to be bailed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer in less than 3 months it's not going to have the infrastructure ready. Trump has already said the PO will get the money if the democrats can agree on a deal, since that funding is a small part of a much bigger deal....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar he's told you why he's against it. And there is plenty of evidence that fraud happens in this type of vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar Trump hasn't hidden his distrust for nationwide mail in voting. He has openly talked about it and explained he's concerned it makes it easier to defraud an election. You have no evidence he's against nationwide mail in voting because he's afraid he'll lose....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar there's evidence that mail in voting is open to fraud, lost ballots, delayed ballots. Just look at a few recent elections in NJ or NY and the issues they are still dealing with. So to pretend there aren't concerns with mail in voting is not being truthful....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Jitsu_DG @esaagar you could easily spin this the other way. Democrats are scared of losing so are trying to force through nationwide mail in voting so they can rig close races. There's no evidence for either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VapidJason @L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer delayed ballots would be a big problem FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahPaladin @ArtValley818_ @FBI @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson the guy that commited attempted murder has been identified. But being Portland who knows if he'll face justice. He should face a civil suit from the victim though, assuming he lives. I'd imagine he's going to need plenty of medical care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimOBrien @senatemajldr @RexChapman  https://t.co/cUxBvyMbrE  Hack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how @TwitterSupport @jack hasn't put any warnings on any of the fake hysterical USPS photos of locked mail boxes or mail boxes being delivered. It's almost as if someone on the Biden/Harris team is deciding what to censor 🤔 #USPSHoax<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter Yup dems and republicans need to come to a deal to get that funding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdysl72 @AGHamilton29 the democrats and republicans can't agree on a deal which would involve funds for the USPS that's the fault of both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_Hill_LA @AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer Yeah you got me, the USPS never loses anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cegriff3 @AriFleischer @USPS You're right there are no problems with  nationwide mail in voting. As we've seen recently in NJ and NY everything goes smoothly with no problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alocalbookshop @AriFleischer Couldn't see any stat about lost mail on there. Can you point me to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alocalbookshop @AriFleischer  https://t.co/Z1m1xRF0MK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alocalbookshop @AriFleischer  https://t.co/6okpVCXCon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alocalbookshop @AriFleischer Got a source for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alocalbookshop @AriFleischer Yeah you know how many Xmas gifts go missing or arrive late??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cegriff3 @AriFleischer @USPS It's not just funding, the logistics of nationwide mail in voting isn't something you can just pull together in a few months without expecting many problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneNewsJunkie @sassybarbara12 @AriFleischer And people's Christmas gifts never go missing or arrive late right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer Fraud is one of the potential issues but yeah it's one of many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @kaitlancollins @jaketapper The chances of mistakes, votes going missing and outright fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @kaitlancollins @jaketapper There's evidence of problems with mail in voting, now multiply that accross the country. For a party so concerned about election interference I don't understand this push to vote in a way the country never has before, with only 3 months to organise it, and knowing it increases...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter it's amazing to me that a party could be obsessed with election integrity and then insist on something that has never been done before that would need to be organised in just 3 months and which leaves open many more avenues for fraud and interference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter ballots get sent to people who have died or no longer live in that area. Just look at the issues NJ and NY have had recently, and multiply that accross the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter it's not just the extra numbers. When you do mail in voting it's a different process than voting absentee. Thousands of ballots will be sent out to people on the electoral role and as we've seen in places its been done on a smaller scale, ballots go missing,...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @JoeBiden you can't even give it a rest for 1min can you? you think this makes you look like a good person?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCJosh23 i think it's just a negotiating tactic to get the fee a little lower. If all parties want it to happen it'll happen, a few million isn't going to stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCJosh23 yup the cost / benefit of waiting a year to get him for nothing but then maybe having to pay more in terms of signing on fee / wages don't make sense to lose 1 year of a career where he's entering him prime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter the country and we wouldn't know who had won for months afterwards. It's almost desgined to cause as much confusion as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter you then have to take in hundreds of millions of ballots and make sure none get lost etc.. it's already been shown on a much smaller scale recently in NJ and NY that its open to fraud and open to mistakes that can throw into doubt the correct result. Now multiply that accross...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter yup because nobody has ever had a christmas present go missing in the mail or failed to be delivered on time. It's more complicated than that, you're talking about hundreds of millions of ballots and making sure they end up with the correct people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter Fauccci went on the record yesterday saying if its ok to goto the store its ok to vote in person. Why are the Democrats making this big push for nationwide mail in voting when they know the infrastructure isn't in place to handle it and they know its much more open to fraud...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter Trump has been very clear he supports voting in person or voting absentee ballot, how is that not upholding democracy?? Do you understand the logistical implications of trying to implement nationwide mail in voting in just 3 months??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGentile1982 @DonaldJTrumpJr Mr Rogers would be proud of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter nationwide mail in voting that is. Trump hasn't hid the fact he's not a fan of it and there are many legitimate reasons to be concerned about a presedential election decided through nationwide mail in voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kenneth88191233 @KurtSchlichter ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter and Trump hasn't hid the fact he doesn't trust nationwide voting for the Presedential election. And there are lots of very legitimate reasons to be concerned about the accuracy of such a vote, as well as all the logisitcal implications that would have to be sorted out in 3 months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter the republicans have no obligation to accept whatever deal the democrats put to them. Especially if it includes $1 trillion to bail out failed states. The USPS funding is a tiny part of a much bigger bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OakwoodTruckstp @JohnJRamboEsq @jazzndodgers @KurtSchlichter What he's said is without the funding the democrats can forget about their goal for nationwide mail in voting. The USPS funding is a small part of a much bigger package including $1 trillion to bail out badly run democratic states....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch @mohamedbouhafsi He's an elite playmaker his passing is on another level. Think we'll see Fabinho at the back for some games with Thiago in the 6.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jmcorrigan0 @thebradfordfile Funny you talk about the discourse and then make up comments from Trump. Do you think that helps the discourse??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeFreddoso @redsteeze Not really, someone has to express the absurdity of trying to implement nationwide mail in voting in just a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSlotkin It's called covid-19 and it's on their website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln You gonna give credit to the person that created this or nah??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeeper528 @emilyelarsen Read this...   https://t.co/edrXTKNSY0  It's not new it happened under Obama and it's been happening for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeeper528 @emilyelarsen The very term "systematic dismantling" is a DNC talking point. And you've swallowed it hook line and sinker. The USPS has been in decline for a very long time (so much so Miss Swift uses UPS to deliver her merchandise)....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyelarsen Would be interesting if she could expand on her concerns. Methinks she has no idea what she thinks she's complaining about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alltejuupptaget @AGHamilton29 Yeah you've swallowed the latest talking point hook line and sinker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeLunaVintage @AGHamilton29 I see so many people on the left have the attitude that it is only the Republican Party that might try and cheat. The reality is both parties are ruthless, we've seen the inner workings of the DNC with the leaked emails, they'll do whatever they can to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeLunaVintage @AGHamilton29 Do you think it's impossible for democrats to cheat?? Are democrats morally superior?? Just do a little bit of research on voter fraud, it isn't just happening from one party. This is a big part of the problem....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgardner @AGHamilton29 Are just not realistic. As Faucci said yesterday if people can goto the store they can vote in person. If you can't vote in person vote absentee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgardner @AGHamilton29 One side is trying to force in nationwide mail in voting with 3 months notice. Anyone that's studied that type of voting knows it presents plenty of problems even when it's done on a much smaller scale. The logistics of being able to do efficiently and fairly in a few months...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterMets @AGHamilton29 What policy changes?? This sort of stuff has been going on for years..   https://t.co/edrXTKNSY0  In terms of the funding it's tied to many other Democrat demands the Republicans have no obligation to just accept whatever the democrats want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanillaMag1lla @AGHamilton29 Yeah because the DNC is whiter than white and no Democrat has ever done anything remotely criminal. :/ this is the attitude that is a big part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdysl72 @AGHamilton29 Wrong, both sides are trying to claim the other side is trying to cheat. Neither side has any evidence of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurpleUmpkin @AGHamilton29 This attitude is the problem. The belief that your team is whiter than white while the other team are morally bankrupt. The truth is both teams will do whatever it takes to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kenneth88191233 @KurtSchlichter  https://t.co/edrXTKNSY0  They've been doing this for years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaseyJohnson_85 @KurtSchlichter What is happening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outofideas4anam @peterjhasson Yeah this is what happens when you propose something logistically complicated like nationwide mail in voting and have 3 months to get it organised.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dani2_times @RealJamesWoods The laugh is to try and deflect the fact she has no good answer to the question.

<|startoftext|>@stablegenius74 @John_M_Lally @OdomBilly @KamVTV @ABC Read about the issues that have happened very recently in NJ and NY. You can't organise such a major undertaking in just a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stablegenius74 @John_M_Lally @OdomBilly @KamVTV @ABC Now imagine the logistics of tracking hundreds of millions of ballots and delivering them and receiving them.

<|startoftext|>@stablegenius74 @John_M_Lally @OdomBilly @KamVTV @ABC No it is not. Nationwide mail in voting means EVERYONE on the electoral role is mailed a ballot. If you vote absentee you have to request a ballot to be sent to you....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stablegenius74 @John_M_Lally @OdomBilly @KamVTV @ABC You think voting absentee ballot and nationwide mail in voting are the same thing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CG29223756 @tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT My point is the Crossfire Hurricane team knew Carter Paige was working for the CIA before the 1st FISA application and ignored that information and hid it from the FISA court<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyledcheney How about this little tit bit??  All of the FISA's on Paige were obtained illegally.  https://t.co/20Th2UaiGK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS Sure "viva la resistance" right. But he's not on a team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS So a recommendation of 7 years for Cleinsmith??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CG29223756 @tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT Wrong. It's not that the FBI lawyer didn't think it was relevant. The FBI lawyer changed the email to change its meaning completely. So instead of it saying Paige was a CIA source he CHANGED IT to say he was not a CIA source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS I get it it's hard to admit your team did something wrong. Spoiler alert both teams are full of criminals that do criminal things all the time. I have no time for either team to be honest. But if you think there isn't corruption on the left you're deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS And he got sentenced for what he was charged with. I'm not sure why you have to play these childish games, what Stone was charged with and what Cleinsmith plead guilty to are in no way comparable crimes so why do you have to bring up Stone??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS So you don't think what the lawyer plead guilty to is worse than anything  Roger Stone was charged with? They're not on the same level of criminality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CG29223756 @tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT Still can't answer the question unbelievable. So in your world it's ok for an FBI lawyer to fabricate evidence given to a court and used to spy on a US citizen. Is this what we can expect from a Biden administration? I hope not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS I think that's a big deal yeah. I know you've got to down play it because nobody Trump related can be the victim in your mind but it is a big deal yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS You don't think it's important that they had to lie on the FISA application to spy on Carter Paige and both Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates admitted under oath had they known then what they know now they never would have signed off on those FISA applications....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS I think what this lawyer did was far worse than anything Stone was charged with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CG29223756 @tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT :/ ok so to be clear you don't think it's a big deal to falsify a document that is used as part of a court filing to spy on a US citizen? Is that your position?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS So just to be clear you don't think what he did is a big deal??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @LannyWarwick @PubliusPost64 @sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT Wrong. That's not why he went to prison but of course you know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corey7999 @LannyWarwick @PubliusPost64 @sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT Do you think what this FBI lawyer is pleading guilty to is a serious offence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CG29223756 @tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT Oh we've heard of him. That you hadn't is pretty telling. Do you think what he's pleading guilty to is a serious offence??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amoshiashwili @CasualtyWar @sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT What the hell are you talking about?? I notice you didn't answer the question. But let's be honest it's far more serious than anything Roger Stone did and they wanted to give him 7 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amoshiashwili @CasualtyWar @sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT Whatever you want to call it do you think it's serious what he's pleading guilty to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasualtyWar @amoshiashwili @sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT No mention of altering documents used in a court filing. Whatever you want to call it he defrauded a FISA court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhizzyNYR @smoothdave1996 @houseboatbob65 @adamgoldmanNYT @PaulaReidCBS A document that was used in a court filing to spy on a US citizen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt_Nowak5 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT Telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tendermoments2 @ktbenner @adamgoldmanNYT Altering a document that is used as evidence in a court is not a process crime. From what I understand it carries a possible 5 years in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_mpls @DemsNeverThink @adamgoldmanNYT Who cares about Biden??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_mpls @smoothdave1996 @adamgoldmanNYT Just look at what you're trying to make excuses for. You're so entrenched you don't care, you'll excuse your team of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_mpls @adamgoldmanNYT Altering a document that is used in a court is not a process crime. He could go to prison for 5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WearADangMask @kyledcheney :/ such a mark they had to try and set him up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jpanzer @kyledcheney Horowitz did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AZachParkinson @Surabees he's about to be the star of the next Trump ad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch once they're out of the CL it'll become clearer. Im not sure if we are interested but Klopp is pretty respectful and I don't think they'd make any firm moves while he's still playing in that competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott can you imagine if this is what you watch every day. It's no wonder so many people that oppose Trump are showing genuine signs of mental illness. It's one thing to be opposed idelogically but this is a different level and it's not healthy for the people that constantly watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom you guys are now basically Alex Jones. I've lost count of the conspiracy theories being pushed by the never trumpers, remember when you used to make fun of those people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jason_koebler  https://t.co/pga3GwYeNT  here's the explanation they couldn't find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe So referring to a virus by the province it originated from (not a race by the way) is the same as systematic racism against Asian Americans??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachClarke88 @aaronjmate Director Wray has been withholding documents and under his watch Congress was briefed and lied to about the credibility of Steeles sources. I wouldn't trust anything he says at this point because he has shown himself to be duplicitous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lewgo2 @EliLake @matthewamiller Id say describing yourself as the presidents "wing man" is pretty political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller @EliLake There is a genuine concern this all disappears if Trump isn't re-elected. Would you be ok with Durhams work not being finished if Biden becomes president?? Do you think it's important to figure out the origins of the Russia investigation and if there was wrong doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetireInReutte @jf29patriot @JerryDunleavy but if you think having nationwide mail in voting is something you could organise without any issues in 3 months you're deluding yourself. There is nothing extreme about worrying about the validity of such a nationwide mail in vote. There are legitimate concerns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetireInReutte @jf29patriot @JerryDunleavy no it has something to do with the police who protect us from criminals.   and we've never had nationwide mail in voting so you can't take away something we've never had. Nobody is talking about stopping people voting absentee or in person...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jf29patriot @JerryDunleavy Could ask Kamala about defunding the police, i hear she's all for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordGATTSU @Timcast There are very legitimate concerns of nationwide mail in voting, 3 and a half months out from election day. It's a massive undertaking that you can't just rush. If it's ok for 1000s to protest it's ok to vote in person, and those that can't can vote absentee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9a8bf44ebb0c42b @cnnadam @evanperez So investigating how the whole Russia investigation started is political. But a political party paying for dirt and using the intelligence agencies to spy on American citizens is fine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordGATTSU @Timcast No he said the USPS needs funding for the democrats to justify mail in voting. It's far too late to try and implement something like that nationwide no matter how much money you throw at it. But without the funding it's a non starter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lrozen If you honestly think he has that sort of pull in the middle East seems like a good reason to reelect him. All I see though is a bunch of anti Trump journalists trying hard to explain why this is no big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec yeah lets have that conversation with the american people. not holding out much hope any journalist asking her about it again mind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @SandyHarvey2 Biden hardly ever takes questions so if they waited for that they'd barely cover him at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinkerino @k19706604 @FeatherRuffled @RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro with someone that refuses to give any benefit of the doubt to someone they disagree with. I'm not going to waste my time and wish you a good day. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinkerino @k19706604 @FeatherRuffled @RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro No you were referring to anyone that was on the side of trying to preserve confederate statues. If your goal is to have fruitful conversations this approach doesn't help. I'm just going to leave it here because it really is pointless trying to have a conversation in good faith...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinkerino @k19706604 @FeatherRuffled @RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro but for decades it wasn't a debate. Are all those people that said nothing for decades white supremacists and racists? Just a bit of advice, try and give people you oppose ideologically the benefit of the doubt before judging them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinkerino @k19706604 @FeatherRuffled @RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro just because you say so doesn't make it so. It's easy to defend yourself though when you paint anyone that disagrees with you as being a white supremacist or nazi. These statues have been around for a long time, I understand it is now a debate people are having....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@009soulmaster @greg_price11 @bassettvision @Yamiche All he's saying is he's under estimating the % of minorities that live in the suburbs so the media can't play gotcha. The bigger point he's making is when he's talking about looking after the suburbs that also involves the large number of minorities that live there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@009soulmaster @greg_price11 @bassettvision The context is he was saying the suburbs is also made up of minorities. He said 30% and then said it's actually closer to 35% but I cut it so the media can't play gotcha... just watch the very next sentence @Yamiche cut it's clear what he's saying...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccadelago There are clear differences in ideologies and the country will make a decision on these ideologies. But Californian politics don't always play well with most of America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccadelago Maybe because the Democratic party has moved to the left she's not seen as radical in her party or in California. But the country isn't California and the policies she supports are seen as far left positions in a lot of the country...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DennaMDavis @mallen2010 @JRubinBlogger @SenKamalaHarris An oral assassin who had to end her campaign early because Tulsi Gabbard ended her in about 90sec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Hardly anyone would listen to her. She's boring. There's a reason her own party rejected her before they seriously started counting votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jolberding01 @mikehar @JRubinBlogger @Yamiche It's pretty obvious why he was stating that the suburbs are made up of between 30-35% minorities because he was making the point minorities are also affected when neighbourhoods become crime ridden. It's not a white problem it's a problem for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jolberding01 @mikehar @JRubinBlogger @Yamiche It would help if @Yamiche put the full clip in her post so people could see the full context. Instead she cut it to lie to her followers and try and and spin the statement to suit her own political agenda....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Model0Bacterium @lateblum @Ernst67370822 @greg_price11 :/ that's some mental gymnastics you're playing to justify your belief. He's condemning when he says "they should be condemned completely". It's not the only time he condemns those groups either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NovelistNick @notasheep1776 @Cernovich There's no evidence what happened to George Floyd was because of his race but that hasn't stopped the media. Becayse the current default is if a black person is the victim racism is automatically assumed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Model0Bacterium @lateblum @Ernst67370822 @greg_price11 "They should be condemned completely". What do you think that means??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Model0Bacterium @lateblum @Ernst67370822 @greg_price11 What part of "they should be condemned completely" isn't a condemnation?? Jeeze it's like 1984 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Model0Bacterium @Ernst67370822 @greg_price11 @lateblum  https://t.co/JuLk1Pl8uC  Here around 2min he very clearly condemns neo Nazis and white nationalists. This is the same speech Biden is talking about by the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OanNion @Cernovich @DarrenJBeattie Reverse the races and you know this is a national story covered by CNN and MSNBC. It's a hard truth to accept because of what that means but it is the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jason_howerton They're talking to an incredibly small audience. But at some point they'll have to try and defend the policies they are proposing. Trump needs to use his platform to let the people know the sorts of policies they support because they will never be pushed on this by left media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairewillett Yeah I always have solid working relationships with people I've basically called racist and a rapist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @LifeandLiberty4 @conservmillen @benshapiro 1984 much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @FeatherRuffled @conservmillen @benshapiro 1984 much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoxingYup @RBMEllis @MusicManGA2 @conservmillen @benshapiro It's the same press conference literally the next paragraph he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @LifeandLiberty4 @conservmillen @benshapiro No the people there to protest tearing down confederate statues. He cannot be clearer he's NOT talking about white supremacists or neo Nazis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FeatherRuffled @RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro  https://t.co/JuLk1Pl8uC  Listen carefully.   "..and I'm not taking about neo Nazis and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @MusicManGA2 @conservmillen @benshapiro  https://t.co/JuLk1Pl8uC  "..and I'm not talking about white supremacists or neo Nazis because they should be condemned..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBMEllis @conservmillen @benshapiro Start around 1:50 and listen carefully. You have believed a lie, or you knowingly peddle a lie because you don't like Trump.    https://t.co/JuLk1Pl8uC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielinPDXOR @SydneyLWatson @JoeBiden Keep listening it's only been debunked years ago but the fact you still believe this bullshit is pretty telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@am_wex @FormerNewspaper @JoeBiden See there are legitimate things to criticise him on, but when you blatantly lie like this you lose all credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSarelson @heckyessica @JoeBiden @TwitterSupport The fact you still believe this is pretty telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Umm @Twitter @jack isn't this the sort of stuff you're supposed to fact check for us??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodyCarmichaelX @jonronson Yeah, she was polling so bad she had to drop out very early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2Stroong @esaagar Wouldn't that be amazing, a president that couldn't even get double digits in their own party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dimarpat @mkraju Why didn't she mention bird flu?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck Just wait until you see the types of questions they ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck What did you expect?? CNN is the public relations arm of the DNC. We're going to be told she's amazing meanwhile she got 7% of the vote in her home state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnkurDaveMD @TVietor08 @jonlovett @KamalaHarris So much so she got a whopping 7% of the vote in her home state!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonronson There's a reason she got 7% of the vote in her home state. Can't think of many politicians that come accross as more opportunistic as Harris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Hey Kyle I'm sure you'll be right on it with the fact check on this one. Like comparing apples with an elephant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No questions?? #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck The media will have worked for 4 years out of the last 12. It'll be time for another nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_rauch No pattern of misconduct in the 29 non Trump related FISA applications. 17 significant errors in the Carter Paige FISA applications 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost abortion after 20 weeks executive order to ban "assault weapons" socialised health care green new deal  small c conservative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BocaDuke @jon_rauch Yup, that's an obvious conclusion to come to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson So once Trump became Presdient, Harris stopped being all the things you used to describe her??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @TheRickWilson Yeah we all saw Tulsi wreck her presidential campaign in about 90 sec. I'm sure Pence will be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGovic @ChuckRossDC 17 errors is "way less" than the norm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljashmore @jon_rauch He doesn't even realise this actually supports the idea that the errors in the Carter Paige FISA applications weren't the norm like the democrats tried to claim. Why so many errors with Carter Paige and not with the other applications they looked at 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_rauch So there were 17 errors with the Carter Paige FISA's as reported by Horoiwitz but only 2 in the other FISA cases they looked at. Hmm I wonder why there were so many errors with Carter Paige 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MogsSam @ronjansaft @middleageriot  https://t.co/h8Dqhh0o8p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaeveReston @KamalaHarris @alivitali Journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MogsSam @ronjansaft @middleageriot The point is those suggesting she's this master debater must have missed Tulsi wrecking her. She wasn't strong in the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelSlansky @k_ovfefe2 @nytimes A moderate who also said she would use executive order to ban "assault weapons"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronjansaft @middleageriot Well Kamalas campaign never got started after it. 7% in her home state is pretty bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_ovfefe2 This one??  https://t.co/PeGxQtQdAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost She didn't use the word racist but she heavily implied he was. But we all know you have to run cover for the DNC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@demersjason @mpiatt3 @ScottAdamsSays Trump is polling around 97% with Republicans. Harris got 7% I think in her home state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 She also said she would use executive orders to ban guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA @SeanTho98192182 Is that a still from The Purge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRHLofficial Make it something good, please!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 She'll get heat from the left for the cop stuff. Focus on the stuff she supports...  Green new deal Socialised medicine She said she'd use executive orders to ban guns.    Etc, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@middleageriot Tulsi Gabbard ended Kamala's presidential campaign in about 90sec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaTutles @CassandraRules There's plenty for the right to go after her on.   She's in support of the green new deal, socialised medicine, said she'd use executive orders to ban guns etc. Etc. Tulsi Gabbard destroyed her whole campaign in about 90 sec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules She'll be attacked from the left for that. Plenty of stuff for the right to attack her on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PetiteNicoco Why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen Don't forget Kamala said she'd use executive orders to ban "assault weapons".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OcCoder42 @DougonTech @ProjectLincoln Remember when Tulsi Gabbard destroyed her campaign in about 2 min??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ja5onRoberts They all want their shiny new player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_ovfefe2 @realDonaldTrump She also said she believed Biden's accuser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpiatt3 @ScottAdamsSays Remind how well she polled during the primaries?? Harris has that knack of the more you listen to her the more unlikable she becomes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfMJCleveland Yup plus she's completely the opposite of what progressives would want. Given Joe's issues her unlikeableness is a factor given the real possibility she could become president. There's a reason she polled so badly in the primaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corp_Raider99 @ComfortablySmug And the cop called the guy that's been there for 50 years a racist just a few months ago and said she believed the woman who accused him of raping her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drawandstrike They don't care it's all about likes and retweets the truth is irrelevant. Of course they'll continue to lose any credibility along the way but at this point they obviously don't care about being accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rabiasquared @benshapiro it scary that you're an attorney and you fell for this 4chan troll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megladdd @ViNguyen @cbschicago I also think some people were claiming this was an unarmed individual which wasn't accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megladdd @ViNguyen @cbschicago the misinformation was that it wasn't noted that the individual shot first at the police who returned fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>who are these judges not prosecuting looters?? #ChicagoRiots #ChicagoPolice #Chicago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyesGround @johncardillo so you're ok with Trump sending in Federal officers to put a stop to what's happening? because we were being told last week that would be the act of a dictator. Governers are in charge of their states and this is happening under the watch of democratic governers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @BernardKerik more importantly, watch the reaction (or lack of) from the people you elected to protect you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abigbutandsmile @avalon304 @eXalt_truth @tico_tonito @JStein_WaPo  https://t.co/VFTPnpa3Ed  nothing here about people getting $0 if states don't contribte the 25%. It says clearly the Federal government will contribute $300<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigbutandsmile @avalon304 @eXalt_truth @tico_tonito @JStein_WaPo Im not sure if that is accurate but even if it is, a state that can't find the 25% its people need to ask where their state taxes are going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shipwreckedcrew Wray needs to be brought in to explain this ASAP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigbutandsmile @avalon304 @eXalt_truth @tico_tonito @JStein_WaPo the states have been asked to contribute 25% if they can't do that that's on them.<|endoftext|>

Good luck going to court to stop Trump giving people an extra $400 during a pandemic. I'm sure that'll play well with most people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avalon304 @eXalt_truth @abigbutandsmile @tico_tonito @JStein_WaPo its really not that difficult. It will be $0 this week, instead thanks to Trump it will be $400. $400 is more than $0. It's really not difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emilylgoodin Good job Emily your Pulitzer is in the post I'm sure for this scoop!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle If Trump is involved in anything he should pay I don't excuse paedophiles whatever the political party. Which makee it all the more disgusting that CNN and MSNBC seemingly do cover up for rapist paedophiles if they are prominent democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @CurtisHouck They settled there was interference I'm asking you what was the scale of the interference? The scale is important is it not??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColbyItkowitz @pbump I know lots of you guys took an 8 year holiday recently but you might want to read this...  https://t.co/Zq7gjHWWO1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle Lol. Really?? The Epstein story has been all over the news for months. When Maxwell was taken into custody of was all over the news. But the Bill Clinton is named and crickets from certain sections of the media and you're making excuses for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @CurtisHouck I'm asking you to tell me. What was the scale and scope of the 2016 interference? You do agree there are degrees of interference right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffmason1 @realDonaldTrump Time to quit being a journalist methinks. But on the bright side, you always have a possible career as a prince William look a like!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_N_Liberal @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden Did you just try and mansplain who this individual should vote for and why? Check your privilege!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @CurtisHouck Sure wanna talk about how the report also stated China and Iran favoured Biden?? Again you didn't answer my question, what was the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Just saying they interfered means nothing without knowing the scope and scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle I'm just comparing how certain CNN reports haven't shut up about the country club speech and haven't uttered one word about Bill Clinton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle No the original tweet was highlighting the hypocrisy of a media that is hyperventilating about Trumps press conference at a country club while ignoring the violence going on in Portland every night..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @CurtisHouck explain the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election. What did it entail?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle what has that got to do with CNN and MSNBC completely ignoring the news about Bill Clinton? Why do you think they have barely covered it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle nope it was about a witness claiming under oath that she saw Bill Clinton on Epstein's island with "young girls". I understand though if you watch CNN or MSNBC you wouldn't have seen this reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMcDaidWine @politicalelle And??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_Sommerfeldt @PhilMurphyNJ I bet you used to remind the teacher they forgot to give you homework didn't you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore Who would you have gone for Stan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalelle More outrage over a country club speech than Bill Clinton visiting Epstein Island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Harry Wilson and Grujic = Thiago 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore your work will be noticed and other teams will be watching you. I expect to see more black managers in the next 20 or so years, and their individual success or failure will determine how well they do and what teams they manage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore Success is subjective and will vary depending on circumstances but there are numerous examples of coaches at small teams making an impact to the point they get noticed and hired by a bigger team with more resources etc.. so even at very difficult jobs if you are talented enough..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore so black players that were successful high profile players will get chances to manage teams that other more qualified coaches of all races won't get. If you are a successful manager that will count a lot in terms of getting jobs, experience counts and past success plays a role...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore so what are the reasons someone gets a chance at a high level managerial job? I'd say there are 2 factors..  1. Past success / experience 2. Standing in the game  would someone like John Barnes have got the chance to manage Celtic if he wasn't a world class player? no chance...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore I think you're off on this one Stan, the truth is the number of coaches full stop is a tiny elite, which means there are plenty of coaches of all races that are qualified and talented that will never get a chance at the top level....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo the LARPING continues..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Have you reported on Bill Clinton being named as visiting Epstein Island yet? Or is your reporting limited to these woe is me type posts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWHuber How many times did he tweet about Bill Clinton being named as being on Epstein Island?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnMm08 @RealSLokhova For example? Do you know who the primary sub source was? Spoiler he wasn't based in Russia and has distanced himself from everything he told Steele.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people replying to @RealSLokhova are demented. Laughing about paedophilia if it helps the dems.  https://t.co/Jzvxzfn5jj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton They're so dumb they don't realise they're making Trumps adverts for him. When most Americans see a masked mob harrasing and bullying an old woman they're not going to be sympathetic to the mob. And this is what democrats fail to condemn. The ads write themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec they're making Trumps adverts from him. If they think this looks good to most Americans they are deluding themselves. Gangs of masked youths surrounding old women while the democrats claim there's nothing to see here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tprstly I have an unhealthy obsession with these reaction videos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz This happens a lot the rare moments they are challenged because they just aren't used to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvisharDutta @BernieSanders Don't confuse him he thinks he's onto something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke @senjudiciary They should have bunch of you guys and gals notifications on during the questioning if they want to ask anything important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I think she probably does think Sargons ideas are dangerous. And if you asked Sargon he'd probably think her ideologies are harmful too. But I can't see Sargon trying to take her down because of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I'm pretty sure Sargon could make an argument that the ideology Akilah promotes can become dangerous but I don't think he'd ever go out of his way to try and take her down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I guess that depends but because it's completely subjective you can justify anything being harmful if you try hard enough. From what I've seen in this case Sargon has acted with a lot more humanity towards someone im sure he disagrees with a lot than she has towards him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddockMirror @TheRedmenTV When the players wants the move it's very difficult to keep them. Reckon we'll settle on £12-£13 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pauljoyce Don't worry Edwards will get him for £8 million by next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I'm sure Sargon doesn't like a lot of her content but I don't think he'd try and take away her livelihood using a frivolous copyright claim to try and do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority But the court case was a copyright claim and she tried to use that to bankrupt someone she disagreed with ideologically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority If someone is being paid to physically harm random people  that's illegal and should be dealt with by the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynTewson @AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I agree. Not sure what we're discussing anymore. I'm happy to move on, have a good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority Of course in the example you gave I wouldn't be concerned about the livelihood of someone being paid to randomly beat people up. If you're trying to suggest that's what Carl does I disagree with you so the example is pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynTewson @AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I disagree he's a horrible person and that's a very subjective statement so it doesn't really get us anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @KathrynTewson @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority They disagree ideologically and so she tried to take away his livelihood. The claim that Carl is this horrible person is so subjective and depends on where you stand ideologically some people really like him some don't. I'm sure the same is true of Akilah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynTewson @AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority And just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbooneus @SaraCarterDC The democrats went after Barr and gave him zero benefit of the doubt. Some republicans were making excuses and tip toeing around the obvious with Yates. Don't be kind to these traitors if the shoe was on the other foot we know how it'd go down ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbooneus @SaraCarterDC I wouldn't suggest stopping the witnesses from answering but trying hard not to upset them would be a start. Lindsey Graham did so much covering for Sally Yates yesterday it was sickening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynTewson @AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority id argue that the person that shows no remorse about trying to take away someones livlihood, and that of his children is also not a very good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority sorry I misunderstood your reply. I guess we have no problem then. Have a good day. ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority can you explain why Carl should have lost the case? The judge's explanation seemed cut and dried. And it's you're not your. @LindseyPaigeB is very anal about grammar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvaroIM77 @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I was just repeating the persons argument back at them, it doesn't mean anything. In this court case Carl was clearly in the right as the judge explained, it was a clear cut case. Do you disagree with the judge's decision?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leejenkins19 @indykaila probably agree on £15 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila once again breaking the big stories, good job Indy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@st_venters @slmalamud @thedailybeast every single point you made isn't accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC can you imagine if this had happened with the political parties reversed. Look at how Barr was treated compared with how Sally Yates was treated. The Republicans just don't get it; playing nice doesn't work when the other side will do anything for power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slmalamud @st_venters @thedailybeast that's pretty impressive to be wrong on every point you tried to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slmalamud @st_venters @thedailybeast :/ Trump didn't kill 150,000 people. The economy was shut down for months of course its going to tank (do you disagree with that decision?). The paying to kill American soldiers story has not been confirmed as accurate, and peaceful protesters are not being violently attacked..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisanfield While this rule did benefit us over a lot of teams, the main benefit were to teams like City who have an incredibly strong squad and also Man Utd that will strengthen. Outside our best 15/16 players we dont have huge depth compared to City.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@st_venters @thedailybeast its also a left v right thing. And if you lean right the idea of voting for Biden and empowering a bunch of communist sympathisers is more terrifying than anything Trump could do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard_Spoor "In a moment of madness" they had more cocktails ready to throw, this was premeditated not a moment of madness. As lawyers they knew the severity of what they were doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCraigLTMR @redsteeze yeah because there's no other possible way people can make funny videos about Trump. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordofAnime @LindseyPaigeB @questauthority thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyPaigeB @questauthority what a strange thing to say to someone. Is this how you interact with people in your day to day life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGutmann perfect Klopp / Edwards signing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougstafford has he read the green new deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyPaigeB @questauthority i don't care how I come across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkilahObviously you are clearly living is some alternate reality if you think this makes Carl look anything but fair. He tried to tell you, you would lose, but you ignored him. He tried to help you avoid this situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyPaigeB @questauthority I've met Carl and he was really nice. I've never met Akilah but she comes accross as an entitled race baitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you'd think she would have learnt that using social media during a court case isn't a smart thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz Yup I think at one point she tried to say they didn't have the transcript before they interviewed him. If that was the case how could they prompt him with his own words??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GypsyisanAngel @pedsscrub @paulsperry_ @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy I think Hawley was effective but you've only got to compare this hearing with the Barr one to see what's happening. The democrats are ruthless and play to win the Republicans are complicit in the cover up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pubfare @paulsperry_ :/ why did I know you'd say that. He was right about the FISA stuff wasn't he. It should be easy to prove the original 302 wasn't lost if he said it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pubfare @paulsperry_  https://t.co/nxOYI2tUEn  do you have any news to the contrary? it would be easy to prove if this wasn't true. Im pretty sure Judge Sullivan commented on it too, ill try and dig up that quote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz @Shem_Infinite I think they've done ok so far in terms of getting a few little titbits from Yates. But yeah having people with a solid understanding of what happened means they could have destroyed a few of her lies easily enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pubfare @paulsperry_ they have admitted the original 302 is missing. Judge Sullivan didn't seem to think it was important :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz @drawandstrike cc: @LindseyGrahamSC @HawleyMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pubfare @paulsperry_ damn shame the original 302 went missing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jacket_Spangler @paulsperry_ im pretty sure he was never asked about the sanction vote in the interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacket_Spangler @paulsperry_ what were the very specific lies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacket_Spangler @paulsperry_ Comey and Hilary said " I don't recall" about 100 times under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacket_Spangler @paulsperry_ saying you don't rember is not lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC its like they're talking with a delay :/ very annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacket_Spangler @paulsperry_ ok how about the agents having the transcript of the call before they interviwed him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite someone needs to remind her of 2 things...  1. They had the call transcript before they interviewed him 2. The agents wrote that they didn't think he was lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ someone needs to remind her the agents that interviewed him didn't think he was lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite hopefully someone else revisits that, who isn't Graham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @SenFeinstein @GenFlynn They don't care, lying is all they have at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary what questions would you ask her Julie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @DLtothe @ddale8 its not that he had sources, its WHO the sources were.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 it's not impossible. We have the best people to innovate with tactics, and improve the players we do have and that's how we compete with a team like City that might spend £300 million this summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 exactly its not a fair game but it never has been and lots of clubs will look at us has having a big advantage over them which we do. The problem is the expectation with lots of fans is to win the league and that's very difficult when its not a fair game, but as we proved...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 earmarked for the front 3 in the future. I expect we'll sell one of Salah or Mane in the next 24 months and replace them with someone younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 sure we have issues with the team but we just have to accept that we won't spend our way out of that problem. Minamino is one player that is back up for the front 3 but sure outside of that we're struggling if we get a serious injury. Long term no I don't think those 3 are being<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @DLtothe @ddale8 what parts of the dossier have been verified as true? who were Steeles sources (we just found that out). Do you know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 the media has done. I do think the media is more political than its ever been on the right and the left and I don't think its a good thing. Trump has highlighted that from the left and he's right to do it. Now it also happens on the right, and on both sides its not a good thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @DLtothe @ddale8 yes, yes it was. Do you know who Steele's primary source was?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 he's not a stupid man, he knows most of those journliasts don't like him and support leftist ideologies so of course it's going to be combative. Sure maybe he's unfairly used the term fake news on occassions but on other occassions its been an accurate description of what...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 Well lets just look at how the media reported the Steele dossier which we are now finding out was complete bunk. If you're Trump and you know its bunk but you see the media reporting it in a certain way then that's going to make you suspicious and untrustworthy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 give him a fair shake? I've heard him say it many times, he doesn't expect them to be easy on him he just wants them to be fair and consistent and I think lots of the media are not fair or consistent in how they apply their outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 I think it's a 2 way thing, and it's not as if the media treated him "fairly" and then slowly changed as Trump changed. They haven't treated him fairly from the beginning so if you're Trump is it any wonder you're suspicious of a press that he feels is out to get him and doesn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 but they were favourites this season and didn't come close to us. All you can do is the best you can with what you have and if it's not enough so be it. But its not as simple as not winning the PL is a failure because all things aren't equal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlupescu0509 @GraemeKelly1 it's irrelevant because we can't do it City's way. All you can do is use the resources you have to the best of your ability there are pros to continuity and there are cons to constantly changing players. Yes if City spend hundreds of millions they will be favourites for the PL...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 :/ what a strange thing to say. The media has a job, and it's not their job to be patisan and bias which is what it has become on the left and the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 I guess that's subjective and probably depends on whether you like him or not. But i think Trump handles the media pretty well considering everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 you don't think he should be challenged by the media before the debates??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 has a bias against Trump. If you think they've treated other Presidents the same I would have to disagree and if Biden wins watch how they change from challenging to compliant. I don't think its controversial to suggest there is a left bias in most of the mainstream media is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 I think it's both, they clearly don't like him and sure it's their job to ask challenging questions but sometimes I think they intentionally take the worst possible interpretation of something. I guess that's subjective but i don't think its outlandish to suggest the media...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLtothe @yourmom009 @ddale8 I think he holds his own better than most give him credit for. It would nice to have a comparison to see how Biden would deal with a similarly hostile press for an hour at a time but we know that'll never happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerChed @btsportfootball yeah i understand ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerChed @btsportfootball I just guess we'll have to agree to disagree I know Klopp didn't treat it as a nothing cup. There aren't many chances a team will get to win it so in that respect its not an easy one to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 don't you think he should be asked some hard questions before? so we as voters can judge him? isn't that the point of a presedential campaign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 In the meantime Klopp will continue to work with the players he has and he will continue to develop and improve them as individuals. That's how we get better as a team. Knowing you have players that will give everything for the shirt is enough. You can't control what others do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 Im at the stage where I really don't care how much they spend. If anything it takes the pressure off our players if they spend another £200-300 million they absolutely should win the league and it kind of shows the type of manager Pep is that he'd need to do that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so what would you like asked of Sally Yates today?? #SallyYates #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 but Trump has shown he will take questions from a media that obviously hates him and he's able to hold his own. Biden has not shown he can do that and seems to be avoiding any sort of challenging media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 where did i say that? but he's sharper than Joe. He takes questions from the press for an hour at a time regularly. When has Joe done that in the last year? Both men are old and they are both probably suffering from some mental decline...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 Biden is the one that has avoided any sort of challenging interview from the media. He speaks for about 15min and takes questions sometimes from pre-selected journalists for about 10min. The debates will be 90 min and Trump won't ask him softball questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 :/ this whole discussion was based on the idea that Trump will be afraid to debate Biden. I'm just making the point that if you think that you are deluding yourself. If Trump was afraid of debate he wouldn't give hour long press conferences where he takes questions from everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerChed @btsportfootball how many English teams have won it? a very good Liverpool team couldn't in the 80's. Either way its not a nothing trophy far from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 do you think this is what an individual that has all their mental facilties looks like??   https://t.co/E5rK5pfrme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 I mean he faces a press that asks him challenging questions. Biden has not. Trump won't go easy on him in the debates and if you think Biden is looking good right now in the puff interviews he has I don't know what to say....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerChed @btsportfootball yeah cos you qualify for the audi cup by winning the Champions League right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 so they're both idiots. But lets not pretend Biden is some super sharp individual. The idea that Trump is scared of debating Biden is stupid, he faces a hostile press almost every day. Biden hasn't had a challenging interview for months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerChed @btsportfootball World Club champions and Super Cup champions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourmom009 @ddale8 Yeah I bet he's scared to death of this...   https://t.co/E5rK5pfrme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott I think he took cocaine before this interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LfcRight @AnfieldWatch That is true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Would be nice to see Biden chgallenged in a similar way so we could have a comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randall_plant @DavidAFrench There was the one with Mika over the rape allegations and that wasn't good for Biden even though we all know she's a friendly journalist but at least she asked some difficult questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randall_plant @DavidAFrench For that to be true it'd be nice to have a comparison interview where Biden is challenged in the same way. But so far I've not really seen him have many interviews where the interviewer was challenging him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happychappy76 @Liddellpool We'll see, there are always exceptions to the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@722l2 @ComfortablySmug I wonder what Maggies theory is?? If it's not one of those two options?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcstaton1 @BillKristol Joe was terrible in the debates, to say otherwise you're just deluding yourself. And Trump won't go easy on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElevenRedMen @Jay82_LFC you can also improve a winning team by making the individuals in that team better. Klopp has shown he's one of the best at developing and improving players. Gomez, Trent, Keita, Fabino, Ox are all still young and can improve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sir_Funk @Jay82_LFC can better at. I'm sure we'll add to the squad when the right player is available at the right time, but there is a lot to say for continuity and it's not against the rules to improve the players you already have at the club, and Klopp is one of the best at doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sir_Funk @Jay82_LFC Klopp has already shown he can develop the players he works with every day. We have some experience in the team but also a lot of young players like Gomez, Trent, Fabinho, Keita even Ox that have massive room for improvement. Even looking at the front 3 and there are areas they..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sir_Funk @Jay82_LFC there are ways to improve the squad that don't involve having to spend a tonne of money. For example, you can add players from the youth system (Jones, WIliams, Elliot?) you can also improve the players that you already have...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump whats the point when the questions he get asked are basically "tell us why you are so great and Trump is so bad". The questions he gets are always softballs anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happychappy76 @Liddellpool But you look at players like Trent, Gomez, Fabinho, Keita, and they are still very young with lots of areas they can improve. Even looking at the front 3 you can see areas where they can get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happychappy76 @Liddellpool I think Klopp will look to improve the team through improving the players and when you look at the individuals they all have room to improve. We'll add to the squad when the right player is available or when we free up a spot in the squad that a young player can't fill...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happychappy76 @Liddellpool Because signing those young players is often more expensive. Also the squad is not in a building phase. We've got a very strong group of 14/15 players and someone like Thiago gives us something we don't currently have. It's not easy to make improvements through signing players..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeannin55385803 @Abulinixish @Timcast You do understand how this makes cheating easier right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeannin55385803 @Abulinixish @Timcast If there's no post mark on them how does anyone know where they came from and when?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abulinixish @Timcast How is it cheating to count ballots that never went through the mail system?? You're seriously asking that question??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSarahD @pateast @MattWalshBlog Or he was high on a lot of drugs they found in his system and that was causing him to act in the way he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randy_o1970 @KnightsRick @Af23yr @paulsperry_ Now we find that in the other 29 cases they reviewed there were only 2 errors. So why so many "errors" with the Carter Paige FISA? This new finding only helps support the idea there was political bias in the Carter Paige FISA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randy_o1970 @KnightsRick @Af23yr @paulsperry_ Lol, you don't even realise that hurts your argument. Horowitz found 19 serious errors with the Carter Paige FISA, the democrats tried to argue there was a problem with the whole FISA process and those errors weren't unique to the Carter Paige warrant...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_appeliii @SethAbramson Yup all he said was none of the agents told him they were biased when asked and there was no documents found that admitted bias. That's a big difference to saying there was no bias. But he said very clearly he could not rule bias out as an explanation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Cos you Republicans are not doing your job. Start issuing subpoenas, get these people in to testify under oath!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pateast @MattWalshBlog I'm clearly talking about what is shown in the body cam footage :/ I already said nothing excuses that act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pateast @MattWalshBlog It also shows the officers clearly trying to help him, they weren't aggressive or antagonistic in how they dealt with a clearly distressed and paranoid individual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pateast @MattWalshBlog I don't think it changes the wrongness of the act by the police officers  but it does provide a bit more context. E.g. this was a man clearly acting in a strange way (probably due to the drugs found in his system) he was claiming he couldn't breath before he was on the floor...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg have a good day ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg anyway nice deflection from your original point I replied to which was not accurate. The Republicans did not start the investigation into dirt on Trump, they did not initially pay for what ended up as the Steele dossier. That is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg yeah that completely unbiased list of 1000 former prosecuters lol have you read the names? its a who's who of people with TDS!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg These words??  https://t.co/one3aycFDM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg Let's start here...  https://t.co/f4sI2UUFbq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg Yeah my mistake I thought you linked the Mueller report. Instead you linked a bias summary of the report. I apologise for my mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg And excuse me for not taking the interpretation of a clearly biased source. Why don't you use Mueller's own words?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg Tell me in your own words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg People that say they're going to explain something to you and then just link a huge report are basically saying I don't understand it and can't explain myself in a clear way. Tell me in your own words how the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg Lol I thought you were going to explain it to me. Have at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow How about you let people see the evidence for themselves and judge it on its merits. We know you're scared of the truth coming out about how the Russia investigation started coming out, but it's time the other side had their say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg Sure. Have it at it. Embarrass me with all this Russian interference. Id be particularly interested in the Russian interference linked to the Trump campaign. GO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg You seem confused. The Washington Free Beacon hiring  Fusion GPS has NOTHING to do with the DNC hiring Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele. They are not connected. It's really not that difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg :/ ok you're not serious. Christopher Steele had so much trouble finding dirt on Trump he had to make it all up. And yes there is a difference between looking for political dirt and using fake intelligence to spy on American citizens and spy on a presidential campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 nice like business that agent has going with Arsenal at the moment :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg sure but they weren't looking for dirt on democrats and Christopher Steele wasn't involved. They went to Fusion to get information on a number of Republican Presendential candidates. Not the same thing in the slightest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so in the last few days the usual suspects carrying water for the DNC have suggested...  1. If Trump loses he'll refuse to leave the WH 2. If Trump wins its because it's fixed and Biden shouldn't accept the result. 3. Biden shouldn't debate Trump  they sound worried.   #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer umm have you watched Biden in the last 6 months?? we all know the reason this narrative is being spread, Biden's handlers are scared to death to have him debate for 90min where they can't control the questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HGiamarco @MattWolking @Liz_Wheeler what's been looked into? The origins of the Russia investigation? I don't think so, that's what Durham is looking into though. What Horowitz found was enough cause for concern mind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HGiamarco @MattWolking @Liz_Wheeler you mean the same US intelligence that tried to set Trump up? Yeah im sure they trusted him, but I'm not sure how anyone can trust them given what we're learning about how they operated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HGiamarco @MattWolking @Liz_Wheeler trusted by who? and it was a big mistake to trust him I guess since almost nothing he produced was accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCmdrRealMark @MattWolking @Liz_Wheeler nope. The Washington Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS to get information on multiple Republican candidates. Nothing to do with Steele. Ive heard that DNC talking point before though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvisibleTL @MattWolking @realDSteinberg the Republicans did not hire Christopher Steele. The Washington Free Beacon used Fusion GPS to get information on multiple Republican candidates nothing to do with the Steele dossier. Nice DNC talking point though :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovethydog9 @EdanClay @realDonaldTrump just out of interest do you feel Governor Cuomo bears any responsibility for what happened in his state? Do the governers have any responsibility?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @mikebarnicle but if Trump wins its because he is cheating and Biden might not accept the result. Either way they win, and yet they are trying to push the narrative that it is Trump that won't accept the result. Its a scary proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @mikebarnicle Good independent reporting there. This whole narrative being pushed is so transparent though. The democrats are basically saying if they win Trump might not accept the result and he'll have to be forcibly removed from the WH, but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @WhipClyburn Any pushback from the CNN host?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo @livesmattershow Small man syndrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch Thiago would be my priorty. He's priced reasonably and would really add something to the midfield we don't have. If we have some left over i would take Coutinho on loan for a season. He knows the system and he knows the players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chase_Hend @kengibs81 @Polaroid451 @DC_Draino just curious what will happen if they "take" the federal building. How will they use it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Polaroid451 @DC_Draino if antifa entered their own property that had been boarded up by someone else im pretty sure not many people would have a problem with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_N_Meems @theDavedt @Suntimes @LisaMarieBoothe No, Chicago has its own unique problems that aren't present in most states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheResistanceSP @BradmanTV @SamanthaJPower You do realise banning tiktok doesn't stop that person making videos mocking Trump right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamanthaJPower Because Sarah Copper couldn't possibly make videos making fun of Trump without tiktok right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grizzlybizzly @beyondreasdoubt @SamanthaJPower  https://t.co/REgt0ganbu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamanthaJPower  https://t.co/rW6Yk4q0zI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathyJCard @SteveKrak @Cernovich @NewDay So your response to CNN and MSNBC all but ignoring this is to paint the channel that DID cover it as fake news? I guess ignoring major news stories makes you a real news outlet in clown world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkepBy @quirkyhandle @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump Is that why other countries have banned it to? The NSA, even Joe Biden's staff were told to remove it from their phones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump Trumps super power really is to make people pro ANYTHING he is against. Now people are simping for an app that gives their children's information to communist China!! You can't make this shit up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobinRodin1 @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump There'll be another app that does the same thing but doesn't share your child's information with the Chinese government. I'm sure your child can cope until that new app appears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore You're assuming they can offer him something to stay. Other clubs can offer him more money (China maybe) and other teams in Europe can offer him a better chance to win the top trophies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @thebobby77 Sometimes adults have to make decisions for kids that don't know the implications of what they're doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @thebobby77 If there is a national security risk they should get involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @thebobby77 There'll be another app that does something similar that isn't sending your data direct to the CCP don't worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @redsteeze Just to give you one example I heard someone more knowledgeable in tech theorise the Chinese govt could take control of people's phones and use that to in effect shut down the internet in the U.S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @redsteeze But the point is someone using it in the US might compromise another person not using the app. It's not only the people using it that might suffer. It has real national security implications for everyone not just those that are using it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @redsteeze You're missing the point. Read this...   https://t.co/LUGdhe5gy7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Death2Tyrants84 @redsteeze Not when there are possible national security risks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randy_o1970 @KnightsRick @Af23yr @paulsperry_ Is it a crime to lie to a FISA court? Alter an email that is used as evidence to a FISA court? Illegally spy on a US citizen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ikerock @greg_price11 Why shouldn't both be given wall to wall coverage? If Trump is involved in any of this stuff he should go down too but so far he's not been implicated. But Bill Clinton was and the media silence is deafening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine in a time of mass instant media, a former president of the USA being named as being present on an island dubbed "paedophile island" and vast swathes of the mainstream media not even reporting it!! #BillClinton #BillClintonIsAPedo #BillClintonIsARapist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeardlessDen @GraemeKelly1 Its not paranoia there are serious security questions with the app and the Chinese government. It has already been banned in India and I think Australia is seriously looking into banning it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DukeToma @DrewHolden360 @KatMcKinley Fair enough, the hotel guy referenced is someone else though. If you search here you'll find the name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPerturbed @CNN @ChrisCuomo They also weren't in lock step with political parties. We deserve better for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogueScholarPr @HonorAndDaring  https://t.co/O2pjsOPIs3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DukeToma @llggs5 @DrewHolden360 @KatMcKinley The hotelier is someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DukeToma @DrewHolden360 @KatMcKinley The Hotel guy isn't Trump (he's not the only person that owns hotels) I know you want him to be involved but why not focus on the people named and not what you hope to be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller Where were all those flights going??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @jimsciutto Anything interesting happen today Jake?? Involving Bill Clinton maybe?? Something newsworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dffallis @thebradfordfile @LindaSuhler It's not a good look. For the record nobody has ever claimed Trump went to the island there was 1 flight but it wasn't to the island. But instead of wishing for Trump to be involved why not focus on what we are finding out??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dffallis @thebradfordfile @LindaSuhler Why do you guys always do this?? People mention Clinton who was named in the recent documents and you immediately pivot to "but Trump!". Why are you carrying water for Bill Clinton he is not a good person. You can still hate Trump and think this, but when you deflect like this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbieW_ @DanielHeselden @Lvnglo_Lv @AnfieldWatch I disagree. I do think we'll sell him though and people will keep complaining when Salah is out and Ox plays there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbieW_ @DanielHeselden @Lvnglo_Lv @AnfieldWatch So?? Bournemouth don't play the way we do. Is he a better option than Ox to come in for maybe 5 games a season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabyrinthWeaver @mkraju The Steele dossier says hey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr1492 @ChuckRossDC @BluegrassPundit @carterwpage Absolutely, it destroys that talking point that this was incompetence rather than targeted corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mjames21Pete @EmeraldRobinson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you were the one diverting. Nowhere in these documents is Trump accused of anything yet you immediately bring it back to Trump. Why not focus on the people it does implicate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPerturbed @CNN @ChrisCuomo he's hoping his viewers won't realise. He flat out lied to them and he doesn't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeolithicBarber @Stugots1970 @CNN @ChrisCuomo it was absolitely deliberate, why would you use the annual number for the US and then compare that with the quarterly number from Germany?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeadersMaster @CNN @ChrisCuomo not that you'll care bu Cuomo lied to you. He used the annual number for the US and compared that with the quarterly number from Germany. If you compare like with like the US drop was 9.5% and the Germany drop was 10.2%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgordon52 it did. why are you lying to panic people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLagarry @alexander122982 @JackPosobiec @AustinWoodNYC @Comey i still find it amazing that a blind hatred for Trump means you have to make excuses for people like Bill Clinton. You can hate Trump and still accept Bill Clinton is not a good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mjames21Pete @EmeraldRobinson @realDonaldTrump like clockwork. Your hatred of Trump still allows you to condemn paedophiles and rapists even if they have a D next to their name. Why are you carrying water for Bill Clinton? he's not a good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MilesGrant @BrianHartPR @brianstelter it didn't drop 34.3 that was the annual number if the same thing happened over 4 quarters. It was actually a lower drop than Germany and France.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kushtiannn @RHarnetiaux @HansMahncke agree but if the judges are playing politics what can you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kushtiannn @RHarnetiaux @HansMahncke not the last thing but sure there will be more important things to worry about. Not more important to General Flynn and his family though. But it won't come to that, Trump will pardon him if he has to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dznyc @KlasfeldReports  https://t.co/Tb6geoULnE  a Bill Clinton sighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinahseattle @JackPosobiec @Comey The hotel owner is someone else. I'm baffled by this reaction to the released documents, immediately deflect to "What about Trump?" It's obscene. Why are you trying to protect these people? You can still hate Trump and admit these people aren't good people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lvnglo_Lv @DanielHeselden @AnfieldWatch Ox has played wide right at times and he struggles to make an impact there. I think Wilson would be a better option for that role and Ox can focus on being a midfield player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lvnglo_Lv @DanielHeselden @AnfieldWatch the problem is if he stays he won't play very often, but Klopp has shown he can improve players just through training every day with the group. We do need backups for the front 3 and it's difficult to convince someone to sign and be a backup but someone like Wilson might do it..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielHeselden @Lvnglo_Lv @AnfieldWatch he's not, but we do need players to come in for the odd game and at the moment its difficult to attract someone world class to come and be 4th choice. Would Wilson do a better job on the right than Ox when he's played in the forward positions??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarquisHorace @Newsweek why are you carrying water for a paedophile rapist? I get it you hate Trump but this immediate deflection is horrifying. Look at what you are trying to cover up. I'd hope everyone would agree that anybody that is proven to be implacated pays the price no matter who it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanTo2020 @KlasfeldReports @CourthouseNews why did you fail to mention this?    https://t.co/Uiyl5Qr9c5  I know you guys hate Trump but you can still hate Trump and admit that Bill Clinton is not a good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanTo2020 @KlasfeldReports @CourthouseNews you forgot Bill Clinton :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CEGibbs1 @adamhousley Like clockwork :/ why are you carrying water for a paedophile rapist?? You can still hate Trump and admit Bill Clinton is not a good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexander122982 @JackPosobiec @AustinWoodNYC @Comey I've seen so many people that hate Trump deflect the stuff about Bill Clinton by immediately going to Trump, why!!?? Why are you protecting a paedophile rapist? Bill Clinton is not a good person, you can admit like while still hating Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexander122982 @JackPosobiec @AustinWoodNYC @Comey Why is this your first instinct to go after Trump?? I get it you don't like him but so far he's not been implicated in any of the stuff on the island. If he's involved then I don't think anyone will carry water for him but that's what you are doing when you react like this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr1492 @ChuckRossDC @BluegrassPundit @carterwpage Well the democrats have tried to argue there were errors in lots of separate FISA applications and somehow that proves the Carter Paige warrants weren't political in nature, so I guess it destroys that narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRossDC @carterwpage There goes that democratic talking point. Although if your argument is "they didn't target Carter Paige they were incompetent with everyone" that's not a very good argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KM12021978 @JackPosobiec It's psychotic how the immediate reaction to Clinton being named is to attack Trump!! He's driven people over the edge so much they're carrying water for a paedophile rapist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobi_you @Corbin_D_C @Cernovich Jeeze man your hatred for Trump is so strong you're willing to carry water for a paedophile rapist. Bill Clinton is not a good person, you admit that and still hate Trump but the immediate deflection is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devengus @Cernovich I don't think he's criticising that poster. Techno Fog is excellent when it comes to all things legal. I think Cernovich is directing you to a good source on the subject that won't leave out certain names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMJLawless26 @Cernovich Why are you covering up for a paedophile rapist?? Is your hatred of Trump so strong you'd do that rather than admit Bill Clinton is not a good person??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kushtiannn @RHarnetiaux @HansMahncke Sure but if the courts are corrupt and political it's not easy to fight that. Do you risk a Biden presidency and hope for a fair trial? Nothing about this has been fair so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator i hope you're right and maybe once the storm has settled it'll get to that point. But I do think because of Trump the sides are more polarised in terms of working today than they've been in my lifetime at least, and i don't see that getting better immediately should Trump lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator agree they're both as bad as each other. Maybe the republicans are more incompetent which isn't a bad thing at the moment. But you can see how ruthless the democrats are even though they only hold the congress they're setting the agenda in a lot of ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator i hope you're right, I don't think you are though. Ive watched the current democratic party and ive never seen a group more hungry for power at any cost. And once they have it they won't give it up easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator it won't stop there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator be careful what you wish for though because these things have a habit of boomaranging as we saw not too long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator we both know what's happening, you just happen to agree with the end goal so you don't care. If Trump was trying to gerrymander the country in the same way you'd be against it (as would I)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHead1984 @justcheckingit7 @Heminator did the founders intend for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to become states? next it'll be allowing illegal aliens to vote and you know the goal is democratic power for decades, unchallenged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obama just laid it all out, if the democrats gain power of the 3 branches of government the USA will be turned into a one party state in all but name. Lots will go along with it because it will be their team wielding all the power but this cannot end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justcheckingit7 @Heminator its not just more power to the government its power to one political party that will change the country to the degree it will become a one party state in all but name. That won't end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heminator they won't care in the short term because their team will be the one holding all the power. But in all but name the USA will become a one party country and that won't end well for anybody.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Timcast also, im still not sure why mass protests are very important so those gatherings are ok, but voting for a president isn't an important enough reason for a mass gathering of people? you can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast If voter fraud was planned for November (which it probably was) making a huge deal of it as soon as possible is a smart way to make it a big enough issue that more and more people will be looking out for it which makes it harder to do....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump he's perfectly happy with in person and absentee voting. Explain while mass gatherings to protest are ok but we can't vote in person in November? If masks make us almost 100% safe it should be fine to vote in person in November no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historyKehoe @robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer given how certain people are freaking out right now about not having national mail in voting I think it's perfectly rational to wonder why?? if masks make us safe and large gatherings are ok for important stuff i don't see any problem come November time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historyKehoe @robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer its very difficult to argue someone is trying to steal an election when they say they have no problem with people voting in person or voting absentee ballot. What's uncharted territoy here is a national mail in vote and it's perfectly rational to be concerned about that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historyKehoe @robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer you can't have it both ways. You can't ignore issues of large gatherings when it comes to protests because the argument is protests are important, and then say a presedential election isn't important enough for large gatherings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historyKehoe @robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer he's clearly trolling and he has no authority to delay an election. But everyone should be concerned about election integrity as much as possible. If mass gatherings are ok when it comes to protesting then it should be ok to vote in person in November right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer People trying to pretend this is no big deal have no idea what they're talking about because it's never happened on a national level before. There is a difference between voting absentee and have a national election which is 100% mail in. That's uncharted territory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robduran @baseballmom524 @AriFleischer You obviously aren't paying close enough attention. There was an incident just a few weeks ago that involved 3 democrats. Also just have a look at what's going on in N.Y. right now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If protesting is seen as a valid reason for mass gatherings because of its importance, why isn't voting in a presidential election given the same sort of dispensation in terms of mass gatherings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_macgeever @YaseenChotta @robinnsonn_16 @13maryam04 @peterrutzler @JamesPearceLFC I don't think we'll sign nobody but realistically how do you improve on our strongest team?? Maybe midfield but it's not easy. I accept there is a drop off when one of the front 3 is missing but it's not easy to convince a similar level of player to come and be 4th choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_macgeever @YaseenChotta @robinnsonn_16 @13maryam04 @peterrutzler @JamesPearceLFC There are other ways to improve. Keita looks to offer us something different given his form in the last 3 months, Curtis Jones and Neco will step up into 1st team squad regulars and hopefully Minamino will be more settled...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDamaniFelder can't believe she parroted the "fine people on both sides" lie. You should have directed her to the next paragraph where Trump said very clearly "and I'm not talking about the neo nazis and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickungar @bhweingarten I don't remember any witnesses not being able to give an answer to questions during the impeachment hearings. If you have any examples I'd like to see them but I watched those hearings and witnesses were allowed to answer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rickungar @bhweingarten Any examples of this happening to a democratic witness to anything like this extent??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer they were too busy asking him to explain why he's so awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>jeeze Biden is a terrible public speaker, droning on for minutes and saying nothing. He's got zero enthusiasm. #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth absolute joke, they might as well just say "Mr Biden, tell us why you're so awesome and why Trump sucks please.!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktbenner failing when you've kicked up a stink to have him there in the first place. Why would he go back?? he'd be well within his rights to point to todays circus and say "what's the point of me being there if you won't let me reply?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HCTrudo @emilyelarsen should read "Biden taking vetted questions from hand-picked "journalists" " once again he's reading off the names of journalists to ask questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa it was the same the last time he took questions. Clearly the questions have been vetted beforehand. Also just look at the tone of the questions, its rediculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do the democrats think that was a good look?? they've been asking to talk to Barr for weeks and when they get him they refuse to let him answer anything!! he would be well within his rights to refuse to show up again based on that circus. #BarrHearing #BarrTestimony #barr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nadlers mask just slipped (more than the one he's wearing) he knew he screwed up and had to quickly change course. #BillBarr #BarrHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid If they let him answer anything we might be able to come to some sort of conclusion. When you constantly stop someone from replying it's kinda difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HansMahncke Horowitz already debunked that talking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSLokhova it takes some nerve to say lets move on about something they were obsessed with for 3 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 We've got rid of 2 high wage earners and I expect we'll sell Wilson who didn't play 1 min for us last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 I think we'll get Thiago which will add an extra dimension to the team and you'll see maybe a back up left back and maybe CB. But if you have Jones and Williams becoming regulars that's 2 extra 1st team squad players plus maybe one or two others from the u21s stepping up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 I also think it's a case of to improve the first 11 you're talking about a huge amount of money unless you can get someone like Thiago whose contract is expiring...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch if we can also get Thiago, all of a sudden our midfield is transformed and we will offer teams many more different threats compared to this season. We need to keep evolving and the midfield I feel is the one area where that can happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch i still feel as if he's not 100% confident in terms of his position in the team but once that confidence grows we have a hell of a player, and someone that can really help us improve which we need to do....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch id read comments from the players that he had come back from the break looking really sharp and in the games he's just grew. Offers us something we don't get from anyone else in our midfield, drive with the ball, and good passing ability...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy if weaponising the intelligence agencies to try and take down an elected president isn't important, im not sure what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy they obsess over something for 3 years and then when their lie is being exposed pretend like its not important. And they have a complicit media that will happily bury any new developments that destroy the narrative they helped create...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott @ValerieJarrett @MariaBartiromo Typical gaslighting from the democrats. Obsess over an issue for 3 years and then when the narrative is falling apart act as if it's not important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume @TomCurle this isn't a coincidence. They didn't all of a sudden lose interest in Russia. When Trump called certain parts of the media the enemy of the people he couldn't more right. People need to wise up how the media is working against good people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume @TomCurle they are also vital to the supression of any new information that challenges the narrative they tried to spread for 3 years. They were hyper focussed on this story for years and now they don't care when new information surfaces that challenges what they were reporting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume @TomCurle the media was a big part of the whole plan. They needed a compliant media to spread the false narrative. Lets not pretend certain media reporters aren't in bed with the intelligence agencies. They were vital to the spread of this hoax....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadSeeLife @94RJones @NYGovCuomo so its ok to potentially spread covid and start a 2nd wave if its being done in the name of a cause? or does the virus not target people protesting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eathen_1892 @GraemeKelly1 I do think we can improve our options in midfield signing someone like Thiago and I wouldn't be surprised if that transfer happened plus one or two others to provide backup for certain positions. But there is also a lot to be said for continuity and growing the squad slowly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eathen_1892 @GraemeKelly1 other clubs need to catch up its probably not the wisest thing to do right now but other clubs are more desperate than we are and it might bite them down the line. The fact is we have a very strong first 11 that is very difficult to improve upon without spending big money...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Think he's written a really strongly worded letter to someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkaggsJc @Gma2Iowa @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram maybe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa @SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram but it gave the impression that a bunch of people were guilty even though the charges had zero to do with russian collusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa @SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram yeah i think you'd agree they should have gone to jail for lying to congress. I just think what they got people like Stone and Manafort for were nothing to do with the Russia investigation and in fact everyone that was convicted was for process crimes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa @SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram just out of interested you must agree that Hilary, Andy McCabe and others should also have gone to jail for lying to congress right? if we're being consistent here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa @SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram You're obviously a lot more authoritarian than I am when it comes to law and order. I'm for trying to keep as many non violent criminals out of prison as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gma2Iowa @SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram I never said it was ok I said there was a difference in terms of severity. Unless you think they should be treated the same??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SrikanthTalagad @lachlan @brianstelter Have you just woke up?? Google Waco or Ruby Ridge, this isn't new.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reb_80 @MusicManGA2 @Crustyone2 @MattWalshBlog There's a photo where it clearly shows him pointing it at the car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crustyone2 @MattWalshBlog You do understand there's a difference between pointing a gun at a group of protesters that have broken into your property and pointing a gun at the driver of a car that you have chosen to approach and surround.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAmendments @AirspaceGeek @CheriJacobus It's like you guys forgot Waco or Ruby Ridge, this isn't new, but of course now Trump is president people that were sleeping for 20+ years have suddenly woken up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAmendments @AirspaceGeek @CheriJacobus Then why not post a real photo?? Reading the comments in this thread make my head hurt, you guys have lost the plot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC Nice switch from "violence? What violence?" To the violence is the fault of the person that's been calling it out from the start and offering help (which has been ignored)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seuntheactivist If your goal truly is positive change this is the wrong way to achieve that. People will get sick and tired of this and that will not help you achieve what you say you're trying to achieve. You need to be smarter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsOrFables4U @Timcast Um you left out that the protester fired 5 shots at the car before he was shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthBelle4 @soit_goes you do realise he fird off 5 shots at the vehicle before he was shot right? a vehicle he approached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro you can see how scared the lady in the car is. They should try and imagine if that was one of their mothers or grandmothers in the same situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeneralDilley Step 5 do NOT fire off 5 shots into the vehicle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSenior1 I think it's just we need certain things from a #9 that he doesn't offer. Technical ability good touch and vision. For another team playing differently he'd do much better..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram That's not the same as the Fed's asking you for example if you talked with person A as part of a criminal investigation and you lie about the meeting. Both are lies but they're not the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram Ok if for example the Fed's ask you what you had to eat at a restaurant and you say steak and they have the bill which shows you had chicken that's a lie but it's not material to any case...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurhamIsComing @GeneralDilley Not only pointing it but firing off 5 shots it appears. That driver is incredibly lucky to still be alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veracityseeker3 @intheMatrixxx @Austin_Police Yup 5 shots first then 3. I don't know enough to tell the difference but those that do say the first 5 shots were from a long gun like and the final 3 from a pistol. The driver seems to have been very lucky not to have died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkaggsJc @ombudsman4truth @ChadPergram And they both went to prison. Also there is a difference in lying to Congress about something that is not material to a case compared to lying about something which is material, you understand that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elhaym135 @JamesPearceLFC Whole team wasn't switched on. Gini gave them the ball so they could take a quick fk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jsc_35 Looks like a scared women to me that sees her car being surrounded by a mob of angry people. Ask yourself how you might react in that situation or your mother maybe? We've seen drivers getting dragged out of vehicles and being beaten why would anyone risk that in this scenario??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayLouis @PeterArcher37 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT What!!? This guy was the "source" for Steeles dossier. Turns out he wasn't much of a source. Turns out he testified that Steeles dossier was full of crap. I think that's kind of important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Now you have to defend Biden's insanity instead!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterArcher37 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT We'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterArcher37 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT And yeah lying to a FISA court is a crime. Withholding evidence from a FISA court is a crime, and that's the tip of the iceberg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterArcher37 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT Altering an email that's used to get a FISA warrant isn't illegal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Batcat44 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT Yeah how dare they look into the origins of American citizens being illegally spied on and presidential campaigns being spied on!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterArcher37 @charlie_savage @adamgoldmanNYT Schiff selectively leaks like a sieve and that's fine but somehow trying to figure out how this whole thing started is wrong!! The guy is the primary source for Steeles crap it's kind of important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beyondreasdoubt @JoyAnnReid There was a 45min press conference where all of these democratic talking points were  challenged and debunked but no push back from Joy. This is not journalism it's propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beyondreasdoubt That whole show is just a joke. @JoyAnnReid offers zero pushback because this is the narrative they are trying to create. If this sort of stuff was being spouted by Alex Jones people would be going crazy but because it's a mainstream source it's treated seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisEP @JoeBiden Notice how most of these "protesters" seem more concerned about getting a cool video to share. Most of these people are larping, they have no idea what they're trying to achieve or how to do it effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these Democrat majors and governers playing footsie with Antifa remind me of the "cool" mum and dad that go out partying with their kids.

<|startoftext|>@TweetOfSteiner @JackPosobiec Yes of course that's included.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BullshitDetec11 @mouse512 @MrAndyNgo You must understand these larpers are doing nothing to fight fascism. Just because you call yourself antifa doesn't mean anything.

<|startoftext|>@OddNacho @C_brreezy @MrAndyNgo Portland isn't the country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hallingto812 @LoHoFran @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand when they brought the information to the FISA court they didn't mention it was oppo research. is that ok??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallingto812 @LoHoFran @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand is there something wrong  with the intelligence agencies using oppo research to spy on American citizens, and continue with that spying months after they knew the information wasn't true?? Is that ok?? oh and by the way they left out the bit where the denocrats paid for it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallingto812 @LoHoFran @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand without the dossier there would have been no FISA on Carter Page Horowitz was very clear about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallingto812 @LoHoFran @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand lol sure this all started because of Papa. if you believe that I guess you'll believe anything!! the fact is the dossier was key to getting the FISA warrants and they knew in January 2017 it was rubbish but they kept going, that should trouble you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyPSmith7 @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand it was interference from foreign agents, either that's bad or it isn't?? or is it good when the DNC does it? And in fact pays for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoHoFran @Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand that's not what I asked and if you think I'm surprised by that you're mistaken and it means nothing. The Steele dossier was payed for by the Hilary Clinton campaign. Why not answer the question instead of replying with DNC talking points?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand you know the dossier the DNC funded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phwji @BishesBrew @NatashaBertrand who was the primary sub source for the Steele dossier??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stujohnn @AnfieldWatch I think unless you have mega money to throw at these players its always a problem. Also you can argue our front 3 are much more set in stone than City's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisanfield i remember we were heavily linked with Kelly before he signed for Bournemouth. Could be a decent option given he also can play CB but again the problem might be convincing someone that knows they'll be backup to sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stujohnn @AnfieldWatch we might be better off keeping someone like Wilson who can fill in for Salah and hope he makes big improvements because its hard to justify spending close to 100 million for a backup even though that player will play lots of games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stujohnn @AnfieldWatch if you want to sign someone to be backup left back they know Robertson is going to play 90% of games. The same for right back. I do think midfield is the area we can strengthen in terms of getting a player like Thiago that offers us something we don't have...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stujohnn @AnfieldWatch the problem is its very difficult for us to improve on certain positions so unless you promote from within you're trying to convince very good players to sign to be 2nd choice. Anyone you target for the front 3 positions knows they are a backup and they might have other options..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Munday3M @njhm100 @soledadobrien more dispicable than trying to belittle someone that is at the top of their field and who lost both their in laws to covid in NY nursing homes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@njhm100 @soledadobrien The cognitive dissonance in this reply says it all. Both sides are living in bubbles, your version of the world is just as imaginary as the people you are criticising but you don't see it because you are convinced you are right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGutmann you could certainly sell Grujuc and Wilson  without it having any impact on the squad in terms of what we've used this season. Add in Shaqiri and Origi and could Thiago and Coutinho offer more than those two over a season?? (yes!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuanceBro @shoe0nhead this is how someone reacts when they are used to having zero pushback to the things they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JYSexton May I point you to the first line in the tweet you were quoting... "Deputy Secretary of DHS" there's the identification you seem to be not be able to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRBolen @CBS_Herridge @JohnCornyn @carterwpage then you add into that the dirt used might have been Russian disinfo and you add to that, that the intelligence agencies knew it was crap but used it anyway and you have one of the most important stories of the past 60 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRBolen @CBS_Herridge @JohnCornyn @carterwpage maybe, but politicising the intelligence agencies to spy on a presidential campaign as well as American citizens is a very big deal. not to mention a political party paying for dirt on its opponents which is then used as a pretext to spy on them! does it get much bigger than that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thevivafrei You don't need to be an expert in body language to make some assumptions about the truthfulness of what she was saying. Maddows response gives the game away, she knows she's coming accorss as shady so doesn't push for more details.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jason_howerton @kayleighmcenany Kind of interesting too that they all made the same "edit" to the quote to create a particular narrative, almost as if it's co-ordinated. Luckily one of the positives of this social media age is the press sec can highlight this in real time and set the record straight quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich maybe @JoyAnnReid can get her expert body language analyst to take a look at this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weijia this is why fewer and fewer people trust you. You know exactly what you're doing yet you'll act shocked when you get called out for your biases. Do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 And then they act all shocked when they are accused of having an agenda. Luckily in this age of social media the press sec can instantly call out these hacks and expose what they're trying to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GiovanniNati @esaagar yeah I'm guessing that giant swab prop they created for his little skit with his brother as 1000s were dying in nursing homes took a good deal longer to create than that photo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HODLFrance @esaagar it's hardly whataboutism when the person that is doing the criticising is guilty of doing the same (and arguably worse). or was it ok to joke around with a giant swab prop as 1000s were dying in nursing homes??  https://t.co/ZTMQMqcpLZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politidope @ChrisCuomo yet Cuomo and CNN had time to create a giant swab as part of a skit while thousands were dying in nursing homes...  https://t.co/YRL9WBICUD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kathy10938807 @tesa_silva @Wheatty @Politidope @ChrisCuomo did you cry when this happened or is this ok??  https://t.co/aEohRrynTP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeTaylor @natefc someone like Van Dijk i do think plays at his best when he plays angry. After the mistake he was noticeably more aggresive and he's a much better defender when he plays that way. Hopefully these results will be used as motivation for next season and as lessons to get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeTaylor @natefc its a very unusual set of circumstances playing to empty stadiums etc.. its a worry if next season does start behind closed doors because this team needs that energy from the crowd. The good news is there was a clear step up in intensity in the 2nd half and we dominated...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamMcGuire90 yeah there are players in the squad that will be motivated to make a point. Players like Jones that are trying to break through, someone like Minamino that needs games to adapt to this team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeTaylor @natefc it's hard to play with the sort of intensity we need to be playing at in an empty stadium, and its hard to play with that intensity once we've won the league. Hopefully these lessons will be used as motivation to keep improving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeTaylor @natefc the lockdown hasnt helped. The support would have given them that extra few % they've dropped off since the league was won. This is a team that needs to play with intensity to be at its best and given the circumstances its difficult to geenrate that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraemeKelly1 especially with this team that relies so much on intensity compared to a team like city that relies on technical ability. we drop off just a few % and those things that make us great aren't there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldWatch not surprising 2 horrible mistake due to severe complacency and lack of focus. I know they're only human and it must he hard to stay focused but if you want to be the best that's what you have to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @rdaex1 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes that's fair enough just don't expect me to take your word for something. I'll watch what you linked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james1chas3 @MattWalshBlog nobody has said he deserved it, the question is should he be celebrated and hero worshipped given his past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @mattgaetz that intelligence is not confirmed unless you know something you're not sharing here. (I know you don't know anything and are just pretending that story has been verified)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdaex1 @Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes im assuming these same policies are the reason approx 3% of the population are commiting 50% of violent crimes too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdaex1 @Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes give me some specific "anti black policies" and I'll look into it, but just saying it doesn't prove anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes what anti black legislature in particular is responsible for the rate of children born to single parents to go from 30% to over 70%?? if you list some specific legislation I can look into the correlation but just saying it without giving examples doesn't prove anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdaex1 @Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes listen to what?? there is no evidence to support the idea that the war on drugs or "anti black" policies is responsible for the single parent rate at birth to go from 30% to over 70%. Unless you can be more specific, just saying it doesn't make it so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hehe11021 @Middle_Man_11 @snopes but we're talking specifically about violent crime not petty crime. are you saying there's thousands of instances of violent crimes by white people that aren't being reported?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes so because of the war on drugs the rate of births out of wedlock went from 30% to over 70% is that what you're saying?? are you saying there is a huge number of fatherless homes primarily because of the war on drugs? becayse those numbers don't add up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes yes there are a very small number of deaths at the hands of police that are not justified. But it's not an epidemic, it doesn't happen very often and of course steps must be done to try and make sure it never happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes ive lived in America for 3 years im not currently living there. But there is a difference to supporting the police and supporting police officers that have killed people unjustly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes im pretty sure the number of peple that support letting off cops that kill people without good reason is miniscule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes i dont think you'd find a single person that supports that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuahjeaton @MonsterMarcia @ashsoles @Reuters yes there is a strong correlation between a single parent family and other factors like likelihood of dropping out of school, likelihood of going to prison etc..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes there aren't many examples of ANYONE no matter the skin tone that is being compliant and getting killed by police. It doesnt happen very often (of course it should never happen) but when it does the officers pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuahjeaton @MonsterMarcia @ashsoles @Reuters i agree that seems like a huge factor when you compare both numbers looking for some sort of correlation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes oh and by the way why would you assume im white? (im not)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes what a strange thing to say. It depends on the reasons of course and the number of unjustified police killings is very small. Often it happens when the officers life is in danger and while of course any death is tragic they're not all equal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonsterMarcia @ashsoles @Reuters ok now ask yourself why. and it's actually more like 3% of the population because we're talking almost exclusively about young black men. the same approx 3% also commit around 50% of recorded violent crimes, that statistic alone should alert everyone to the scale of the problem..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoseoksQueen @MichaelsMoss @snopes Trump said more white people are killed by the police and he's correct, he wasn't talking about per capita which is how the statement is being "fact checked". that's a separate issue that I'm happy to discuss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dkey1983 @ScottAdamsSays @turningabout @maggieNYT the reality is you have around 3% of the population (African American men aged 18-35) committing around 50% of the violent crime and that is a massive issue that needs to be addressed. I'm not sure you can blame over policing for higher violent crime stats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dkey1983 @ScottAdamsSays @turningabout @maggieNYT what about violent crime though?? I agree in terms of petty crime a higher police presence is more likely to find cases of petty crime compared to areas with lower levels of policing, but....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGaunjaMan @vanwhy_sanda @LogicHobbit @redsteeze @maggieNYT that's besides the point Trump made a very simple statement more white people are killed by police then black people and he is correct. now the point you raised is a separate issue that definitely needs discussing, but Trump was correct in what he said....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hehe11021 @Middle_Man_11 @snopes so you have around 3% of the population committing around 50% of the nation's violent crime. I'd say that should be any countries #1 priority to figure out why it is happening and how we can address it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hehe11021 @Middle_Man_11 @snopes African Americans commit 50% of the violent crime. and the reality is when you say African Americans what you really mean is African American men, aged around 18-35...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hehe11021 @Middle_Man_11 @snopes when you're talking about violent crime it's very difficult to use that argument. petty crime sure, the extra police presence is a factor but violent crime isn't petty crime...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelsMoss @snopes the president was correct, snopes is fact checking a different point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mamelaaa_Mbu57 @Edhaskell3 @alcal74 @snopes the % of black babies born out of wedlock went from around 30% in the 1970s to over 70% today. The numbers don't add up if you're saying it's because of the war on drugs, there's clearly something else going on culturally, that's made it more acceptable...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shipwreckedcrew where can you listen to it??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC the irony of you labeling someone a white supremicist with no evidence and then in the very next breath complain about being distorted and how dangerous that is. Top quality gaslighting well done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @CharissaRooks1 @thehill @govkristinoem FYI this was added to the original story that started thread off...  https://t.co/GKNkpKstqZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FatsSpringfield @jonathanmpierce @yashar @jason_howerton ok but you're not going to argue that MSNBC and CNN don't lean left are you? or at the least lets say they lean very heavily against the republican party. the same point applies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FatsSpringfield @jonathanmpierce @yashar @jason_howerton ok what are the mainstream left wing media outlets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MosheWander @jason_howerton CNN and MSNBC claimed the Coverington kids were rascist white supremacists for standing and smiling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamMantine @yashar @jason_howerton explain the difference in terms of bias?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanmpierce @yashar @jason_howerton particularly in terms of bias, what is the substantial difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanmpierce @yashar @jason_howerton really? what is the substantial difference between OAN and MSNBC and CNN at this point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConceptualJames you've probably seen this but if you haven't i think you'll find it interesting and the perfect example of where we're headed. The craziness of this conversation boggles the mind....   https://t.co/cNXGWi9Mfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomselliott how many of the same people were making this point 4 years ago? If your outrage only began once Trump was elected you're not to be listened to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @CharissaRooks1 @thehill @govkristinoem so you're saying its more than confederate leaders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewattHCP @EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel @CBS_Herridge and you've added so much to this conversation. thanks for enlightening me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewattHCP @EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel @CBS_Herridge If you don't think CNN, MSNBC, Fox don't report on certain stories because its damaging to their narrative I don't know what else to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewattHCP @EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel @CBS_Herridge @CBS_Herridge is part of the mainstream, difference is she's a proper journalist. Amazing that you just hurl insults instead of deal with any of the details.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaBritton @marcelluswiley amazing that this isn't at the forefront of the discussion when you see the positive benefits being part of a 2 parent family brings. it's almost as if they don't want to make things better. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewattHCP @EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel im guessing you watch CNN and MSNBC yeah they wont report on this cos it doesnt suit their narrative. Follow @CBS_Herridge you'll get the picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @CharissaRooks1 @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @thehill @govkristinoem yup with this false comment.    https://t.co/Scqp00cErd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @CharissaRooks1 @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @thehill @govkristinoem You think this is an orginal thought? everyone knows about this. The discussion we were having was the claim that only the statues of confederate leaders were being pulled down which is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_fpeterson @chadfelixg @JoyAnnReid @govkristinoem not all the statues being taken down are confederate leaders. it moved on from that pretty quickly. Maybe CNN isn't covering it but its not hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @CharissaRooks1 @thehill @govkristinoem i forgot the one of the elk too, i guess it was a confederate elk?   https://t.co/nEssLeJ9sG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junecarryl @susiefreathy @ManbearpigV2 @CharissaRooks1 @thehill @govkristinoem the arguement was the only statues coming down were confederate ones which is clearly not true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KRNY100 @marwilliamson luckily we have the amazing Democratic party spreading unity and love at all opportunities and channels like CNN and MSNBC promoting nothing but unity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moderateohioan @BridgetPhetasy but what is the better message?  1. Times are tough but America is a great country and we'll get through this better than ever.   2. This is a country founded on white supremacy and the great leaders of the past should be written out of the history books?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln it's gonna be fun seeing you guys having to support tearing down statues of the man you're named after. The craziness isn't stopping and you've picked a side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs you think the country supports erasing people like Washington and Lincoln from the history of the US like Al Sharpton was saying earlier on MSNBC??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck all countries have a mixed past but it's also important to celebrate the good and because of TDS the left media is forced to take the position of doing down the country and I don't think that's a winning message for the majority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisHouck if Trump can turn the debate into those that love and celebrate the greatness of the USA v those that want to do it down i don't see that as a winning strategy for the democrats....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donchartier @JarradKushner @BS2KZ @RichardGrenell you understand the difference between a meeting and an event right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AZachParkinson it's amazing how things that have been around for decades have all of a sudden become racist and signs of white supremacy in the past few years. if you weren't complaining about these things at least 4 years ago you have no credibility.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan ok, we'll see i guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan just to be clear how many of those cases in New York are linked to Epstein because we were talking about Epstein and seem to have switched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan What about the people that visisted the island where most of the sick stuff happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan I realise you hate Trump and want to get him but whether you like it or not he was not on the flight logs of people that visited the island. those are the people that should be investigated first don't you agree??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan we know who flew on Epsteins plane and visited the island where most of this happened, let's start there. that is evidence not some blog post with nothing to back it up. those flight logs are evidence of who visited the island, I'd be looking into those individuals first...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan if you think that's evidence of anything I don't know what to say to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan you've basically just posted a conspiracy theory. none of that is proven. you notice the word "reportedly" and "claims" that just to make sure they don't get sued but it's not evidence of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan sure but you have to wait for it to happen before you talk about it as if it's a fact he's guilty. whatever the reasons the case was dropped it was dropped so it's just an accusation, if you're happy to convict someone on an allegation that was dropped i don't know what to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @aPotentPloy @rosemcgowan yeah that case was dropped in 2016. it's not evidence of anything other than an allegation that was dropped. I'm all for punishing anyone involved but it has to be based on evidence and let the chips fall where they may.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @rosemcgowan I don't care who goes down, if they were involved they deserve everything coming their way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @rosemcgowan soon a Clinton gets mentioned the impulse from democrats is to mention Trump. Trump wasn't on any of the flight logs, Bill took many trips the island, their connection to Epstein is not comparable. But investigate them all and let the chips fall where they may.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @rosemcgowan put your political biases to one side. the fact is Bill Clinton is implicated far heavily in all things Epstein than Trump or Barr or even Dershowitz who was on the logs. Anyone that was involved needs to pay no matter what their political persuasion, but it's telling that as...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tokertim @775Bravo @GeorgePapa19 sure I get it and whoever is involved in this should rot, I don't care what political party they belong to.

<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel wrong again, the democrats might try and impeach Barr but like Trump it won't go anywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sisteers and that's not a bad thing. Finding motivation on the back of success is a challenge and that game might give them a little motivation to make sure it doesn't happen again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteers you learn a lot during a set back, as a coaching staff I don't think Klopp will be too disapointed that he has a game he can point to as where we can improve but at the same time the loss is insignificant. The players are proud and whatever the circumstances that will sting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenn96AFC @Orbinho yeah Chelsea, Arsenal, Villa, Newcastle, Brighton, Burnley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenn96AFC @Orbinho that too. easier to stay motivated when you have a goal still to play for. I hope this Liverpool team still aims for the record points achievement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orbinho having a break and playing to empty stadiums doesn't help with momentum though so it's not the same situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BassTunedToRed @Chem2006 a game that doesn't mean anything significant. but the players are proud and it'll sting which is a good thing. often you learn the best lessons in defeat and doing it in a game with little significance is perfect for the coaching staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BassTunedToRed @Chem2006 right. sloppy turnovers when we commited bodies forward, diving into challenges and not winning them and then being sloppy in attack with 4 or 5 really good situations. small margins but if I'm Klopp I'm not too disappointed with the team getting a bit of a wake up call in...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller can she get anything right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AIScoreOfficial when it doesn't matter he's really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chem2006 @BassTunedToRed I don't even think we were that bad. Mane had a poor game by his level we could have easily scored 2 in the 1st 25 min. If anything I thought we were over commited and that opened up lots of space for city which they used clinically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this will be used as motivation for the coaching staff and the players. they are all winners and won't like losing that way. It gives the players a reality check of what improvements can still be made in a meaningless game  #LFC #LFCchampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you can suffer disappointments and setbacks while doing it after you've won the league i can't think of a better scenario for a coach. the lessons are there but there are no severe consequences...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>disappointments and setbacks are great ways to learn lessons, in life and in sport. make no mistake despite this being a meaningless game in terms of the league it'll hurt the players to lose like that and that's a good thing #LFC #LFCFamily #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGutmann diving in and leaving space all over the pitch. Robinson for the 3rd goal. Haven't taken some good chances and City have been clinical. small margins in these games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abundance247 @SkySportsPL why? aren't teams allowed to lose games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_tomkins you just want consistency. sort of thing that happens to Virgil at almost every corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_leisner @robbinbythesea @eliehonig more recently e.g. she was a guest at Chelsea Clintons wedding not that long ago. I personally don't care who goes down. Republican or Democrat if they are involved in any of this they should rot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_leisner @robbinbythesea @eliehonig i was responding to a tweet that was suggesting that because there are photos of Trump with Maxwell from decades ago that somehow means he's implicated in her arrest. I was just pointing out the Clintons are connected to Maxwell and Epstein in a much greater way, and much...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_leisner @robbinbythesea @eliehonig so? doesn't mean they wont be implicated by Maxwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich not if you value life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_leisner @robbinbythesea @eliehonig funny how this happened a week after Berman was got rid of. You know what other case he was stonewalling? the Weiner laptop investigation. hmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_leisner @robbinbythesea @eliehonig so?? Epstein has much more of a connection to the Clinton family than Trumps. Bill visited the island several times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BKamanawanalea @liamstack or just watch this 4min clip which destroys the premise of this stupid article.    https://t.co/8KzQ4YAitG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbinbythesea @eliehonig now post the photo of her at Chelsea Clinton's wedding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quentintess6 @GaryDean911 @JackPosobiec when does it become human?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Max50Edwards @KimStrassel what does that have to do with Flynn being indicted after the case has been dropped? you're clearly letting your bias get in the way of the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Max50Edwards @KimStrassel yup, as shall you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Max50Edwards @KimStrassel that's not how the law works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel  https://t.co/RPirsZTgjY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel you're wrong and obviously not informed about this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewwgold @KimStrassel let's just wait and see what Durham finds shall we. not that CNN or MSNBC will cover it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @LLCWalk @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel yeah and thats why a court just killed the case and he'll be a free man soon. would have been nice for Biden to face at least one challenging question he hadn't been prepped for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @LLCWalk @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel you mean when he said he couldn't remember? that's not lying. and keep ignoring the fact that according to the agents own notes they were trying to catch him in a lie. It's pretty telling how you ignore all of the recent information that has come to light which is exculpatory...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel im talking about the recent case being brought in which Biden was named.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel but why no questions on these matters? let Biden explain it himself instead of having other people covering for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel you know that case went to court and it was thrown out for lack of evidence right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @LLCWalk @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel the agents talked about trying to catch Flynn in a lie so they could charge him or get him fired. They already had the transcript of the call so the only reason for questioning him was to try and get him to lie. That's called entrapment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @LLCWalk @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel look at the notes that were taken. Saying I don't remember is not the same as lying. Watch Comey and Hilary testify before congress they said "to the best of my recollection" dozens of times, its not the same as lying. I guess we're also just going to ignore the notes where...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel you can ask him about speculation so you can get his point of view. why wasn't the question even asked??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel they were fighting the charges way before Barr got involved. As soon as he changed his defence team and the scale and scope of the corruption and incompetence of his former legal team came to light. which of course you won't talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel innocent people plead guilty all the time for a multitude of reasons. you clearly don't understand this case or you wouldn't be making such stupid comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @spitzerC4C @KimStrassel you clearly don't understand this case or you are intentionally ignoring lots of exculpatory evidence that was withheld that has come to light in the past few months...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel oh and by the way the stance on masks has changed there hasn't been a consistent message from the experts. and in terms of opening up and shutting down the economy, Faucci was very clear Trump acted as soon as the experts recommended shut down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel there are lots of tough questions you could ask Biden. Off the top of my head...  1. Flynn - Logan Act, unmasking  2. Ukraine - recent recordings that were released and also recent case in which he was named 3. Tara Reade  4. China how will he deal with them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel if you want to be considered fair you have to apply the same standards accross the board. There are lots of tough questions you could ask Biden; not one of them were asked yesterday, why if the press is unbiased??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel :/ come on dude you know that's not true. I agree it's a 2 way relationship but to argue most of the WH press Corp isn't hostile towards Trump is just fantasy. I have no problem with the press asking tough questions, that's their job. But at least be consistent....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hottips123497 @Cernovich depends what he knows, the main reason none of the big players go down is because they all have dirt on each other so there's almost a pact not to go after each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel  https://t.co/6INsX8CjTA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel :/ yeah I'm sure his campaign would love that. one thing you can't accuse Trump of is not dealing with hostile questions. I'd like to see Biden cope with the same level of hostility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel have you seen a Trump press conference?? Nothing but hostile questions. Just because there is one news outlet that is conservative doesn't take away the fact that most of the others lean pretty heavily left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel you know they went soft on him but you don't care cos you support him. that's fine, it makes a mockery of a supposed free and unbiased media but that illusion was destroyed a long time ago. Trump won't ask him softball questions though and he won't have the questions beforehand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel sure. there were over 30 masking requests of Flynn in the last few days of the Obama WH some coincidence that. If you're being honest with yourself you know a challenging media should have asked him about the Strzok notes, and if he did suggest using the Logan Act...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich in a world where violent mobs are strolling down their neighbourhoods and the police are AWOL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel sure. Barrs testified before Congress several times and they can't lay a glove on him. At least he doesn't describe himself as the presidents wingman right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loganclarkhall once he heard that first bit of information that a protester threatened him the adversarial tone should have been over, but of course he had his narrative and he was sticking to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel yeah the walls are closing in. this time they'll get him right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel Barr will be fine, I'm sure looking forward to Durhams findings though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel done through the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel nope...   https://t.co/7afxAGORKq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel lol you haven't been paying attention have you. the case is about to be dropped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandman0023 @KimStrassel did you see what was released last week which implicated Biden? You might have missed it becayse CNN and MSNBC most likely didn't report it but it's pretty big news and worth asking him about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j24bauer @KimStrassel you mean you don't care. that's fine. but given what was released just last week which implicated Biden it's worth asking him about it. you might have missed it though CNN and MSNBC probably didn't report on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yebadmillennial @KimStrassel he's not in prison. he was never charged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaWeis17084375 @KimStrassel explain which part of it is fake news?? you've seen the notes right? also we know Biden asked to unmask Flynn basically the day he was leaving the WH, worth asking him about it don't you think? especially since he denied having anything to do with the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justdoit198808 @KimStrassel have you watched a Trump press conference? now compare that with the Biden one. it's not the media's job to lob softballs at politicians, they are supposed to ask tough questions. it's not helping Joe though cos Trump won't go easy on him during the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evasuncle @KimStrassel clearly knew were coming and he still mumbled and looked confused at times. debates generally last 90min and while I'm sure the friendly networks will help him as much as possible, Trump won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evasuncle @KimStrassel it's not helping Joe for him to get this pass, because at some point he will be asked things he hasn't prepped for and it won't look good. Trump has been answering difficult questions for 3 years, often his conferences last for over an hour. Biden did 15min with questions he...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evasuncle @KimStrassel if you don't understand that press conference was nothing but a show designed to help Biden I don't know what else to say. The media should be objective, they should ask difficult questions. Trump won't go easy on a debate stage and he's faced hostile questions for 3 years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evasuncle @KimStrassel so easy they never asked him about it. Why did you request an unmasking of Flynn basically as you were leaving the WH? Did you suggest using the Logan Act against Flynn as the notes suggest? Ask yourself why no "journalist" even brought that up yesterday....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel pretty strange that question wasn't even asked don't you think? almost as if the media didn't want to ask him anything negative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mthilt03 @aharonml123 @KimStrassel worth asking the question though don't you think? if it's being misrepresented Joe can clear it up. Let's also not forget Joe requested an unmasking of Flynn basically the day he left the WH...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caroljsroth can I buy bitcoin instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverdarcy this aged well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dogriguez @manganello_d @KimStrassel I think both democrats and republicans are knee deep in corruption and they know Durham is digging into all of it. I think lots of democrats will be caught up in Durhams investigation but also some republicans which is why they are so weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics_buff27 @bae_miami @SaysSimonson I think it'll be more damaging now if they drop him before November unless there's some major health issue they can use. But if elected he won't be running anything that's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bae_miami @Politics_buff27 @SaysSimonson Trump regularly does press conferences for over an hour with almost all the questions being hostile. Biden answered soft ball questions he clearly knew beforehand for 15min. you think Trump will go easy on him during a debate which lasts for 90min?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dogriguez @manganello_d @KimStrassel that's the only logical conclusion you can reach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manganello_d @KimStrassel but the Republicans are constantly on defence while the democrats don't care. now they're going to try and impeach Barr!? the inability  from republicans to fight back hard is infuriating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lfnsrncplcy @lyndseyfifield @KatiePavlich yup that's true of quite a few things at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 not surprised but watching that presser and comparing it with a Trump one was still quite shocking. these so called journalists should be embarrassed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGuest @ComfortablySmug or Flynn and the Logan Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @MZHemingway imagine calling yourself a journalist and not asking him about Flynn and him suggesting using the Logan Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimStrassel nothing about Flynn and the Logan Act. Shocker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErinMPerrine can you imagine calling yourself a journalist and not asking Biden about the recent documents re: Flynn and him suggesting using the Logan Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull and this is with clearly scripted questions he's prepared for. Nothing about Flynn and the Logan Act, nothing about the riots and looting, nothing about Tara Reade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield @KatiePavlich also how protesting squares with his comment about large gatherings. hell maybe even Tara Reade, the contrast with this and a Trump presser is startling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield @KatiePavlich can you imagine if you had a fair press. you'd get questions about using the Logan Act on Flynn and how that contradicts earlier statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>would like a fact check on Biden's comments that over 200 million people have watched his pressers. Most feeds I've seen have been less than 10,000 watchers. #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComfortablySmug or suggesting using the Logan Act on Flynn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbluestu42 @KatiePavlich waiting for the fact check on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich waiting for the question about Flynn and the Logan Act...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to the type of questions the media are asking Biden and compare that with a Trump presser. Let's see if anyone asks him about suggesting using the Logan Act on Flynn. #Flynn #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annvandersteel Brennan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@downtym @Pericles216 @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen did you just ignore the part where they're chanting about killing police officers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen yeah they did it out of the clear blue sky right. it's not as if a mob wasn't outside their private property or anything. I guess they should be good little sheep and just let the mob do what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diannrt5 @KristenClarkeJD I look forward to seeing how you react when the mob shows up in your neighbourhood and how you might react if you feel like your family is threatened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristenClarkeJD when the mob shows up in your neighbourhood I look forward to you just sitting back and letting them do whatever they want. my guess is though if you feel your family is being threatened your response will be similar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen huh. they put themselves in that situation. the family was just minding their own business in their property. you realise that's different right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen I wonder how you would react if an angry mob descended on your neighbourhood outside your family home? And just because you might agree with them politically don't think they won't come for you too if you have something they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen I never said they were scared but it's remarkable what you're capable of when someone threatens your family, that desire to protect is very strong. it's not abnormal to react in the way these 2 people did, what would be abnormal is cowering to the mob and not protecting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen :/ well it worked because the mob didn't want anything to do with them when they saw they were armed. but yeah let's criticise his tactical awareness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen we've seen it before how people act differently when part of a mob that is angry. the homeowners had no reason not to think their property was under threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen property when an angry mob decends upon it. as far as I'm concerned this is the perfect response, nobody was hurt and the situation didn't escalate. that family probably did them a favour, who knows how it might have played out if the property wasn't being protected...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @TriaRyder @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen nobody was shot. you have no idea what might have happened if the mob had seen a soft target. we've seen looting for weeks. the mob was chanting about killing police officers, this wasn't some peaceful protest, the mob was angry. people have every right to defend their...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen apparently the 2 people are also attorneys so i don't think it'd be so simple. the area was clearly marked private property and there is video of the crowd chanting about killing police officers so it's easy to prove it wasn't as peaceful as you're suggesting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen you can protect your property yes. and if showing you are armed stops the situation from escalating that's a good thing. Maybe they had young children inside their property. we've seen mobs loot in the past few weeks you have no idea what their intentions were.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diaz_Topher @redsteeze if a mob is gathering outside my private property I'm going to make sure they know they can't loot it without something bad happening. this is what they were doing, protecting their property and maybe they had young family inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downtym @thecoraesthetic @CaseyNolen they didn't shoot anyone. but every one has the right to protect their property which is what they were doing. you have no idea what would have happened if they hadn't been armed, or are people just supposed to allow the mob to loot their homes now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I hope this person can be found and that beautiful dog can find the loving home they deserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich I mean we found out last week it was Biden that was suggesting using the Logan Act against Flynn and the media have just ignored it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich I think they're putting a lot of faith in Durhams investigation dropping some bombshells and also the debates. Gonna need it to be something so big from Durham the media can't ignore it, otherwise they'll do their best to downplay anything significant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bware_howard @AndrewMOliver2 @SaraCarterDC @CNN no mention of party affiliation in that article. Funny that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxwellMudd @AndrewMOliver2 @SaraCarterDC @CNN any idea what party they were affiliated with? that CNN article didn't mention it once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jj_talking @realDonaldTrump he's the dude on camera lecturing the black police officer. should be easy to identify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar I've tried to end this conversation several times politely and you keep going on, can you please stop replying. thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar nah you don't want a conversation. and you need to re-read the Mueller report. have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar @marathonman2019 you're wasting your time. he doesn't want a conversation in good faith, doesn't matter how many examples you give he'll just say something like he did as if that makes any sort of point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar well claiming there is clear evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian govt is a pretty big lie. better tell Mueller cos he didn't find that clear evidence. anyway this is fruitless have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar ok you can't have a conversation in good faith so it's pointless continuing. have a good day ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar but I guess it's only republicans that lie no Democrat spins or lies or spreads disinformation that's only the nasty republicans right? if you really believe that I'm not sure there's much point in this conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar and he admitted during the Joe Rogan interview that one of the biggest problems for Twitter was the left wing bubble their staff existed in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar they do if they break any terms of service. but that has nothing to do with whether or not Facebook and Twitter has a left wing bias in terms of the people working for them which influences how it acts. Jack Dorsey disagrees with you, he admitted there was a left wing bias...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar the fact you think there's no left wing equivalent shows your bias. There are still democrats that claim there's evidence that Trump is an agent of Russia ffs!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar it's common sense, who would China prefer as President?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar ok so your position is the people at Facebook and Twitter that make lots of key decisions do not lean left in the majority?? because if you watched Jack's interview with Joe Rogan he admitted there is a left wing bias at Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar and what about left wing disinformation or does that not exist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar don't worry China will be going all out for your guy Biden in November, I'm sure you'll be ok with that. all for the greater good right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar you don't care because you agree with them. so don't be a hypocrite. you're happy with election interference if it helps your team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar :/ yeah and they do nothing to help your team right?? if you're going to act in bad faith this conversation is pointless. Facebook and Twitter clearly support left wing politics and your refusal to even admit that is pretty telling...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar you claimed Trump was elected because of Russian interference, there is no evidence of that. Maybe, just maybe if Hilary had bothered to campaign in certain states she might have done a bit better? much easier to blame troll bots though right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar ok well unless you can prove votes were changed its impossible to make the claim that troll bots and Facebook ads influenced people to change the way they were going to vote...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar I'm also assuming you were equally shocked at high profile politicians and diplomats from Ukraine openly talking about their support for Hilary and dislike of Trump before the 2016 election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar so trolls on Facebook? How many votes were changed? I'm assuming you're against social media platforms having a political agenda then, because if you look at Facebook and Twitter currently they are doing far more than troll bots to influence the 2020 election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar you know under oath the guy from Crowdstrike admitted there was no evidence that Russians hacked the DNC servers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar still didn't answer my question. how many votes were changed for Trump? I've already said any foreign interference in an election isn't a good thing but it's been happening for decades. this didn't start with Trump you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar but the question you didn't answer was, what was the scale and scope of the interference? how many votes were changed for Trump? you claimed Trump only won because Russia wanted him to win, there is zero evidence of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar I'm not saying they are right or wrong. I do have a lot of problems with that particular intel report but that's a different matter. I have also seen reports that Brennan withheld evidence that Russia preferred Hilary, i'd like to see that information...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar I think the goal was to cause chaos and in that regard they succeeded. I also think it's highly likely the Steele dossier was Russian disinfo and that was used to spy on US citizens and a presidential campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar I'm not disputing russia interfered in the election they've probably been doing it for decades. and no when any foreign government interferes in an election that's not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar :/ how many votes did Russia change? What was the scale and scope of the interference. I've not seen anyone claim they changed one vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar wrong, but good try I've heard that talking point several times before. they hired fusion GPS but that has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortnormaltrip @marathonman2019 @Moshelias @Cernovich @yashar where did the Steele dossier come from? who funded it?<|endoftext|>
