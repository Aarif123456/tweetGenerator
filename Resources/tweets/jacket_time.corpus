<|startoftext|>@BigBadBricknell @jamieson__ @VicGovDHHS Yeah right. ScoMo has the power to kick off a royal commission into it all. Why won't he? Cos it'll find the federal government was inadequately prepared to protect the aged care residents in their care. It has already been found.

<|startoftext|>@Jpana75 @Urban_Immerser @sigma1440 @VicGovDHHS Because a virus knows precisely where the border is. It stays within man made borders.
