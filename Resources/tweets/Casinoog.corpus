<|startoftext|>@ghost_0836 @cheetah @Chiefs Same thing we used to think when we saw you out there,  miss ya buddy, hope all is well and Chiefs fans miss you a lot.  Now you know how us fans felt when you would would come up with a huge play,  awesome feeling.  Take care brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless Finally something smart from bayless, maybe some Mahomes respect next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mathieu_Era  you doing ok T, I have seen a few tweets posted on Facebook showing you lashing out on people?  Remember you are worth 100 times people trying to get their 10 seconds of fame,  don’t give them the satisfaction,  you have way more love than hate from #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Chiefs are amazing!!! I mean how can you NOT LOVE THIS??? They are having fun and beating Brady, the best of both worlds Mahomes for MVP!!!!!!! @brittanylynne8 #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchSchwartz71 That’s what I love the most is the guys having fun,  makes this old guy feel like a boy again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchSchwartz71 Haha that was nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoNicA40398951 @brittanylynne8 Hahah I want what your smoking! Mahomes is already 100X the QB Brady ever will or had been. After Mahomes career is over Brady will be a cliff note 📝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brittanylynne8 Tyreek is so fast! And Patrick’s arm is strong,  = bad for any defense lol 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchSchwartz71 Yes sir 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brittanylynne8 Yeah I know and me and my wife just got our 11 pro max and then the 12’s dropped 😭 just our luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who gives a shit, just leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeytailgate @chiefsfan82 @RaiderCody Omg 😂 LMAO 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mathieu_Era And yes that was a bogus call on you, I was like what the hell are you zebras seeing??? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mathieu_Era You cannot do it all yourself brother,  you will have good games and bad ones, but when you have a squad like yours you will never be alone and you always lift each other up and KC, and #ChiefsKingdom loves you guys, keep rolling and keep your head up brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khalenNOTkaylen @ArrowheadAddict That’s true,  in many ways that cuts deeper than a victory lap,  a lap will be forgotten over time, a first win in the new stadium 🏟 will forever be in the books lmao 😂 great job Guys!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes  @tkelce @cheetah  Dirty Dan you guys really came together and showed #ChiefsKingdom  your hearts,  your City loves you guys and are very, very proud fans tonight,  thanks for making me feel young again, and almost giving me a heart attack at the same time LMAO😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealBirdLawyer Well thanks for busting a move for #ChiefsKingdom lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TambaHali91 man we could have used your heart, drive and passion tonight,  miss one of my favorite Chiefs,  I can see you giving Carr some snot burgers lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KOseven0 @ArrowheadAddict That’s mildly putting it,  I might have to get my heart checked out lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCChiefs_UK YES THANK YOU BABY JESUS 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nateburleson The Chiefs won, never doubt Mahomes and Co. lol but to be honest you were absolutely right, and I was wrong,  the Raiders did show out and once again it took us a while to get going.  I did not even think it was going to be close,  but you were right Nate B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchSchwartz71 Man I know,  I don’t know how much more my heart can take this lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never the less,  we’re in every game,  we have Mahomes.  So I ain’t sceerrrddd.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkMcMillian29 #truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowheadPride He is also the most personal, he loves his fans, at training camp he always stays after to meet everyone and sign everything, he is a great person to have on the team! Great job @tkelce way to be a great role model your city loves you brother!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriceIsRight I love your show, I watch every time I can, thank you for continuing to improve the show. You have a lot of fans and I am probably the biggest one lol 😂 you guys rock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Coreyo4 @Kcchief5886 Hell yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jstoner44 @Kcchief5886 Haha damn that sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dpryor1 @TonyGonzalez88 I know that was high school but you look so much better in red and gold brother 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecoldjones_ No I don’t think they make you feel old, in my opinion they make you grow up if your younger and have a kid, and if your old they keep you on your feet and keep you young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurentDTardif @Chiefs Congratulations brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EPN I commend your stance on the wall, way to keep a steady stance on your position. You have more a lot of support here in the states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TambaHali91 thank you for all you did in KC, you will be missed, I wish you luck in all your ventures and you will always be apart of CHIEFS NATION. You made such a impact on this city and we owe you a lot, I will miss seeing you giving them QB’s hell in the red and gold brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superdj56 thank you for all the memories, the impact you had on KC, I wish you all the luck brother and I will miss talking with you at training camp and seeing you dominate on the field! Chief forever. Still remember the first time I met you at your first signing.  https://t.co/qC3tStug5e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjbirden @jaypez25 @TeamX88 I agree it was not 100% Alex’s fault, you obviously have way more experience than I do, you have been in in depth film break down sessions, I just noticed that Alex was running for his life 60% of the time, and Tom Brady would not survive like that no QB’s would<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alvarogmz @ArrowheadPride @pgsween That’s awesome I would love to go watch my Chiefs play in Mexico 🇲🇽 City!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjbirden @jaypez25 @TeamX88 I agree he did produce, but this trend to make it to the playoffs and lose every time has got to change, we do have to do something about this offense line, too much pressure on our QB’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeFu11er Welcome to #ChiefsKingdom, we are a great fan base and the Loudest stadium in the NFL, fitting for a great CB like you, well see you in training camp.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ChiefsKingdomِ #ChiefsNation heck maybe it is time???  https://t.co/6IZ72fOhUH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChiefsNation #ChiefsKindgom we all need a gut check and things need to change, I know we are better than this, what happened to my Chiefs, every one asking for a QB change, maybe but the O-Line is not blocking at all. In down for anything if it helps us win. GO CHIEFS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TambaHali91 We need you back Tamba!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bubba_March You are doing a great thing in memory of your father, great job brother, God bless you and your family<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#chiefkingdom your thoughts on Larry Johnson #27, he thinks there should be no ill feelings how he disgraced Kansas city and Chiefs nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonLandRip @2LarryJohnson7 You cannot disrespect a city and team and not expect ill feelings, maybe in his mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBrothaMan A public figure does not deserve criticism. He made millions and was a NFL player they are public and when they disgrace a city, yeah ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 I will not lose sleep tonight, but when you associate yourself with a current #27 when you discraced that #. You stopped being A CHIEF ✌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 My family is fine and for the record I have never hit my wife, or spit in her face thank you now claimed Christian, make your peace with 👆🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 Post it maybe im wrong if you apologized, but not everyone listens to radio these days, and I did not call you a idiot but you are more than<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 Vermil was correct and he will always get more respect than you will ever do, and true Christians don't spit in women's faces sir! Really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 If you cannot admit you were a discrace to CHIEFS NATION, then you cannot accept your sins if you want to bring God into this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 How about you put a poll on twitter and ask how many CHIEFS fans like you being on that program🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 I hope you made your peace, you had it all, and if im wrong about you know I apologize, I just know you had my respect and pissed on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 How did you overcome the mistakes are you still in the league? And you made mistakes after the NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 I met you and your family when you first got to KC, you think there should be no ill feelings from CHIEFS FANS how you ended??? Plz explain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 That's right you made great decisions in your life, coach vermil was right you acted like a baby, don't associate yourself with the CHIEFS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBrothaMan If you don't see what he has done was wrong makes you as good as him! Prob not even a Chiefs fan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 For the record I loved watching you play and you were the biggest upset in my life as a player and person, SMH you had it all and then....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2LarryJohnson7 What does that even mean, you disrespected #27 he's is a Christian!!! They don't spit in women's faces you have no point to make here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bubba_March That's right brother not the same without you brother😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really after all this guy did to disgrace Chiefs Nation!! Who cares, the new #27 is 100 percent better person than you will ever be  https://t.co/qoDzpdEQ0J<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does anyone think trading @DwayneBowe82 would be a bad idea,  he's become quite a diva?  And attention hog! With 2 catches a game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realJohnAmes @KC_DreadHead lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamLeek40 @ChiefConcernsMS lol he is a chump,  but I am glad he brought in Poe,  but he's had to get lucky sooner or later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver anyone and everyone can win in this league, well maybe not the jags, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefConcernsMS it's looking good!  He's a good commander and CHIEF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyGonzalez88 @JaredAllen69 so uhh you guys coming home? #ChiefsNation we could use your help, and heck we miss ya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefConcernsMS huh yeah, just cannot get a pat on the back lol,  it's ok though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver huge fan but you have to stay realistic, but glad not a repeat of last season. But I am proud of my boys! Playing hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver if the bills were 8-0 you would hear the crap too,  but you just got to enjoy the feeling while it lasts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver I'm not trying to talk crap but when people always talk about the past,  they remind me of raider fans lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefConcernsMS I wish we could go 16-0 prob will not happen but I'm going to enjoy being undefeated while we are, everyone can keep hating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefConcernsMS yeah all 2 of them are on here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLB_Chiefs @Chiefs_All_Day hearing it a lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLB_Chiefs @Chiefs_All_Day this spell check is killing my tweets!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver @RaiderHater29 your just tweeting a broken record! A win is a win,  if the bills were undefeated you would understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver @RaiderHater29 but I understand everyone hates a winner it comes with being undefeated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsObserver @RaiderHater29 I am hearing is about what the bills have done before, all I have to say is well see what happens in the now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLB_Chiefs @Chiefs_All_Day great point all the haters say that!  I'm heating it a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gbiffle he will accept your apology cause he's a man, lucky he's going for another championship, because your not WORTH  messing that up!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoeMans_dream beautiful, but he needs a lil more CHIEFS red :  ) And maybe a lil gold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gbiffle what a dick move,  your boy even on J Johnson's level,  he should have knocked your cry baby ass out! Your a damn prick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common COLTS,  tonight I am the biggest colts fan,  just for another 11:35 :  )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets show this rookie QB for the texans what it's like in a real NFL stadium, nothing like the #SeaofRed #ChiefsNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChiefsNation #ArrowheadStadium It's almost.....GAME TIME,  7-0 here we come,  the Texans cannot handle the SEA OF RED! How bout them CHIEFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcylauren @HardyHottub @BarackObama SUCKS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupermanSamcom @jcharles25 that's what makes @jcharles25 THAT GUY!  He has a huge heart, on and off the field!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tnels0n @raycoon @KC_DreadHead @Kcchief5886 hell yeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefs360 #ChiefsNation I agree with everyone,  if we can get the offense going we are definite contenders!! Maybe #88 can help some : )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@molevy24_7 @Chiefs360 @DwayneBowe82 I would like to see Hemingway in there more! Great hands and not afraid to get hit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nflnetwork A ,  Tony G should come back home where he belongs in KC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@610SportsKC I agree,  but it seems like he does the best rushing in the 2nd half when the defense is pooped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfitchnj be careful you will get hooked,  I started and watched the whole season and caught up to see the last season.  Big treats coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefConcernsMS oh man if our offense wakes up the sky is the limit!  I would like to see Hemingway in there a little more a lot of speed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfitchnj @JHouston50 thank you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KCChiefs_Reid @kcchiefs @big_fish79 I think you should ask him what crazy rookie hazing he thinks he will be through??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowheadPride I think we should keep him for 1 more year and if he stays healthy maybe we can get a lot more for him next year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowheadPride  I do not see the Chiefs having any leverage, maybe after the draft some team will want him the. But now I see no leverage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_mallett_15 forget the browns,  come on over to the CHIEFS!! Razorback nation is closer to here anyways:  )<|endoftext|>
