<|startoftext|>Looks like Ronnie is being torn apart however this is Ronnie and this snooker so absolutely anything could happen here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes 2020 has been a wank year but look at it this way. At least you know what a monolith is now.  Always a positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Selby ripping the piss out of O'Sullivan's tip issues ü§î seems the man does have a personality after all. "Everytime he misses a shot it's the tips fault" ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pamelabaal Positive vibes x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything could happen here. Ronnie could storm out in a huff like a moody kid for no apparent reason or he might ask the ref to take his shot for him so he can go for a cig break.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When Ding looks sad it breaks my heart üíî<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan Fucking weirdo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan Wow !!! Really ? You know harassment can be reported to the authorities if it upsets you. Hiding behind anonymous accounts doesn't work when the proper people get involved. I've done a course recently on cyber crime and the geeks who investigate it can ID them sometimes in hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan You would assume that eventually he would get bored, however cretins like this have very little else to do in their sad little lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know what the status is with my 2020 world championship tickets. I opted to transfer them to 2021 but haven't had a single correspondence since despite sending a few emails (okay 10) #snookerworldchampionship #snooker #wst #worldsnooker #crucible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan Reported the account as fake, there wasn't an option for being an utter bell end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan 100%. Like he said they should get the  opportunity to bang a few balls around to get to grip with the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I admit I'm not the biggest O'Sullivan fan but I much prefer him after matches when he is like this, being positive about the game and positive  about his opponents and being constructive rather than just being a knob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Allen was outstanding there against Jimmy. I prefer these less  frame matches as it really does make it more exciting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still love watching Jimmy White play. Saw him live at The Crucible in 2019 at The Rokit World Seniors and he was amazing. Tonight however I fear the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so annoying I have to watch the end of this but I also have to be up at 6am. I love snooker but I love having a job more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant century that by Robertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is brilliant snooker match between in my opinion the 2 greatest players right now. Its gonna go down to a deciding frame is this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my humble opinion, these two are the best in the game right now by far  and have years left #snookerukchampionship #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump v Wilson is going all the way. #snooker #ukchampionship #UKChampionship2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am not Ronnie's biggest fan but he gets my vote purely for his longevity and his remarkable achievements in the sport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whilst out walking in Nidderdale today I happened upon a very very beautiful house near Swinsty which I am led to believe is owned by someone quite important  @GarethSouthgate  For a footballer you have exquisite taste in property and are truly blessed with living in gods county<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snookerbacker I never received my 2020 tickets for April, I was then told I could either roll them into August or have them rolled into 2021. I opted for tickets for 2021 and since then my emails regards confirmation of this seem to be completely ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveg147 Brilliant performance all week, well done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh look Judd Trump has another title. Great final and Ronnie played his part. Trump is head and shoulders better than Ronnie right now. He has not won as much obviously but definitely better right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to a decider this then #trump v #therocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronnie is dragging this frame out for no other reason than to be annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must not go on Twitter and gloat if Trump beats O'Sullivan tonight. Them Rocket fans are scary fanatics, some old bloke had a right rant at me last night for suggesting Ronnie was abot of a tool. #NorthernIrelandOpen #NorthernIrelandOpen2020 #homenationssnooker #snooker #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_peter_beard @Exsnookerpro Thank you for that Peter. I have read that. It is however called "The Cat Sat On The Mat" not what you called it which was "The Cat Sat On The Mat Is About Your Level" no wonder I was confused. I suggest you get some sleep old lad, it sounds to me like you are a bit grumpy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I happened to have said that Ronnie fans are abit over zealous in their worship of the Almighty Rocket and I may have referred to the aforementioned Rocket as being a bit of a bellend and now I'm getting shouted at on here by an old man. Which kind of proves my original point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_peter_beard @Exsnookerpro I read an awful lot of books what with me earning my living as a book reviewer however I don't think I have ever read a book called "the cat sat on the mat is about your level" but thanks for the recommendation and I will give it a go. You take care my man and you stay safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_peter_beard @Exsnookerpro I agree with you that Ronnie is abit of a silly Billy sunshine and bereft of any common sense, but he is an incredible snooker player. Hope he doesn't read this what with you calling him names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_peter_beard @Exsnookerpro And you my friend with that reply have just confirmed my original post to be true all wrapped up in a big shiny patronising way. I think he is a bell end, a genius but a bell end nonetheless. You get some sleep now, your god is in sermon tomorrow üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exsnookerpro @marjayhan Rightio my man, after all fortune favours the brave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_1187g I don't know who Wayne and Donna are and by the sounds of it I'm better off in the dark. The only player I find that no one dislikes is Ding. Ding is ace everyone loves Ding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan @Exsnookerpro Gonna be a positive result for both of us then either way ha ha, let battle commence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exsnookerpro @marjayhan Yeah man, you are right. Gonna be a great final though tomorrow. I am the worst gambler in the world, no matter what I back its always the opposite result so I might stick a fiver on Ronnie to guarantee Judd wins ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan As a snooker fan I can't deny his genius at all. He has made his money, won everything there is to win and still playing at the top these days so I get it, I like watching him I just don't like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan He is snookers celebrity alright I'll give you that.  Mind you most of the best sportsmen in the world divide opinions in the fans of the sport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exsnookerpro To be fair I thought greeting Thepchaiya the other day with a Wai was a nice touch of class from him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted that @daveg147 lost as he did brilliant to get there. However not a bad pay day at all for him and totally well deserved. I can't help thinking though that If I had not put a bet on, he might have won. Every snooker bet I place goes the other way. #sorrydave #MOT #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exsnookerpro Which bit ? The greatest to have picked up a cue bit or the bell end bit ? I think he is a genius player and a legend of the game don't get me wrong but I just don't like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardcore Ronnie O'Sullivan fans on Twitter are really off the weird charts with their obsession for him. They are critical of every other player and totally blind to his idiosyncrasies. Yes he is arguably the greatest to have ever picked up a cue but also an utter bell end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spectacular pot of that green ball in frame 6 by @daveg147 my bet could come in yet. #homenations #northernirelandopen #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frame number 5 and Trump has finally turned it on. Looks like he has found his rhythm. I fear the worst for Grace now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daveg147 playing really well. Looks comfortable out there. Stranger things have happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OOCSnooker Once got a 13 and was buzzing my little tits off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck tonight to @daveg147 against Trump. Banged a tenner  on him just because he is a Leeds lad and he has done a mint job getting to this stage. If it all goes tits up however I won't hold a grudge #youwinsomeyoulosesome #homenations #NorthernIrelandOpen #snooker #mot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronnie seems to have his match sealed and hopefully @daveg147 will follow suit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ding just looks sad tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody actually ever fallen for any of this bullshit and responded. #scamaware #scam #financialcrime  https://t.co/VWw0M02lIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlucky there for Thepchaiya. He is a proper class player and very fast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikedunn147 @fouldsy147 There is just something special about him, I really enjoy watching him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronnie O'Sullivan greeting Thepchaiya Un-Nooh with a Wai was a nice touch.  #homenations #northernirelandopen #snooker #eurosportsnooker #ILoveSnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said I had a feeling about @Ben_Woollaston tonight. I suppose in sport if it's your night, it's your night.  Long way back for @nr147 methinks  especially as he don't look confident at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just have this feeling about Ben Woollaston tonight. He looks right  up for it. #NorthernIrelandOpen #ILoveSnooker #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember the day well. Sadly it is one of those dark moments in Bradford's history that Bradfordians will always remember. Thankfully there aren't too many days like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markwil147 has a spectacular beard. #beard #markwilliamsbeard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sless147 doesn't seem to have any fear. He looks confident, sharp and up for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuePowerBlog Fair enough when you put it like that. I always love to see them and it's a shame that there was no crowd to see it done live just that stupid recorded clapping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuePowerBlog Of course there's something special about them. A maximum is special. Granted they are getting more frequent but that is to do with the standards being higher now. Brilliant achievement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>During The Champion of Champions #markallen looked great, played great and seemed up for it. Tonight he looks physically tired out. Not surprising really, spending weeks and weeks in Milton Keynes under lockdown rules must be soul destroying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYFRS @bradfordmdc @WYRForum @PHE_uk @EnvAgencyYNE @EnvAgency @networkrail @nationalrailenq @LeedsCC_Help Wow that looks like a mountain rescue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pandora_UK I thankyou for your replies and dm with regards the issues I was having placing an order on the website. After a couple of hours of me acting like a small child and throwing tantrums it resolved it self and my order was placed successfully. Cheers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely delighted for Mark Allen in winning the Champion of Champions. Always been one of my favourite players to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Allen is on another level tonight but seems to be having problems with that pesky yellow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Allen will replay that missed yellow over and over and over again.  #Snooker #snooker #ITVSnooker #itvsport #wst #champofchamps #ChampionOfChampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good battle this #markallen #itvsport #itvsnooker #snooker #champofchamps #championofchampions #wst  https://t.co/FAlAEENYcT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad work is quiet for once. Long way to go yet but come onMark Allen #markallen #itvsport #itvsnooker #snooker #champofchamps #championofchampions #wst  https://t.co/FAlAEENYcT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant performance by Mark Allen. He looks bang up for the final. #snooker #ITVSnooker #wst #ChampionOfChampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said on this ere twitter before this match started that I had a feeling Trump would lose tonight.  At 5-1 to Allen I may be correct.  #ITVSnooker #snooker #wst #ChampionOfChampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A brilliant ref is Tatiana but I definitely think she threatened the re-rack too early  #ChampionOfChampions #wst #snooker #ITVSnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh no. Mark Allen would have been in then. #ChampionOfChampions #wst #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the ref warning a re-rack came abit early then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frame 1 was classic Mark Allen. Great cue ball control, developing the reds and using hardly any cushions and gets a century. One of my favourite players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just have this weird feeling that another Trump will lose tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow this is sensational stuff from Robertson and Selby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>137 then 141 then 121 ü§™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>137 followed by a 141<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These two are making snooker look easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>137 break from Selby there and I enjoyed every ball which is weird because he normally makes me fall asleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Milton Keynes looks an amazing set up for the snooker. Crying shame there are no fans allowed to experience it. #championofchampions #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Sullivan is a massive fucking bellend. Surely nobody on the tour actually likes him. Yes he has done loads for the game, but that doesn't alleviate the fact that he is a total cretin. I'm surprised Mark Allen didn't just knock the div spark out #snooker #championofchampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to have to go to bed because it's late and I know what is going to happen here . It will go to a deciding 11th frame and Selby will bore Wilson into making a mistake or Wilson will fall asleep when Selby sets his safety stall out. Hope I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGBra1 I think as an absolute minimum it should be waistcoats. Not sure bow ties are necessary in this day and age. Especially as some players like Trump wear them stupid flat ones, which look ridiculous. I do think the Shootout should stay casual as its a different type of game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGBra1 I don't know. My mate isn't a huge snooker fan and the reason is he thinks it looks stuffy because of  how they dress. His opinion is it looks boring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selby is playing opportunist snooker, waiting for an error from Wilson like when you fall out with your girlfriend, she gets upset, storms off and your mate sees the chance and tries snake his way into her pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyren Wilson who I think is one of the most exciting players to watch right now is smashing Mark Selby who I think is from Leicester.  #ChampionOfChampions #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a WhatsApp row with a mate about snooker. He thinks the dress code should be relaxed and the players should dress like they do in The Snooker Shoot Out to attract more fans. I called him a moron and then I sulked #ChampionOfChampions #Snooker #wst #snookershootout #moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an unbelievable performance by Judd there, he made Gilbert look average which is bonkers because he played really well aswell. Great snooker match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go Gilbert Go ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank the lord for that. I can now go to bed.  Ding's smile at the end shows his class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 snooker needed for Ding üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proper snooker this. Can't turn it off even though I need to be up at 5am. #ChampionOfChampions #snooker #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't be many sports where players apologise and are embarrased when they fluke. Snooker players always do. I don't see what they have to apologise for. You win some you lose some surely, like any sport.  Scoring a 4 off an edge in cricket is a fluke but is celebrated. #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsSteveMOBrien I had a chat at a bar with the lad who played bombhead in Hollyoaks and I didn't know who Bombhead was as I have never watched Hollyoaks, I also questioned why he was wearing a vest in winter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ding just makes me happy #ChampionOfChampions #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great snooker final that. Both players on top form. Class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to a deciding frame.. I love this shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pamelabaal You are a legend X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing that black will have affected Judd massively and when Judd loses confidence he loses games. I think this is over now and Robertson will just blow him away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These two tonight are making this game look easy... #EnglishOpen #englishopensnooker #HomeNations #snooker #wst #trump #robertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A 133 total clearance from Higgins there. Pure brilliance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Higgins get into the pack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Ronnie discuss the break off shot and having never put  too much thought into it before, I realised that with my standard of snooker I am just pleased not to go in off the break<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebeccaKenna89 My favourite to watch is Judd (when he has confidence) as he plays like he is playing pool pissed up. The player who bores me the most is Selby ü•±<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clusterofreds1 Nationalities have no relevance when the entire season is played in Milton Keynes üòÖ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yuan is a great player, he could pull off a shock here against Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selby you absolute bastard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fabulous 107 clearance there by @GouldyBalls147 to get level. #Snooker #europeanmasters #wst #gouldyballs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck ? @Eurosport_UK @Eurosport middle of the final and you crash on me. Every other channel working so it's not a broadband issue Eurosport1 fine for tennis but  Eurosport2 is fucked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe not after all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frame 13 is over now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GouldyBalls147 go on lad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering how negative Selby normally plays he is on fire tonight #Snooker #EuropeanMasters #europeanmasterssnooker #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selby off to a flying start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Class from Aaron Hill there. Showed his bottle in that last frame where most would collapse. #Snooker #europeanmasterssnooker #europeanmasters #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important pink that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this might be where it goes wrong for Hill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Sullivan is a bit like Manchester United. His hardcore fans love him like a god, snooker fans in general  appreciate how amazing he is but also enjoy him getting beat and the rest want him to get beat everytime he plays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on Kleckers lad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both matches I've watched today involved young talented players namely Nuessle and Kleckers. It annoys me when people say there's no young talent coming through (usually the O'Sullivan faithful ) because there is. #snooker #europeanmasters #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously Florian Nuessle is getting turned over by Mark Allen but it is by no means the whitewash I was expecting. Getting your 1st televised century break against a top ten player is a brilliant achievement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liang looking good this evening, great game this #Snooker #europeanmasters #europeanmasterssnooker #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am trying to watch the Robertson V Akani match on Eurosport on my phone and people keep ringing me. Honestly it's bang out of order, I come to work for a bit of peace and quiet #snooker #EuropeanMasters #eurosportsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pamelabaal The past is called the past for a reason. Never allow anyone to judge you unless they have walked a mile in your shoes. Hold your head up high girl, nothing to be ashamed of x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matchroomsport might be me doing something wrong but I can't seem to unmute the live snooker on matchroom live. Picture quality is great but complete silence. Any ideas ? #snooker #ChampionshipLeagueSnooker #ChampionshipLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronnie might be a bit of a bell end but he is definitely the greatest ever, his 6th world title and another ¬£500k in the bank. Congratulations to @KyrenWilson on his final and his well earned ¬£200k. Showed true class at the end in the post match interview. Brilliant player #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shortest night of snooker ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan @KyrenWilson Thats the thing isn't it ? Psychology has a big part to play I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said that if @KyrenWilson beat Judd Trump then he would win the Worlds. I stand on that. I just think he will do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I reckon Wilson has seen Ronnie miss a few and is using that to his advantage now #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Them last 3 frames must have done Kyren Wilson the world of good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan I think it was more of a clever ploy to mess with Kyren's head. Clever too. If Kyren's head pops it will be game over. Gonna be a great final this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By not calling this frame Ronnie is just messing with Wilsons head #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That green was important for Wilson   #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matthew1Brown @KyrenWilson Yeah. Snooker must be up there as one of the most stressful sports. Must be very hard to be confident without team mates building you up. Quite a solitary sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think it's any lack of ability or skill that will stop @KyrenWilson from winning this final. I think if he loses it will be purely down to psychology and confidence. #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan @KyrenWilson I think Ronnie is the greatest to have ever held a cue but just think Kyren might just do it. I like how he plays the game and I hope he does this. My worry is he may collapse with the pressure though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I still stand by it... I still genuinely think @KyrenWilson will win. The man deserves it for how hard he works #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker  https://t.co/u8SxQJdQfv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan I know right. He is quite knowledgeable to be fair but he just irritates me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Selby doesn't react to this he is going to get absolutely destroyed as Ronnie is playing well #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mark Selby has got no chance at all playing a negative game against Ronnie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeOtway Potting Shed I would think, 5 years ago, I'm good man hope you are too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Kyren V Ronnie final for me #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to feel for Mark Williams there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW what a frame of snooker #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Sullivan is,flying tonight #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Sullivan is flying tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually fell asleep watching Mark Selby play last night. Watching Mark Williams and Ronnie play is a different thing all together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidbeaven10 @marjayhan Can be such a thrilling game like McGill and Clarke yesterday and then there's this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0try @marjayhan Kill me too. üò™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan @0try Kill me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swapped Eurosport2 to Eurosport1 to watch Selby v Robertson and surprised to see it 9-5. I was expecting a much closer match than that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met @KyrenWilson last year at The Crucible after watching him play and he seems very appreciative of his fans. I enjoy watching him play and I  so want him to smash Judd tonight #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker  https://t.co/upnDWdg3J0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great snooker match that. Now to sleep. Got early start today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fucking stress of this frame and I am at home watching, imagine how them two poor fuckers are feeling #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clarkej998 just keep your nerve now. Keep it simple. Payday coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one of the best 3 frames of snooker I have watched in ages #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Jamie Clarke #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @clarkej998 had frame 24 in the bag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This match is close tonight McGill v Clarke is neck and neck at 10-10 at 10pm. Could be a late one this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeOtway I saw you out Friday night. I just thought you might appreciate this picture from the same bar in September 2015. I'm the bald one üòÇ  https://t.co/VMJm2TWTt3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did say so  #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think that will be the last shot Ding plays in this frame #worldsnookerchampionship #snooker #snookerworldchampionship #SnookerWorldChamps #worldsnooker #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always admired O'Sullivan and love watching him play but I've never warmed to him personality wise, I'm not sure he takes snooker very seriously these days and doesn't appear to have much respect for many of his peers. I really hope Ding does this tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjayhan Ha ha me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only use Twitter to follow the world of snooker. #snooker #SnookerWorldChamps #Snookerworldchampionships #worldchampionshipsnooker #wst #worldsnooker #SnookerWM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only use Twitter to follow snooker related stuff, otherwise it just winds me up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snookerbacker Kyren has turned it on and Gould seems to have lost that spark tonight. Good game for the fans at home though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going for a maximum when there was an easier pot backfired there for Kyren Wilson, which is a brilliant thing and how to play snooker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyrenWilson is playing brilliantly. Seems to have slowed his pace down abit tonight and it is working it seems. #class #worldsnookerchampionship #snookerworldchampionship #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gould v Wilson Eurosport1 or Robertson v Hawkins Eurosport2  I've tossed a coin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really fancy @KyrenWilson for the final<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grwat game of cricket  well done #englandcricket<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GouldyBalls147 seems to be a very methodical player. I enjoy watching him play. Hope he goes far in the championships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Lisowski v McGill match is everything that is great about snooker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite a battle this Gilbert v Maflin match<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pure class act is @nr147<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Snooker World Championship is weird enough without a crowd but that recorded crowd applause is even more weird. However it's still being played so shouldn't moan.  I am glad however that I swapped my 2020 tickets for 2021. #snooker #SnookerWorldChamps #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do really enjoy watching @markwil147 play. #snookerworldchampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in man !!! Well done @mikedunn147<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are still furloughed then it is obvious you are not needed anymore. Even the team who fit indicators to BMW cars and the interior designers for Wetherspoons are back at work and their jobs have never ever actually been required #furlough #furloughed #backtoworkforall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With uncertainty surrounding The Crucible this year and whether spectators are allowed and if so, how many, I have opted to exchange my tickets for the 2021 World Championships instead.  Gutted but the best option I think.  #worldsnookerchampionship #worldsnooker #wst #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like both Michael White and Jamie O'Neill, they are both far better players than their ranking suggests and I actually expected 5-5 tonight. Been a great match  #worldsnookerchampionship #qualifiers #wst #eurosportsnooker #eurosport<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been on lockdown and furloughed from work since the 27th March until 3 days ago. I spent most of that time walking with my kids in the glorious weather.

<|startoftext|>I like this format  #ChampionshipLeagueSnooker #ChampionshipLeague #snooker but the bit I don't get is, in a best of 4 what happens if it goes 2-2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With lockdown hair, unfastened collar, loose tie and a waistcoat @KyrenWilson  looks like a pissed up wedding guest. Class player though #snooker #livesnooker #ChampionshipLeague<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally been able to get my blood test that was cancelled due to lockdown rebooked for next week but they want me to attend the health centre for the time arranged and remain in my car.

<|startoftext|>@WYP_Keighley without wanting to be a knob about it, as I go for my solo walk near Myrtle Park in Bingley there seems to be a bbq happening. Not sure this social distancing has been understood completely.  https://t.co/U6EiJxkjnZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a final #GibraltarOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW another massive 140+ break #GibraltarOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two big breaks there, this is gonna be a massive albeit weird final.  #GibraltarOpen #wst #worldsnooker #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird having no crowds but at least there will be no phones going off to distract the players #GibraltarOpen #wearewst #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeHancock_ @SkyBet Fucking students. Always moaning üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised I have some out of date Guinness in the house.  Thought it might make me sick then it occurred to me that Oasis once  took Crystal Meth by accident and they didn't die so I should be fine with the 16 week out of date Black stuff #oasis #LiamGallagher would approve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering he is 14 years younger than O'Sullivan and with the  numbers of tournaments increasing  year on year I genuinly think Judd Trump will become the most succesful player ever. #juddtrump #Snooker #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Judd but I just hope Yan brings a couple of frames back and makes a game of it. Love to watch him play #PlayersChampionship #coral #wst #worldsnooker #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeHancock_ Could be worse pal, I had Liverpool to beat Watford, West Brom to beat Wigan and Shaun Murphy to beat the Chinese kid out of The Goonies in the #worldplayerschampionship #snooker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IVORYWAVEUK @Lukeivorywave Last night in Leeds was pure class. Brilliant set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSherlocks absolute class gig in Leeds. The roof blew off and trainers were thrown.Worth the wait. Two special support bands too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just discovered @IVORYWAVEUK after seeing them support @TheSherlocks at Leeds O2 Academy and I can honestly say. #fuckingclass loud, brash, cocky fuckers from Brum who dress well, just how music should be, just missing a BEZ with a set of maracas,the 90's is back with a bang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gone out for lunch with the wife and just had a lovely cold beer. Now I want to go get spannered in a pub somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judd Trump really is fantastic when on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a kid, my grandad owned a pub in Leeds with 2 snooker tables. He was my hero, he taught me to play, told me he had once beat Alex Higgins, told me he had achieved a maximum and left me his Smith &amp; Nelson cue when he died. I now think he was winding me up. #thelegend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shellhiggins147 Every shot I take jumps out like that üôà<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That yellow in the 9th was spectacular by Maguire #snooker #CoralSnookerSeries #wst #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do snooker ref's do it as a full time job, I assume there are enough tournaments to go round ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to get my youngest daughter to sleep sometimes is like fishing for salmon with a tea cup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronnieo147 has got the weirdest fan base. I don't mean the normal people who love snooker and appreciate his genius, I mean the obsessed one's that constantly live and breath his existence. I have read some really weird tweets tonight. #rockettonnie #ronnieosullivan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @hitmanholt well deserved, shows the true professionalism of this sport, 24 years plugging away to get a ranking title..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was horrible. I have never willed anyone to win a frame of snooker as much before.  I thought @mikedunn147 had it there. #gutted #SnookerShootout #wst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikedunn147 legend. Best of luck tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made a massive error this evening, I thought the bottle of Hendricks was nearly empty and poured it all into a glass. Half a pint was left. Luckily for me I have a pint glass, some ice and some tonic so now I have the worlds maddest gin &amp; tonic. I have called it The George Best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sless147 1 frame format, its a 50/50 chance. O'Sullivan got beat and it's against WST rules that O'Sullivan gets beat. Chin up man, still a class act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sless147 Mind you, saying that, a new baby is far better than winning a game of snooker anyway #Congratulations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Class player is @sless147 but it just wasn't his night tonight. Shame because I do love watching him play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done for earlier @mikedunn147 for a more mature player, you fly round that table üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@villa1st It's great to watch as that Carter Sargeant frame just proved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ali Carter V Brandon Sargeant what a frame of snooker. Brilliant #SnookerShootOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why does the dress code change from tournament to tournament in #snooker is it down to the sponsor or the venue ? The Welsh Open has no waistcoats and no ties.  Not moaning or owt just wondered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadiaarezina @1Freedrugs @rubaaay_doe Ha ha ha that was me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaargh Dotty I feel your pain #snooker #WorldGrandPrix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great high pressure black in the 10th by @nr147 proper class match this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frame 9. Go on Kyren #kyrenwilson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that fascinates me most about #snooker is the compulsive behaviour of certain players. I don't know if its habit, a luck thing or what but Kyren Wilson for example strokes the cue multiple times before every shot every single time. Quite a few have similar traits too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope @KyrenWilson wins this tonight. Robertson however looks ace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Dotty and bad luck to @tomford147 class performance from two class players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I appreciate he is a fantastic player, arguably one of the best if not the best ever but there's just something about Ronnie O'Sullivan that boils my piss. #snooker #wst #WorldGrandPrix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notnormal_olein Yeah just seen them myself. WOW !! üôà<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notnormal_olein He does. I think he has been looking at some comments about his hair on Twitter before he entered the arena and it's boiled his piss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like watching Gary Wilson, I think he is a great player but he does look an angry twat when he plays. Maybe that is his thing but I can't see it helping his game at all. Oh yeah and his hair is angry too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Higgins is a bastard üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think all snooker players should come out to play to music from their locality, at very least their country. I would love to see John Higgins come out to "I'm Gonna Be (500 miles)" by The Proclaimers or Neil Robertson to  Mona" by Craig McLachlan and Check 1-2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snookerbacker Wow over 2 hours that is some frame. I bet it was like watching two pissed girls playing pool  in a pub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Hello Mr Cameron I am escorting you on this BA flight from New York to Heathrow, I am from The Royalty and Specialist Protection Unit, you are in safe hands.

<|startoftext|>I wonder what was the longest ever frame of profesional snooker ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Matthew Stevens has thrown this away now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It always fascinates me how amazing snooker players can have such nightmares occasionally, like Murphy tonight. He doesn't look like he is likely to even win a frame let alone the match<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to a Chinese buffet in York last night called Regency. It was great however outside there was a lot of Chinese walking around outside wearing face masks. It was quite strange to see. Then I realised why ?  https://t.co/KU82ZC5xro<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snookerbacker As finance manager for a large dealership group I can confirm that it is not mandatory but quite a common trait.

<|startoftext|>It's snooker matches like this that affect my work. Early start for a big day tomorrow and I should be in bed now but I'm not, I'm watching Carter V Higgins and it's gonna be a while still yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to restore the equilibrium, these next 7 days are going to be amazing, I will get rid of man flu, I will have a new TV, I will have 3 functioning toilets and I will win the lottery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This last 7 days have been turd. I caught man flu off an idiot at work, the 18 month old TV shit itself resulting in the financially and emotionally underprepared compulsory purchase of a new one and now the toilet in the ensuite is fucked...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good frame that #kyrenwilson #jacklisowski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still have man flu but watching snooker in bed whilst eating matchmakers makes me feel somewhat human again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My 7 year,old has spent the last 2 hours colouring in with felt tip pens. This shows that kids are still kids despite there being so much technology around them. Technology is amazing but the satisfaction she has had from drawing an ace crocodile and colouring it in is better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seem to be in the middle of a festival of cheese<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see that both Selby and Lisowski seem to be actually enjoying this match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up in Leeds in a working class Labour supporting family. My parents voted labour, their parents voted labour and I have always voted Labour. I served in NI whilst in the army and witnessed first hand things you would not believe, for that reason I will note vote for Corbyn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Steven Maguire is just outstandingly good tonight. Mark Allen looks blown away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned the Manchester derby off to watch the snooker. Allen v Maguire #topgame #snooker #UKChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think @NigelBond00 plays poker ? The man is as cool as fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Mark Allen is on it he is properly on it and one of the best to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pistol147 amongst the balls is pute class and I feared for @NigelBond00 there and then all of a sudden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Selby v Stevens game is really dragging on now.  Ordinarily this would delight me and my insomnia but tonight I feel I could sleep so I do wish they would get a wiggle on....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markjesterselby is having an absolute mare it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am owed loads of holidays from work to be taken by December 31st so for the past 3 weeks and up until Christmas I've been working a 4 day week and it's weird but also brilliant. I feel really relaxed. 6 day, 66 hour weeks is the norm but now feels totally wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LucieKate1996 Ha ha,tits.... seriously though I was abit shocked. Shouldn't have to feel like you have to ask permission to feed a baby. I told her it was of course fine and to crack on. I said If anyone complained I would kick them out ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A customer just asked permission to breast feed her baby in our dealership. She said she would wear a poncho to avoid upsetting people.

<|startoftext|>An unbelievable fluke there by O'Sullivan. Outrageous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have watched snooker since I was about 6 years old because my grandad was a player and a massive fan.

<|startoftext|>I love peanut butter. It is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do feel for @OliverLines had it not been for a few missed pots I reckon he could have beaten Ronnie tonight. A good player who played great against a great player who played ok. Big future for him I reckon plus he's a Leeds lad so he deserves it. #leedsleedsleeds #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a frame of snooker.  No longer about skill, it's all about  who has the biggest balls.  And I don't mean snooker balls #champofchamps #worldsnooker #snooker #itv4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Scrap my last tweet, a 97 total clearance and 4 century breaks in 5 frames with the last century break involving two doubles is utter brilliance by @Stuart__Bingham and well worth staying awake in my sick bed to watch #class #snooker at #theworldopen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mikeh60882356 It's wrong though. I love Ronnie as a player but saying that certain lower ranked players will never win anything as they are not good enough is disrespectfull. In my opinion a player ranked 100th in the world  at anything still deserves respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ronnieosullivan is a disgrace. I genuinly love #snooker and I do think he is the greatest and part of his greatness is his arrogance but there's arrogance and then there is disrespect.  https://t.co/yRhFICmgf8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robertson is a class act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ronnieosullivan is one of the best if not the best to have picked up a cue but what he has just said on #eurosport about lower ranked players is a disgrace.

<|startoftext|>@Stuart__Bingham  take a bow. They are all special but that maximum was pure class #maximumbreak #147NotJustANumber #class #worldsnooker #ChinaOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have I only just discovered  @idlesband courtesy of @BBC6Music utter brilliance and pure British noise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched all the episodes of #AfterLifeNetflix in one sitting.  Truly excellent telly. Hilarious but heartbreaking, funny but tragic.  Cheers @rickygervais you may have just saved someones life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my Samsung Notes there is a reminder that at 11pm on the 29th March 2019 something historic was meant to be happening.  It's now 11.43pm and nothing spectacular has happened so I'm having another beer and off to bed #BrexitDay #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Both Robertson and Ronnie are just pure class acts. This is a a wonderful game of snooker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SnowGain247 Hello<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long does a pot have to be to be classed as a long pot in long pot success ? #snooker #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I despair at myself for my fuckwittedness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrychristian What punishment do you think is apt for killing innocent people? A life sentence maybe? Or a life sentence then a pardon under the GFA? Yes that tragic day in 1972 was nothing to do with terrorism but bombing a coach of innocents on the M62 in 1974 was #hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To win the final with his 1000th century is a way to win the final.  O'Sullivan is without a doubt the best ever to have picked up a cue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both Robertson and Trump are class acts. Thoroughly good match that #snooker #PlayersChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God help the poor bastard players who are on at the end of each night session of the #snookershootout the pissed up crowd whilst very funny must be a massive distraction to them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well done @mikedunn147<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_PCWILLIS It was. I'm gonna assume that he drove down the slip road in error and turned round rather than drove down the wrong carriageway of the motorway and up the slip road which I suspect would have maybe been brought to your attention earlier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A maximum break then a 140 straight after by @nr147 just proves that snooker is one of the greatest spectator sports in the world. #utterclass #WelshOpen #Snooker #neilrobertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first maximum I've ever seen live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maximum break for @nr147 #maximumbreak #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I left work tonight at 7.15pm and joined the M606 via the slip road from Chain Bar, well imagine my surprise to see a Toyota Avensis driving towards me on said slip road. How did he get there ? Wonder if @WYP_PCWILLIS can check the cameras and have a quiet word with him. #m606<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCaptain147 is playing brilliant. I love @judd147t but I think Carter deserves this win for his performance this week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Earlier I was walking behind a woman and her son and we heard this loud weird screeching noise.

<|startoftext|>@PamelaBalian Good evening Pamela from a very very cold and wintery England. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love snooker, I watch a lot of snooker, I really admire all the pro players but each  and everyone of them seem to have a peculiar trait about them. I don't know if its superstition, compulsion, habit or what but I doubt many other sportsmen or women have it quite as much<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An amazing win for @judd147t who deserves all the plaudits he gets. A humble winner and an uncredible player, gonna be a big season for him #juddtrump #TheMasters #snooker #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant snooker match this. Both class players but for me #juddtrump just has the edge #trumpvrobertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we have a game on our hands @judd147t v @nr147 at #themasters #trumpvrobertson  #snooker #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mark Selby looks pretty unstoppable this evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHawk147 is dishing out a superb demolition job of @Magician147  which I find abit strange considering how good Murphy actually is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ryan23day just won me ¬£30 courtesy of @SkyBet right game of snooker that. #masters2019<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great interview with @pistol147 after his win  Andy Goldstein "are you gonna have a beer tonight ?" Mark Allen "my wife says no" Goldstein "yeah but are you ?" Mark "yes" #legend #ScottishOpen #markallen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so ill I googled my symptoms and convinced myself that man flu had evolved into dengue hemorrhagic fever so I rang a woman on 101. She said to me "there are no mosquitos in Bingley Mr Carbine so stop being such a fanny and grow up"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You jammy twat Murphy #ScottishOpen #Snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some very brilliant shots played in this @judd147t v #shaunmurphy semi final also some terrible shots and some very very strange shots but it makes for great viewing. I said a Trump V Allen final from the last 16. Hope I'm right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its got to be a @pistol147  v @judd147t final for me. Two of the most exciting players out there. #juddtrump v #markallen #ScottishOpen #final #Snooker #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've worked constantly since being 15  I've paid tax since being18 and I'm 43 now and only once have I ever  had a tax rebate from HMRC and that was this week and it is ¬£32.78. Never have I been so underwhelmed by anything ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Frame 5 is scrappy but great to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonights match between @nr147 and @pistol147 will be an occasion to remember mark my words. I can't call this one at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My works christmas do on Saturday in the buzzing metropolis of Leeds. I'm gonna get drunker than a traveller at a wake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pistol147 is a class act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is @markwil147 playing at in the 7th ? Is he not aware i have money on him to win the 7th bastard frame. I think its because he knows im English<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ali was "The Greatest" and his arrogance made him the greatest ever. I think Ronnie O'Sullivan is the greatest ever but not "The Greatest" as his arrogance makes him sound negative  about the sport that made him rich. #worldsnooker #TheGreatest #therocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a snooker match there between @judd147t and #dominicdale it went down to a deciding frame after a mad frame 10 and this little dude here had a bet on 6-5 to trump ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£ kerching cheers @SkyBet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow frame 10 dale v trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so that little bet didnt pan out quite as expected. @judd147t looks nervous tonight which is abit strange considering how great he is so i've rebacked him again to win 6-5 #trumpvdale #Trump #worldsnooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@judd147t is drawing 2-2 at the moment and i've just got odds from @SkyBet of 3-1 for #trump to win 6-2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like @KyrenWilson he is a great player and all, but I really wanted @mikedunn147 to win this evening mainly due to the fact that I had money on him @SkyBet had him at 5-2 and I invested a ¬£20 in him. #worldsnooker #snookerukchampionships #UKChampionship #snooker #skybet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A well deserved win  for @judd147t infact it was a fucking brilliant victory beating a classy @ronnieo147 on top form. #juddtrump v #therocket #worldsnooker #NorthernIrelandOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#juddtrump v #therocket Is as good a final as I thought it would be. I do hope that @judd147t is victorious. He deserves it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleep is required<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edensharav147 Well done tonight my good man. Very impressive indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A massive congratulations to @edensharav147 who played amazingly well this week in the  #NorthernIrelandOpen @judd147t has been spectacular in this tournament but you held your own. ¬£20k well earned my man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#juddtrump v #therocket Is a magical final. Two of my favourite players after @mikedunn147 I'm sticking all my remaining ¬£23.68 in my Sky bet account on @judd147t as I just think he wants it more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frame 1 of Trump V Carrington was spectacular. 137 total clearance in 8 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certain pro snooker players seem to get an awful lot of kicks, now I'm sure a kick does exist and that there is a scientific explanation for how they happen but I suspect that a lot of them are what I seem to get when I play which is quite simply being wank at snooker #snooker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to feel for @KyrenWilson there. If it wasnt for that red going in I'm  sure he would have done it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on @pistol147 fucking take this frame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not one of those snooker fans who is totally blindsided gay for Ronnie but when he is on it like tonight he is an absolute joy to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow @KyrenWilson is smashing @judd147t with back to back ridiculous breaks. And I'm loving it. Great players the pair of them but I love it when a shake up occurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaun Murphy and Justin Fletcher off CBeebies aka Mr Tumble are actually the same person. This would explain how a) Justin has so much money when all he does is fuck about being a clown and b) why Shaun Murphy pulls them comedic gurns like a clown. #snooker #ChampionOfChampions  https://t.co/ZFuKPNfNLU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Avoided the result all day and just watched the final so I'm delighted to say Well done @pistol147 a worthy winner. Top bloke aswell  https://t.co/dRDWaXqCMU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great frame by Joe Perry there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Joe Perry V Jimmy Robertson game is excellent. Good to see some lower ranked players in a final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Robertson V King game is a beauty.  And I hope it goes 5-5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Day off from work. I woke up took youngest to school then went and bought some paving slabs, laid them in the mother in laws garden then went shopping for her then picked the youngest up from school then picked the big one up from school then went  swimming DAY OFF MY ARSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does my body decide to create a sneeze at the shittest of moments like 1.2 seconds after I take a drink or whilst I'm having a piss or whilst I'm about to introduce myself to someone with a handshake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today has been a great Sunday. I didn't  have to work, I've spent the day with my kids, I've eaten 20 chicken wings and sank a few beers and Europe have won the Ryder Cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've done something for someone else today that's,actually quite a big deal and I want nothing back in return and it actually feels really really good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanGasser Well I watched Fireman Sam recently reward an arsonist called Norman Price by taking him for a ride in a Fire Engine with the blue lights on which is precisely what he started the fire for in the first place. #utterjoke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tonight I have purchased a 6 pack of @KorevLager made by @StAustellBrew and can it is amazing. I'm not  sure if Korev is a Cornish word as the only cornish word I know is pastie but if it is it must be Cornish for cracking beer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#twitter is a worldwide phenomenon and a wonderful random source of media. Today I chatted with a complete stranger from Nebraska for 30 minutes about trainers or as he calls them sneakers. This could never have happened in a pre Twitter world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard some terrible news today about a colleague passing away at only 46 years old leaving behind a wife and 2 kids.  Cherish every single day because life is an utter bastard at times and them so called acts of God really know how to stick the knife in and twist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi. This is me. I have no hair.  https://t.co/fcf4vSBvR4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grace just asked me how the World was made.  It was too deep a conversation to have with a 5 year old so I just said God did. She said "well where did God live ?" I said er heaven, she then said so is heaven not in our world then ? I just gave her sweets then to stop the talking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sunnnnnnni_ Open your eyes then look around. Consciously think about what you want to dream about. Close your eyes again and remain still. You start to feel like you are falling asleep again but this time  allow yourself to sleep. When you next open your eyes you will be asleep and dreaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunnnnnnni_ Go to bed a bit earlier than normal. Lay still with eyes shut and arms by your side but don't fall asleep think of something you want to dream about  remain like that for about 20 minutes. Eventually you start to feel like you are drifting off but then open your eyes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>White and Selby talking about Trump and his lack of confidence. I never thought top players suffer from lack of confidence, lack of form yes or lack of luck yes but surely not confidence.The top 100 are exactly that, top 100 in the world, and that itself should make confidence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chris147ace @mikedunn147 @sless147 @chris147ace you played a brilliant match on Thursday night, a totally mad last few frames however I backed you to win so you owe me a tenner. And I also  backed @mikedunn147 to qualify so he owes me a fiver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikedunn147 @sless147 Don't get me wrong Ronnie is undoubtedly a genius but like most geniuses he attracts utter bellends as his followers who are unable to accept that the Messiah can be beaten. Just like US Golf fans in the US. If a European dares to win in the US they just totally lose their shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect that Judd Trump despite winning that match actually lost to his  nerves. Amazing snooker match that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judd Trump you lucky bastard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has been given chance after chance after chance tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just about to Tweet that you have  to feel for Wakelin there as Trump pots the pink but look what's happened now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far this World Championship I have had money on Selby, Robertson and Murphy. I think what is appropriate here is #WhenTheFunStopsStop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamelaBalian I wouldn't bother as you look amazing as you are plus getting in shape sounds quite hard work to me. Just the phrase "getting in shape" makes me tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @ryan23day an amazing 145, I hope that stays the highest break of the tournament because I think that's money well earned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flukey Bastard McGill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I look at Anthony McGill he reminds me of a cross between a young Paul Scholes and a Proclaimer.  Great player though despite that.  #snooker #WorldChampionshipSnooker  #snookerworldchampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has been some outrageous flukes in this World Championships so far. Very much reminiscent of me playing pool in The Horncastle. #worldsnookerchampionship2018 #worldsnooker #snookerworldchampionship #Snooker #flukes #fluke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great result by @JackLisowski I didn't see that coming at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did however back Robertson to beat Milkins. That's not going well for me either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't have bet on Lisowski beating Bingham and I didn't<|endoftext|>
