<|startoftext|>Hey @icehockeyaus: can't wait to see @GordGoodenough's stellar tweets after your 8pm SGM. He tried valiantly to set the table Nov 20.

<|startoftext|>Precisley the point. We often have a dog with us at the beach (where allowed); we're not anti-dog/pets. But @eurobodalla is completely missing in action in this regard.

<|startoftext|>THIS.   It explains SO much about the US -- not just the election, but its continuing &amp; growing dysfunction. Give this three minutes of your time. Please.  Remarkable insight, genuine passion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the prawn heads have been stuffed into the curtain rods &amp; the fish heads hidden under the mattresses, the Orange One is departing early, tail between his legs, Adderall bottle re-filled, seeking refuge in Moscow. Moving van awaits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The conduct of some of the most senior politicians -- AND their staff -- in the nation, I hope! Can't wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbabones @abcnews Salvo buddy, doesn't even compare.  Obama WAS the incumbent president so had every lawful (and moral) right to use the seal. You are an embarrassment to academia, let alone to the concept of truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't this a statement @dfat should have drafted for @MarisePayne? Why hasn't she or #ScottyFromMarketing issued it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But he doesn't hold a pen, Chris (just as he doesn't man a hose).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptTeebs @abcnews @ellenmfanning The crazy thing is surely they'd have known @mjrowland68, @davidlipson &amp; @KathrynDiss were doing live crosses with @abcnews 7pm TV bullies? They say viewers are sometimes too critical; no, we're not critical &amp; we see this patronising condescension bullshit for what it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@abcnews: thanks for your US election coverage today. But please, someone tell #StanGrant he comes across as rude, bullying &amp; aggressive as he speaks over @ellenmfanning &amp; other guests. He clearly loves the sound of his own voice &amp; wants to parade his alleged cerebral depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BKArturo Maaate, the Republican Party got into bed &amp; became Trump's harlot long ago. They won't stand up to him! Like you, I wish they would, but it's too late now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump exits stage right clearly knowing he's lost this election but setting the scene for his base to revolt over "we won but they stole it", simply because 100million voters did pre-polls &amp; they're still counting those ballots. Returning officers will declare results, not Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump never names who the "they" are in anything he says where there is criticism about him. He conveniently forgets to refer to early polling in many states where the counting continues. And will continue for several days at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This @sbabones is a repulsive commentator. Using the White House as a place for political posturing is entirely unacceptable. He knows it, but excuses it as simply "unconventional" &amp; suggests Biden should have spoken to the media from his bedroom. What a tosser. @abcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bairdjulia And if that's the least of your worries, you're fine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any volunteers for an Office for Democratic Institutions &amp; Human Rights field observation team to assess the US election &amp; observe the electoral vote counting process? Just askin' for a friend b/c that country needs truckloads of help staging a federal election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bairdjulia Julia, Julia ... it's me, me, not I. Towit: "... and tune in at eight for an hour with Hamish McDonald and I (sic)...". You wouldn't say "tune in at eight for an hour with I", would you? I know it's only Twitter, but ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touché.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellenmfanning Well, I stand corrected. @ellenmfanning says "rubbish". (Not sure whether that means she [a] is impressed &amp; [b] has not stared daggers, or both!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @ellenmfanning -- whom I highly admire -- is not impressed. She has several times already stared daggers when she's sensed this #stangrant tendency. The EP has him on a very long rein. His cooperation with CCTV Chinese production is an eye-opener too.  https://t.co/HoEmkUQYpa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #stangrant always have to have the last word @abcnews? The biggest knock on the guy is he doesn't when to STFU. He makes long-winded statements &amp; eventually gets to the end, but no one knows what the question was (including @mjrowland68 @davidlipson in the US).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From a US friend: "COVID is already baked into the cake. It’s too late to stop it. It'll run its course, regardless of who wins the election &amp; actions taken to stop it.

Frankly I've never wanted my political/public affairs soft, so mixing in "soft" yarns is a real art ... too soft &amp; they run off your toast, down your shirt front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The reality on the ground in America (mass unemployment, 225 000 COVID deaths, right wing armed militias intimidating voters etc) isn't a fact; it's an interpretation," says this numpty @sbabones who simply can't STFU. What BS. #qanda<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mbabbbage @jotownsend @abc730 @_JustinStevens_ @latingle A work in progress possibly. I try not to read too much into emphasis though I hear you. What's their story selection (which means what have they not covered) &amp; how they're covering it means so much. For some time it hasn't been as hard-hitting as I'd like.  But that's just me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunno if @jotownsend's departure from @abc730 is any coincidence, or whether @_JustinStevens_ has upped the ante, but tonight's program was a cracker: solid, hard-hitting, comprehensive, great i/vs with talent, &amp; @latingle on for more than 2 minutes!  More. Encore. Zugabe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good point Abul makes -- optics forced Holgate out more than anything else. Meanwhile sports rorts, Gus Taylor's water buybacks, Gus Taylor's botched document hit job on Clover Moore ignored, et al. Good riddance to Holgate nonetheless. @australiapost is a shadow of itself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The DTele journo (Caldwell), her editor &amp; Newscorpse generally have a lot to answer for in this one Mal. I know a drop when I see one; I also know the DTele's modus operandi &amp; clearly the "facts" were immaterial to the yarn's intent: damage Clover Moore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@ChrisMerrittc: Notwithstanding you have no idea what "procedural fairness is", the fact is Heydon declined to be interviewed/give statement.

How could anyone have interpreted his activities otherwise?  For decades his lecherous activity has been "inadvertent &amp; unintended"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stanleyward90 Guess I'm only just recognising how industrial was/is the scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"One of Mr Heydon’s postgraduate students...was so upset &amp; angry about Mr Heydon’s harassment of her in Oxford's Bodleian Library, that she complained to the university." What a grub. What a creep.  https://t.co/AC9iEo0IIx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The legal sector tolerated this? Disgusting (&amp; don't "cancel culture" whinge at me). "Former High Court Judge Dyson Heydon was known as 'Dirty Dyson' and 'Handsy Heydon' due to his lecherous behaviour towards young women students at Oxford University."  https://t.co/AC9iEo0IIx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellegrattan Starters, these inquiries are rarely if ever conducted by lawyers. The rules of natural justice/procedural fairness have never required right of cross examination, but merely to be given a "hearing" to answer adverse allegations &amp; to have all adverse matters of fact put to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's appalling this occurs in 2020, in Sydney, with all of the exposure given to the inappropriateness of such conduct ... and in public. I simply cannot fathom what type of parenting has permitted (or tolerated) boys/men to behave so disgustingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting Heydon to front up to face the collective music, as a man, is unlikely.  He'll have too many ifs, ands or buts in the way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does Newscorpse really believe Dyson Heydon should have had the right to cross-examine the very women whom the Chief Justice has accepted were sexually harrassed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heydon was afforded that opportunity to answer allegations. At no point has Heydon anywhere denied what occurred. Instead he has hidden behind the disingenuous "if/any" non-apology. Apparently his actions were all unintentional &amp; inadvertent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merritt is certainly not a scholar. He's a journo, &amp; at that, a journo who is woefully ignorant. The rules of procedural fairness as established in countless legal decisions do not require a right of cross examination -- only the right to answer allegations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newscorpse's long-suffering (we've suffered long enough) "legal affairs" scribbler Chris Merritt suggested the former High Court HeydonJ was denied procedural fairness because he was not given the opportunity to cross examine the accusers, only respond to written allegations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. Was Dyson Heydon denied "procedural fairness"? In short, no. As explored &amp; explained by someone far more learned in the law than me, allow me to share his insights.

<|startoftext|>When Kotvojs was asked if she accepted scientific consensus the climate's challenges are caused by greenhouse gas emissions we create, she said: “There's evidence both ways. The changes, the current environment &amp; the current climate we have is the result of many factors.” Cop out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. #EdenMonaro LIB Fiona Kotvojs, can’t be trusted on tackling climate change. @Mark_Butler_MP knows her form.

<|startoftext|>During the #EdenMonaro byelection campaign, Fiona Kotvojs &amp; Alan Burdon have no availability listed when they'd like you to show up to volunteer your labour. But they're still listed  https://t.co/9cDc5M3M3A. Passing strange, the whole thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I'm all for farming (organic, dairy, cattle etc) but the WWOOF concept has me wondering about: insurance? workers' compensation? liability? visa status of volunteers etc? Hosts are responsible for complying with tax, Work Cover &amp; OH&amp;S (&amp; PPE during #@COVID19) legislation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what duties are the vollies at Kotvojs'/Burdon's Dignams Creek 380 acre cattle &amp; truffle farm expected to perform? Work includes orchard &amp; truffiere maintenance, chores, working with cows, weeding, gardening, rock walls, fences &amp; other infrastructure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The host takes volunteers on the basis they'll work for free up to 6 hours daily (max 38 hrs/week). Kotvojs' preference is for vollies to stay up to four weeks, accommodating up to four at a time! That's more than 600 hours' labour in a month! No salary, no pay. How good is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. So #EdenMonaro LIB candidate Fiona Kotvojs &amp; hubby Alan Burdon are hosts with the group World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms  (WWOOF). It aims to promote its mantra via its members/hosts through a curious arrangement of voluntary labour, in return for food/board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryOBR28128869 @AnthonyCole68 Yeah, that's an interesting one isn't it. In return though, the  "slaves" get to live &amp; eat with the Kotvojs/Burdon Bretheren, experience a part of the country they might not otherwise see, &amp; contribute to a commercial organic farm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RFSCommissioner told it straight on excellent @AustralianStory that he was blindsided by #ScottyFromMarketing's decision to stand up ADF reservists. Conveniently @AndrewConstance ignored that snub in his media doorstop today. He can't be trusted. Just ask @JohnBarilaroMP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's telling porkies then @AndrewConstance? We don't want this LIB-NAT infighting in Eden-Monaro. It's distracting, unproductive. Go away. Get help. @JohnBarilaroMP's texts to @M_McCormackMP tell a very different story to what you told journos today.  https://t.co/xBlCVgVOCe  https://t.co/kKelj3xo7V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's not"cutting &amp; running" from the state seat of Bega says @AndrewConstance to seek pre-selection for federal parliament in the seat of Eden-Monaro. "That'd be going &amp; picking up a corporate job somewhere," he says. Like Andrew Robb then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewCatsaras @thepmo @AndrewConstance @DanTehanWannon That's my interpretation of what he said ("no more scripted lines"). You can hear the entire 15' doorstop here on the @NaroomaNews' Facebook page:  https://t.co/Js6cCQ85yO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@thepmo #scottyfrommarketing are gonna have their hands full with @AndrewConstance ignoring their TPs/daily brief. "It's dehumanising" he said today, that politicians work from scripts.  Not for Andrew any longer. He's going rogue! He's going feral. He's doing a @dantehanwannon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With respect, the last thing Eden-Monaro constituents need is a broken biscuit.  If @AndrewConstance is disillusioned with politics, even worse if he thinks that's a healthy attitude, then we don't want him. He needs help. He doesn't need #scottyfrommarketing patronising him. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When asked "how long ya planning sticking around" by journos today, Eden-Monaro wannabe MP @AndrewConstance dismissed his recent threats to quit NSW politics with this strange rationale: "Being disillusioned with politics is a healthy thing for someone in my shoes." 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewConstance conveniently overlooks #scottyfrommarketing "deployed the troops" during the 2020 south coast bushfires,&amp; ignored to tell the most important person needing to know: then @RFSCommissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Firies found out from the telly!  https://t.co/hcEqrLjAL7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 But @AndrewConstance reckons #ScottyFromMarketing has learned his lesson even though the public has no faith Constance could work with the PM. "It was great #ScottyFromMarketing apologised to me personally at the time," Constance says.  What about the rest of Eden-Monaro?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There's no doubt we all learned from the bushfires," says @AndrewConstance. We learned #ScottyFromMarketing's a dud who abandoned Eden-Monaro when we needed leadership most &amp; we discovered PM still hadn't learned his lesson when trying to force Cobargo survivors' handshakes. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems @AndrewConstance already has a National Kumbaya Policy for Healing drafted for #ScottyFromMarketing. He says "we don't need debate; we need solutions". And guess what: he wants bipartisan solutions, holding hands, singing around the campfire. Eden-Monaro doesn't want him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would Eden-Monaro want an MP who has neither respect for #ScottyFromMarketing let alone from #ScottyFomMarketing? @AndrewConstance knows the EM constituents have no time for wankers; that's why Cobargo gave the PM the bum's rush when he visited.  https://t.co/UXuCx51qQj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Granted @AndrewConstance bore terrible mental anguish over New Year's bushfires on NSW south coast, but his pitch today sounds like he's lining himself up as the new Minister for Trauma. Not sure #ScottyFromMarketing had that in mind when he was downing another Hawaiian daiquiri.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How'd you forget the terrible impacts of the prolonged drought @AndrewConstance at your doorstop today? You referenced bushfires, #COVID19 &amp; the economic consequences, but overlooked the significant impacts of the drought on Eden-Monaro farmers. You have selective memory it seems<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is a tragic loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colonelhogans @pjlogue He’s not as decent a “family” man as you might think actually. Ask around the electorate. Insofar as NSW 2020 bushfires, he responded genuinely. He suffered. He is still suffering frankly. I’m not sure he should really be standing for Eden-Monaro; his health is fragile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor social distancing ... but cut them the slack they deserve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @AndrewConstance is standing for Eden-Monaro LIB pre-selection trying to fill the shoes of a very fine father &amp; husband @MikeKellyofEM, will he try to run on a similar theme of strong family values? Like he did in the NSW State election? Hmmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Property NSW, NSW Government &amp; Sydney Council doing a "he who must be Obeid" to the Sydney Cove Oyster Bar?

<|startoftext|>Further, ABF can detain PAX/crew if they believe there are unresolved issues – a temporary halt to clearance if you will –  while such matters (such as “isn’t there a pandemic … shouldn’t these 2700 PAX be at least screened, if not quarantined?) are resolved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bauer says 250,000 consumers have looked up roller/inline skates on its website in the past six weeks, while the company has seen a 723% year-on-year traffic increase on any content related to these products.

<|startoftext|>So, NZ PM Jacinda Ardern (&amp; all of her ministers) have agreed to a 20 per cent pay cut over the next six months!

<|startoftext|>Anyone notice what's missing from #RubyPrincess #COVID19 debacle in the Aug 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza?

<|startoftext|>@stanleyward90 @Ippystar @jommy_tee @AusBorderForce @PeterDutton_MP @ScottMorrisonMP @GladysB @NSWHealth Yeah, not sure who/why Ippy is so hell-bent on giving ABF a pass, but nailing every other agency.

<|startoftext|>Don't forget @imperialcollege modelling on Mar 16 concluded even the most effective #COVID19 mitigation strategy would lead to 250,000 deaths in GB, and 1.1-1.2 million in the US.

<|startoftext|>Tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ippystar @AusBorderForce @Sue0606 Of course it's not legal advice. Who said it was? It's research to inform the issues: who did the risk management for the disembarkation of #RubyPrincess, who dropped the ball, &amp; why didn't @AusBorderForce stop the one ship (boat) it should have. Fini.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABF may not be able to lawfully refuse entry to a flagged ship on a scheduled voyage, but there are ways and means to intervene, delay/stop disembarkation as I’ve just outlined. #RubyPrincess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/3 Further, ABF can corral &amp; detain passengers/crew if they believe there are unresolved issues – a temporary halt to clearance if you will, while such matters (such as “isn’t there a pandemic … shouldn’t these 2700 PAX be at least screened, if not quarantined?) are resolved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While there exists a constitutional barrier to @AusBorderForce refusing entry to Australia of Australian citizens, the ABF is able to exercise quarantine powers, usually on the advice of a responsible authority. 1/3 ping @Ippystar @Sue0606 #RubyPrincess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sue0606 Fair observation. I was not seeking to contradict; simply to provide context &amp; an explanation of how the Ag staff gewt involved on behalf of the CMO as the national director of human biosecurity, at the direction of state agencies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sue0606 @AusBorderForce More to the point: who undertook the #RubyPrincess risk assessment of disembarking 2700 PAX during a pandemic; &amp; then who authorised letting them off the ship? @AusBorderForce proactively should have over-ridden any other agency's call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sue0606 @AusBorderForce But the CMO is director of human biosec. DAWE officers only undertake human biosec role as agents of C'wealth &amp; State health depts; they do what health authorities instruct them to do. DAWE staff are NOT medically trained; they act on directions of the relevant state health dept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBopinion Not fully across the detail but I believe some of the recent arrivals are special charters of expatriate Australians being "evacuated" or repatriated home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatPurry9 @AusBorderForce No, I could not find any solid evidence but I continue to see plenty of chatter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_haigh Let's not drag all that into this Bruce ... I get your anger (justifiably so given government policies at the time), but the #RubyPrincess needs a deep, deep dive of investigation into it. Hopefully that will occur, both formally &amp; informally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimiko67 @PhoenixMe_ @AusBorderForce @PeterDutton_MP @abcnews @KarenMMiddleton @lenoretaylor @andrewprobyn @murpharoo @leighsales @mjrowland68 @LisaMillar @latingle @vanOnselenP @David_Speers @CroweDM @PhillipAdams_1 @LaTrioli Well he has been confined to barracks as a #COVID19 infected carrier. And his family trust's child care centres are taking a massive hit so he's no doubt supporting his wife as she struggles to fire staff ... my heart bleeds. Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ippystar @jommy_tee @AusBorderForce And finally, @AusBorderForce commish Michael Outram was instructed (likely by @PeterDutton_MP &amp; @ScottMorrisonMP ) to front media to dump on @GladysB &amp; @NSWHealth. Finger pointing, playing politics to the hilt, just as PM &amp; his press office did during the summer bushfire crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ippystar @jommy_tee @AusBorderForce More to the point: who undertook the #RubyPrincess risk assessment of disembarking 2700 PAX during a pandemic; &amp; then who authorised letting them off the ship? @AusBorderForce proactively should have over-ridden any other agency's call.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is a very good point from someone whose view (knowledge &amp; experience) I respect. He was after all a depsec at IMMI during very trying times. The salient point: what should govt have been doing for ALL ships &amp; planes, not just #RubyPrincess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ippystar @jommy_tee @AusBorderForce I'll get a legal eagle (which I am not) to parse the relevant Act ... it doesn't have to be a biosecurity matter. Don't focus just on that. The @AusBorderForce has power to prevent entry on grounds it determines are lawful. Simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ippystar @jommy_tee @AusBorderForce Health matter or otherwise, @AusBorderForce has the power to deny entry let of a vessel, let alone PAX disembarkation.  If they want to, they can. The legislation is sufficiently loose you can get a Mack truck through it when you need to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling Woking Pizza Express; your delivery team is missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I think about #RubyPrincess debacle, the angrier (&amp; sorrier for the victims) I get. It defies logic that @AusBorderForce didn't assert its authority. It has on so many other occasions.  They had ONE job ... one boat (well, ship) .. and WTF happened? Asleep at the tiller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @ConversationEDU even writes about (ice) hockey .. in a #COVID19 context, of course.  https://t.co/tKDslkYWxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The line -- "after a month-long medical conference on board a cruise ship in Antarctic waters" -- is what piqued my interest. No doubt largely subsidised by the Australian taxpayer!  https://t.co/KTPdwrylsa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do @barstoolsports &amp; @spittinchiclets regularly make my day?  This is one example:  https://t.co/Kch8ndvM6Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never, ever tire of this vintage @Paul_KeatingPM. He knew a salmon and what bait to use like no other. Ping @AlexanderDowner aka Curly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an absolute, total &amp; unquestionable tosser. Yes, hindsight and all that, but what did he know on March 10 to arm him with such confidence as to tweet this shite? Is he a doctor? Scientist? Epidemiologist? (h/t @hughriminton)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneKennerly Because, as I said "no concrete evidence emerged". Suspicions &amp; assumptions are not evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Twitter: the allegation about a SYD MP using influence to expedite Ruby Princess' berthing/PAX SYD disembarkation has pretty much come to nought. MP names have been (privately) shared, but no concrete evidence emerged. It still has a stench to it. Hopefully MSM will dig deep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 It will take "three days" to resurrect a full sheet of ice. As a reminder, it was only a few days ago that hearses began to unload #COVID19 deceased at a Spanish ice rink  https://t.co/Dgc03cG4yd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The use of Phillip ice rink in Canberra as a temporary morgue is not that far-fetched, though we sincerely hope #COVID19 will not come to this.  CT suggests the facility is currently melting the ice pad for "floor refurbishments".  https://t.co/EVB9LUME4Z 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What other locations along the eastern seaboard was @NSWHealth considering as berthing options for cruise ships where they knew PAX disembarking would require medical attention &amp; intervention?  https://t.co/kUDQAgkXgc Excellent reporting @FarrellPF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone knows about ghost truckloads of cement failing to be delivered to construction sites (or masks disappearing "out the hospital back door" [who would want them?]), this guy would. Crook, spiv, fraudster-in-chief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good read, excellent summary. View from afar, up close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another example of the piece-meal, haphazard, knee-jerk response of #scottyfrommarketing, in this case to Australians facing impossible situations o/s. I cannot believe @dfat wasn't advising to "get them home, now". FFS, this is an appalling dereliction of duty by government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So if, as IPA Review journalist @J_C_Campbell suggests, public sector wages need to take a hit b/c of #COVID19au effects on private sector, which would he start with: police, firefighters, nurses, ambulance officers, teachers, ADF personnel, train drivers? Do tell us, champ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the rest of the world is saying during #COVID19au keep 2m or 6 feet apart, Aussies will soon be issued with measuring tapes to determine what 1.5m is. In Toronto, they use an ice hockey stick.  Makes sense.  https://t.co/2V6PFmAsUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a very useful innovation on @InsidersABC. Trick will be not to let it appear to be a "scoreboard" or tallyboard. Context, comparisons &amp; where AU fits into the global picture will be key into the future. Nice work @CaseyBriggs &amp; deft use of technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's pretty shit. Wot say EP @sclark_melbs? Why's WA being denied your great program?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerardb99212455 It occurred to me was likely easier to get this numpty (who referred to @StuartRobertsMP as "Stuey") in MEL into the studio than either @lenoretaylor or @markgkenny. He also fills the "balance" requirement @sclark_melbs is obliged to meet. As TV talent, he'd best stick to print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vbthedog @InsidersABC And your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dambreezie @InsidersABC @J_C_Campbell Precisely ... as if the APS &amp; state public services haven't been hacked to the bone already. Can't wait to see @J_C_Campbell's list of donations he has made since #COVID19Aus, his pay slip showing how he's sharing the pain, his refusal to accept IPA Review money for his copy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did @sallymcmanus @unionsaustralia or @NadineFloodCPSU hear outrageous suggestion by newscorpse/IPA stooge @J_C_Campbell on #insiders (from 57' 10"  https://t.co/c30YnO6x3D) that public sector must share "pain" when rest of workers "taking a haircut"? Public servants are 24/7 ATM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's with @InsidersABC crap @J_C_Campbell that public servants' wages be reduced during #COVID19? Where's this shite from? Oh, just checked your bio: Sky News commentator; writes for Institute of Public Affairs Review. D'ya really not get it: without them, we're fooked?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OzzJen No, still trying to get a rock solid confirmation on the MP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #scottyfrommarketing. You wouldn't wanna do anything as creative, humourous, human &amp; understood by EVERYONE, as this #COVID19 campaign, would ya?  Na, let's keep with the boring stick figure @healthgovau campaign. It's brilliant. Not.  https://t.co/rdQj5D3phW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't we need 10,000 more nurses (especially ICU-trained) to staff the doubling of critical care wards in public hospitals throughout Australia?

<|startoftext|>Because so many do not trust the PM (bushfires, Hawaii, sports rorts et al), just about anything he now says about #COVID19 is an automatic negative; he's not only untrustworthy but also cunning.  He's not #scottyfrommarketing for nothing! Australia: we do not have a winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visual impact (largely from abroad so far) is gut-wrenching; the signal value (what's next as a portent of further ills) is full of possibilities; &amp; there are so many exposed now, the "it could be you" resonates. But we instinctively rate Morrison's messages on "do we trust him"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got enough human interest (victims, hero first responders), high-profile issues/personalities (Tom Hanks) &amp; conflict (Outram/govt dumping on @GladysB) to fill an emergency department. It is all leading to out-of-control deer-in-the-headlights Morrison mismanagement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. All of the what are known as "media triggers" during public health crises which turn the crisis into a major clusterfu*k seem to be occurring to the Morrison govt. Already questions of blame (o/s visitors, Chinese) &amp; cover-ups (Ruby Princess) dominate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whyalla55 The only issue with this claim about NZ Health (other than Rubi [sic]) is that David Coleman has been on extended personal leave. Alan Tudge is acting for him.

<|startoftext|>So @KayMcNiece &amp; her family trust  ( https://t.co/X1JNEr0JEi) have just been contracted back to @healthgovau to manage #COVID19au media.  She's a longtime consultant to them for media liaison tasks. She's earned, wait for it, $21M from Cwlth contracts over the years! Waddya say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the Biosecurity Act 2015. It's a great read! See  https://t.co/vdXImc3a2i #COVID19au<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That @AusBorderForce commish Michael Outram was instructed to front the media to dump on @GladysB &amp; @NSWHealth is disgusting: @ScottMorrisonMP (&amp; @PeterDutton_MP &amp; the Pez) are playing politics to the hilt, just as the PM &amp; his press office did during the summer bushfire crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relative to the Ruby Princess disaster, there are two issues: who undertook the risk assessment of disembarking 2700 PAX during a pandemic; &amp; then who authorised letting them off the ship. Surely @AusBorderForce proactively should have over-ridden any other agency's call. Surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAWE officers only undertake the human bio security role as agents of Commonwealth &amp; State/Territory health departments; they do what health authorities instruct them to do. DAWE staff are NOT medically trained; they act on the directions of the relevant state health department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Metcalfe's remit is everything APART from human biosecurity. The Chief Medical Officer (currently Dr Brendan Murphy, @healthgovau) is the "director of human biosecurity".  State/Territory health depts are his key authorities in their respective states/territories. #COVID19au<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. There's a common misapprehension about biosecurity responsibilities in Australia &amp; who has carriage. There is a director of biosecurity (who is also the the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Water &amp; Environment [DAWE] ( https://t.co/Mu92dZE0Hd). #COVID19au<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@AusBorderForce How can Michael Outram, ABF Commish (sent out by Pez/Dutton/Morrison to dump on @GladysB &amp; @NSWHealth) defend this, if true? ABF staff tell PAX it's not their responsibility to enforce social distancing at SYD Airport arrivals hall? It's biosecurity's role? WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Federalism works so well ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@antsyturbo Good question b/c the Maritime Arrivals Reporting System is largely a self-serve online kiosk which cruise operators use. I thought DeptHealth had carriage of Biosecurity Act 2015, but Dept Ag also plays a role. Did their biosecurity staff join ABF before PAX disembarkation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@AusBorderForce wdn't have dumped on @GladysB &amp; NSW  https://t.co/DsPAZOtcAh without green light from @ScottMorrisonMP &amp; Spud.

<|startoftext|>What a hopeless, spineless #ScottyFromMarketing we have as a PM.

<|startoftext|>Not a one ... furthermore, he relies on the "support" of a ministerial colleague whose claim to fame is that he was once unanimously chosen by doctors to be the nation's worst health minister. Sorry to be technical but #scottyfrommarketing is an absolute clusterfuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We need people to know what to do at the local level.

<|startoftext|>"So concern at the ‘local community level’ was bubbling," Parsons continues. "We needed to myth bust &amp; set the expectations early; be clear on message.

<|startoftext|>Parsons, a very experienced comms exec, says there are many concerned/worried locals who are only hearing the #COVID19 messages as they relate to ‘the cities’, but little about their backyards. "Regional residents have different concerns to city dwellers," Parsons says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To apply appropriate social distancing protocols, the media conference was staged in a huge convention centre so journos/attendees could have 4m sq clearance. There was even a live mic for journos' questions. How hard is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This convuluted approach enabled the interpreter to hear the presser live &amp; simultaneously sign in Auslan as a picture-in-picture feed, out to @DubboCouncil's  social platforms and TV networks - all of this LIVE. This is incredibly innovative use of technology. By @DubboCouncil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather than wrestle with the logistics of getting her from SYD-DBO, they sent their interpreter to studios in Balmain, broadcast their live TV feed from Dubbo (via their own in-house capability at Council!) to the studio where it was then put through the studio's master control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the closest Auslan interpreter 300+km away, Council's comms director Andrew Parsons contacted @deafsocietynsw for FRI's broadcast. They promptly provided (Level 3) interpreter Tanya Miller but time was of the essence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adammshirley @GeorgiaHitch @abcnews @abccanberra @PMBarraclough I stopped producing morning radio yonks ago; won't bore you with a punter's critiques beyond my tweets. That said, listener/viewer feedback &amp; engagement is valuable; even more so when it's constructive. My beef is @abccanberra news judgement, live crosses as patsy cross-promos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgiaHitch @abcnews @abccanberra @PMBarraclough You're not the mic jockey. My criticism is the blatant cross-promos incl live hook-ups with @adammshirley pretending to be a journo. He presents a radio show, but he's not a reporter. And it shows. Granted he's a scientist "by trade", but still, not a journo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgiaHitch @abcnews @abccanberra Unless you are CoS/news editor at @abccanberra, my criticism is not directed at your reporting (which was fine); it was clearly directed at whomever drove the decision not to cover @Clonakilla yarn the day it broke (even just a reference in the intro/outro at least).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMBarraclough @abcnews @abccanberra They're doing live crosses from just about everywhere these days. The story was important enough to have dropped the cross-promotion wankery they're shooting/airing this week, including live crosses, &amp; done the wine yarn live. It would have been picked up across the network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It only took 24hrs for @abcnews @abccanberra to follow-up a story about which I tweeted, one they should've covered in last night's bully. At least they did pursue it. But I continue to wonder where their news values are. Why is a clearly non-journo, but a mic jockey, reporting?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree! Ordered a dozen of every @Clonakilla red I could get today.  But where are @abcnews @abccanberra news values? They have no idea. The cross-promotion crap for a breakfast radio program on "national" news is embarrassing. They. Have. No. Friggin'. Clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is @abcnews @abccanberra serious with its "farming conditions are going to ease" reporting tonight when @Clonakilla says its ENTIRE 2020 vintage, tainted by bushfires, is binned?

<|startoftext|>I'm a huge fan of Andrew Metcalfe, but I am far from alone.

<|startoftext|>Jump to 2020 &amp; #ScottyfromMarketing announced in Dec 2019 he was bringing Metcalfe back: Secretary of Agriculture, Water and Environment from 1 February. And guess what: for the second time he won't get to serve the minister (McKenzie) to whom he was appointed. Bad luck I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peta Credlin wielded her axe on Andrew when Abbott became PM ... using PM&amp;C secretary Ian Watt as her proxy to dismiss him. It was a highly unfair &amp; partisan decision. Metcalfe went quietly, his then-minister (Barnaby Beetrooter) ignorant of the sacking. He wasn't consulted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THREAD. With #sportsrorts @senbmckenzie gone (as Ag minister), it'll be the second time top bureaucrat Andrew Metcalfe fails to serve under the minister to whom he was appointed. It's a highly unusual, if not a unique historical quirk. In Sept 2013, he was summarily dismissed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ljayes @craigthomler @SkyNewsAust @newscomauHQ What’s the difference between “has told me” and “has personally told me”? Does one suggest you’re a VIP journo?

<|startoftext|>Those poor families of the C-130 waterbomber crew whose plane crashed today in the Snowys. RIP.

<|startoftext|>THIS is why community-based fund raising efforts are not only far better “investments”, but they also give locals ownership of their future rebuilding. Better yet, they don’t pay commissions or have huge admin overheads. Cobargo’s  https://t.co/8RjMroFNX3 is an excellent example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There is absolutely no way the entire community sports grants program wasn't (repeat, wasn't) compromised by the LIBs, right up to the PMO, to be used as a re-election tool in May 2019.

Messaging reassurance, help &amp; service delivery crucial. Where is it PM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@DeptDefence public input to bush fire crisis response &amp; recovery has been excellent. Their media briefings are reassuring, helpful. On the contrary political spinners PM, DPM &amp; Treasurer have no idea how NOT to see this as an opportunity simply to master their lines. Hopeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Campers at the wonderful @eurobodalla Mystery Bay campsite abandoned their tents with encroaching bush fires. Their emptiness, silence speaks volumes.  https://t.co/nHH5F0so2F<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@savourybanana @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence @emmahusarmp Princes Highway is open. He is busy I understand. His office has full details for Vicky Hoyer in Cobargo whose stock are starving. If he wants to, he can contact her directly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news when I checked in to Mystery Bay last night: community untouched so far by fires. Heavy smoke, ash everywhere. We refreshed bird baths. Carrots, oats, barley &amp; fuel dropped off for neighbour.  https://t.co/7UUW0pHXij<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can’t win ... the 95-y-o  Bermagui bush fire evacuee we’ve been caring for has had to now be moved to W’gong; the air quality is so bad in Canberra he can’t breathe. What a calamity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolduncan @JayneAzzo @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence @needforfeed Tks. @nswdpi says Cobargo can wait its turn. It’ waiting while its stock starve ... or get shipped to Wagga for a special “ fire” sale 13 Jan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickiKyriakakis @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence Twitter is helping although @nswdpi says Cobargo has to wait its turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Honorleee No generators pumping fuel and no fodder drops yet for farmers without diesel to power their trucks to collect feed. It’s far from ok.  https://t.co/9G0jNxCLeG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dr_Camouflage_ @iliasofjohn You have it. My apology. Indeed it was uncalled for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have left an urgent phone message on Constance's electorate office line (Bega) imploring him to get @nswdpi to immediately prioritise Cobargo for fodder drops. Their stock have gone up to six days with no feed. The drought, now bush fires, are killing them, albeit slowly. Horrid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LyndsayFarlow @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence @tegangeorge Yep, excellent update. Have shared with COBARGO peeps (who are out of town with starving stock).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayneAzzo @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence Appreciate this ... he is trying. His (as opposed to Morrison's) leadership in the electorate is recognised but he needs to get fodder drops urgently into Cobargo. It's six days now &amp; stock are slowly dying. This is a horrible crisis for all -- humans &amp; animals (stock, wildlife).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@nswdpi ... where is the urgent fodder drops for stock in Cobargo?  There's no LLS rep there, there's no @eurobodalla council staff on hand &amp; they're six days into having NO feed for their stock. Your urgent assistance to prioritise COBARGO please is appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggacrow @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence You're right: all @DeptDefence doing a fantastic job &amp; have been for months. However they're needed, with an industrial size generator, in Cobargo urgently. The community is desperate for power, however tenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonr @AndrewConstance @DeptDefence Excellent ... there are however issues associated with people having no fuel to drive to centre; no vehicles; no money. Centrelink need to get their act together urgently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Lindt Cafe siege &amp; all the hoo-ha associated with when/if feds step/get invited in, was supposedly a watershed moment in fed/state relations.

<|startoftext|>Cobargo is starving, Australia. They have NO power; NO phone comms; NO feed for their stock; NO generators; NO food. Where the fu*k is @AndrewConstance? Where is the @DeptDefence support? Two fatalities, hundreds evacuated, stock dying &amp; all the PM does is try to shake hands.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So no one at the Cwlth level (including liaison officers embedded in state coord centres) knew anything about the PM's announcement SAT?

<|startoftext|>@LindaFurness3 Twitter isn't a forum to outline it all, but in short ADF can: lead, coordinate across borders/agencies, add aerial capacity (for evacuation, water bombing, re-supply of fodder/food/water), back-fill where appropriate (we've got some extremely tired volunteers). For starters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was Scott Morrison &amp; Angus Campbell (as Lt-Gen) who speedily set up a joint agency task force (Operation Sovereign Borders) in September 2013 just days after LIBs were elected to government.

<|startoftext|>So origins of the Qs at parly presser of #SootyfromMarketing abt the NSW govt underplaying its bushfire challenges appear to be Morrison's staffers actively backgrounding media against NSW govt to ensure PM doesn’t wear the blame for his handling of the fires. via @vanOnselenP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ugo_oh @ringsau Puh-lease ... "khaki doesn't make you infallible". That's such a put down, gratuitous in the extreme. I won't be relying on you for my solutions-based party planning operation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ellecee4291 Trying to get to the bottom of that one ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ugo_oh @ringsau Issue is deploying wide range of ADF assets (human &amp; fixed) beyond current DACC assignments given the severity of this national bush fire crisis.

<|startoftext|>@ugo_oh @Oscar_Vieira_ @perthsteve @twcau Frank, professional firefighter: let's not get in a pissing competition here. It's bad enough between FRNSW &amp; RFSNSW at any time. Now we have a pissing competition between #SootyfromMarketing &amp; the states. Enough already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennyh17 When @lindareynoldswa came out with an endorsement of #SootyfromMarketing being a wonderful leader, I lost it. And she lost me. Bullshit TPs to keep at bay any Dutton threat. How dare they play their internecine LIB politics during a national bush fire crisis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@perthsteve @twcau He's got stars ... generally speaking that means he commands a lot of people, a lot of resources, and has a lot of experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A VERY senior ADF officer tells me the latest asset deployment is way too little, way too late. "The entire government effort has been woeful: 1400 houses destroyed &amp; we did nothing preventative to stop it despite RFS advice re the need for back-burning &amp; capability.

<|startoftext|>"Morrison is utterly unrepentant – he thinks he can talk his way out of anything, so there is no reason to believe that he has any interest in becoming a serious prime minister."  https://t.co/OhsIZoxJdU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He is not just a very naughty boy, either – he has now been revealed as a dangerous incompetent, an opportunist populist combining policy vacuity with a reckless opportunism and a political tin ear." I wonder if that'd be #SootyfromMarketing?  https://t.co/OhsIZoxJdU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those RAAF C-130s we think are waiting, begging to be converted to water bombers, someone who knows this stuff says it's not simple, it's not easy ... but it can be done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We. Will. Never. Forget.    Ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 The biggest numpty was Andrew Peacock, when he was Australia's ambassador to the US. An appalling human being. Kevin Andrews as IMMI minister was another classic numpty: nasty, soulless, nut job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me be clear(er) however: most of my bosses were NOT numpties!  But one or two were numpties, for sure. I can name them if you wish ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It drives me crazy ... knowing numpties in the past I've had to prepare for media engagements, this #SootyfromMarketing is all about nailing his TPs ... names of premiers, names of agencies, numbers of firies ... but no genuine empathy, no sensitivity, no friggin' idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davey0511 @marnieoneill7 Expected something like this would arise ... yes, he's damned because he didn't &amp; he's damned now again because he did. He will never recover from this.  He will never face redemption. His is a lost cause. He will be reminded of this daily for the rest of his life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good point ... we have had planes in Australia, on the ground, cleared to fly now, with crews trained, awaiting conversion to water bombers. But no ... #SootyfromMarketing cdn't have given a continental.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"You can't just hustle up (water bomber) planes from overseas," says #SoottyfromMarketing. So why the fu*k have you waited so long to act?  Not only are there accreditation issues -- the planes won't be available at the earliest for another week-fortnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilkoooo @ScottMorrisonMP I was hopeful ... but ...<|endoftext|>

It'll take a week for these extra water bombers to land, have them cleared to fly, have their crews accredited, be ready to tackle this national bush fire disaster. Yep, keep that $500m wasted on the Australian War Memorial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whenever there was a sniff, a hint of an asylum seeker surge, the LIBs under Morrison as IMMI minister deployed assets from across the ADF ... within minutes of the intell landing on their desks. When it comes to us however ... fu*k 'em ... let 'em burn. I'm on holiday in Hawaii.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting, waiting, waiting for #SootyfromMarketing to address a re-think on climate policy ... this presser is all reactive. None of it is strategic, forward thinking, progressive. What a regressive, uninspiring numpty you are @ScottMorrisonMP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMolan Well bloody Allen would say that given his old man tried mansplaining a woman who knew you &amp; your LIB leader are a waste of time &amp; space.

<|startoftext|>When thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of Morrison's 'Quiet Australians' are unemployed because bush fires have destroyed their livelihoods, let's see how long it takes the LIBs to raise the Newstart allowance. Maybe then we'll have a cohort of "deserving poor" ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ldp_smith @abcnews On point one, inference I drew from the Q was that serving commissioners didn't always have the muscle to get their requests over the line, but when others (eg. former commisssioners etc) spoke up, it strengthened the point.

<|startoftext|>@EVERALDATLARGE @SwannyQLD Not/never gonna happen under #SootyfromMarketing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews has been indispensable in recent days as national bushfire crisis has engulfed the NSW south coast.

<|startoftext|>Hey #SootyfromMarkerting, wot say: "The mightiest king on the proudest throne is still obliged to sit on his own arse. The PM is nothing special &amp; down to the lowliest in this egalitarian country, the PM is our servant, not our boss."  via John.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Australia .. when this numpty #SootyfromMarketing Marketing shows up in your community, you have permission to model your response on Cobargo's as seen on this British news report excerpt. Cobargo rocks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This precis from @hughriminton is spot on ... I listened live to his analysis while driving through fire-ravaged paddocks &amp; homes on the NSW south coast. Never a truer word spoken Hugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A mate down the south coast says a dairy farmer neighbour learned from his herd that trouble was on the way on new year's eve: the cows wdn't leave the dairy after their morning milking. They knew the shit was getting serious. How intuitive those beasts were!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You all do realise this mass evacuation underway during the bushfire crisis is something hundreds of thousands of people endure daily overseas ... without first world challenges such as cars, petrol, mobiles, internet, pet food &amp; evacuation centres. Walk. In. Their. Shoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a list of things #SootyfromMarketing would rather do than confront the bushfire disasters as a national crisis. Have I missed anything?  https://t.co/6G1DOTKSFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 They announced they'd "hired” a vessel. Why? We have two large landing helicopter decks that could evacuate thousands of people. Why aren't we deploying them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A contrast in "styles": at the recent NZ volcano disaster, NZDF was forward leaning, included as a part of the whole-of-govt approach within 24hrs. National Australian bushfire crisis -- the ADF stages its first press conf Jan 1. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry .. 2004 tsunami.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You all remember Sweden's foreign minister Laila Freivalds was sacked after the 2006 tsunami? Almost 600 Swedes died. She was MIA at start of the crisis, shrugged it off &amp; never overcame the public's perception as an incapable &amp; empathy-bypassed person.  https://t.co/OG2gbstX7R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @AndrewConstance isn't invited along to Cobargo when #SootyfromMarketing drops in -- a major oversight -- &amp; he tells the world the Cobargo locals' "welcome" was something the PM deserved. The incompetence of PMO/PMPO staff is gob-smacking. They're not even reserve grade level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SootyfromMarketing prosecutes his position on the national bushfire crisis as one of an "acquittal" or audit of federal contributions. "Mine's bigger than yours-ism" he boasts to the states. He will not go anywhere near climate change policy let alone a national strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wikidribble I might have a block for you after the weekend ... it's looking decidedly unfriendly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The feds don't get the urgency of this national bushfire crisis. @D_LittleproudMP spent the majority of his @cvanextel i/v on @RadioNational focusing on state responsibilities, as if listeners were keeping score. We don't care who delivers services; where's the longterm strategy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has it ever occurred to you #SootyfromMarketing with his LIB government likes spending our money ... but rarely on us?  https://t.co/C9L2ixa4z3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 5am departure from Mystery Bay to seek refuge in #CBR was done with heavy heart; a neighbour has a water tanker which will help him defend his large property, but if the conditions as forecast eventuate, I don't know that our little community will survive. Be safe peoples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blowback from Cobargo -- according to one of NSW south coast's least popular state (LIB) politicians (Andrew Constance) was what #SootyfromMarketing deserved -- will carry through every local community the PM visits.  His advisers would be best to send him back to Hawaii.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new moniker is #SootyfromMarketing -- a more out of touch, disconnected, uninterested, insensitive, uncaring politician you could not find anywhere in Australia. He has no strategy, no vision, no friggin' idea. His advisers are equally as appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d tell him to fu*k right off if given half the chance. But I can’t; gotta house to protect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big (belated) shout out &amp; thanks to @SimonLauder @abcnews team at Bega doing phenomenal job day ‘n night with bushfire coverage, updates, advice. Truly impressive broadcasting in context of a national broadcaster too many seek to defund or neuter. In rural communities, they rock!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eXcretaDeBull So far so good but the next few days are gonna be shockers they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No fire damage to Mystery Bay but we remain vigilant &amp; concerned. The community is split beteeen those continuing to use Narooma evac centres in the absence of phone/power connectivity &amp; those staying put; no tension, just diff strategies. #NaroomaGolfClub staff so so supportive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s what’s appropriate: Narooma Golf Club opened its doors for “evacuees” where we’ve been welcomed all day, without power. They’ve cancelled the fireworks, the bands, the NYE dinner so we have somewhere safe. Woolworths has donated foodstuffs. That’s rural community spirit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilvesterSJ What part of symbolism was missed?  The $$$ is secondary. It’s entirely inappropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonycusack Oh I get it! I’ve grown to love Australia and Australians since migrating here 50 years ago. We all have our idiosyncracies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindaJaneWhit @bluebowerbird Guess online donations don‘t have enough bang in the buck ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coralreef77 Yes, thus far. However very smokey, dark. Dunno about Mystery Bay; evacuated there around 10am. Waiting for news on when I can return...hopefully to our home. Who knows ...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebowerbird Tough sell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamgear @AttardMon About 100 people have been evacuated there from Cobargo. They’re at the beach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisdavies @AttardMon Surely you’re not serious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I wait in Narooma to learn what has happened to my community of Mystery Bay as the east coast flames, I wonder what part of SYD’s  fireworks symbolism is ok. Does no one in charge not see how inappropriate this display of fire power/waste if $$$ is to those of us in bushfires?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So #ScottyfromMarketing isn't gonna allow social media to set policy. Sure. But if it wasn't for SM, he'd still be sunning himself in Hawaii, hiding from the disaster over which he is presiding. Has this man got a clue? Any clue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simon works for big tobacco. Simon claims to want a "smoke free" world (WTF is that?). Simon believes vaping is OK. Simon thinks parents should pay to use a toilet in a servo. Simon is a wanker. Don't be like Simon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is so inadequate.  A leave entitlement/payment has been in place as long as I was in the federal APS (30+ yrs, now retired).

<|startoftext|>3/3 Frost now knows the court is preparing to declare he committed an illegality re “characterisation of the corflutes”. Morrison's reaction: not surprised, it was a smear job.  https://t.co/p8c9nA2TIS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/3 "And it has made a finding that the person responsible for that, Mr Frost ... (be) given ... an opportunity to make submissions as to why he shouldn’t be referred to the minister, which could potentially lead to prosecution."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FedCourt recommends pursuing frmr Vic LIB director Simon Frost over the deceptive Liu/Frydenberg corflutes. Litigants' lawyer Michael Bradley said: "The court has found the use of these corflutes (was) misleading and deceptive, in contravention of the Electoral Act." 1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 The FedCourt went on re the Liu/Frydenberg corflutes: "Secondly (my edit: the corflutes properly read implied) there was an official instruction of the Australian Electoral Commission that electors must cast their votes as indicated."  https://t.co/p8c9nA2TIS via @GuardianAus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't get much sleazier than this from the LIBs: "“In our (FedCourt) view, the corflutes are properly read, not as encouragement to vote 1 Liberal, but as a statement first, that to vote correctly (that is validly), one must vote 1 Liberal." cont'd 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trevor_cogger @joshgnosis Why is is it unacceptable if #Scomomustgo gets asked about NY during a press conference (whatever the purpose of said presser)?

<|startoftext|>But @maanitruu, did you mean "publicly" (and not "publically" [sic])?  Extra plumbing contract keeps Scotty in Hawaii.  https://t.co/pVLXkewJP6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonywalker1 Quite the contrary, though it was largely helping AU media get to NYC &amp; elsewhere in the US. I helped many Oz journos, both travelling &amp; US-based, on 9/11 &amp; beyond. Sadly we could not insert media onto Qantas/Hawaii arrangements. (USG wdn't allow uplift on its aircraft.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. The USG flew Howard and his party (of about 15) from Washington DC to Honolulu, from whence he departed for Sydney. It took us ≈18hrs to put those complex arrangements together. Contrast that with #Scomomustgo who took 60hrs to book a commercial flight home. Sixty hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the 9/11 terrorists struck the US in 2001, all commercial/civilian planes were grounded there. It took hard work, arm twisting &amp; eyeballing to convince US authorities to allow us to land a Qantas jumbo in Hawaii to get then-PM John Howard home from his US visit. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KieranPender @MarekRivers @LaLegale @IzzyFolau @ANU_Law @JoshBBornstein @KateHumanRights @Adrienne_Stone1 @APS_Commission @joydeephor One of your examples has absolutely nothing to do with free speech; it has everything to do with workplace behaviour, standards, ethics. Just based on this tweet, I'd recommend anyone remotely considering attending, re-consider. You obviously have not read the judgment; read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very interesting: every question that got up at the #Scomomustgo presser at NSW RFS earlier today was from a woman journalist; not a single male voice was heard. Just an observation; nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an appalling, duplicitous bastard: hiding behind his wife &amp; kids' expectations of a holiday in Hawaii after a "difficult year" to justify his disappearance overseas. #Scomomustgo is no leader; he's a loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This dolt #Scomomustgo just doesn't get it. We don't want nor need your "deep respect &amp; sympathy"; that's a given (one would hope) you'd offer that to the grieving families, homeless fire victims et al. It's your leadership, reassurance &amp; vision we were expecting, Hawaii or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There were some lessons learned this week," says #Scomomustgo. Too bloody right -- one of them surely is the lesson everyone who voted LIBs has learned: vote for a mug, you get a mug; unquestionably not a leader. This fella is fit to run my local farnarkling club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It'd time to be kind to each other," says the MIA #Scomomustgo. What a total waste of time he is. But "it's not the time to talk about climate change" ... oh no, not just now.  Straight out of the NRA playbook. PS. You're not leading this nation, mate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tony_chatham @phbarratt @MikeCarlton01 @MichaelPascoe01 The 9/11 'extraction' was negotiated over many hours with many caveats. The key one was that no other PAX would be allowed on board the Qantas jumbo (for about 15 officials/Howard). The plane could only land/depart in/from Hawaii. The USG flew the Oz party from DC. (I was there.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkylarksRising Quite possibly; my postcard from him with details hasn't arrived yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is air quality millions living in our region endure on a 24/7 basis. We're now finding out what it's like &amp; it ain't pretty, is it? Be prepared for this to continue for quite some time now ... those are massive fires up &amp; down the east coast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flickafaida @myofoz Don't expect too much: it's the silly season; the starting line-up is on holidays largely, so it'll be reserve grade reporting; the media caravan will have moved on by then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ian333 This is an extraordinary natural disaster with widespread &amp; long-term consequences.

<|startoftext|>Lucky PM: no haze, no fire, no coughing, no acrid smoke ... just a beach, ocean, mountains, the missus (on her device), the life. Remember, he told us: it's not easy getting a flight back to Australia. He's bloody not trying hard enough.  https://t.co/OTpp56wS30<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I don't hold a hose, mate, and I don't sit in a control room," Morrison told 2GB. No PM: no one would want you within coo-ee of a hose. Just be a bloody leader for &amp; with Australians in their time of serious need!  https://t.co/zJkRFJRYd9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ViscountBrooky You clearly miss the symbolism of his holidaying while Australia burns. Don't deny him/his family a holiday together, but as PM, now is NOT the time.

<|startoftext|>@Donsvess You mustn't understand how the bureaucracy works with ministers' offices/staff. This sort of hit job by Taylor on Moore would never (repeat, NEVER) be initiated by the public service; this was pure politics. Think you might have to let Taylor own this one 110%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markedw @AndrewAndy63 @nswpolice Mate ...wow or no wow, take your concerns elsewhere (especially if you have information about Scott Morrison's mentor, Brian Houston), such as to the police.

<|startoftext|>@Markedw @AndrewAndy63 You're the last person to be piping up -- as a pastor in a community church, the very places Frank Houston is alleged to have sexually abused some of his victims. Maybe refer your concerns to the @nswpolice currently investigating fellow pastor Brian Houston.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MettaBhavana1 Sheesh. OK ... is a woman!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or put another way ... isn't it a basic tenet of fact-checking one's sources the Daily Terror's journo would've checked City of Sydney's report (with council) to verify what he or she had been given? (Terror journo was a woman. My mistake.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“In the meantime the corrosion of public trust will continue. The Daily Tele is rightly furious at being misled.” The Terror is on the drip, like all NewsCorpse titles.

<|startoftext|>It's something both sides of politics (which is not an excuse ... far from it) exercise with abandon. This current mob has taken it to Olympic proportions.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewAndy63 @Markedw You are the last person to be excusing the repugnant Brian Houston's behaviour (seeking to allegedly cover-up his father's reported sexual abuse of young boys).

<|startoftext|>@Markedw The repugnant Brian Houston has been acknowledged as Morrison's "mentor" by the PM himself, &amp; so described countless times as such in the media/elsewhere.

<|startoftext|>@TanyaLevin @nswpolice Have read that too, but not sure to whom confessions were made (other than family/church hierarchy), or what (if any) formal reports to police/prosecution authorities were made.

<|startoftext|>@MWhalan On the contrary: if the LIBs in Canada are smart, they will not only work with the NDP, they'll bring them formally into the government with ministerial roles too -- a formal coalition if you will!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Frank Houston, father of creepy Hillsong pop-pastor Brian, confessed to sexually abusing a boy in New Zealand &amp; was removed from the church.

<|startoftext|>@phbarratt @dfat Those of us who knew/worked with him recognised immediately it was a @dfat stitch-up. After all, the internecine fighting over the mission's handling of the issue with US interlocutors was at the core of it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phbarratt @dfat There was no doubt that was Merv's greatest fear: the @dfat team members' intention when they sat him down at the embassy was to do him in. He had no one in the meetings to support him in any way. It was just disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phbarratt As it was, Merv was headed home when @dfat forces of darkness descended on mission. We all know pressure involved in those o/s moves, kids' school changes etc. Typical @dfat would seek to write its own history of this tawdry business. (The open warfare within 1601 didn't help.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBlaxland1 It certainly is/was a complicated story.

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @jamesglenday 2/3 This was gonna be her angle: the US (hotel industry?) was snubbing John Howard, or the Australian Embassy had fallen asleep at the wheel &amp; had failed to get Aussie flags hoisted atop the hotel!

<|startoftext|>@MikeCarlton01 @jamesglenday 1/3 Then there was the time a young go-getter woman TV reporter (now a major metrop newsreader) early 2000s in DC demanded to know why the Australian flag wasn't atop the Willard Hotel's rooftop flagpole during Howard visit (not 9/11).

<|startoftext|>Nonetheless @UK_CAA, @SimonCalder you cannot let BA get away with this appalling debacle mishandling thousands of customers' flights. This is an airline in terminal decline. Do. Not. Ever. Fly. British. Airways.  Ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So after extensive toing-froing with @British_Airways, including their blaming @Qantas for failing to sell them seats - "It was only announced today (28/8) we can now rebook our customers onto Qantas" wrote 'Linda' - I am back onto my original dates, with @Qantas &amp; a diff route.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TelButcher @SimonCalder @British_Airways It was -- that's my point! I specifically canvassed BA's actions around alternate flights on other airlines (eg Qantas) but was told this was not their obligation &amp; I could basically go jump. Absolute right royal bastards @British_Airways. Now ask me how I really feel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C'mon Richard: Kilimanjaro, New Zealand &amp; State Dept alumni soirees are walks in the park compared to this sh*tfest being delivered in five tonne bain maries by @British_Airways. @UK_CAA needs to act in passengers' interests, urgently. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I asked BA for a flight on, for example, Qantas, they said they weren't obliged to canvass alternate flights/airlines. The deception is costing me more than a thousand quid, lost time/productivity, &amp; forcing additional labour costs to address issues unexpectedly arising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmgstephenson needs to know how urgently @UK_CAA  must act &amp; seek immediate compliance from  @British_Airways to adhere to EU law. I have been deceived by their staff to accept an alternate BA flight a week later than that booked. They lied to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonCalder Thanks for your fine reporting. I can assure you @British_Airways quite deceivingly told me they were NOT required to canvass alternate flights/airlines once they'd cancelled my flight, &amp; forced me to accept a BA flight a week later. I am disgusted with their misconduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This deception is costing me more than a thousand quid, lost time/lost productivity, &amp; forcing additional labour costs to address issues unexpectedly arising as a consequence of this appalling corporate misconduct. @UK_CAA needs to act in passengers' interests, urgently. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@UK_CAA needs to act urgently &amp; seek immediate compliance from @British_Airways to adhere to the law. I have been deceived by their staff to accept an alternate BA flight a week later than that booked. They lied to me when I asked them for a flight on, for example, Qantas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They know that it is BA, not me, who is obliged to book and pay for the accommodation. They also know they are not permitted to impose a maximum rate for PAX who find their own hotels. @British_Airways is an absolute disaster of an airline. Never. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why has @British_Airways still not confirmed for PAX forced into accepting the re-booking option, and who now need extended accommodation as a result, that their costs will be reimbursed by BA (as they are so obliged)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I specifically asked why I had to wait a week for two seats when I knew there were seats available, for example, with Qantas. BA Newcastle call centre staffer said he was not required to check, let alone assign me seats on another airline. That is clearly in breach of the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@British_Airways' Newcastle didn't offer me alternate travel under comparable conditions at the earliest opportunity including flights with other airlines when I finally got through, after 48hrs' phoning, queuing over the weekend.  https://t.co/OTr6IYhSPZ ping @UK_CAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonCalder Their handling &amp; mismanagement of this issue is an unmitigated disaster. Not since 1811 when the luddites struck have I encountered such incompetence. (Yes, I am an old man!) It’s gonna cost me a thousand quid or more; they’ve gone MIA responding to me. How are they in business?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrogsGamut In any case Bernard was the lawyer assigned to my mate Witness K when he went to the IG.

<|startoftext|>Powering Forward's initial spend of $12M was a waste, especially as it ran through parts of the year when Australia was at the beach, not focused on bullshit government advertising. Total spend was actually $30M with little to no evidence found by the ANAO of its effectiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It'll cost at least a thousand quid to re-schedule my original travel plans b/c they can't manage their pilots' pay, &amp; it seems they're now hiding behind an EU reg which says as long as they've notified me within 14 days of my original travel, they're home free. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 24hrs since @British_Airways' contacted me to say "Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused...we (will) take a look at this for you", they continue their radio silence.  Can you believe the gall of this company? They've fu*ked me over big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The greatest indictment is Angus Taylor's $12M extravagance Powering Forward, a campaign about which ANAO found "evaluations called into doubt the campaign’s effectiveness, (but) Environment continued" it nonetheless. Who ordered the campaign continue, minister? You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In these circumstances, there would be merit in the Parliament and Australian Government revisiting the (campaign advertising) framework," ANAO adds. In other words, the LIBs over 2015-19 have been major rorters of public funds, using the money as their advertising piggy-bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The persistence of debate over the use of public resources for certain government campaigns indicates the framework has not achieved its primary purpose of building confidence &amp; is therefore ineffective in respect to this outcome," says ANAO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci Yeah buddy ... you played your part getting him there. Proud?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mackaysuzie @phbarratt So if @janeenorman was told in a press release the world was flat &amp; subsequently reported that as fact, she’d believe she’d done her job b/c the presser said so! How lazy, how lazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The appalling customer service is beyond disgraceful; it's disrespectful &amp; assures them I will never fly BA ever again, although they must make alternative arrangements for my flight. Manage My Booking won’t allow me to re-book. A complete disaster of an airline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@British_Airways It has been 18hrs since BA cancelled my flight &amp; d'ya think they give a tinker's cuss? No response to these overtures, no response to DMs. Didn't they have a contingency plan to bring in extra staff for the huge spike in calls after their pilots' strike messages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@British_Airways has been unable since 6am today to answer my call since they cancelled my flight. The appalling customer service is a disgrace.

<|startoftext|>@Crankymack52 "That peron's" so-called "analysis" in fact started under the then-Gillard/Rudd governments; it had nothing whatsoever to do with the current minister (or even his predecessor, the current PM). Facts please, not assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alecwsewell The difference is in how this manifests itself in one's approach to the workplace &amp; the extent it influences one's ethical &amp; professional behaviours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianSmedley "Hunted down"? Please. When one leaves one's Twitter account open on the desktop for one's colleagues to see in clear day, the game's up. The handle's reputation was already established in the comms team's consciousness. Staff  didn't like being dumped on; worse by a colleague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Azdrubal6 That is the point: her tweeted "views impinged upon the ethical &amp; impartial discharge of her duties ... an issue sufficient to challenge her job tenure". You nailed it in one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelaNewell_ @Qld_Mythbuster Anonymity is in the eye of the beholder (&amp; the anonymous). The HC didn't find anonymity was a shelter for the appellant; nor did I. The justices' judgment is quite unambiguous on this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gld301218 Your managerial skills were obviously far superior; there was a method and an objective in mine from which all of my staff benefited, over time. Twitter exchanges with accounts I didn't know was part of the risk management employed in our SM strategy .. much like this one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen_J_Grey The pace of (digital) change will often disrupt at an uncomfortable speed. You may well be proven prescient (and right).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenParish1 @LaLegale No, never.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenParish1 @LaLegale What "demos"? The tweet referenced attending "several events". No, I wouldn't have been fired, per se, but there might have been consideration the spokesman be transferred into a lower (media) profile role if there was a concern he couldn't perform his duties fully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreoPope @ScorpioGCoast The "liking" of a SM post is a keyboard stroke too far, in my opinion. I was decidedly uncomfortable when I saw that reference (was it PM&amp;C?) to an agency's SM policy. But the principle here is about being ethical, professional &amp; unbiased in the delivery of public service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janer98 Wrong, wrong. They certainly have no right to broadcast their private/personal views when they openly criticise their colleagues' performance, let alone the government, whom they serve, &amp; its policies. If a PS cannot perform ethically, go; go swiftly, in fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rrogerramjet Dunno how to say this but (a) I am on a permanent holiday (have been since retirement); &amp; (b) no public servants should be excluded from the workplace because of their personal/private beliefs. Personal/private are the key adjectives here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. (I've kept my head down on this one, for the most part, for six years. It was time to provide some context.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScorpioGCoast No, not at all. I attended several events in a private capacity, using discretion, while at IMMI, the vibe of which was clearly not flavour of the department/government-of-the-day. I didn't tweet about it; I didn't use a loud hailer to announce my presence. It can be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parsect What tosh. You have no idea what I said either within the department, let alone to the MO. Keyboard warrior with NFI. Blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, would have been much better all round!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftyScumbag Take your incivility elsewhere. Blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricksmedia What's occurring today -- almost six years since I left IMMI -- horrifies me. I have said this on many occasions, publicly, here &amp; abroad. Don't instance today's horrors in the context of the sacked public servant; totally different circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricksmedia Well if you think that, keep researching. You clearly live in either la la land, or a land where reality has passed you by. Get real, please. There was (&amp; still is) some excellent work done by public servants in the IMMI space. The Pez has tried to militarise it all, but not yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuddenCharmaine Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parsect On what planet do you reside?  If it's only what you're smoking, you gotta share it around more and inhale less.  This is such nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftyScumbag What nonsense. But if it makes you feel better, get it out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF? Never, ever!  I spent three months as Gareth's press sec in 1993 (filling in for his substantive adviser), then went on posting to Bonn. The Pez was never in the MO in my time. I (and he) can assure you of that. From where does this sh*t come?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricksmedia FFS, read what I’ve said. There are countless policies from both sides of politics with which I personally disagreed. As a public servant, you eat sh*t sandwiches from time to time. If you can’t fathom that, go get another job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricksmedia You’re, with respect, pi**ing in the wind. You have no idea the extent of external activity undertaken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtsandCulture @Greens Not at all. I was a member of a political party at times when it was not in government, but that never imposed itself onto my job. It’s about your public pronouncements critical of policy, operations, delivery where the danger lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricksmedia The “many” were both inside &amp; outside the APS. When confronted with the cold hard reality her pseudonym was unmasked, she denied it was her handle. There were no “inconvenient truths”; it was stream of consciousness nonsense, frankly. It was nonetheless counter-productive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thompson07671 Here, have some pasta.  You need a fix with that sort of uncivil discourse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebrewerchef1 No, my staff had certain obligations. They were not met on all occasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsRebeccaRobins @abcnews Nice try but it ain't about me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>is satisfying, for me, because it brings to conclusion an important principle of public service impartiality &amp; independence. That it has come at significant personal cost is however quite sad: we are all human beings with hearts &amp; minds for whom hurt is never pleasant. I get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't post her tweets; I didn't seek to litigate in the Federal Court to overturn the decision to terminate her employment; I didn't lodge a Comcare claim for compensation; I didn't appeal to the AAT. That this matter has finally been resolved in the High Court today ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>get out of the department, or get out of the APS altogether. Regrettably there are many who neither know me, &amp; who clearly don't care about getting to know me (that's fine) but who have taken a position that blames me for the outcomes now faced by the sacked public servant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because one believes strongly in a policy direction doesn't excuse a public servant from obligations to the APS' code of conduct, as well as the department's own social media policy. If one doesn't support the policy to the point a 100% professional commitment is possible...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>many in fact did know, &amp; this reflected very poorly on the team, the department &amp; the wider public service.

<|startoftext|>Thank goodness @abcnews tolerates this microscopic analysis of its news-making &amp; news-manipulating processes.

<|startoftext|>@DancingDanB There are countless serving &amp; frmr IMMI staff -- good, hard-working, smart, innovative public servants -- horrified at how badly their work is now valued; how corrupted the processes have become under political diktat. The long-term damage is frankly unfathomable at this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an interesting &amp; potentially prescient theory! Whatever Dutton's/Pez' motivation is, we all know it is pissing off tens of thousands of applicants ... Australia's name is being dragged into deeper &amp; deeper mud in so many sad ways. Thanks Peter Dutton, thanks Mike Pezzullo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVofCarringbush Wouldn't be surprised. There are plenty of providers out there hungry for government contracts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it gets worse: Dutton &amp; the Pez want to privatise IMMI’s visa system &amp; its visa processing. WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are 24,000 regional employment (RSMS) visa applications while the employer nomination scheme has 30,000 visa applications under processing. When the visa system is in trouble, spivs and people smugglers take advantage of the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts in demography &amp; economics all agree this will take us towards failed immigration policies of parts of Europe &amp; Middle East. The permanent employer sponsored visa backlog is also at an all-time high. Don't believe the BS from David Coleman claiming he's helping employers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At second stage, it’s 156,000 applications awaiting a decision, while 35,000 further applicants are ready but haven’t formally entered the process. For the first time in our history, government policy is to reduce permanent migration &amp; increase temporary migration. Madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A visitor’s visa doesn’t allow the spouse to work, to remain permanently in-country, nor offer Medicare or similar support. The spouse first stage visa program has 82,000 applications in the pipeline – unheard of in the once well-regarded IMMI visa program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t be surprised if someone initiates a class action to force the government to process these spouse visas within a reasonable time. The waiting time is two years for a first stage spouse application, so married couples cannot plan their futures together without permanent visa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn’t make us safer – which is their “intent” – but instead simply makes people frustrated &amp; angry. Why not also check out the partner visa program. Dutton has restricted places for spouses which is contrary to the intent of parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bridging visa backlog results from poor policy, staff shortages &amp; incredibly low staff morale. Dutton &amp; the Pez’ strategy – to delay granting permanent residence &amp; citizenship – is ill-informed and counter-productive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@KKeneally THREAD. Asylum seeker-arrivals by plane are only tip of the iceberg. While you're at it, check out near 230,000 bridging visa backlog. Or the 60,000 IMMI visa cases at the AAT of which almost 20,000 are for asylum. It’s a scandalous state of affairs say the experts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I cannot fathom that: (a) these shootings continue day after day after day; (b) their relevance to the gun ownership debate seemingly diminishes as the body count rises; and (c) the world's media barely blinks when the news wire fires up with the latest American gun tragedy.<|endoftext|>

I know; I've been associated with a family member who went through it (at a public hospital).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZZiillaa The freeze on Medicare services certainly did occur under the LIBs 2016-today. It's their way of, by stealth, slowly but surely diminishing the important contribution public health makes to healthier communities. Nonetheless, Medicare must always be properly funded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top ad. It's a community service announcement I reckon! Would love to see an Australian version. One day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZZiillaa The 2016 Medicare message was entirely accurate (see Greg Hunt's own words to introduce a US-style health insurance co-pay system where insurers -- not doctors -- have the final say on treatment); its delivery was sneaky, for sure -- though effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mnxmoosi @mealslaw In 1996-97 when LIBs extended $$ accommodation bonds from aged care hostels to nursing homes (because no government was prepared to spend $5B on bricks/mortar), there was a massive outpouring of greed (not grief) from those seeking to inherit their parents' family home (sale).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZZiillaa How many times did Labor have to say during the campaign the report was fake, there was no such policy under consideration -- let alone on the books -- for you to believe it?

<|startoftext|>Well, I'll be!  I couldn't see any authorisation in the images posted, but you're on top of it.  Who then is responsible for protecting the AEC branding?  In any event highly impressed your SM crew is on the Twitter so assiduously. Bravo Phil Diak &amp; his team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who does have the power?  There is neither authorisation nor details of the people/person responsible for these signs.  They're clearly branded as @AusElectoralCom incl colour palette, meant to deceive. They're illegal without authorising name/contact for starters, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LyleShelton You’re an absolute fuque knuckle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanbadham Was fuck knuckle one of them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @AusElectoralCom ... wot say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaundyCraigMP Craig, Craig. ... let it go. You’re no longer standing. And anyway, you surely recognise the principle at play here: how can a tax refund be justified when no tax was paid by the recipient of our largesse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmatthewswood @barriecassidy @abcnews @karina_carv Thanks for pinging @karina_carv into the conversation; she was a real pro "handling" a veteran journo like @barriecassidy in a moment of, as you say, raw emotion. #bringithomeforbob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful to see UK Labour-leader-in-waiting @tom_watson paying tribute to Bob Hawke's leadership and inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sorry @barriecassidy didn't get to visit Bob Hawke one last time, but as @abcnews presenter said to a visibly emotional Barrie in their live cross, "don't be too hard on yourself". I second the motion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMorrisonMP Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deemadigan That's what I wanted to say, and more. So, "what she said" will work in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You bastard. You have no heart, let alone any fu**ing idea. I hope you get absolutely smashed in SAT's federal election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How very sad #BobHawke has died. He stayed as long as he could ... almost long enough to witness a Labor victory this weekend. Let's do this for Bill, as well as in honour of Bob &amp; Gough!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is wonderful wisdom, in two minutes: non-racist as opposed to anti-racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember Dutton/Morrison's use of Manus/Nauru asylum seekers and/or refugees' alleged criminal histories when PM/Dutton claimed murderers, pedos &amp; potential terrorists cdn't be transferred to Australia for medical treatment? They failed to substantiate those claims then or since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really puts to a lie either of the propositions the LIBs have forever argued are what differentiate them from LAB, towit: "we will decide" -- they certainly didn't decide NOT to accept murderers in this case -- &amp; "keeping the borders safe": ya reckon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "swapping" of challenging asylum/refugee cases among nations is not unheard of; we've done it for years, often among the dozen or so first world countries with refugee settlement programs. However this sort of "swapping" of known murderers is unique.  https://t.co/8gV4fIu38z<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who initiated @nswpolice AsstComm Walton's presser beamed live on FB today?  He was appalling; worse, undermined by his own staff poorly briefing him. Did Commish Mick Fuller approve this?  Or some numpty feeding a tabloid TV appetite? Shocker.  https://t.co/j7AHFeYXxU #nswpolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some context: AssistCmsnr Walton is a highly protected species at @nswpolice. He's commish Mick Fuller's fave for DepCommish, as well as being close to a few other execs (sworn &amp; unsworn)  He's hopeless at media, public comms &amp; based on this FB broadcast, at social too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure this is working Assistant Commissioner Walton; there is a degree of passive aggressiveness in the whole shtick we're seeing on this side of the camera lens (and hearing in the tone of voice).

<|startoftext|>@BrigadierSlog @peartonjohnson But @billshortenmp did say on @QandA in answer to specific Q about Newstart that he wouldn't be reviewing the levels of support b/c he wanted to see a cut.

<|startoftext|>@BevanShields might also consider deleting his tweet about the PM being “smashed” with an egg. He was not. Actuality shows an egg rolling over his head. Not good, but just the facts please; enuff hyperbole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @BevanShields tweeted at me: “I feel sorry for you. What a sad human being you are and a sad life you have. Good luck with it all.”, it was liked by @ljayes.  Why?

<|startoftext|>Hey 'Team Australia': enough of the #Eggwars. This is not cool. Fortunately we are a generally tolerant nation, sensible about guns &amp; weaponary; rule of law prevails.

<|startoftext|>More than 600,000 of us have voted already &amp; I suspect few of those were for Morrison; his "performance" tonight on @abc730 was a disaster. It's all bla-bla-bla. He's a bloody waste of oxygen, seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bless her, @leighsales tried but Morrison is a bully, a blatherer &amp; a bullshitter. The big difference is @billshortenmp is about people; the other bloke is about money, money, money. Is anyone's vote gonna be influenced by @abc730 tonight?  I doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetowncrier @SkyNewsAust So if it's not in any way, significant or otherwise, a "right-wing TV backlash" via the influence of, among others, @slpng_giants_oz &amp; biznezes which choose not to advertise/support SKY &amp;/or Your Money, was it just a crap concept in the first place?

<|startoftext|>@Mcali4 You're probably right but when he was listing his assets in an attempt to secure a pensioner discount card, its value was recorded as $60,000 ... that's my story and I'm sticking to it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The closing shot of this bit was shot by a drone at 200m, the $$60,000 yacht powering at 15 knots near the bridge over troubled waters ... what a total crock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So VERY impressive @billshortenmp @Shorten_Suite on @abc730 tonight. Seems his prep was superb, paying big dividends in his detailed responses.

<|startoftext|>@RachelQuayle08 @ABCIndigenous @marcuskelson No, I don't speak any Indigenous Australian languages (but do speak other languages including Tok Pisin fluently). That's not the point.

Very shabby treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordofWentworth How does one bring a unicorn back to surplus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCIndigenous @marcuskelson Surely you mean "effecting real political change" (effect - [verb] 1. cause [something] to happen; bring about. -- "the prime minister effected many policy changes").

<|startoftext|>Is the taxpayer, via @abcnews, paying for @Dan_Bourchier to pump up his own tires with sponsored Facebook ads?

<|startoftext|>So true ... it's a rort, whatever political hue rings your bell, and it shouldn't be tolerated.

The two don't stack up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When ministers want to go off the record in these sorts of instances, it's usually to provide better context in order to facilitate an improved understanding. Or it's because their hand is stuck in the cookie jar and they need help extracting it. Which one was it @AngusTaylorMP?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Difference btwn @AusBorderForce, Peter Dutton, Scott Morrison &amp; LIBs when it comes to detainees is they no longer have anyone like Dermot Casey PSM, recognised in '08 for his contribution to the improvement of health &amp; psychological services in Australia’s IMMI detention n'work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2. “When experts such as Rural Fire Service, Primary Industries, Environment and Heritage, &amp;  Local Land Services are all raising concerns, they should not be ignored or dismissed,” @Leanne_Atkinson says.

<|startoftext|>@BevanShields @AntonEnus But mate, no where in your SMH copy is there a direct quote from Morrison supporting your claim “Australia risks tumbling into a recession”. No where.

<|startoftext|>Morrison wdn’t say it on AM; Cormann wdn’t say it on RN Breakfast; there’s no direct quote in @BevanShields’ copy either. Was he verballed? Chris Pyne’s recession reference clearly scared them outta it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heldavidson @RichardTuffin The community can "properly focus on the policy" by asking questions of their MPs &amp; Senators, demanding change, insisting on it.

<|startoftext|>@heldavidson @RichardTuffin The, as you put it, "situation" being far from "appropriate", for me, is about the policy sub-contracting our Refugee Convention obligations to broken arse Pacific warehousing nations.

<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 As a rule, tipping is the exception in Australia (as it should be). Pay servers a decent wage, you get decent service from them. No need to tip, no need to patronise customers. If service exemplary, tip 'em (but it's not expected). The US tradition exploits workers dreadfully.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@SenWhitehouse is one impressive prosecutor. What a strong presentation on SCOTUS nomination process, outlining how unsuitable Brett Kavanaugh is for this role. The Judge letter is equally forensically torn apart. Cover-ups never last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@JohnCornyn ... what a numpty. He says alcoholism or substance abuse issues, mental health challenges or surviving cancer now give you a "leave pass" from ever being asked questions, ever being held accountable. Serious?  You're a joke.  And a very bad one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@LindseyGrahamSC ignores entirely the stench surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, instead reads us a children's book about SCOTUS nominations and hearings. Do these people even care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@LindseyGrahamSC tries the home-spun folksy approach to what is a very serious matter about sexual assault allegations. He is all that is wrong with big-money politics in the USA. He is all that is the swamp.<|endoftext|>
