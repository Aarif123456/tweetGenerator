<|startoftext|>We're being very careful... sheltering in place... lots of #handwashing...only necessary trips for necessities.  In the vulnerable category and some breathing issues... terrified? Yes.  We have some living to do and won't be sacrificial lambs for "herd immunity" #FauciHero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering out loud: if they decided to amend/change the 2006 law that demanded #PostOffice pension pre-funding of 75 years and reduce that to 30 years, and pushed those funds into current operating expense funding, where would we be?

<|startoftext|>@utbrp Somehow, eerily, the two may be connected.  #SadTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MzYun Forget the people... somebody should have told #SadTrump that it's not the damn flu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriMelber @MSNBC  @maddow @chrislhayes  So the #POTUS is calling off #federal testing on Friday?  Why?  Is it because they committed to pay for all testing.  i.e.Rep Katie #Porter and the #CDC hearing. Makes zero sense...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 @hattieknuff Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I figured out why everyone is losing it over #COVID19 when the same freakout didn't occur for #SARS, or #MERS, or #SWINEFLU - the powers in charge at the time cared about the people, not about their personal image (or wealth).  #EgomaniacInCharge<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Karoli @realDonaldTrump #DT is flanked by folks who look like hostages...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! #DT has found someone who is more unhinged than himself... #Bolton.  America is now closer to being the catalyst for ending life on this planet than ever before.  #Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got a call from a rep of #Enbridge Energy. "Sylvia" gave a very glowing dissertation about how wonderful #EnbridgeEnergy was and what a great boon to the economy the new pipeline would be. She was surprised to hear that I didn't support the new/replacing pipeline project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darn near sacrilegious to demean poor #McGruff in that commercial... IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes #Avenneti did NOT say Stormy was threatened about talking about her Trump affair.  He said yes, she was threatened in response to a general (Mika) question.  He's slick.  https://t.co/7ux7bgZXvr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika @DebraMessing He DID NOT specify why or in what context that threat came... from my viewing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe The threat might be for something other than the #NDA... could have been anytime during their "relationship". IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC who were the last two(2) guests on today's Morning Joe? - they spoke about tribalism and the current political climate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#morning joe guest panelists(authors/writers) this morning had great insights into our revolving/evolving tribalism.  Annan ___?  and _____________ __________?  Your assistance appreciated, #Twitterites.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can hardly wait for the Space Force to be created - if they have a draft the folks with #Bonespurs will automatically go to the head of the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes But it did...  just not the kind of effect the #RW expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...was #Trump outraged when #Tillerson used military transportation back from Africa, seeing as how the #WH claims he was fired last Friday? #Comey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee...I hope #Rex lands softly.  Full severance package?  Good thing all the offshore drilling around our coasts is wide open (except for #MaraLago and FL).  Nice going away present for his retirement funds. #RussiaTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes  For someone who never sets or meets a hard deadline, #Trump suddenly seems obsessed with an investigation end date.  #BlueWave<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So... has anyone heard verification from #KimJungUn or #NK?  They would/should be crowing/bragging about this action.  Sorry my skepticism is showing... Is this just a perfect #Stormy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many times did the the #SK representative speaker congratulate and praise #Trump?  Lots!  Sounds like they were pushed out there with a specific hostage script with unbelievable #WH pressure.  Something just seems wrong...sorry.  @allinwithchris @Lawrence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dasani_01 Too any things smell funny, especially given #POTUS track record on honesty...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always possible that this giant concession by #NK and Kim Jung #Un is a big LIE concocted by #Trump.  What a great negotiating strategy - put words in your enemies' mouth.  Let's put a call in to Kim to verify his conciliatory language...?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think folks who have never experienced an AR15 close up really need to.  The sound and the massive damage is overwhelming to the senses.  I've been close to one outdoors, but not inside.  Gotta be awful and intimidating indoors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes  So is #Gates still in #Mueller's sights as it relates to #Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Mr. #President, I'm going to pray...for your removal from office.  If you want to resign before the #indictments, that's okay too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps a short #military #parade featuring the various mass murderers brandishing AR-15s with the parade grand marshall Wayne #LaPierre ??? Seems appropriate, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This American #carnage needs to stop... and it stops right here, right now!"  (Or whenever we can get around to it).  Thanks Mr. #Trump...thanks for nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My #Trump theory on why there is so much apathy instead of #outrage: stable #gas prices.  If prices push up into the low $3s per gallon ppl will examine ALL POTUS behavior.  Immediate pocketbook impact! @chrislhayes @maddow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianklaas @MWJ1231 For someone who has spent recklessly and then declared multiple bankruptcies, this should come as no surprise - it's what he's good at.

<|startoftext|>#Donald #Trump is "brilliant".  (This guy is a crazy, scary bastard)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last thing we need to hear/see is #Trump speaking at a #PRAYER BREAKFAST.  To be honest, I've been praying for an end to his presidency for 12 months, so there's that.  #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chuck #Todd has become unwatchable.  Tries to show his grasp of all things political... he's not as informed, or in touch, as he thinks he is.  It's time to switch your afternoon lineup, #MSNBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So why do you play multiple negative #GOP ads on your news segment #MSNBC ?  #Todd is a regular offender in this category.  The ads really offer bonus support to GOP...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say we organize a giant #parade of our #cyber defense capabilities... as well as our cyber offensive abilities.  A couple of flatbed trucks with cyber experts hunched over laptops and a few large display screens should suffice... #TrumpBrainDead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, I think #SubpoenaTrump is the way to go - let's force the issue.  RT if you have time... please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when "you lie" was screamed out at #Obama #SOTU that was also #treasonous?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is the best...the #best brain, the best words, the best health... And, the best #liar.  So he should fear sitting down with # Mueller if he wants to avoid near immediate #indictment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The word treason is now being thrown around willy nilly with no respect given to what it really implies.  #DT an his family are likely to hear it used against them, and would like to nullify its meaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Businesses and banks in the US are wary of #trump and don't trust him... the markets may now be reflecting that fear...Smash and Grab on #WallStreet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for #DT to approve the release of the expected #DEM memo, but with heavy redactions...it wouldn't surprise me.  #dumpNunes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson @Joy__Hart Do you mean "a" presidency, or "the" presidency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally realized why #Trump is in love/bed with the #Russians...2 reasons:  1.) It's all about the oil (money)  and... 2.)  The country is all #WHITE.  Not sure why we didn't see this coming.  #Rubles to #Dollars exchange rate is inconsequential now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have kids/grandkids in school make sure they take #Russian as a second language.  Also, find out what the dollar-to-#ruble exchange rate is... you'll need it.  #maddow @maddow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThommyPetersen Not something to be flattered about, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary but true that #GOP could recapture the hearts and minds of #americans by standing up to #Trump and bringing his presidency to an end before 2018 midterms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... there will be Blackhawk helicopters patrolling around Minneapolis for #SuperBowl?  Should we trust them?  #Trump and #Nunes say "no"  -  You decide...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree with Frank Figliuzzi on @allinwithchris and the #GOP fake memo giving #Trump cover to back out of a possible #Mueller interview vis-a-vis #russiainvestigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need someone to talk me down from this giant cluster...how can we allow this kind of partisan behavior rule/destroy our justice system?  #GOP is overboard on this "protect the president" effort at the expense of the country's welfare.<|endoftext|>
