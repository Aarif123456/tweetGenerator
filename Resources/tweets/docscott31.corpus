<|startoftext|>Respect for Demba Ba.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhysicsDJ Just giving people a chance to unfollow so I don't have a situation like what I had today, not good for me or the person involved, not good for anybody TBH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhysicsDJ It seems I have to do it every 6 months, it's unfortunate, I really don't like the negative energy it brings but what can you do? I will never understand why people follow someone on social media but then complain when you say something they don't like / agree with .. #dontfollow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevezCable Good man :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look, to be clear, yes I'm a DJ &amp; I will mostly talk about DJ'ing &amp; music but I'm also a human being &amp; I have opinions on politics, social issues, etc.  If you only want the music part please unfollow. I really don't like being told 'stick to dnb' and I don't enjoy the negativity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelukewoz You're on my timeline telling me what I can and can't talk about, someone's smug here and it isn't me, neither am I rich. Simple solution, if you don't like my opinions don't follow me and don't be so arrogant as to tell me to 'stick to dnb'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelukewoz No, but thanks for the advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other news, it's cold AF! 🥶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AkuaReflections I understand the scepticism &amp; under no circumstances should it be mandatory. But when the scientific community comes together to work solely on one project as they have done with a vaccine for Covid it's amazing what they can accomplish. I trust science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaguarWorldwide @wafbinthedark It is, I read that recently, very good article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FemmeRonin I can only imagine, let's hope we are moving in the right direction so these obstacles can be removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FemmeRonin I didn't actually type 'Where are the Women in Drum &amp; Bass?' - it did it when I shared the article (which is a very interesting  and important read) but I agree with it, when you look at techno and house DNB is a joke by comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming soon.  https://t.co/sRgWsnCC4C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntagonistUK Yep, as it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are the Women in Drum &amp; Bass?  https://t.co/6N1heX9XzR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrossOutdnb Go on, i'll bite, how so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would estimate that at least half of the people saying they won't take the vaccine either drink excessively, smoke, take drugs or have a bad  / unhealthy diet, and in some cases all of the previous.  That's kinda weird to me ... 🤔 #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetpeaDnB You're welcome, thanks for sending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fuck Covid Fuck Brexit Fuck Trump Fuck racists  and if you don't like that then fuck you too.  Have a nice day. 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beane_Noodler That would be very disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Thanks for spoiling it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StudioPressure That would be cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redrackem That's a good shout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to whoever is doing this 👏👏👏  But if it's aliens then I, for one, welcome our new alien overlords ...  😉 #monolith   Monolith discovered on Isle of Wight similar to ones found in US and Romania  https://t.co/6AsqGXQ8ko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCDNB BTW kudos to you for being honest and open, too many people only talk about their biggest selling tracks or show pics of their best gigs, when we all know the reality can be quite different. This distortion of reality fucks it up for everyone. ❤️😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gbellseattle @thenewstribune You did your job, the offence stunk the place out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCDNB Status Quo made the same song for decades to keep their 'fans' happy &amp; they fucking suck, make what you want to make, fuck numbers, some of the best tunes I've ever heard have less than 100 plays on Youtube. You're an artist not a stats nerd FFS!  #nohate #keepitreal #underground<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back from playing at Alchemy in London just in time to watch the Seahawks game, fun night if a little chilly 🥶 Great to see some familiar faces again, some old ones that I haven't seen for ages and a new one :) Out to Colin Dale, SP:MC, GQ, Pokes, Breakage &amp; Surgeon. 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackSpectrasoul @PeteSamuelLegon All I can see is a one sided conversation, I muted that person ages ago ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was kind of a rhetorical question but you get my point?   So much pointless hate, anger &amp; fear ...   All that energy could be put to much better use than being so negative, sometimes the world (or rather some of the people in it) can be so depressing 🙁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Infinite love for all underground music and for all those that sacrifice for the love of the underground.  It's so easy to make or play what people supposedly 'want'.  It takes courage to stick with it.  Salute the real. #UndergroundResistance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hadn't even planned to play Aura by Bungle on Soul:R in the mix, but timing meant I could fit it in there as a back up track (I did it live, not in Ableton) and when I heard it back I heard Marcus speaking in the breakdown, spur of the moment decision ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did putting it together. 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not completely a DNB mix, I wanted to use this platform to not only showcase the best of drum and bass but also to show my varied tastes in all aspects of underground electronic music, I’ve also done things on this mix that I have never done before and would never do again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A huge thank you to the DNB world, who when I asked, came through in spades and supplied me with more music than I knew what to do with. I really want this mix to represent the true sound of underground drum and bass and hopefully I have achieved that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Essential Mix airs tonight (Friday) live from midnight GMT on @BBCR1 and catch up @BBCSounds #R1Dance  Thank you for all the positive feedback earlier in the week to the announcement, it really means a lot. 😎✌️❤️   https://t.co/IPUD77r5YE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Benaskren I didn't say you said that, I'm saying it's just as bad. I like you BTW, so no need for name calling 'dumb dumb'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Seahawks are playing like they have a hangover ... #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Benaskren Sure, just lump everyone into the same basket. That's just as bad as saying all trump supporters are racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FieldGulls brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Benaskren What's wrong with being against fascism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brutal ...  #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to score a TD on this possession or its game over., I can’t believe were only down by 10, we’ve been awful today #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the Seahawks were good because Russell was playing out of his mind, now he's come down to Earth the reality is we kinda suck ... #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was ugly ... #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh just fuck off already you fucking loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russell Wilson in hero ball mode already ... 🙁 #SEAvsLAR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And the absolute worst thing about Trump is he brought the worst out in everyone, his supporters, his opposers and he brought the worst out in me, I don't like hating anyone but that's how he made me feel and I don't want to feel like that anymore. Good riddance. #ThankyouAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A racist, bigot, narcissist, sexist, serial liar, sociopath, sadist, con artist, misogynist, selfish, fascist, bully is no longer President of the United States and that makes me happy, it's really that simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's completely wrong to say all Trump supporters are racist, but all racists are Trump supporters. #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't worry about votes and awards, the only thing you need to be concerned with is is this ... Are you happy with what you do? Are you content as a producer, DJ, label owner, event organiser? if it's yes, then you've already won.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The thing about @RishiSunak comments is this. The vast majority of people who are in the arts get into whatever they do for the love of it, not money, its a calling, its within you, music, dance, comedy, acting, film, art.  You just do not walk away from a life's calling. #viable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you and your government 'care deeply' then prove it, don't throw us under the bus. A life without music, film, art, laughter, entertainment is not life, it's just existence.  We are not worker ants or drone bees.  Life has a soul, show us you have one @RishiSunak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's enough internet for me today, have a good day everyone, stay safe and be well. 😎✌️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Edwina_Currie I was being polite because my wife asked me to, I wanted to say much worse, have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Save lives by destroying the economy, utterly destroying parts of it to the point of no return, increasing mental health issues tenfold (at least) ...  There has to be a better option than this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrisDnB So he's faked having Covid (which has killed 200k Americans) for a PR stunt. Unbelievable even by his standards.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you had asked me a month ago of course I would have said no, no to playing at one and I would advise anyone not to attend one.

<|startoftext|>If this government is hell bent on destroying the nightlife industry, I will not only consider playing at illegal parties I'll consider putting them on myself. I haven't worked for 30+ years building a career &amp; a scene to let it all be pissed away for nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@promozo @RishiSunak @HMRCcustomers I know, doing my tax return for 19-20 is going to be fun, not sure how they expect me to pay in Jan' 2021 with my income dropping off a cliff in March 2020 ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck Donald Trump too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if people working in the nightlife industry will get any targeted help, whilst it's been tough for other business', they have at least been able to re-open in some capacity, clubs have been shut since March &amp; will be for another 6 months. @RishiSunak @HMRCcustomers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JubileeDJ It's rough, there are no easy answers, it's just depressing seeing everything go to shit an no one seems to know what to do ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm not just referring to my line of work, it's everything, every week I see major companies announcing record losses, laying off 1000s of workers or going out of business. To me this isn't sustainable, what will be left by the time a vaccine gets here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybrisdnb Every week here in the UK major companies are announcing record losses and laying off 1000s of workers, or simply going out of business. I just don't see how that is sustainable, I don't have the answers, I'm just saying what I'm seeing .. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ratiodnb I'm not, I hear you, but this course of action isn't sustainable ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hybrisdnb Agreed, but we (the world) can't carry on like this until a vaccine is produced, what if it's years? What will be left? I fear that more than the virus itself at the moment ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItoaMusic Agreed, confusion seems to be part of the 'plan' ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjTeeBee Also people get drunk on power, whether its politicians, criminals, ordinary people, whoever. You give people unlimited power they usually end up abusing it, there seems to be a perverted pleasure in telling millions of people what they can &amp; can't do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerumDnb I hear you, don't get me wrong, I know this is real, but it's not the zombie apocalypse. My fear is what if there's no vaccine for 3-4 years, are we going to live like this for that period of time? What will be left? And I'm not just talking about our work, I mean everything ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of me agrees that this virus is dangerous, highly contagious &amp; strict measures must be used to contain and control it. But the other part of me thinks this is overblown, its not as dangerous as we first feared &amp; perpetual lockdowns will wipe out our economy.  #balance #fear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJRigodon I'll sell one of my Ferraris ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SBPMusicGlobal Thank you. 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right I'm off to do something useful, this grass isn't going to cut itself ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not a real doctor BTW so please dont take anything I say as a professional opinion, just the ramblings of a DJ with too much time on his hands. But I have experienced some tough times in the past, in a much better place now &amp; so hopefully can use that experience for some good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokeshi__ Exactly, the not knowing is the killer, there's nothing to aim for ... We are all good thanks, love to you &amp; the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJTamsin @realDonaldTrump I think you're like me, a tweet or 2 a week aimed at the orange buffoon makes you feel better :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>BTW there's no right or wrong, each individual handles their own business their own way, whatever works for you. I know from past experience that for me personally it's better to be open than not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJLevela Doesn't have to be a rant or a rage tweet, just being honest doesn't necessarily mean being negative :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djnikkibeatnik @SBPMusicGlobal You too x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dont keep things bottled up, its good to talk, wether it be 'real' talk or an online post, you're not being an 'attention whore' as some might see it, you're lightening the load, helping with your mental well-being &amp; maybe helping others who might think "yeah I feel that way too"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipAKelly Thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Originukradio Yep! We are social creatures at heart and the social part of our life has been taken away from us, it's difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djpierrephutur Thank you for the wise words, I truly believe we will all be stronger and wiser on the other side of this, it's just difficult right now whilst in the eye of the storm. Also thank you for providing the soundtrack to my youth, much respect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know Im not on my own, as DJs we're all in the same boat with other live acts. But this is more than just my job, its my life, Im 49 years old, had a set of decks since I was 14, been a pro DJ since 89 &amp; an international DJ since 93. Never had more than a month off, I feel lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo to Pioneer for releasing the new CDJ 3000 at a time when no clubs are open and 99% of DJ's around the world are virtually unemployed, bravo ... 🙁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess I better get myself in the studio and try and make some music, it'll probably take me 6-12 months to finish something and by then clubs might be open for me to actually play it out ...  #tryingtobepositive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In March I optimistically thought we might be back in clubs be end of May, in May I resigned myself that summer was gone and we probably wouldn't be back in clubs until Christmas / January.

<|startoftext|>my fave reply - "I go back 65 years. I remember when people punched each other on the nose then went home! We NEVER EVER heard of stabbings and shootings and I live in London!"   HUH?

<|startoftext|>@DJBarelyLegal WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People pointing to Birmingham &amp; equating that all the violent crime in the UK is because of immigration (ie : non white people) as if violent crime never existed before immigration. I think this country has a pretty rich history of violence, way before any immigration took place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krista63231295 @DVATW Funny, I never heard that the Krays "punched each other on the nose then went home!" What a time that must have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW So I'm guessing there was no violent crime in the UK before immigration, none whatsoever?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ronin_Sound Yep! agreed, but it's also good to still have goals :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAMN! That felt SO good to be back on the decks, in front of a live crowd, playing on a proper sound system and being able to feel the music. Thank you. 🙏🙏❤️❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I haven't wore a pair of jeans for 6 months, living that Nike joggers / sweatpants life ... 😜😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep having dreams with DJ's in them, I'm guessing it's because I'm not on the road and not bumping into people, is this happening to other DJ's or is it just me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANDYC_ram Thank you Andy, coming from you that is the ultimate 'essential' compliment. ❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a more positive note, I have an actual gig on Thursday in front of real people (Covid compliant of course) in London. First gig in 6 months, I just checked my bank account &amp; I've been paid, money went into my account, it's too much for me to handle so Im off for a lie down 😍  https://t.co/G61Hg3INFT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rroker Amen dude, hope you and the family are safe and well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a more positive note, I know lists are always subjective but it's still nice, so thanks to Alexis Petridis for including 'Here come the drumz' at number 7 &amp; also a shout out 2 Bad Mice for being number 1 in - The greatest hardcore rave tracks – ranked!   https://t.co/N1fZRehEcK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hansbouffmyhre Great release.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big up @IanWright0 and all racists can fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw Argos was trending and assumed it was going to be about job losses due to Covid but it turns out a bunch of racists got triggered because Argos had the 'nerve' to run an advert with a black family in it.  Sometimes I'm ashamed to be British. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CleveWatkiss i like this a lot. ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlixPerez For real, safe travels to you both. x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On this very day 30 years ago @derrickmayday  changed my life forever with a DJ set that blew my 19 years old mind and installed in me a belief system of always sticking to what you believe in and to play for the future and for that I am forever thankful ❤️  https://t.co/aF8onGEqmU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djjjfrost Say it aint so ... :(    Although I understand where you are coming from, this shit is depressing the longer it goes on with no end in sight ....   nightlife, live music, we're dead last and I don't think they really give a fuck ..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What do you do when you get everything wrong whilst handling a pandemic causing the worst death toll in Europe &amp; the worst recession in the G7? Call your friends at BBC &amp; SKY to run non stop stories scapegoating migrants crossing the channel as a deflection from your failings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trancestorm I wish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zed_Bias I don't even want to get on the scales mate, hope you're good, see you're back at it (gym) hopefully i'll be back at it before September ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This pandemic is not good for my waistline. 😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To be clear, I'm not condoning illegal parties, wouldn't play at one and would advise people not to attend one but it's going to happen more and more the longer this continues. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThysMusic Not condoning it, but it's gonna happen, hope you're good mate 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If clubs are going to be closed until October, probably January &amp; maybe even March 2021. That could be a whole year of nothing, what will be left?

<|startoftext|>Wrong, people are not happy because the dumbest man in the world is POTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djjjfrost @GROOVERIDERDJ @realDonaldTrump His only quality (if you can call it that) is that he can make you say WTF? on a weekly basis without fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump More lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"we’ve done MUCH better than most other Countries"   WTF are you talking about? The US has the highest death rate in the world, it's Covid-19 not the 'China virus' you racist fuck &amp; the media doesn't need to work overtime to make you look as bad as possible, you do that yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Monday everybody 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anything better than pure unadulterated Detroit techno? I personally don't think so ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JubileeDJ @OutlookFestival Sorry :( x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was supposed to be at @OutlookFestival this weekend, was booked to play 4 times, inc Goldie &amp; Calibre stage with boat parties for Dispatch &amp; Outlook.  Don't get me wrong, life has been great, extremely thankful, but right now (DJ) life sucks.  Roll on 2021 #hopefully 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What happened to "Keep America Great" ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you love music you would never say anything like this, you would never treat music as just a commodity or content. As Kasra said, fuck this guy. We need to get our music off this shitty platform otherwise we can't complain when we continually get shafted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doggermusic Wrong, kind of a compliment if it's just for the person only to play on his own device and plans to buy it when it comes out, but still wrong. Super wrong and a problem if they are doing anything else with it. Sign of the times, self entitlement overload, no patience. :sigh:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JubileeDJ There are so many elements to this story that suck that its like an entire series of South Park in one event.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feeling stressed today, no real reason today rather than any other day, missing DJing to a live crowd, its festival season but there's no festivals.  Every other profession has something to aim towards, an end goal, nightlife has nothing, we dont know shit, who knows when? #limbo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VOLTAGE_DRUMS Who knows he might even win, I wouldn't bet against anything in 2020 ... 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Soniccouture He can run as an independent, like Ross Perot did in the 90s which helped Clinton defeat Bush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope this is a joke because if the asshole actually runs he will take votes away from Biden and allow Trump to win. Fuck you Kanye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_r00_ Maybe they should pay their presenters less then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeLSB They also prosecute 100,000 plus people a year, many who are financially disadvantaged, whilst paying some of their presenters 6 or 7 figure salaries so they can go to hell.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NedRoberts1 Netflix, National Geographic, Discovery channel etc ... think otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djjamo81 I like the BBC (generally) but I don't like being forced to pay for it. I don't like the fact that they take to court over 100,000 people a year for non payment of the licence fee. And I aslo don't like when they brag about ratings, ridiculous when they have a guaranteed income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The BBC should have adverts and compete in the real world like all other broadcasters, it's outrageous that you are forced to pay for something that you might not use. BTW I would pay an annual subscription to the BBC but it should be optional, not compulsory. #DefundTheBBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shylo_FT Good point. It's the 'so white lives don't matter?' argument that I find baffling ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden BTW I was typing that reply while listening to the podcast and hearing your voice so it felt like I was having a 4th dimension sci fi moment. 😳😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden Thank you for your reply, your position is important and I appreciate you’re using it to move things forward, I know Twitter isn’t an accurate representation of the population but the replies were depressing. Keep up the good work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djjjfrost Mate, I started reading the replies to talksports reporting and Burnleys twitter account and had to stop as it was depressing, at best ignorant, at worst racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden Not as depressing as the replies to Talksports tweets, how does it feel to have a listener base that are at best ignorant or at worst racist? Not gloating or anything, genuinely concerned. Please use your platform to educate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of people saying 'well done' and 'I agree' to the banner flown over the football last night that says 'White Lives Matter Burnley!' is beyond depressing ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackSpectraSoul @AntagonistUK @Loxycylon I don't agree with everything he says &amp; obviously I don't agree with some of the guests he has on, but I like the fact that I can hear different points of view, no matter how extreme from my own, people living in echo chambers is part of todays problems imo. I watch FOX news FFS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NinaKraviz I hear you, I encounter the same problem from time to time, we want everyone to know and love the music as much as we do and if not then to go out and enrich themselves in knowledge and it's disappointing when that doesn't happen. Big fan BTW 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@method1 He's a POS, that we know and we shouldn't be shocked even though we still are. What gets me are his supporters, surely they can see what we can see ... ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NinaKraviz Don't worry about comments, some people are idiots. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@method1 I've never seen someone with such little to no empathy, I can't imagine any other world leader having to read what he reads (death toll numbers) and have no emotional reaction to what he's saying. A rotten human being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump bragging about how many tests they've done, mentions nothing about the 10,000+ people that have died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djjjfrost He's awful!   https://t.co/2esMzYaB2L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btbshowtime @TonyFergusonXT @Justin_Gaethje Bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I've said before, no fan of Boris or the Conservatives, but to take any pleasure in this news is wrong. It's not funny or some form of perverse justice, it just shows that you have lost your moral compass. I hope he (and all) make a speedy recovery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Liverpool, made a mistake, realised it and put it right whilst admitting they were wrong in the first place. Whatever the reason for making it right (shamed / public backlash) at least they did and that's commendable. Mistakes are the reason pencils have erasers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sc_codeUM @ModalElectronic Thanks for the reply, much appreciated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>(IMO) The 2 most important tunes you can play as a DJ are your intro tune and your outro tune because they really say who I am and who I was. Everything in-between should already be great because you're being paid to be a good DJ! #dontbeafakeasslamedj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Say what you want about Boris Johnson but thank god we don't have Trump as our leader at this time, his only redeeming quality is that he can still make you say "WTF?" on a daily basis, what a awful, terrible human being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great, now Americans can fill up their cars and drive to the jobs they don't have anymore and visit their relatives who just died. What a POS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarrySword true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crowbloke no, and thank you :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh and if true Jack Grealish you're a f*cking idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting really annoyed by people who keep saying "it's just old people that are dying"  1. That makes you a pretty heartless person. 2. That 'old person' is someones mum or dad, grandad or grand mother. 3. It's a human life FFS!  Stay safe everyone and don't be selfish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A huge thank you to @DjTeeBee  who did an amazing job on the remasters, which he did in double quick time and for free! An amazing gesture. So if you have some old tracks that need remastering hit him up for work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m also well aware that there are many people who are in the same situation as myself regarding the future financial uncertainty and therefore have made them available at hopefully what is a reasonable price point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But well with the current situation now seemed like a good time get it done and get them out there if you’re interested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for about 2 years now with the intention of re-releasing them in remastered digital format but never got round to it as to be honest I’m much more interested in the future than the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m constantly asked about my 31 back catalogue that was on the Bunch of Cuts website in the late 2000’s being made available again digitally and believe it or not (and some might not) we’ve been talking about remastering my old Nasty Habits 31 releases from the 90s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>'play' not 'pay' ... obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SUBPAC me please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_Skream Apparently theres some 'up and coming' DJs out there playing tunes they shouldn't have and hitting people up for music trades. No one is quite sure where they are getting them from, radio / DJ set rips, lost / stolen USBs, promo hacks ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_Skream mate .... 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In short, don't be a dick and don't pay tunes you aren't supposed to have FFS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus you want to be thankful that my generation are a bit older and mellower, if this kind of nonsense happened in the 90s you would have ended up at the bottom of a flight of stairs if you were lucky ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as for trading tunes with other DJ's, again a huge NO NO.  The fact that this has to be said publicly, not just by me but many other DNB DJ's and artists is a very sad sign of the times, its 100% wrong and completely unethical and will finish your career before it starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to add my 2 cents to the 'playing tunes you shouldn't have' topic.  If you have any hope of a career as a pro DJ in DNB then please stop playing tunes you shouldn't have &amp; delete them immediately from your drives, this is the biggest NO NO you can do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>BTW to the people messaging me about encouraging people to “jump off a bridge” I’m obviously not being literal.

<|startoftext|>@DrumObsessionPL Its very very rare tbh in todays day and age, but it can happen, either people don't read the contracts or they just have an old skool mentality of paying the day before, but thats just not how we work in 2020.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have you heard ‘DLR - Banana Bread / Busy’ by @31Recordings on #SoundCloud? #np  https://t.co/yK3UVebhe6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the NFL you need a little bit of luck (injury wise) to go with your talent, but when you're a run first team and you lose your first 3 choice running backs, well then it becomes tough. Kudos to the @Seahawks for getting this far, we love you, see you in 2020. #Gohawks #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we're in a hole, nothing new about this scenario ... #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>family jewels #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lord_lines Gonna be tough, but when Russell is on the field anything can happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the moral of this game is don't make the Chiefs angry. #HOUvsKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diamondlights75 Yep! not sure about that fake punt though ... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisATC12 It's happening!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MisterMowgli I’m not angry, just disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0102studio Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLapping I can't tell you who Dawn Wall is but the tune at 9 mins is Dom &amp; Roland 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_Skream I do, and btw I loved your highlighting the other week of the guy who really rated you but then didn't just because you played 1 particular tune. ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gbellseattle @AB84 is free ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulWoolford 4 albums this year, dude you're making everyone else look bad ;)  Seriously though, take a bow and Offworld is one of my fave albums of the year. 😎♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to all the artists, labels, DJs who take risks,  aren't prepared to play it safe &amp; keep this dnb thing always moving forward, innovation is one of the key ingredients that make dnb so special &amp; sometimes you need to swing and miss to know where the boundaries are. #dnb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a DJ Ive always played across the board as I have a wide taste in music &amp; I like to experiment, its what's allowed me to do this for 30+ years. But this means if you're only into a specific style of dnb I'm probably going to play something you don't like, sorry abut that. #dnb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Musical snobbery is the worst, if I had made Shadow Boxing today some people would call it a 'foghorn' tune and shoot it down in flames, get off your high horse or better still go to a niche dnb night where you can just hear the same sound all night long. And don't fucking @ me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@30for30 You have to make this happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FIFAWorldCup @afcasiancup Did you take a closer look at their human rights record?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're a shy person or uncomfortable in public situations like myself, to feel constantly surrounded by people professionally, but at times to feel so lonely, is such a weird feeling, it something I and many others who do what I do feel but somehow you never get used to it ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My goal as a DJ is to make people dance (obviously) but it's also to hopefully play one or more tunes that people will be unsure about, hell, I'm unsure about them, but the goal is always to play something challenging that they can take home &amp; figure out later ... #moveitforward<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fiverdrive It wouldnt be fair to rank releases, but i was very proud when we did the Krust release, for me that was very special.   No WTF moments, apart from my own stuff.  Maybe, big compilations take a lot of work and planning so we'll see, im not against the idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khal Years ago, I almost signed a deal but thankfully I didn't, a lot of people got messed up signing album deals they werent ready for, I wasnt ready &amp; deep down i knew it, thankfully i didnt need to from a financial point of view, im a DJ not a producer anyway :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Slow_it_dowwwn OK, not sure if i've ever said this before? but i sampled the reese from a Trace tune, stretched it out and FXed it so it sounded like my own :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UltramagneticCB Thank you, no, that was a one off and was an honour to be asked to do it. Art of Noise were a big influence on me growing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmac176 WOW, thats a name i havent heard for a while, last time I saw Gwange was 1994 ish ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azizyduzit Probably the one on Exit, was that in the last 5 years? if not the Alix Perez one, 1985 is stellar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PixelatedPike Logic, used to use Cubase, cant get my head around Ableton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Britbloodedlove Akai s950, atari running cubase 4 i think, not much else, my brain and a lot of drugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keegan_Hooper I just do my thing, not to the point of arrogance, i read a crowd and can adjust if i feel i need to, but i learnt an very important lesson years ago from Derrick May, half the people left when he was playing but he just did his thing, that stuck with forever. Be true to yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daim_yo_ Hmm, I dont know a lot of the names for breaks to be honest, but ive always loved the break that Ed rush &amp; Optical used for Bacteria. that break is fucking sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@escapingbrown I don't know if dnb is as big as jazz or disco, but when we started to DJ in America, Japan, Australia, world wide in the mid to late 90s, it felt like dnb had arrived and it was here to stay. Thank you, to be considered a small part in the whole thing is a nice thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaseyriot Was a lot of fun, especially playing an hour techno set straight after my dnb set to transition the club into its after hours techno setting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marksubloco1 Of course, wouldn't miss it, played there first in 2006 and haven't missed a year. Always special.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbfab1 New Stylee btw, its the blueprint for jungle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TADAW_AU Both, new, old, unreleased stuff and im excited too, I love playing dnb but I love even more the opportunity to play non dnb sets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@olliekav Yes, but not dnb, making some 130 tempo beats (techno / house) and some ambient / drone music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flight cancelled due to bad weather from Minneapolis to New York, stuck here until the morning (6pm local time), no gig tonight so no real drama, shit happens, found a bar that serves Guinness so that's a bonus, got time to kill though .... Q &amp; A anyone?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@I_Skream Im sure you've had a bucketload on this but I have to say I respectfully disagree, as long as its online I dont see a problem, if it gets too much for me I unfollow that person. But if a DJ started getting on the mic spouting politics in clubs they can go to hell.. #loveyoubtw ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Safehandsgk11 deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utter nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last word on this, just to be clear, obviously im not talking about people asking for a rewind or shouting for "one more tune" at the end of the night.  I'm talking about getting into a DJs face and aggressively shouting their demands, please don't do that, it sucks. Thanks. 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello Boston ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinksqrl No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly I thought that's what you once called 'the price of freedom' ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Randallmac2 Dm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carbon43 @agzyeah You’re right actually, don’t shout at anybody, my bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hyroglifics specifically it was , "oi mate, play some harder stuff" ... (in aggressive tone)  Serum was playing at the time ... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrusiFex Specifically an individual who shouts (usually aggressively) stupid instructions, like i'm his personal DJ, that person. Don't be that person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaseandstatus I think Fabio went through a stage of taking phones of people that did that, like a school teacher .... "see me after class to get your phone back" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agzyeah Shout at the sound guy, not the DJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokeshi__ @EXECUTIVESTEVE I like it when you swear ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nat_Carnegie Yes :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamkabuki Yep, I've done that for sure ... "play some liquid"   OK heres some fucking Noisia ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieS23 Yeah , that usually happens as well when im playing Skeptical ot Alix Perez which makes it beyond funny ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully its very rare but every now and then theres one ass that thinks the party is all about him (its usually a guy)  If you're really not happy then feel free to go online the next day and vent about how I wasn't whoever it was you wanted to hear ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To people in the crowd, please don't shout requests like 'play harder, deeper, faster etc ..' at me or any DJ. We are here to represent ourselves &amp; our personality, not to be shouted at.  1. Im not going to do whatever you're shouting. 2. its incredibly rude. Thanks, from all DJs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the constant highlights of my life is an early morning (or late night) call with Goldie where we shoot the breeze &amp; catch up, he gives me grief about not answering the phone and then we end up swapping some tunes like excited teenagers. #nevertooold #headz #thebest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArturiaOfficial BTW @ArturiaOfficial I love your products but as many have said in their replies, €199 to upgrade to V7 for 3 new synths after €199 to upgrade to V6 is way too much, i hope you'll reconsider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailSport Good riddance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArturiaOfficial €199 to upgrade? You're tripping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailSport £60m? How about £160m or swap deal for Mbappe ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@djjjfrost They're on the beach when they're supposed to be fighting for a top 4 position. Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MUFCScoop Genuine question, do you think Ole can get angry (hairdryer) with these players? Is it in his DNA? I hope he's not too nice as this lot need a good kick up the ass and some of them bombing out of the club. Totally unacceptable today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thelenzman Gutted, I missed the game by 2 days :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every now and then I'll swing and miss, but that's OK, if you never swing and miss you'll never know what the boundaries are, sometimes you gotta push right to the edge to see what's possible. Keep pushing, its fun, playing it safe all the time is boring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music is awesome, I still get as excited as I did when I was a teenager when you ID a tune and then that murder tune drops in your inbox, when that doesn't happen I'll quit.   But as is stands, I'm super fucking happy, love it :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elhornet I hear you, I don't envy coming up today or making your name in the last 10-15 years, it's way harder with a lot more pressure and a lot more competition. But I believe that people need to be more courageous and be leaders and not just 'give people what think they want' IMO😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elhornet My circle is maybe small, but I get your point, that being said people I admire, play with and have played with by and large play / played what they wanted to and thank fuck they did, because I wouldn't be here 30 years later still being booked to do what I do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elhornet I guess we move in different circles, but 99% of people I play with play what the fuck they want to play, they're DJ's, not disc jockeys. What you describe sound like basically glorified cheerleaders if I'm being kind,  and complete and utter cunts if I'm not.  Peace out 😎✌️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Its always special at @sunandbass , Ive been coming here since 2006 &amp; every year has its own unique moments at what is a unique festival.

<|startoftext|>Also thank you to everyone who came down to Bal harbour and grooved to me and Commix rolling out some techno for a couple of hours. Was a blast. Next year we'll ask @sunandbass for 4 hours 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So last night was a night off and a night out for me at Sun &amp; Bass.  I had a ton of fun and my biggest take away was the future off this scene is in very very good hands.

<|startoftext|>I know it’s been said before but it’s worth repeating, you can’t beat a small, loud, packed, hot club with a low ceiling and the crowd right on top of you.  That’s the real shit.  Guernsey last night you were rocking, thank you 🙏😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>t's been a rough couple of weeks, I usually don't respond to stuff like this anymore, must have caught me at a low energy point, still catching up on my sleep and recharging my batteries. Anyway 99.9% of people seemed to agree on some level so whatever, it's all good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I use social media to promote my label, promote upcoming gigs, share my feelings, have a laugh and every now and then express my opinion on something I might feel strongly about.

<|startoftext|>Use social media to just promote yourself &amp; your label / gigs people complain you're boring, use social media to comment on music people complain you're too opinionated, use social media to comment on subjects outside of your business people complain &amp; say just stick to music 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jon1st That USA title match = first toilet break :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wai0937 Great match and a ton of fun. Congrats @RondaRousey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveShichman Was genuinely cautious as I'm a fan of Ronda. Well laid out and perfectly executed. Great match. So much hate for her, sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon1st I like Ronda and was genuinely worried, she did great, well laid out match and perfectly executed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck the haters. That was a great match. Ronda. Angle. HHH. Stephanie. #WrestleMania<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‘Derrick May Boiler Room x Ballantine's True Music: Hybrid Sounds Russia DJ Set’ on #SoundCloud #np  https://t.co/SsY3nsZXlD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon1st @djsquarewave @TMSVmusic Yep! Short sets suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_binga Agreed. I should have been more specific, was speaking from my own personal DJ style, I like longer tracks as I'm not that good a DJ to mix quickly ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just for today ...  https://t.co/Ne4JDklCZs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a crazy game of football. #ManchesterDerby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW sorry if I sound like a grumpy old sod. Going through some promos, heard a great track and it just finished all of a sudden (3:08) and it left me disappointed. Thank you to everyone who sends me music, it's always very much appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MARTYN3024 HAHA I bet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet of the day.  https://t.co/NWnw2bOGXY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregSubmorphics @silentdustmusic @khal @jon1st Plus I'm a slow mixer so I need longer tracks :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMSVmusic I'm a slow mixer so I need longer tracks :) Awesome, look forward to hearing it !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silentdustmusic @khal @jon1st @Lewisinspace Yes, great 12, thank you :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMSVmusic I'm talking from a DJ perspective I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silentdustmusic @khal @jon1st Depends on the style too. I guess I'm referring to your traditional style D&amp;B roller, 3 mins isn't enough for me for that style.  (Going through promos and I was into a track and all of a sudden it ended)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silentdustmusic @khal Technology doesn't make me mix quicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregSubmorphics @silentdustmusic @khal Maybe? Just stating that 3 min D&amp;B tunes are 99% of the time no use to me. In fact it's more frustrating when I like the track. Depends on your style of DJ'ing I guess. Like I said in the OP I'm 'old fashioned'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silentdustmusic @khal Always an exception to the rule, but for me, 99% of the time a D&amp;B tune that clocks in barely over 3 mins is no use ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeLSB I have tunes (yours included) that have intros longer than 3 mins 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me old fashioned or out of touch but it's hard to take a promo seriously when the running time of your track is 3:08 ... sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danawhite Welcome to Monday Night RAW .... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjTeeBee @beemabey I could have done without the flute TBH ... 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beemabey Thought it was just me on that one ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I aint done BTW, just feeling reflective ... 😁  God willing I'll be DJ'ing for another 20+ years. Keep on trucking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would have thought that on Wrestlemania weekend the UFC would be more crazy than the WWE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now here's a picture of our cat. 😻  https://t.co/vq2afAUlHo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only ever wanted to be a DJ. Any wrong turns I took were my fault &amp; I own them all but when its all said &amp; done and I look back at it all. I can say I did it my way on my own terms. That's all anyone can ask for and I'm proud of my small part in this crazy thing called D&amp;B.✌️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you've been trying to ID a track for almost 2 years &amp; you find out what it is, message the person to tell them the back story, how great it is &amp; ask where can you buy it &amp; then they reply that they're a fan of your music &amp; send it to you. Life is good :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Annix_Online @DjTeeBee Yep! that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermodeMovie One of my biggest cinema disappointments ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjTeeBee I didn't mind the Porgs, (WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)  I did mind the awful awful awful forced humour, the crappy death of Snoke, the crappy death of Ackbar, the crap casino story and Princess Leia flying in the fucking vacuum of space!!! WTF??? ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaHawkersPod   https://t.co/VIk00ORt8O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechnimaticUK :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wittertainment Star Wars The Last Jedi should be in there. Sorry @KermodeMovie I love you but you are so wrong about this film :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjTeeBee Dude, go back, its well worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@audio_injection Really really good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PacificDnB I'll wait until DVD to watch again but I don;t think I'll change my opinion. Way too much (bad) humour and Jedi powers that never existed before in any of the previous films...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simond22 Hey, you might like it, a lot of people do, I didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I think about it ... the worse Star Wars #TheLastJedi gets 😠<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>About time! TD #WASvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good thing about being down by 8 is that we'll go for a 2 point conversion meaning Blair Walsh won't have to kick the P.A.T. #WASvsSEA  https://t.co/zF6REo2hqq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The sad thing is the art of DJ'ing is becoming a lost art. I've never known a time when the art is as less appreciated as it is right now ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't understand any of the previous comments then I'm sorry you're a disc jockey not a DJ. But don't worry you still get paid ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I learnt from @GROOVERIDERDJ 20+ years ago was that there's beauty in the violence of a mix, forcing 2 tunes together is an art ..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@day_off_ales @Apple I'm old and grumpy and don't like change ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I hate is so much !! Courage? GTFO !!! - Apple calls killing the headphone jack 'courage'  https://t.co/dhthViy35F via @YouTube<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealEdem I get that feeling but fuck it, Samsung looks cool so as long as it doesn't set me on fire ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelenzman I love Apple, been a fan and a consumer for over 20 years, but they really take the piss sometimes ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I refuse to upgrade my iPhone 6 plus until @Apple bring back the headphone jack, and if they won't then I'll go back to Android. #AppleEvent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@djzinc @Lowsteppa Im 99.9% very polite, I just wanted off this mailing list because the music genuinely did my head in. Plus they couldnt say 'I supported it'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djzinc @Lowsteppa I once put "If I could leave 0 stars I would but your review system has a minimum of 1 star that this release doesn't deserve" 🤪 #truestory<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sirdeuce_ I agree, but they were on the field a long time due to our offence not being able to do jack shit all game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djzinc It means you replied to the promo mail out ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirdeuce_ Best defence minus your starting corner back on a bullshit call? Oh yeah ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCDNB Please lets not get the promo 3-4 days before release ... 😎✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last word on last nights game #SEAvGB - its hard enough to go to Lambeau but when the officials dont call the game fairly you have no chance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How is that not PI on Jimmy Graham? #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slimDrjim Both are true tho :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My takeaway from the game so far .... Pre-season &amp; regular season are COMPLETELY different. #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a sucker punch at the end of the half! I think I enjoyed that FG more than any in recent memory ... #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle Defence looks amazing. In other news the sky is blue. #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There have been some questionable calls in this first half against Seattle" - NO SHIT! #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaHawkersPod smart !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets have a solid drive please ... #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaHawkersPod NOTHING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedjbagpuss There was NO punch! BS call, both should have been flagged and penalties offset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where was a punch thrown? Absolute BS! #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BS call !!! #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was an ugly start ... #SEAvsGB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackSpectraSoul Not many to be honest, I think most knew he was selling wolf tickets. He had a punchers chance at best, I just dont get all the hate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record Floyd is a don, probably the best defensive boxer of all time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL at all the Conor bashing, he's not a boxer, he sold the fight and walked away with $100m , who's the fool here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Toronto, you were wonderful, what a great way to end my tour. Blessed &amp; so happy that I'm still doing this job &amp; still loving it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Djbarryc They criticise MMA striking all the time. Conor was selling the fight, whats he supposed to say? I have no chance buy the PPV anyway ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all the boxing purists crowing, put any top 10 boxer in the octagon and see what happens ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go!!! #MayweatherVsMcGregor<|endoftext|>
