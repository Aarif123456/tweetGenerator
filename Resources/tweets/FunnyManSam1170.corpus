<|startoftext|>@HowieRose Up until I was 12 years old, I was a Yankees fan because my dad and older brother were. Then Keith was traded to the Mets and my life changed forever. Been bleeding blue and orange since. And I’d rather eat glass than go back to rooting for that other team.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what I admire about Peter is that he’s never afraid to sound incredibly dumb, even on consecutive days about the same topic. It wasn’t John’s group any more than it was Paul’s. Just like NWA wasn’t Dre’s or Cube’s group 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - yesterday, I got angry twice at your show. First time was when I heard Peter’s nonsensical claim that the Beatles were John’s group (REPUG!!)...the 2nd time was when I watched the show on DVR &amp; visually went through it again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrNiteOut - thanks for the retweet. I need to put this bootleg cable company on blast. They’re crooks and their service sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @agundling - hey Peter....who was NWA’s frontman? Was Dre the face of the group more than Ice Cube was? Who was the frontman for Wu-Tang? 🤔 It’s absolutely ludicrous to say Lennon was the frontman. Paul was equally up front!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I understand the GOAT argument, but to cancel someone because of it is just plain stupid.   BTW, MJ is the GOAT but LBJ is the BOAT (best of all time). Because of his physical makeup, he can do things MJ couldn’t do (like play center) and is a better team player than MJ was, IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVinScully Hello Vin, I am curious to know which players you’ve seen play are on your Mt Rushmore of ball players. #AskVin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240  https://t.co/YqObE1qZZ0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - my guess is Jayson Stark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP If there were degrees issued for the amount of time spent playing Pitfall, I would have 2 Master’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - not saying that it was a smart move by Brodie Van Wagenen...but d’Arnaud mostly sucked when he was catching for the Mets. Low average, couldn’t throw out the garbage, much less a base runner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HowieRose It’s Fake News!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vzmercogliano With the assets this team has, I would be shocked if they don’t pull off a trade (or make an offer) for a 2nd line C. Strome is NOT the one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 Tough spot for Gorton. Could have waited and risked losing Kreider to FA. Right now, that would have been the right decision. But at the time and out of respect for what Kreids means to this team, he had to re-sign him then if he wasn’t going to trade him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 Wait...what? Didn’t you want them to sign Kreider? Plus, it’s only awful now because they can draft Laf. Otherwise, if they had the 8th or 9th pick, you would be just fine with Kreider.  Trouba??? That’s another story. He needs to earn that paycheck this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - Sanchez is such an enigma. So much talent but so many mental and physical errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vzmercogliano I believe Hank “agreed” to buyout before playoffs started. Which is why DQ started him in Gms 1 &amp; 2. If they had won either game, he would have been in goal for gm 3. Knowing CAR was just too good against them, Igor started instead. Hank was spared. Is this conceivable?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca  - I called @TMKSESPN when the playoffs started &amp; shared my theory. And now that Hank’s getting bought out, I’m even more convinced that Hank starting Gms 1 &amp; 2 had nothing to do with Igor’s health &amp; everything to do with this being his “last stand” @EJHradek_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalinabreaNYR I took my then 10 year old son to one of Hank’s hockey camps. He stopped to chat with my boy and signed his helmet. I was probably more excited than my son was that he met the King. We’ll miss seeing #30 on the ice.  https://t.co/p0HaNhLhxl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpiderDanThree @SNYtv MLB will never eliminate pitcher’s W-L records, no matter how devalued it is these days. They’re adding metrics, not taking any away. Only “stat” I’ve seen that was introduced and then eliminated fairly quickly was GW RBIs which was truly useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpiderDanThree @SNYtv A little radical to eliminate wins altogether. But there’s no way a pitcher not doing his job effectively should be rewarded for his ineptitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv I hate, HATE, HAAAATE that a reliever who blows a save gets the W when his team comes back. There’s no way Diaz deserves the W (nor did Betances, obviously). I know the rule has been in place for decades but #MLB needs to reconsider who gets the win in those situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB - if I ever had to die on an #MLB hill, it would be this one...IF YOU BLOW A SAVE YOU CAN’T GET THE WIN. It’s ridiculous to reward a relief pitcher when he failed at doing his job. Diaz took away a W from DeGrom. No way does he deserve a win. CHANGE THAT RULE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Keeps Hank in the fold to make one last run for the Cup. Acquiring  a 2nd line C and a strong defenseman could be the last pieces for them to really compete.   They don’t “need” Georgiev and packaging him with CAR’s pick could get them a top flight player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen @vzmercogliano @NYP_Brooksie - this may be a stretch, but follow me. W/Lafreniere in the mix, the #NYR  just improved substantially.

<|startoftext|>@natalinabreaNYR I’m a Mets, Jets, Rangers, and Orlando Magic fan. I’ve celebrated exactly 2 championships in my nearly 50 years of life. I know your pain too well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I was FIVE!!!!!!!!!  🤦🏻‍♂️ #ParentsOfTheYear #NightmaresForYears  https://t.co/N5GO3XhLwJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 Yeah, I can’t help you with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RangersMSGN I truly believe the best is yet to come #PlayLikeANewYorker #LetsGoRangers #LGR #NYR #NYRangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 60+ games of Igor next season...Kakko, Fox, Lindgren tasted the playoffs as rookies which should motivate them to up their game...potential high pick in deep draft...prospects to move for a top 6 F...they were better than expected. There’s a lot to look forward to with this team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL @NYRangers Not going to matter if they play disjointed like they have for too long during the last 2 games. Defense needs to be tighter and passes need to be crisper. Otherwise even if they had the Geico walrus in net, they’ll still get bounced. #PlayLikeANewYorker #LGR #NYR  https://t.co/7tt8q0hFK0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 - look at this filth. @FreddieFreeman5 is a restaurant quality All-Star player. Even he was like “WTH?!?!?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beltransburner @RVacchianoSNY Sadly, I am. Some people are numb to the brutal losses but I feel the pain every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surrendering a 5 run advantage to lose the game is bad enough. But to watch Travis “I did nothing with the #Mets” d’Arnaud smack a double to clear the bases and give ATL the lead is about as cruel a loss as it gets.   #LGM #LetsGoMets #MaybeNextYear  https://t.co/zkNLdbdOfx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 I’ve seen this garbage too many times in my life. There’s nothing funny about it 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beltransburner @RVacchianoSNY But does it though? After 34 years, I’m not exactly sure that’s true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franksantopadre @RealGilbert - I'm listening to episode after episode of #GGACP this week and I'm literally LOL😂. I wish I was famous for no other reason than to spend an hour &amp; a half chatting with you guys. I'm pretty sure it would be amazing AND colossal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVacchianoSNY What makes this even sadder is that my 16 yr old son is losing his mind with each loss and I can’t do anything but watch him suffer. I mean, what can I tell him? That it’s going to get better? SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 And now I’m old as you are quick to point out. So, yeah. 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 Take your frustration right now....and multiply that by 34 years. Now you know how I feel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - Michael's stank attitude over the last few weeks is killing the show. He's virtually Francesca-like. Not sure if his surliness is intended or he's just fed up with Don &amp; Peter...but it's becoming unwatchable 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - watched your Top 5 Canadian rock bands list last night. Not that they deserved to be on the list, but are you familiar with Manitoba’s Wild Kingdom? Their album “....and You?” released in 1990 was a staple for me &amp; co-workers when I was at Rolling Stone back then.  https://t.co/AQzAT8HVTA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - Michael, the way you've composed yourself over the last 2 days, you deserve an 8 day suspension. You're seriously too surly to enjoy right now. #BadGuy #MyGudness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheClemReport 😂😂😂  https://t.co/D6kylA2uIc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyDiComo Oswalt is Hansel Robles 2.0. Wasn’t good last year, wasn’t good in exhibition games, and was terrible today when he needed to be effective. Sure, the team isn’t hitting but they’d have a fighting chance coming back from 4 runs than 10.  #OswaltStinks #LGM #LetsGoMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanKinsella1 @metsonmymind I was at that game against the Giants. It was my son’s birthday.  Cespedes hit a grand slam that inning. The place went nuts. Sadly, a 12 run inning this game would result in a 1 run loss 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When listening to the announcers makes you think, “Man, I sure do wish Mendoza &amp; Rodriguez were calling this game”, you know it’s really bad. #ESPN #BaseballisBack #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corey Oswalt is NOT A MAJOR LEAGUE PITCHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was sure Oswalt pitched himself OFF the team during their last exhibition game.  But nope, here he is, trying to outsuck Porcello and doing a great job at it. #LGM #LetsGoMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raiderjoe_FO @PSLToFlushing Poignant and relevant. Thanks for that nugget of wisdom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CruzThirsty @lucasdiaz1240 Dude....stop trying to poison my son’s mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSLToFlushing If Freeman wasn’t so early with his swing in the 9th innning of Gm 1, Diaz would have blown consecutive games to start the season.  So I agree that he’s looked good for most of the batters he’s faced. But he’s thrown meatballs as well. Didn’t help that he went 3-0 against Ozuna.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a Mets fan and have the same last name as their pathetic closer. If I ever run into Edwin, I may kick Diaz. I #BetterCallSaul in that situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swolegirthjones @uss34mlb @LeVeonBell Me, reading that dude’s diatribe  https://t.co/g53ImbqZyX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyDiComo He was 3-0 to Ozuna so that didn’t help any. Also note that Freeman just missed tying up yesterday’s game against Diaz. So I’m not sure if he was unlucky today or lucky yesterday. What I do know is that I (along with a majority of fans) don’t have faith in Diaz closing games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walksintoIBARRA @TheMikeHennessy @AnthonyDiComo  https://t.co/IO5rO88hkF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusiesKeep I could be mad about it...except Mets had the bases loaded with 1 out in the 10th. They could have capitalized like the Braves did. Instead, Nuñez swings at the 1st pitch 😡 and they only mustered a single run. I’m more annoyed at Diaz than at the 10th inning rule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGelbs @SNYtv Any chance the Mets can send Diaz back to Seattle? Maybe buy a companion fare with Jamal Adams? I’d be happy with 100 fan cutouts in return for Diaz. #LGM #LetsGoMets #DiazStillStinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Any chance the Mets can piggy back with the Jets and send Edwin Diaz with Adams back to Seattle? I’d be happy with 100 cutouts of fans in return for Diaz, who’s straight garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGelbs @SNYtv He almost gave up a game tying homer to Freeman yesterday. Guess that went foul thanks to the Opening Day magic the #Mets have. Today, no such luck. Just the same ol’ choke job like last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 When you try too hard and achieve little to no results. That’s pressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 It’s called pressing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JFreshHockey McKinnon and Draisatl have been on their teams for 7 and 6 years, respectively. Panarin did his thing with brand new teammates. Do you think that factors at all in the voting process?  Asking for my friend, Artie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristinaBirro @talkingsopranos @StevenSchirripa Rewatched the series in 2 weeks time and just finished all of the #TalkingSopranos podcasts.

<|startoftext|>@NHL @EJHradek_NHL @Mackinnon9 @artemiypanarin @NHLdotcom McKinnon - 7 yrs w/Col Draisatl - 6 yrs w/Edm Panatin - 1st yr getting acclimated to new teammates on a rebuilding team  That should also factor in the decision, no?   #Hartemi #Breadman #LetsGoRangers #PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - to finish my point about the Sopranos comparison...sure Tony (Michael) calls the shots, but why would anyone want to be quarantined with him?

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Let Jay Williams know that Bokeem Woodbine, Michael B Jordan, and Lin Manuel Miranda were also on The Sopranos. So there have been minorities on the show. True, they only tallied about 27 minutes of screen time....but they were there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN Not only is @DonLagreca my choice, but I’d quarantine with @ChrisCarlin, @Radio_Randy, or @agundling before @RealMichaelKay &amp; @Rosenbergradio #Facts #LetsGoWithDon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BuchnevichHC I'd love to see Hank be effective as a starter...but even as the 1st or 2nd backup, if the team wins, he wins. If Igor and/or Alex get the bulk of playing time between the pipes &amp; the team is winning, then so be it. Henrik won't be any less of a champion if he's not the starter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bishop_PastorRW @JoyTaylorTalks I’d say showing love to someone despite their sinful ways is real love. Ask most people related to someone gay or with an addiction.

<|startoftext|>@Bishop_PastorRW @JoyTaylorTalks I respect you’re a clergyman,but I have to say...how you attack those who are showing love to their fellow man...all sinners &amp; CHILDREN OF GOD...you’re not enticing ANYONE to get to know His Word better. Contrarily, you‘ll drive more people away with that judgmental rhetoric, IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bishop_PastorRW @JoyTaylorTalks God IS love. HE loves all including sinners. HIS Word says homosexuality is a sin. So those engaging in homosexuality acts are sinners. But we already established that God loves all including sinners. So wouldn’t God want to right those who are “lost” rather than condemn them? 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I almost suckerpunched myself in the face after that last caller. WTH is wrong with people?   (btw...I'm on hold...take my call before you sign off please!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - it’s Kermit Washington....final answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @Radio_Randy @agundling @TMKSESPN - hey guys, what happened to shaving Don's head for Covid-19 donations? Is that going to happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrealeckey225 Let me see....be a loser professional racer with a chance to earn thousands of dollars driving a car OR be a loser racist somewhere else? 🤔  Well, see you guys!   #Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - when I read it this morning, I just KNEW Michael was going to lead the show with that #Sopranos story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mspears96 Ciccarelli thinking like....  I suck at this truck racing thing so I'll just go back to being a racist from my living room. #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - awww, look at Peter’s joy when he finds out #1 on Don’s Best ‘80s coaches list is the Redskins’ own Joe Gibbs. #WinnerWinnerChickenDinner  https://t.co/rW1egIFded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP Growing up, we used it as a booster seat  https://t.co/bcRSs9kGpX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Basically, it’s “I’ll give up a way to make hundreds of thousands of dollars before I give up my racism!” #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I don't know if it's lack of sports or the love of Don, but I'm so damn happy for him right now. Absolutely giddy! #LetsGoWithDon #LoveForTheChubbyOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I heard it live on the radio and had to watch it on DVR to see your reactions. This was my favorite moment of the seemingly 30 minutes of time you guys spent with Joe from Staten Island #WhenMenWereMen  https://t.co/ygRfH9FwyP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP  https://t.co/ndLdJM0w2L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it you that worked at 171, @RodzJohnny? I’ve wondered this for over 30 years. You’re the only one who can tell me if I’m right or wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodzJohnny - hola Johnny. I hope you're well. My dad and I used to enjoy watching you in the WWF. I also attended IS 171 in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn in the early '80s. For some reason, I thought you (or Jose Estrada) worked at the school. Am I right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I feel bad for those who think the more followers they have, the more worthy they are. That's one of the biggest fallacies of social media. You may be super popular, but your worth is measured by the love and lessons you leave behind for those closest to you...in REAL LIFE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you guys are making me nostalgic, remembering the ol' "bring your anvil to school" days. Good times indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - The Outsiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @Rosenbergradio....thought it may be there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - #1 HAS to be Fast Times at Ridgemont High<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, the term "World Series" is a misnomer anyway....it's a North American championship and barely that, as there are no other countries involved  #CaptainLiteralMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP Mets Rangers (NY, not Texas) Magic Jets (NY, not Winnipeg)  4 teams....2 championships in my lifetime 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti A better question is....  https://t.co/HrLHpULpmT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the caller forgot about someone on Don’s top 5 Mets’ list....Edgardo Alfonzo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Too bad they were terrible in The Show. I never want to see Drew Gagnon pitch for the Mets again....not even in replays (never mind, you only show Mets wins 😬)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelLaneJr @Rtnarg I built my impressive CD collection with no less than 6 CH/BMG memberships. That’s $17.99 x 6 x 6.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael’s stress toy, as it appears in his hand, looks rather....risqué  https://t.co/0NIR5NwjPy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I didn’t grow up loving hockey. I barely liked it. It was my 5th favorite sport behind wrestling (yes, I’m aware pro wrestling isn’t a sport, which is my point exactly). Now??? Nothing can touch hockey. Watch playoff hockey and I’ll bet you gain some respect for the sport. 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @realDonaldTrump @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael should never do a Top 5 list again. Unless it's Top 5 worst lists &amp; he can list these in any order  Top 5 candy bars Top 5 game shows Top 5 Mets with Z last names 🤮 Top 5 WS games Top 5 Sexiest sitcom actresses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling  @TMKSESPN - I have an idea....how about you NEVER PLAY "WHO AM I?" on Last Man Standing. You're killing my boy, Donny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mirk42 @Rosenbergradio I completely agree. I would have filmed until the moment he grabbed the papers from the girl. Then I had all the evidence I needed to exonerate me for the punishment that piece of garbage would have received.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP  https://t.co/SXX0XILmA6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFreshHockey As a Rangers fan, I don't want the Islanders to be any better than they are. But I don't see how adding Ho-Sang would make them worse. There has to be some unknown factor that is stalling his career and kept him from being claimed from waivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaoneJayO At this time, he still hasn't been identified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blaho1 @Rosenbergradio I was just telling my wife that if some stranger did that to my daughter and I was filming it, the video would have been considerably shorter. I would have put a hurting on that dude and then called the cops myself. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjlarks @Rosenbergradio I can’t understand how much hate and anger a person can harbor for someone they don’t know for reasons they can’t truly justify. I hope they do find him and charge him with assault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Just saw it so I have no further info on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - an idiot in Bethesda, MD. This jackass went after teenagers. Disgraceful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THAT is what's being conveyed across the globe. Black lives MUST matter to everyone, especially to those in power. To say All Lives Matter diminishes the message. In reality, this isn't a Black &amp; White issue. It's a Love &amp; Respect issue. It needs to replace hate sooner than later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I had a family member claim "all lives matter". I couldn't crush her because she was speaking from a spiritual viewpoint. In God's eyes, all lives do matter. But I reminded her that in our world, we're NOT all treated equal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFreshHockey He's been one of the biggest mysteries to me. From what I've seen he holds on to the puck too much. But I've seen a lot worse players stay in the league but yet he hasn't for more than a few games at a time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LManiSViney @lindacohn @DonLagreca @maxkellerman Kellerman's take was so lame. Yes, it's the 4th team sport in the US. But "no one cares" about hockey? Fewer people care about boxing and First Take. Let him stay there.  And you're on point about Don calling games. The best! 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Press Your Luck over Price Is Right and Hollywood Squares??? C'mon, Michael...YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael leaving out the Price Is Right is more egregious than his omission of the Tex-StL 2011 WS gm 6 from his World Series list the other day. People all over the world know The Price Is Right. It's HORRIFYING!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I don’t know you but I’m kinda disappointed that you’re leaving because I found your tweets to be engaging, intelligent, and fun. I get why you want to shut it down for a bit but you’re letting the knuckleheads win. A shame. Stay safe ✌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WORLDSTAR Lemon Clorox with a splash of battery acid. Yeah, that pretty much sums up 2020 so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - Peter, is it okay to feel guilty that I know the answers to “Who Am I?” segments and Don doesn’t? I really feel terrible for him and hope there’s something I can do to help him. Can I donate somewhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - wouldn't kneeling JUST ONCE also show unity? It would take just one time to show your teammates who are fighting injustice that while he may not agree with the tactic, he does support the cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ochocinco Well damn...my apologies to @wyattcenac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCanty99 @RaySanti @ProFootballTalk Sad that to Drew, unity is shown only when standing for the national anthem.  Wouldn’t kneeling JUST ONCE with your teammates who are fighting injustice also show unity? All it would take is just one time to say, I may not agree with your tactic but I agree with your cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ochocinco I met you when you visited our office for an interview. You told us all you loved us. That alone eliminates the name Chad from being the male Karen. I’m thinking Wyatt is more appropriate. I‘ve never heard of any black Wyatts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Sad that to Drew, unity is shown only when standing for the national anthem.

<|startoftext|>@natalinabreaNYR Truth is....nobody really cares about @maxkellerman. He's not one of sports' major voices. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Me, checking my notifications 😀  https://t.co/7eAwbtXGfG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daubs23 @SassyFNP I can't believe he and the Braves only won 1 championship with the squads they had at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I guess mine too? 🤔 😂  Seriously though, I know the Mets have Degrom and he’s phenomenal....but Maddux was so damn consistent for so damn long. He made it look effortless out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I’m a Mets fan since 1983, so naturally my favorite player all time is.....Greg Maddux?!?!?! That man was a technician on the mound. And he could field his position like a champ. And he was a decent hitting pitcher. I still miss watching him play.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - today’s LMS performance by Don was, in a word,......horrifying! This was a bigger let down than Geraldo opening Capone’s vault and finding nothing...which is what Don answered correctly today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - gm 7 of Chi-Phi Series is extra special for me. Not because I’m a Cubs fan, but bc my wife went into labor that night. I pleaded with her not to give birth until gm ended. 😂 She pulled it off. My baby 👧 was born in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - NO WAY, the BOS-LA game tops game 6 of the StL-Tex Series. Two times the Rangers were within 1 strike of winning their 1st Series. Two 2 run leads lost by both teams AFTER THE 8th inning! It was TREMENDOUS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adrianabarness @lucasdiaz1240 @ajcastigliaa Hi, Lucas’ friend 💀 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor People have every right to be fed up. Being a person of color shouldn’t endanger lives, especially at the hands of the men and women sworn to protect them. It’s gone on for far too long and way too often. But bad cops are not the norm. Not all cops should pay for the bad ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor I know “the system” is flawed and people are sick of it (as am I). But the complete disrespect and attempt to harm officers by protesters is equally wrong and there should be outrage about that as well. Rioting (and looting) doesn’t make this type of situation any better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor There are rules of engagement that need to be followed. And ramming into protestors surely isn’t a policy. It’s clearly wrong. But I can’t really be too critical of the cops IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION.  They are setting police vans on fire and attempting to harm officers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor An excellent point. But in the moment, under those conditions, not many of them looked like they wanted to have a chat and get to know those cops better. They were very aggressive. And the cops were clearly outnumbered. Look at what happened to the cops in Chicago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor I’m not saying they should have either. But I’m putting myself in the driver’s seat. I’m trying to protect peaceful protesters from rioters. I’m trying to help my police brothers &amp; sisters restore calm. But most importantly, I’m trying not to get killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @AOC @NYCMayor If I’m in a car surrounded by people that will likely harm me and my family, I’m protecting us at all costs. Those cops who had NOTHING TO DO WITH FLOYD’S DEATH were in a very dangerous situation. As human beings, don’t they have the right to go home safely to their family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @NYCMayor Those are officers in their squad cars trying to uphold the law. They’re also someone’s husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father, etc. The protesters want to possibly assault and injure them. In that instance, if it were you and your family in the car, what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 Yeah, 2020 hasn’t been a great year so far. But the Rangers have a chance to win the Cup, we may (hopefully) have a new president in Nov, and you won’t have to fight with your sister every day when Sep rolls in, so there’s hope! 🙏🏼  Who’s Pop?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Son....you got bodied! But you’re still THE REASON, so keep ya head up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terryjt1 I know that’s most likely how it will play out. Maybe if there’s an expanded roster DQ will dress 3 goalies for the playoffs like he did during the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terryjt1 My brain tells me this is true...but man, I’d love to see Hank be involved in a potential run rather than be a spectator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasdiaz1240 @DonLagreca They’re not winning the Cup this year. Let Hank go out fighting,  with some semblance of dignity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I feel like this run is gravy since they weren’t in the playoffs before the pandemic. AND even though this is like a fresh start for all the teams, they’re still not talented enough to beat Boston or TB. So let Hank at least start against the Canes. If he struggles, then switch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen @DonLagreca @lindacohn - my son @lucasdiaz1240 and I just had a “who’s starting at goal....Igor or Hank?” debate.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy -I've followed your show daily for the last 4 yrs. Today's Daily Mike w/ Don's Top 5 rants is on my Top 5 TMKS moments since I've been on board. Don is a maniac &amp; Michael captured his best/worst moments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcHochman Crap Your Hands Say Yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don made like the '04 Yankees with Last One Standing this week. He was completely in the driver's seat, up to 2-0 and just blew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP Texas Rangers in 2011. Was 1 strike away twice in game 6, in the 9th and 10 innings. They blew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeyvice @SassyFNP Speaking of Ozzie....better on defense, him or Omar Vizquel? If Omar was a better hitter, he’d get my Shortstop GOAT vote. Dude was sick with the glove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael has had so many baby Jordan moments in his life, I'm going to start calling him Harold Miner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN - sadly, similar to Don's "Tidbits" drop last year, I believe "Strap It On" will end up on the cutting room floor during the #DropMadness2021 selection process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling  @Radio_Randy @espnbob @TMKSESPN - new conspiracy theory....maybe the Jets didn't ask Don to come back for their pre and post shows because....well, he just didn't know who was their QB at any given moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP Not saying Jones isn’t the best or  in the conversation...but Schmidt, Robinson, and Brett are also in that conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP And for 23 years on the same team 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP Jones was a better hitter but no one played 3rd base like Robinson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP “Chipper Jones is the best 3rd baseman of all time”  Brooks Robinson- “Hold my Ensure!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcbreeze11 @SassyFNP The ring is the main thing when considering who’s the GOAT. But when comparing coaches &amp; players surrounding both players, MJ had a lot more support than James. True, James did play with Wade, Bosh, &amp; Allen in MIA...but who else was on that team? Is Spoelstra on par w/ Phil? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam @espn Watching #TheLastDance last night to me it made perfect sense  That the director would end the series Using Pearl Jam’s Present Tense Looking back at that time Some think MJ was arrogant to gloat But even he knew while winning 6 rings That he would go down as basketball’s GOAT 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Met Don on my birthday last year (Nov). He was genuinely pleasant. It was very nice of him to come by and say hi to me and my son. We didn’t chew the fat like we were old time buddies...but he wasn’t socially awkward at that moment either.  https://t.co/bDoTt4VV0w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyFNP I don’t know about that.  If Marino went to 4 straight Super Bowls, I think he could have won at least 1 of them. But Kelly was definitely a warrior. Here’s my hot take:  Elway &gt;&gt;&gt; every QB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldWideWob Watching the end of #TheLastDance  To me it made perfect sense  That the director would end the series Using @PearlJam’s Present Tense  Many could look back at that time And think MJ was arrogant to gloat But in the midst of winning 6 championships  Even he knew he was the GOAT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @JeffPassan - hey Peter, I was at the Rage/Wu-Tang concert at the Meadowlands where Zach jumped and sprained his ankle mid-concert. He still "raged" on 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I thought loved Don before....but after this list, I'd go to war for that guy. JOHN ELWAY IS THE GREATEST QB IN NFL HISTORY!!! If he played in this era with Belichick as coach, he would have won just as much as Brady 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers 🔥 🔥 🔥   Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only video game I STILL play to this day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers Diaz #31<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Diaz #31<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 Do island stops on Caribbean cruises count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 Typically, I am lulled to sleep by the faint voices in my head trying to solve all of life's problems. They are especially talkative the second my head hits the pillow 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend posted his collection of favorite t-shirts and I decided to do the same. There are more but these are my current faves.  https://t.co/Irt9L63fpJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inspire_us01 40.... final answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 Lol! I’m saving you from self-destruction. So shut the hell up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - CAN YOU TELL ME HOW JOE MONTANA AND HIS DAD TONY WERE LEFT OFF THE LIST?!?!?! Both hit guys in stride with deadly accuracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - I’m going with the Hulls as # 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02  https://t.co/Alf8PHyE5O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca We didn’t make the cut...but thank you for considering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the last Carl I met was an oddball. It was 10 years ago and he had no idea...NOT A CLUE...how to take a picture with a point &amp; shoot digital camera. It was like it was the first camera he ever saw. BTW, he was 62 years old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyKeyport @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Thank you, Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Lucas Diaz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - did Michael who just try to steal another man's compliment AND asked Don if he changes his underwear daily?😳 #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN Thank you!!!  @LucasDi64009949<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - btw, my son’s name is Lucas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - gentlemen, my son turns 16 today. Any chance of getting a birthday shout out? I’m a loyal listener and got him to watch while he’s home. He loves the show.  This pic with the great Don Lagreca was taken on my bday in Nov.  https://t.co/T3bRC7a70T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, any chance you can give my son @LucasDi64009949 a shout on his 16th birthday? He loved meeting you in Nov when you stopped by to say hi.  https://t.co/r77jhjHWLZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RangersMSGN Krieds shares a birthday with my son who turns 16 today. I took my son to his 1st #NYRangers game in 2013 and Chris gave my son a puck. That was a cool moment for us.  https://t.co/FaUcEySJmF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - wait, there is 1 more comic that could be on the list...Andy Kaufman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy - can someone please tell Michael that just because his show replaced Francesa in the ratings, he doesn’t need to turn into Francesa to stay on top of the ratings. He’s been really nasty &amp; grumpy 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don, I used to perform stand up years ago and I TOTALLY agree with your Top 5 comics list. Carlin is the undisputed #1 in my book. I may have put Williams ahead of Bruce, but that’s the only change I would make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - thank you to Michael &amp; Peter for hyping The Marvelous Mrs Maesel. I’m halfway through the series (season 2, ep 6) and I’m enjoying the heck out of it.  And yes, the Lenny Bruce routines on the show are taken from real shows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 My teenagers have the same name for the 80s hip-hop and 90s alternative music I love and still listen to often. They call it “Ugh” 🤨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - Wood was on '84 Olympic team<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Betty White 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, rather than top 5 busts for that special list, Don would probably use "Top 5 tidbits"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets I guess I got DeGrommed (that is, shut out 🙁)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Diaz #31<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca My trust in @RealMichaelKay is so shaken right now, I demand to see his birth certificate @agundling @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - hey Don, I appreciated your list. Here’s my movie song list:  5) Tequila-Pee Wee’s BA 4) Where Is My Mind - Fight Club 3) Stuck in the Middle-Reservoir Dogs 2) In Your Eyes-Say Anything 1) Bohemian Rhapsody-Wayne’s World<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @JFreshHockey Language, son!!!!  But yeah, I've been looking forward to it as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Feel free to reply to me to test if I can receive your notifications. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - bad guy Michael taking a shot at Ramapo College. But it was funny 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Michael, was Opening Day the only time the Yankees gave out the Reggie Bars? I was 7 or 8 and my brother took me to the Stadium and I remember being given a Reggie Bar when we walked in.  I LOVED the Reggie Bar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Here are my 3 things. The wonderful children God blessed me with. They mean the world to me.  https://t.co/eCrMMbVSr5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @agundling  @TMKSESPN - people stop what they’re doing, call the show repeatedly until they get through, wait on hold for who knows how long, &amp; when they finally get through, they complain about Don’s pen flicking?!? Tony needs a life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Peter, I thought Michael was going to say Charlie broke into spitting "Peter Piper" 😂   https://t.co/POJNVo84AA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve had such a productive day so far. Which means I made the bed this morning, throw pillows and all.  The possibilities for the rest of today are endless. Did I mention I’m binge watching @SchittsCreek from season 1? #thursdayvibes #StayAtHome #WereInThisTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @DenisMinchuk Great memories of that game.  https://t.co/KlGryeXck1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic Love it. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte $FunnyManSam   #BailoutHumans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic Diaz 31 Black  Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnicksFanBlog Sorry for bringing hockey into this convo but I feel like Henrik Lundqvist is the Rangers’ version of Ewing. GREAT player on teams that just weren’t good enough to win it all. Those who blame lack of a title on either player just don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca But he was FROM New York and was THE face of the Nets for 3 years. Reggie was here for 5 and if you asked people worldwide who’s Dr J, they’ll know him more than who is Mr October. He was Jordan before Jordan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - Donnie, DONnie, DONNIE!!! I love you man, even if you don’t agree with my take....but on your Top 5 NY nicknames you could easily replace Tom Terrific with......DOCTOR J!!! Home grown LEGEND!!! 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte $FunnyManSam  Whether it’s me or not, thank you for all you do to help people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckWendig The True Romance fight scene between Arquette and Gandolfini was crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSLToFlushing One of many great moments at @CitiField. Watched BP and met @You_Found_Nimmo. Really cool experience.  https://t.co/Tb8QhtjCGp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Peter may only the name Morey Amsterdam from this SNL skit   https://t.co/v6GmQNXHmd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - not sure who these 2 would bump off Don's List, but Bubba Smith and Rosey Grier could/should have made the list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Congratulations. I’m sure all of the loved ones of the 18,000+ (so far) dead in the United States (great job, BTW) can take comfort in knowing the economy will bounce back. You’re so awesome! #TotalSarcasm #YouSuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I've watched more television than most people I know...and the Newhart finale was BY FAR the best ending of any series I've seen. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanRobertsWFAN A very recent entry...Tyler Bashlor. He’s a hot steaming pile of garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@DonLagreca⁩ ⁦@RealMichaelKay⁩ ⁦@Rosenbergradio⁩ ⁦@TMKSESPN⁩ - thanks Don for taking me back   https://t.co/tn09oMETJc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - @Radio_Randy , your timing once again was perfect with the "Look at this garbage" drop. Poor Don put the microphone part of his phone...against the microphone 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 At least you know they’re not vaping?!?!? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IL0VEthe80s Human League<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @strome18 Would you rather be a top liner playing alongside your brother for several years or win a Cup once?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam @guerrillacandy Solid 8/10. Clairvoyants is my favorite song but Buckle Up is my favorite composition of the album. But the lyrics don’t match the song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NHLJensen @EJHradek_NHL @VallysView - seeing people walking outside without masks these days is like seeing footage of old NHL games with skaters AND GOALIES playing without helmets. What the heck were they thinking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@19Messier94 @DonLagreca The combination of Lagrecas’s excitement and Maloney’s howl makes that call a forever classic. LOVED it and happy I was in the car when I heard it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 As a Mets fan for over 35 years, you would think I wear #31 for Piazza. But instead it’s in honor of Greg Maddux, my favorite player ever.  Honorable mention: John Elway. Still the greatest QB to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lopez2three45 @YahooSports We’ll agree to disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YahooSports So many so I'll give 1 per sport  NBA - Patrick Ewing NFL - Dan Marino NHL - Henrik Lundqvist MLB - Ken Griffey Jr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phontigallo Clive Davis: "Hold my Ensure!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - BTW Don, following up on yesterday's list, I thought of 3 more iconic characters that could/should supplant Kramer and Hawkeye on the list:  1) Norm (Cheers) - still relevant 2) Columbo 3) Sonny Crocket 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, HBO GO is an extension of your HBO subscription<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don, Candy Crush has completely sabotaged my work from home productivity with their unlimited lives. What level are you on? I'm at 4,095 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, Succession is on HBO GO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I LOVE LOVE LOVE Don's sticking it to Tom the obnoxious Yankee fan. He's physically holding up the Daily News for the entire segment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - caller Tom with a #DropMadness2021 entry..."You need to know where your butter is breaded" 😂😂😂 #ClownShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the world is dark...very dark right now. Your show, the NFL Draft, the virtual games &amp; races taking place, the late night talk shows are ALL LIGHT that is necessary at this time. @AdamSchefter could use some of that light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam Balanced<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenAtHome @iamjohnoliver - THANK YOU!!! Besides a cure to the worst virus this generation has seen &amp; a president who cares more for his constituents than his ratings, what we really need is to laugh a little &amp; you guys have brought the funny, both individually &amp; collectively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - #HiGuys, every year since it began, you’ve complained about how @agundling has seeded the drops. And every year #DropMadness is an unmitigated success. #SalientPoint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam @TheGarden I was looking forward to being at MSG tonight. Have my shirt on from the last time I saw you guys at @fenwaypark.    BTW, LOVE the new album #Gigaton  https://t.co/1CgvmoDjPa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @DougWilliamsSNY @martinonyc @Anthony_Recker Sure. Give him a 3 year, $30M contract while you're at it &amp; expect Familia results 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I don't know how the rest of my day will be...but I don't know that anything today will be better than hearing Don spitting "M-E-T-H-O-D Man".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinJo87724013 @Suffering_Jeff @RangersMSGN I was at the Stadium Series game vs Devils. That was cold enough. Chickened out of the Winter Classic ...regrettably...kind of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Bear &amp; your vinyl collection 😬💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFGrAdventure What exactly does “one additional month for each month that the park is closed” mean? My dues are taken monthly even when the park is closed in the off-season. So if/when I cancel my membership, I’ll have an extra month (or 2 or 3 or...longer 😐)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonTierney I worked a few years at Starline Novelties as a teenager after school and summers. There were MANY posters I loved, but this Spud Webb shot by @ADBPhotoInc was the one I was most impressed with.  https://t.co/3PJRIlAhPc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mstlouis_26 @4EverBlueshirts 1) thank you for the magic you brought to the @NYRangers. Almost won it all but wouldn’t have been that close w/o you 2) love that your kids are playing NHL 96. Keep it old school. And... 3) I keep it old school playing NHL14 on my 360. You’re always the leading goal scorer 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 👏 👏 👏 I understand this sense of achievement as I shaved for the 1st time in a week. It was invigorating!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy Wait a second...Push In The Bush want about aggressive horticulture methodology????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The7Line  https://t.co/rtOwM0JuSz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrealeckey225 Yet he still has so many supporters which is completely baffling to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hasbro - can I make a suggestion? In every #PlayDoh set, can you add an empty container so parents can put the nasty mixed up color ball in it and keep away from the nice fresh colors? I’m kinda freaking out right now. 💯   Sincerely,  Every OCD parent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nolegal02 Star Trek: Wrath of Khan smokes the first Star Trek movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @92In82 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti 😂 Sorry for coming at you. When I saw “old man”, I lost it. You know, anger issues 😉  I do think Henrik has allowed some soft goals in key games throughout his career. But I certainly don’t blame him for them not winning a Cup in the last 15 years. It’s always a team effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @92In82 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti Don’t play yourself, kid. You’ve been crapping on Hank for the last 3 seasons 💯  In this case and for most comparisons between great players, championships is the tipping point.  I will once again repeat that it is not a correct measure...but it’s how most people compare careers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@92In82 @LucasDi64009949 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti The logic has been in place FOR YEARS. Players play to win. Not just win regular season games but CHAMPIONSHIPS. So comparing the careers of 2 equally skilled players, the one with more rings will likely be considered greater. It’s faulty but it’s how MOST people would rank them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@92In82 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti As for Ovi, if you notice, the whole “but he hasn’t won a Cup” narrative is gone. Didn’t change how good he’s played one bit...he’s been outstanding since coming into the league. But now even the haters can’t critique him for not being a champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@92In82 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti And Hank will go down as one of the greatest ever, NO DOUBT! But the biggest criticism against him will be that he never won a Cup. Its the same for football (Marino amongst many others) and basketball (Ewing, Barkley, etc). People equate being the GOAT at a position with rings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte $FunnyManSam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@92In82 @AdamZHerman @RaySanti Nowhere did I say Hank sucked. Or Gartner. Or Joe Thornton, etc. But too often, a player’s “greatness” is measured by the # of rings they’ve won. It’s not right but that’s the way it is. If Hank was in net with those Devils teams, they still would have won 3 Cups, maybe more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhotoAmy33 Me, every day for the last 2 weeks  https://t.co/m5RKkvDbNm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - Gigaton: 1) how much I will weigh after this shut-in has been lifted 2) a fantastic album I just finished hearing for the 2nd time 👏   I’m disappointed that I won’t be seeing you at @TheGarden on Monday...but, God willing, I’ll be in the house when you’re back in NYC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howaboutafresca Number 1 Top 40 song on my birthday was Truly by Lionel Ritchie 🤮  But the top dance track was Nasty Girl by Vanity 6 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamZHerman @RaySanti Unfortunately, the only stat that matters is number of championships: 3-0. Hank has played like and SHOULD be a champ. But they just couldn’t get over the proverbial hump. With the young defensemen on the team and coming up, Shesty has a good shot to win a Cup with the #NYRangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen @VallysView @NHLNetwork While they’re celebrating? 🤔 Where are they keeping the Lysol? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen @VallysView @NHLNetwork After this pandemic, I wouldn’t even want to touch the Cup, much less kiss it or drink from it. Unfortunately, this will be the #NewNormal 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets It’s a family thing with us #NYMCards #LGM  https://t.co/8lRIabExQz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen @VallysView - watching @NHLNetwork replays all day, I have these 3 observations:  1) Hawks’ goalie tandem of Belfour &amp; Hasek may be the best ever 2) Gretzky has been supplanted by Lemieux as my hockey GOAT 3) no one should kiss the Cup anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what about The Larry Sanders Show theme?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Law &amp; Order, anyone????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don did say today’s list would cause fights. He is clairvoyant. Hey Don, how about a top 5 worst NY sports trades (excluding the Seaver deal which is easily the worst)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy No bueno<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - so today’s Last One Standing (with the amazing intro from @Radio_Randy ) was truly fantastic. I’m with you Peter...#ATCQ is part of my DNA. But Low End Theory is my game changer. #MicrophoneCheckOneTwoWhatIsThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio - hey Pete, for a Last Man Standing segment how about this....Mario Lemieux or Biggie Smalls? OR if you don’t want to use another rapper (since you used Jay-Z yesterday), how about Lemieux vs Tom Hanks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca In the Wild Card region, that #11 (Donnie Brasco) vs #13 (The Hangover) matchup is the toughest one to pick out of the whole bracket. I can watch both multiple times in the same day. But my ultimate winner is Good Will Hunting. Or is it Shawshank??? I can't decide🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Tales From The Crib was good and the Last Man Standing segment was fantastic. Don's Daily List has some comp today. #BringItDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurCoreth @LucasDi64009949 @NHLonNBCSports @NYRangers I’m confused. He’s a HOFer but not even in the top 20 of modern goalies?!?! I agree he gave up too many soft goals. But he went through stretches where he was the best player on his team multiple times in his career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @FitzGSN_ Agreed. One of their most disappointing losses over the last several years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don, I just watched “The Russian Five” on @NBCSports last night. I didn’t like hockey then as much as I do now so I didn’t appreciate the job Bowman did with that @DetroitRedWings team in the ‘90s. Really good documentary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I’m surprised Michael didn’t guess “A-Rod” 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - does @agundling clapping back at Michael with “Your region has 16 #9 seeds” qualify for #DropMadness2021? That was fantastic! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @DonLagreca @LucasDi64009949 - picking up my wife at work, my baby girl and I are in a NY (Rangers) state of mind.  https://t.co/lzerZPcWQ3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy - watching yesterday's episode. Michael definitely showed signs of cabin fever as he eviscerated everyone (especially &amp; unfairly going after Andrew HARD). I agree, #DropMadness2020 will be Don's to lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @agundling with a tremendous job selecting the Don region. It’s almost unfair to the others. #DonForTheWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I would argue that the player Knicks fans hate most is Charles Smith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyDee07 @4EverBlueshirts Power 3rd ahead of Sons, GOT &amp; Breaking Bad????  https://t.co/Ad4ACtVHOd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drews_Way One for each major sport:  Baltimore Orioles great, Reggie Jackson St Louis Blues legend, Wayne Gretzky Washington Wizards hall of famer, Michael Jordan Seattle Seahawks running back, Franco Harris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Don, you’re getting ripped by a guy who guessed A-Rod for your list of quarterbacks today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - after listening to @agundling ‘s breakdown of the #DropMadness2020 brackets, all I can say is.....not all heroes wear capes #ILoveThisGuy  https://t.co/vd6tRzScoZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcCarig Here’s my all-time baseball lineup all day, every day  LF - Bugs Bunny CF - Bugs Bunny RF - Bugs Bunny 1B - Bugs Bunny 2B - Bugs Bunny SS - Bugs Bunny 3B - Bugs Bunny C - Bugs Bunny P - Bugs Bunny  You Gorillas have ZERO chance against this team.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool Their schedule is brutal, for sure. But I think 7-7 is possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool So glad I wasted your time...LOL! Let’s pick this up when he scores the game winner sending the Rangers to the playoffs on the final game of the season 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool The Rangers would be an even softer team without him. That’s what I’m talking about.  But that’s it, I’m done defending him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool My point about Lemieux ON THE RANGERS is that there isn’t anyone currently on the 3rd or 4th lines that plays with his level of intensity. And while yes, I wish he was more skilled, he is not the sole reason why they struggle at times. The blame can be spread to several players<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFreshHockey Lindgren’s -1.7 is a little surprising.  Fox is a stud. Trouba needs to bounce back next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool Stay on point. Your initial question was, could he be a 3rd line forward on a playoff team? The answer is yes, for a lower seeded team. I already stated that he’s not a stud. AND I also quantified his importance on the Rangers since he plays with a toughness they lack overall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool Ahhh, I get it. You’re one of those (by those I mean condescending assholes).   Next, unless I’m really that dumb, I believe there are 16 playoff teams.  So yes, I do think he could possibly be a 3rd line forward for a playoff team. Maybe not BOS, TB, etc but for CBJ, MIN, NYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool Possibly. Not saying he’s a stud. But he’s not hurting the team, in my opinion. I wish more of the team played with his intensity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Matty_ice_16 @NOT_Trouba @Christian_810 @nyrbarstool Every player on the ice can also score and pass. But some do it better than others. Lemieux gets under opponent’s skin and mixes it up better than any of the bottom 6 forwards on the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey @agundling , just take the Elf 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sroarke_nhl @NHLJensen Absolutely.This has to be tough for Lundqvist especially given how much he's given of himself to the team. But right now the Rangers are on a roll &amp; they're making an improbable push. Quinn's going to ride the lineup that's making it happen. Sad that Hank's not really part of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sroarke_nhl @NHLJensen I agree. Hank &amp; Georgiev were pretty much even before Shesty was called up. But outside of blanking the putrid Red Wings, Hank gave up 13 goals on 73 shots (.822🤮) in 3 losses since 1/1. Not all his fault of course, but I can understand why DQ may have lost confidence in Hank.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - just thinking ahead of tomorrow's Top 5 on #GameMisconduct. Do you factor in the whole season? Or just for the week? For instance, the Rangers are hot...and while they're still not one of the top 5 teams overall, they sure have been for the last 2 weeks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonDChin @NYRangers @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay I was watching the game. About a minute after it ended I wondered how Donnie Pucks sounded calling that incredible sequence. Hopefully the boys will replay it during the show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall Salud, Don! Glad you were right about Kreider. And I'm glad I was right about Skjei (I suggested they trade him last week). I believe the team is strengthened defensively w/Smith alongside Trouba. And the cap space is way more valuable than what Skjei gave them #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StatBoy_Steven @muychael @LucasDi64009949 @4EverBlueshirts @TonyDee07 @strome18 Cap space = super valuable Brady Skjei = garbage on skates @ $5M/yr  Addition by subtraction for the Rangers💯That Gorton and JD were able to find a way to move Skjei &amp; that unworthy contract is a testament to how good those 2 are in building a franchise. #NYR are in good hands!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, will there be a #GameMisconduct today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLNetwork @Jackie_Redmond @EJHradek_NHL Hi Jackie &amp; EJ, I have 3 questions:  1) with Skjei gone, should the Rangers move Lindgren up to 1st line paired w/Trouba? Or go w/ Smith? 2) Better goalie pair, Rask/Halak or Fleury/Lehner? 3) Which team do you think helped themselves the most for this season's playoff run?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Peter, I take offense to you calling them “fat clothes”. I’m a bit husky and would rather you refer to your apparel to be donated as “redundant fabric clothing wear” 😂 #YoureASloppyPig<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts The haters won't put the time and effort to do the work you do but are quick to criticize. Ignore that noise.  Remember, opinions are like buttholes...everyone has one and most of the time they stink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I had the pleasure of meeting @JuliusErving at Disney World about 15 years ago. Had the biggest hands I ever shook. Real smooth dude.  https://t.co/H7yw4SjnBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts Addition by subtraction. Freed up cap space which is way more valuable to the team than Skjei is at this point. Love this move!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts I'm going to love seeing Mika, Breadman, and Kreider going around Skjei multiple times to score next season. The guy was a $5M albatross to this team. #SkjeiGoodbye #PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnicksMemes I LOVE THIS MOVE!!! Now the Rangers get the chance to go around Skjei to score instead of watching it happen to them. #PlayLikeANewYorker #NHLTradeDeadline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @leahhextall - Rangers haven’t made any noise with trades yet (and I’m pretty sure the injuries to Buch &amp; Igor have something to do with it...thank God they’re relatively ok)...but what a wild trade deadline this has been #NHLTrade #PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgweissman @nynormie @BrettCyrgalis @4EverBlueshirts He’s not winning one here. Not as a player anyway. They’re at least 2 years away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgweissman @nynormie @BrettCyrgalis @4EverBlueshirts Hank can leave NY like Brodeur left NJ and Bourque left BOS. Their legacies remain INTACT! So would Hank’s if he left the Rangers to join a contender. He will always be The King of NY. It’s not his fault that the Rangers didn’t win a Cup. Igor will be the Czar, if we’re so lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts I would trade Skjei in a heartbeat. Trouba is virtually unmovable. The two of them are not worth the $13M/yr they’re getting paid. Moving Fox or Lindgren up to 1st line D would help Hank &amp; Georgiev while Igor is out (apparently he needs no help!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettCyrgalis @4EverBlueshirts The rules changed when management sent out "the letter". At that point, Hank made a decision to stay. I know he didn't foresee himself losing a job to 2 younger goalies, but he shouldn't be all that surprised that the team's shift in young players includes the goalie position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts Chemistry is a beautiful thing. While Kreider has struggled in the past, he has shown how comfortable &amp; how well he can play being paired w/ Mika. Mika's going to be here for a while &amp; I'm glad so is Kreider. His production will drop in a few years, but for now, it's a good move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasDi64009949 @JFresh1999 Patience, grasshopper. I trust Gorton won't make a move unless it's absolutely beneficial to the team. Not going to make trades just for the sake of trading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalterMaselli @4EverBlueshirts I totally agree. Won’t be surprised if they move Fast and slot Kakko in his spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalterMaselli @4EverBlueshirts Yeah, it’s a little worrisome. Hope it’s not another Lias situation. But he’s 19 years old. And Quinn hasn’t buried him which means Kakko’s doing something right, just not getting the expected results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalterMaselli @4EverBlueshirts Also, barring any buyouts, after next season they’ll have Staal, Henrik, Smith, and a huge chunk of Shattenkirk’s buyout off the books. Plenty of cap space to re-sign youngsters and pick up solid free agents in 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalterMaselli @4EverBlueshirts I disagree with “far away from a Cup”. They’re set at goalie. Fox &amp; Lindgren have potential to be great defenders in a couple of years. 1st line is dynamic, 2nd line will be great when Kakko figures it out. Youngsters &amp; prospects will make solid 3rd &amp; 4th lines. 2-3 yrs away, IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts IMO...Rangers are weighing his body of work so far. He’s been inconsistent, streaky, &amp; has disappeared for long stretches. But now paired with Mika, he’s playing the most inspired hockey of his career. They should ride that &amp; pay him. He only helps them in their quest for a Cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt in my mind that if @MikaZibanejad doesn’t miss a dozen games due to injury, the @NYRangers would be a Wild Card team right now.  #LGR #PlayLikeANewYorker #SJSvsNYR<|endoftext|>

You guys have me actually LOL today. The interview with @JeffPassan was teetering on uncomfortable. But I was riveted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts Trade him to BUF for Bogosian and picks. Bogo comes off the books after the season is over. Lindgren, Fox, or Tony D moves up to play alongside Trouba and makes room for Hajek. $5M in salary could be used to re-sign Tony D &amp; Strome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL I know this is a stretch,but could the Rangers trade Skjei to the Sabres for Bogosian? Skjei has been a disappointment the last 2 seasons. Meanwhile, Bogo comes off the books after this season freeing up $5M. Would also move Lindgren or Fox up to 1st line w/Trouba #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen (cont) This would free up $5M starting next season which they can use to keep Kreider (assuming they agree on # of years) plus this moves up Fox, Lindgren, and DeAngelo (who they should also re-sign).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL @NHLJensen - The Rangers have a defense problem. They're paying Skjei &amp; Trouba $13M &amp; aren't getting their money's worth (not even close). If Bogosian clears waivers, is there any chance that the Rangers would consider swapping Skjei for him? (cont...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca If Kassian doesn't get at least a 5 gm suspension, then the NHL can't say squat about player safety. I know all players wear chest protectors, but what if his skate slid up to  Cernak's neck? Deplorable move!  My Top 5 this week: 5-PHI 4-COL 3-BOS 2-DAL 1-TB #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts With the way the KZB line has played, it would be a shame to break that up. Kreider looks the most comfortable I've seen him play. Rangers should focus on moving Fast &amp; Georgiev instead &amp; somehow find a way to move Skjei and/or Smith. Keep Kreider &amp; DeAngelo! #PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimAnderson7 @Rosenbergradio Interview was 🔥  Keep keeping it 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TimAnderson7 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @ESPNNY98_7FM Tim Anderson just became one of my new favorite ballplayers. His honesty (and humor) is refreshing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@DonLagreca⁩ - you made the effort to meet me on my birthday. Now it’s my turn to say “Happy Birthday” to you! Have a great day.  https://t.co/GFW9oCr9LR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca-I love @TMKSESPN &amp; dem boys, but you're my fave of the group (shhh, don't tell the others). Not just because I can relate to you (and your rants) more but also because you make listening to a @NYRangers game just as much fun as watching it. Happy birthday, Donny Pucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackCurryYES @RealMichaelKay I'm going #NextLevel....it's already a frontrunner for MLB quote of the year 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall Hi Don &amp; Leah, looking at the @NYRangers schedule, if they had 3 more wins (2 losses to OTT &amp; loss to BUF hurt), they'd be 3 pts behind in the WC race. I want them to keep Kreider for a possible run, but I know how valuable he is right now. Trade or keep Kreids? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN -my son was discovering Don rants. He was impressed that I knew them so well. I was trying to find the Cespedes "he knows how to slide" rant but couldn't find it. The Kranepool rant is a forever rant 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RangersMSGN Can't wait. I'll be in MSG (the "Bread Box"???🤔) tonight #PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy @koolboblove - 20+ years ago, I was a big fan of the #NuyoricanSoul album. Nice fusion of latin jazz, hip-hop, and R&amp;B.   Your album, #NoRequests, is that times💯. LOVE this album. Music I can turn up in the car, listen around the family, at work...Fuegisimo 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - ok, listen to you guys tomorrow. I can't hear this HOF ballot nonsense for another minute. Jeter's in the HOF. I wish that could be enough. The voter owes you (or anyone questioning his/her decision) NOTHING! #SeeYa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - NO ONE OWES YOU AN EXPLANATION! It was that voter's decision to ensure that Mo is the only player voted in unanimously to HOF. He/she didn't feel that Jeter should receive the same honor. They owe you nothing! #GutlessPuke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Peter was taking so long giving his pick, I thought he was going to run through his best sports weekend ever 😴😴😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Peter, maybe Haas G of the UMCs will call some day. Or Chubb Rock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michele_Tafoya ((sitting here wondering if your son knows my daughter and taught her everything he knows)) 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - regarding the otherworldly Nolan Arenado....assuming he continues to play at his current level for the next 10 years....could he possibly be considered the greatest 3rd basemen ever?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - sorry Michael, but I would have bet my kids that "Click" was your favorite movie. You definitely speak about "Click" more than "Animal House".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this "What's My Favorite" segment is comedy GOLD!!! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL I see what you did there 😉  https://t.co/q409pmV71z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca LOL!!! Have your kids discovered Blippi yet? That dude will make you want to cancel the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @JaVvZdaBoSs @Rosenbergradio I was 10 when Lennon was killed and really didn't know who the Beatles were. Nor was their music played much in my house. But even then, I knew it was a MAJOR loss based on the news coverage and my family's reaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - there may not have been a lot of black Beatles fans back in the day, but there are also people now who aren’t basketball or sports fans and don’t feel the way we do about Kobe’s death. Same difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Antonio Gates is a shoo-in for the NFL HOF in 5 years<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - who was a better coach, Jeff Gundy or his brother Stan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the mischievous grin on Michael’s face after dropping a naughty “hard wood” joke, yet neither one caught it. I heard it 😂😂😂  https://t.co/KjnCC9W0yM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lopez2three45 @PJHughes45 @AROD You think??? LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this whole outcry about #Jeter not being unanimously elected is hot garbage. No question he's worthy of being in the #HOF. But he wasn't the best SS ever. Top 5, but not #1. Mo was THE BEST reliever. EVER. He deserved 100%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio  @TMKSESPN - me, watching @TMKSonYES, waiting for Michael's head to explode arguing his awful take 😂  https://t.co/vdxf3nAQZd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Social media (&amp; media as a whole) are bordering on bullying. If a voter(s) knows a player is getting in but doesn't feel like that player should be a unanimous choice like Jeter, that's their right as voters. Enough already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanKutyNJ And yet Jeter still made it to the HOF. But that's just not enough, is it? SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJHughes45 Social media (&amp; media as a whole) are bordering on bullying. If a voter(s) knows a player is getting in but doesn't feel like that player should be a unanimous choice like Jeter (not even the best SS on his team when @AROD got there), that's their right as voters. Enough already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PlayLikeANewYorker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm a Yankees hater and, while I love your show, I don't love how you call a game. But your call on Jeter's 3,000th hit is one of my top 5 favorite baseball calls of all-time. I think it's the use of "exclamation point"!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lopez2three45 @MarvelStudios @Marvel Thanks, Ant Man 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@koolboblove I bet you and @StretchArmy would have laughed a dude out of the studio if they insinuated you would ever be this large 30 years later 💯 Kennedy Space Center?!?? That’s fuego!! Congrats to you both.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PearlJam MSG! Ticket request is in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall Hi Don &amp; Leah...on the surface, the firing of Gallant doesn't make sense. Why not wait for the end of the season? They're 3 pts from division lead w/ 33 games left. They could catch fire &amp; go into playoffs hot. Did he lose the players so badly, they couldn't wait? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Gallant fired??? I know they haven't been playing to their potential...but this is kind of surprising, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Altuve, Correa, Bregman, et al...they just lost their GM &amp; manager. And even if they were in on the sign stealing, it's Beltran whose name is tied to this mess. Yet all he gets is a black mark on his reputation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just curious...in the end, now that the Astros got zapped, does Mike Fiers (who dimed on them) get looked at as a hero or snitch? What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - while Hinch was suspended (and subsequently fired) and Cora faces suspension as well, I think this all really clouds Beltran's tenure as #Mets manager before it even begins. #SoMetsyAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan @RaySanti As a Mets fan, I feel this puts a cloud over Beltran. And it's not even spring training yet 😩 #SameAsItEverWas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - crazy football weekend...Pro Picks is super tight...MLB levels the Astros....Knicks beat the Heat...there may even be even some hockey talk (5 min or so 😉). Plus Super Box Bonanza II. Looking forward to 2:55 #CantWait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, the 3 goalie scenario in NY can't last too long. So is a trade of Georgiev inevitable? What should they get in return if they packaged him with Fast or Krieder? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts Besides the Blues looking like they have 7 guys on ice all game, Hank looks like this game is too fast for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts One of the worst sequences I’ve seen from the Rangers in a while. Awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - yay, a hockey mention, 30 seconds before going off the air! (Sarcasm!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just re-watched the great Larry David interview. Was there a fraud moment from Larry? He said The Boss was terrible &amp; he had to call George to tell him they were omitting his footage...yet, George made it on the show? Huh???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silsnoe @japioPath @mikesbloggity Sad, if it's fake. But if so, it's a hilarious edit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@japioPath @mikesbloggity I'm crying 😂😂😂 Pat's pause was everything...LMAO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy - the Cosell “C’mon” drop and the Boone “You know what? I don’t know” drop are tremendous when utilized properly. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSonYES - Oh, great...the #Lipozene TV commercial with Rodney Peete is back 😩 #SomeonePleaseSackHimAgain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall Hi Don &amp; Leah,assuming Shesterkin pulls a Binnington &amp; plays well enough to earn more playing time, does this make Georgiev expendable? Maybe packaged in a trade with Kreider for some defensive help? Or do they keep Alex knowing they only have 1 more year of Hank? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does the @nypost have a story about earthquakes in Iran on its homepage and not a single mention of those taking place in Puerto Rico)?!?! 😡 #PuertoRico #PuertoRicoEarthquake #PrayForPuertoRico<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "Joker" is more depressing than listening to your former competition for 6 hours straight. Seriously. It's a tough movie to like. But Joaquin Phoenix is tremendous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSonYES @TMKSESPN - Larry David's reaction when asked how he felt about spending time with Peter #PrettyPrettyPrettyEh 😂😂😂  https://t.co/m22FdxWytR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - to Peter's point, the Bills lost in the most Metsy way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Hey Don &amp; EJ, Happy New Year to you and your families. After yesterday's embarrassing loss and their mostly terrible play all season long, are the Sharks' woes attributed more to the play of their defensemen or Martin Jones' lousy goaltending? Or both equally? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @WolfPackAHL What the...????  #playlikeanewyorker  https://t.co/C8IUjs0QbB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts If they're in playoff contention by the deadline, should they still trade Kreider?

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this is one of the worst takes from Michael I've ever heard. Utterly ridiculous. #GetOffMyLawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael is stopping just short of calling Daniel Jones and Cling Frazier, "whippersnappers". #CmonMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - would MLB ever do something as radical as reducing at bats to 3 balls and 2 strikes? That would certainly speed up the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay It's been more than 3 years, but Peter continues looking for clues in his quest to locate Ray from North Carolina #YoureASloppyPig 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, hope you both had a major Thanksgiving Day with your families. Ok, you're assigned to start a team today to win NOW. Which pair are you picking, Ovechkin/Kuznetzkov, McDavid/Draisatl? Or Marchand/Pastrnak?   #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall  https://t.co/0LLfYgr4mb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall Don, thank you so much for stopping by on Monday. Between your visit, Zucc's return, &amp; the OT win, I had a GREAT birthday.   My question is, if you had to start a team right now, which line would you take? Draisatl, McD, &amp; Kassian...or Marchand, Bergeron, &amp; Pasta? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that was a rant, no question. Saying it wasn't a full blown rant is like saying something is half pregnant. It may not have been one of his epic rants...but it was a rant nonetheless. And it was on point #GiantsStink<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSonYES @DonLagreca @NYRangers Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN When Don mentioned that Diana Russini had some "nice tidbits" when she was on the show...Peter and Don's  reactions were hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - a man of his word is a good man. Thank you @DonLagreca, for stopping by to wish me a Happy Birthday.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - hey Michael, you can create a new email address and have your AOL mail forwarded to the new email address. I did that with my antiquated Hotmail account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - is there any chance the entire 4 hour "Best of" program can be made available as a podcast (maybe broken up into four 1 hour segments)? Most people (like me) will be busy &amp; will miss it 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for the shout out. Looking forward to seeing the reaction to Zuc being on the ice again at MSG. He was such a special player for the Rangers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Hey Don, IT’S MY B-DAY! I’ll be in Sec 119, row 19 tonight. Any chance you can stop by &amp; say hi to me &amp; my son?

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergrado @TMKSESPN - only reason why I didn't walk out of theater during "Frozen" was because I didn't want to get arrested for child abandonment. They weren't budging from their seats. I SO hated that movie. You couldn't pay me to see "Frozen 2"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I took my 2 oldest kids to more animated/kids movies than I ever watched as a kid. I can say with 100% certainty that I HATED "Frozen" more than any kids movie ever made. BY FAR!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm guessing @HDumpty39 taught Milo math using $100 bills instead of flash cards 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HumptyCantyShow @HDumpty39 @RothenbergESPN @ChrisCanty99 - it's like an early Christmas when we hear Donnie Pucks @DonLagreca 2 1/2 hours earlier than scheduled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall The Islanders are 1 blown lead away from having won 15 straight games...and they're STILL 5 points behind the Caps. Besides the Bruins, do you see any other team competing for the top spot in the East? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cut4 Beltran caught looking. Cardinals win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - there are movies such as Home Alone, Gremlins, E.T., etc that can be watched by kids like Cali Kay to old folks like Morris from LI. They're not "kids" movies like Toy Story, Smurfs, or Lion king...they're family movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagicNationCP - As a Day 1 #Magic fan, I've experienced all the ups (too few) &amp; the downs (way too many). But I like the makeup of this team. No "superstars" (though Vucevic is a stud) but all around solid talent. Love what Fultz is doing. But Bamba at 34% FG? He's a CENTER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, the Islanders are 1 blown lead away from having won 14 straight...and they're STILL 5 points behind the Caps. Besides the Bruins, do you see any other team competing for the top spot in the East? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay He doesn't get THE joke  https://t.co/R2i4GZs67j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - MLB should punish the Astros by revoking their ability to sign players to multi-year contracts for 3 years. That would hurt their chances to attract big name FAs which in turn would make it harder for them to be competitive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I was offered tix to the Jets-Giants game &amp; turned them down. Sunday is the Lord's day &amp; I bet God would have been angry if I didn't go to church to see those crappy teams. If it was Niners-Patriots, HE'd probably forgive me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall @NHL I know it's early, but do you see the Rangers moving either Kreider or Staal or both by trading deadline? And what should they do with Lias Andersson? Keep him on 4th line, send him to Hartford, or shop him as well? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - BTW, Don's "It was a good day IN CRAP!" is an unjustified underrated drop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - the Knicks are terrible &amp; difficult to discuss...&amp; though the Rangers won last night, they're still not very good...but to lead the show with this fugazi Barkley story is a clear indication it's a slow sports day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Veronica’s Cliset??? 😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @leahhextall @gamemisconduct Lias Andersson is a scratch for tonight's game. I know he's still young and has a lot of potential, but he's definitely underachieving. Should the Rangers consider trading him? Or is it too soon to move on from him? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I respect you guys asking the questions we, the fans, would ask Gase...but he's smart NOT to give himself grades &amp; be fully transparent about how crappy a job he's doing. The Twitterverse would eviscerate him even more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - wait until RJ Bell is on. You're going to hear 0% Don, which is a damn shame. But RJ Bell is a clownshoes yo yo bumchuck and isn't worth Don's breath. Or Peter's, for that matter. #FACTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL The Rangers have played the fewest games in the league. Besides Quinn looking for the right lineups, the schedule had to play a part in their early struggles, right? When Mika is back, their top 3 Centers should be Mika, Chytil, &amp; Strome. Who should be the 4th? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, hope you didn't take yesterday's suggestion for the podcast as a diss to the show. I LOVE #GAMEMISCONDUCT. Thank you for doing it. What happened to Preds last night? Where do you rank the Tkachuk goal?Fantastic shot but I still think Coleman's goal is best of season so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Matthew Katchuk with a SICK shot to end the game with 1 second left in OT! My goodness!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, I love #GameMisconduct. However, I feel like there's a lot of talk about the Rangers &amp; the Metro division (understandably so). Maybe do the podcast in 4-5 minute segments by division, taking 30 or so seconds per team to update their fans with the latest news. #TheMoreYouKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TBLightning *** Evander (stupid auto-correct)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TBLightning I saw Evandro Kane hiding behind a linesman from Zdeno Chara yesterday. Have you ever seen Chara lose a fight? Even in his 40s, that’s a dude not to mess with. Who do you think could go toe to toe with him? I’m going with Ryan Reeves. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the article about the ShagMag women in the Post....wouldn't it be a Top-less 3 story? 😬 BTW, it would have been triple the fun but this dude blocked a 3rd set  https://t.co/yOiHaajLST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Don, after Michael suggested Andrew could punch him in the face..."That's a tremendous offer" 😂🤣 Another great quick nugget from Don<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I sure hope Gil from Bensonhurst doesn't call in to comment about Chapman smiling after giving up the home run 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets JD was solid all season. But "Legend"? That's not Wright! #LGM  https://t.co/EcAECx6Rpw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts Finding the right combos is difficult &amp; results will vary. I don't blame Quinn for still moving players around 6 games into the season. By the 1/4 mark of the season, they should be set. But what I do blame DQ for is intensity. They play uninspired for 1/2 a game. That's on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL I know the Rangers have the youngest team in the league &amp; are trying to find the right lines &amp; defensive pairings..but what's going on with their intensity? Other than game 2, they haven't put together 60 minutes of solid, focused hockey. That's on Quinn, right? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - “I’ll stand in the corner like Blair Witch” 😂  https://t.co/yyvW0ibeVR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca  https://t.co/T30vJ2YtZ7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - Peter, that was absolutely brilliant!!! 😂😂😂 No wonder you are THE REASON! #GilFromBensonhurst  https://t.co/DN50lQaahG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca "I'll take an Islanders call" and "I'll sit in the corner like Blair Witch"...those were hilarious statements! Great reference, btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - really, Michael??? You know what I hear when I'm standing around outside?  "            " ((crickets))  You'll be okay, buddy 😉 #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - I know you guys have a relatively easy job compared to firefighters, surgeons, &amp; the folks who clean up behind circus animals...but it must be tough listening to idiotic calls from clueless people #LoseTheNumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "I'll take Islanders calls" 😂 Don is REALLY done with the yo-yo bumchucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Gil is a MORON! Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4EverBlueshirts 4 games into the season with the youngest roster in the league. They have 3 rookies trying to figure out the game at this level. Because of the schedule, there has been no consistency to date. W/o playing against real comp, it's hard for DQ to figure out what works. Give it time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - forget about Lindsey Vonn's face...I want to know what Jody's face will look like when she hears this fodder #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - listening to the callers complain about the Yankees yesterday &amp; today has served as an unnecessary reminder of why I generally can't stand their fans. Sometimes your good team gets beat by a better team. #SuckItUpButtercups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - while I think RJ Bell deserved to be corrected, Peter was a little bit of a #nozzle in doing so. But I'm glad there was no #StrongQuads backpedaling by #Reasonberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, Carolina is playing so well. I love that Dougie Hamilton has 4 goals while Kessel, Pavelski, Giroux, Kreijci, &amp; Toews have scored ZERO goals combined. Reimer &amp; Mrazec are solid. And Aho hasn't played his best...yet. This team is dangerous! #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyPSports @DonLagreca That's a bogus call. I understand in baseball if an outfielder has the ball in the glove and both the glove and ball fall over the fence, that would be a home run. But in the goalie cases, they have no idea that the puck is stuck in their jerseys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I once called you guys The Beatles of sports talk shows. Listening to that last segment, I feel like you guys are in the Abbey Road phase of your professional lives. #MeanMrMustard #GoldenSlumbers #TheEnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, in the Pens game a shot got stuck in Murray's sweater. Went in right next to his neck and traveled to his back. He leaned forward before the whistle was blown. But had he leaned back and crossed the goal line with the puck in his back...would that be a goal? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFGrAdventure Sunday is the 13th, not the 14th 🧟‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Neither. I'm watching the Lightning vs the Maple Leafs. #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VZWSupport @verizon Would love to have shared this with my daughter before Sep 14th. She surely would have qualified.  https://t.co/Zns0Jr5Dxd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NJDevils @BuffaloSabres Hey Don, the Kings looked terrible last night (as did Jonathon "Not So" Quick). I'm pretty sure they would be just as bad with Campbell at goal. Meanwhile, Carter Hart has been tremendous so far. Who would you rather have between the pipes, Hart or Billington? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn - I can appreciate you guys putting out extra content on ESPN+....but it's really messy. I have to really search to find the only content I'm looking for, #InTheCrease. If you're going to charge extra for it, can you please streamline the site? HELP, @lindacohn!!! #ESPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @Senators Hi Don, there have been some impressive goals so far this season...but which goal was more impressive to you, Blake Coleman's one-handed goal while falling down or Matthew Tkachuk's goal last night...the double tap while the puck was in the air? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy I'm an independent travel agent. Let's chat. DM me with what you're planning. If I can make it happen, we'll both be good 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, as I sit here &amp; try to wrap my head around the fact that the #NYRangers don't play again until Sat 🤬, here's my question...is it possible that Mika has been underrated the last few seasons? I know he's not in the McD or Crosby level, but he's damn good #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm with Don. I have bit the side of my cheek, my tongue, and my lip at one point or another while chewing my gum. #WeAreAnimals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I wasn't a big hockey fan until my son, who was 8 at the time, showed interest in the game. Now #hockey is my fave sport. I have my son to thank for that. Excited to see this #Rangers team #PlayLikeANewYorker #LGR #NYRangers  https://t.co/P0kh7NDHLa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Having Haley, DeAngelo and Lemiuex on the roster, do you think the Rangers will be tough enough to compete against the more scrappier teams in the league? I would like to see Skjei and Trouba become more of a physical presence. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Don, please share your memories of other classic shows like Manimal, Cop Rock, and aka Pablo. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "Veronica's Closet"?!?!? Man, I haven't heard that show referenced since it was canceled in 2000. Same for Dan Cortese who played opposite Kirstie Alley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Game on, Don &amp; EJ! I've read &amp; heard several season previews...no one has the Rangers making the playoffs. Do you think they have enough talent and toughness to grab a WC spot? Or is the competition in the East too strong for them to sneak into the playoffs? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - no hanging on the rim for any of you this week. You guys combined for a perfect score of ZERO! 😂 #MyGudness  https://t.co/1YYjbKv4AC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @drosennhl Welcome back, Don! So happy that hockey &amp; #GameMisconduct is back. The Sharks, Blues, and Avalanche will make noise in the West but neither team will be better than the Golden Knights. With their STRONG top 6, solid D &amp; goaltending, they're my pick to rep the conference in June<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the end credit scenes from "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" is absolutely hysterical.   And Succession is my favorite show on television right now. HBO BRINGS it with their shows and documentaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - while Michael picking NFL games like he's RJ Bell Jr is a little suspicious...when Don was hitting 70% on NHL games last season with Ice Picks, no one questioned it. Double standard?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Franksantopadre Ah, JHS 210 territory.  I don’t go by there often anymore but I never did get used to seeing the Modell’s logo where the Crossbay marquee used to be. The Haven is where I spent most of my movie viewing time as a teen. You could spend the entire day there for $2.50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franksantopadre - just listened to the Griffin Dunne podcast and heard you mention Ozone Park and Crossbay Theater. I used to live in Cypress Hills but went to Haven and Crossbay regularly. Good times! Where did you live in OP? Did you go to Adams? I was a Lane brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if Michael is right about Eli, then this just happened somewhere in New Jersey 😂  https://t.co/k368y6oibK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardestyespn #Facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I know with the twins and TMKS and the pre and post game duties, you have a lot on your plate. If you scale back #GameMisconduct to once a week, that’s better than nothing. We hockey fans are still winning with a weekly podcast #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo  https://t.co/WEv5PMfITr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if Eli is in touch with reality, he knew he should have been replaced 2 seasons ago. He had arguably the best receiver in the game &amp; an All-Pro RB last season...and was terrible. Yes, the O-line was horrific, but so was Eli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if Eli is in touch with reality, he knew he should have been replaced 2 seasons ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - do you think Jeter rooted against Didi when that transition took place?   On 2nd thought....don't answer that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - your take on Eli seems really hypocritical. You praise him for the good guy he is but then think Eli's rooting against Jones' success. You're basically attacking his character but think the Giants owed him because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Donny Pucks....looking forward to the return of #GameMisconduct. The NYC area will have plenty to cheer for as all 3 metropolitan teams look to be very competitive this season. A fine time to be a hockey fan #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo  @EJHradek_NHL @lindacohn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - but why is SNY Twitter going at Stroman with the Yahoo article? That doesn't make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @MStrooo6 Did I miss something? Is SNY no longer broadcasting Mets games? Why are you going after one of your guys? Also, put Tanaka and Paxton on the Jays &amp; Mets...that wouldn't be their records. #Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Have you seen SNY Twitter going after Marcus Stroman? Can someone explain this to me? Isn't that a bad optic considering they're the home of the Mets? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio  @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - also released ON THE SAME DAY as "The Low End Theory" was Nirvana's "Nevermind" and The Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". What a day in music history 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - HOLD UP!!! How can you show the pic of Michael hanging on the rim THAT I CREATED...and give the credit to someone else?!?!?! #YoureHurtingMe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Donny Pucks...I'm already looking forward to the 1st #GameMisconduct of the season. So many things to discuss. Are the Devils legit contenders again? Can the Rangers' young defenders get it done? Is Varlamov an upgrade to the Isles' 2 headed goalie situation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @realDonaldTrump @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - we hear Michael preach "team first" often. So then how does Manning dictate how his end with the Giants should play out? How does Eli's decision help the team? As I stated when I called yesterday, he is NOT the solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - on the phone with my friend...he's killing me for flying off the handle and having a short fuse.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - the "bad team" problem has been the case since '98 when the league added the Rays &amp; D-backs.

<|startoftext|>@kerbjack That's REALLY cool. Great job on the vinyl.  I missed out on getting a poster at Fenway so my daughter painted this, framed it and gifted it to me for Christmas. I know exactly what you mean about the love &amp; pride you feel.  https://t.co/ex3yqTxJGa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Alonso &amp; Judge are both "Happy Days". The difference; Alonso is season 1 when they didn't have a laugh track &amp; Chuck hadn't vanished yet. Judge is Fonzie fixing the jukebox with a fist bump. Sorry, Don....Pete's a bit humdrum #Aaayyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic Love that Vucevic is signed. This team is doing what the Nets did. Hopefully they will have more interest from big name free agents next off-season. However, "unfinished business" is getting Markelle Fultz to play effectively in more than 33 NBA games. WTH is going on with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay - hey @Radio_Randy, start the news sounder....THIS JUST IN....sources say there's a 100.5% chance that I am listening to @TMKSESPN starting at 2:55 today. @PeteAlonsoHRChamp #PeteAlonsoForPresident2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL @DonLagreca - with the rebuilding process basically done and the chances of them making the playoffs heightened, is there any chance the @NYRangers sign a vet or 2 still out there like Thorton or Marleau? Do they have the cap space to do so? #LGR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pig_Pen @GMBVW @MetsBooth @MLB 36 years I’ve rooted for this team. I’ve never been more disgusted by them than right now. 19 blown saves?!? And there’s still half a season left!

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @agundling - I just heard last night's interview with @jackhughes43 . Peter was so excited when he found out that Jack was a Jew (well half-Jew, so Jew-ish 😉). Can you imagine if Jack was drafted by the Stars? ✡️😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca That’s great, Don. Teach them while they’re young. My wife knows how big a fan I am of the group and gifted me some Beatles swag for Christmas.  https://t.co/OqOdQejwCZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, as a #NYR fan, I'm very excited about the Trouba trade and the picks they drafted. So far this off-season, which 3 teams do you think helped themselves the most between trades and drafting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy @MICROdon We worked together. Always kind and with a smile on his face. I'm shocked and saddened as well.   R.I.P. AL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - why does Hicks get a pass for being on the IL for 2 months but you eviscerate the Mets for the Lowrie signing when he hasn’t had a chance to prove his worth to the Mets? 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what was Babe Ruth's real name?!?!? You might have well asked him, "The Yankees' uniform color is white and ___________?" or "What state do the Yankees play in?" #SteveChrist #DontWantToUpsetJim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - can we call Brian Windhorst, "Seahorst" going forward?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - with Michael sounding like he's going through puberty, I think there should be a "McFly-off" between him and Peter. #RadioGold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeGaffneyNOW @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN That was so funny. Meanwhile, I was losing my mind because I knew the answers to 9 of the first 10 softball questions Michael tossed. And I’m a Mets fan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - why couldn’t Peter be this funny last night especially on the last day of the books? Marty McFly is always strong even when it’s bad 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -  "Montreal ExRays" is just slightly better than the "Oscar Gamble" joke  #HehThatsFunny<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, I'm calling fraud on your Jed Lowrie comment. When the signing was made, you were on board with it. It's only now that he hasn't played due to injury that you're crushing the move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Michael, I suggest you watch this during every break.

Channel your energy, boys or you'll self-destruct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - please, Please, PLEASE!!!! Can we have a conversation between Marty McFly and Stephen A Smith???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - once Durant is signed by the Knicks, the show should be renamed to "The KD with a little P Show" 😬 (I'll stick to my day job)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN- the Warriors won 2 Finals in a row w/o KD. AND they have Boogie Cousins. Even at 75%, he's an effective player. The loss of Klay for 1 game &amp; parts of another did hurt the team. But TOR played well EVERY game. They earned it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - NBA should run 10 seconds off the clock if a team calls a timeout without having one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - can we hear @Rosenbergradio play out a conversation between Michael J Fox as McFly and Stephen A Smith??? That would be RADIO GOLD!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @agundling - It was either John's or Dalessandro's.  Did we make the right choice? Or is there an even better spot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - I went to John's Roast Pork in Philly for a cheesesteak sandwich and it was DELICIOUS!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Pete_Alonso20 @BR_MLB Hugging the polar bear on Marcy Ave?? That made me actually LOL! @Pete_Alonso20 , we needed a guy like you on this team. I can't wait for the team to retire your #20 jersey in 2035! 😉 #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealSmith22 - it was cool to see you on Friday during brunch. Hope you went with the French toast 😉 I meant what I said...you deserve more playing time this season. Glad the team is finding it for you. I'll be at the game tomorrow rooting for the orange and blue #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling - I meant to ask you this on Friday but I was sidetracked and forgot.... I went to Philly for the 1st time since I was 6 years old (in 1976!!!). Instead of trying Geno's or Pat's, I went to John's Roast Pork. Right decision?  FYI - I LOVED my sandwich!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - yesterday's exchange btwn Jessica &amp; Jimbo was great!

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Peter, just use the MSG app to stream games. Don’t need it as part of the Hulu package.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - What’s stranger than the thought of Michael hanging with @oldmanebro? How about Lil Penny &amp; Lil Don chillin’?  https://t.co/iasUPLY8We<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - as a huge Mets fan with many Met fan friends, NONE OF US, not one person I know was happy that the Mets re-signed Familia. We were all glad he was gone. He wasn't good. And the A's, who needed a closer, didn't even keep him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hof803 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @Mets @SugarDiaz39 8 + 31 = 39  🤓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davitude @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @Mets @SugarDiaz39 Thanks, Dave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - I called @TMKSESPN when the @Mets traded for @SugarDiaz39 after my wife had given me a personalized jersey. I wasn't sure if it was fraud to wear #31 with my last name since Diaz is #39. Well, I believe I found a solution #DoTheMath  https://t.co/pFcHwukX7K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Sure, because the last former A’s reliever we signed has been so good #Sarcasm #Familia #TheyBothStinkNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta add Jamie Navarro to the mix as well. Much better than his dad Julio Navarro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - looking at father-son pitchers in MLB history, based on W-L and ERA it looks like Lance McCullers Jr is the only son who is/was better than his dad. Not by much though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @GMBVW - your crappy manager has been bailed out yet AGAIN! If he states he's going to use Diaz for 4 outs, he should ACTUALLY USE DIAZ FOR 4 OUTS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv I haven't stopped wondering why he wasn't fired on Monday, He may be likable...but he's TERRIBLE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyjccuddy A pretty girl, a crippled kid, and a dwarf walk into a castle. Years pass, winter is coming, people get killed, dragons show up, yada, yada, yada....the 3 of them end up ruling the world. The end! #GOT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mets Because the #Orioles don’t suck enough 😂 #Mets are up $499,999 in this deal. Good riddance, Keon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES  So glad I DVR the show. I heard this K.O.B.A. moment while driving yesterday.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm not sure which team is harder to root for, the Knicks, Jets, or the Mets. They are legendary in their ineptitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv YAY!!!! Another crappy season down the drain. How lucky are we #Mets fans?!?! #MeetTheMess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Buster_ESPN @teixeiramark25 - it's 11:15AM ET on the day after the Mets lost their 5th game in a row, swept by the lowly Marlins, a team that held them to 3 hits in 2 games. Why is Mickey Calloway still the #Mets manager? The man has lost his team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Now THIS is the lineup 🔥 #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN I'm saddened by the fact that @TMKSonYES won't be televised today. I really do think you'll spontaneously combust while discussing the Knicks losing out on Zion and the Jets firing Maccagnan. #MustSeeTV @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - @RealMichaelKay , to say it's a FAIL on the @nyknicks part if they get the 4th or 5th pick is too strong. #Knicks don't control the ping pong balls. They did what they had to do to put themselves in the best position to get the #1 pick. It's all luck now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - hey Don...the GM/CEO of weather is...GOD! You can take it up with him, but I wouldn’t. 😇🙏🏼 #OhDearGod<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, I have 2 questions for you: 1) So far Kaapo Kakko is lighting it up at the IIHF tournament. Do you still think it will be him &amp; not Hughes picked 1st overall?  and  2) can Binnington and dem boys stop the Sharks? Blues looked grossly overmatched in Gm 1 #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Don’s hearing is apparently suffering #UseKayForDivorces  https://t.co/CLS8z2dwfJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that Auteri home run call was FANTASTIC!!!! #MakeDreamsComeTrue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I understand that someone else on the #Mets should step up &amp; lead this team, but Alonso is 1) he's 24...not a kid, 2) looks to be a leader, &amp; 3) DELIVERED last night. He's leading them in HR, RBI, R, OPS &amp; 2nd in H &amp; BA 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Did we though??? 🤔 Glad you're o-Kay. Hope it doesn't slow down your response time when hanging up on mouthbreathers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - here are some stats for your segment about the Mets' problems with Familia. Why the Mets signed him for 3 years is beyond me or any other Mets fan I've commiserated with 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @D_AbrianoSNY These numbers don't lie: 6.28 ERA, 2 blown saves, 16 hits given up incl 2 HRs, 12 unintentional walks to 15 SOs, 2 HBP &amp; 1 WP. All in 14.1 innings. He blew 25% of only 24 save opportunities last year. A's didn't resign him and they needed a closer! Why did they bring him back? 🗑️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does $10M/yr get you?... 6.28 ERA, 2 blown saves, 16 hits given up incl 2 HRs, 12 unintentional walks to 15 SOs, 2 HBP &amp; 1 WP. All in 14.1 innings.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca If the top 4 or 5 teams in the NFL, NBA, or MLB lost in the 1st round of their playoffs, I believe there wouldn't be the same type of excitement as there is for the #StanleyCupPlayoffs.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Don with one of the GREATEST movie references ever #IDrinkYourMilkshake #ThereWillBeBlood  https://t.co/vlMolQOgNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca WHYYYYY?!?!?!?!  Ok, hear you tomorrow 👍🏽  https://t.co/BtfwCZnqoq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franksantopadre - listening to old #GGACP episodes...Lange, Einstein, Oswalt, Charles...so entertaining. I wish I knew some of the older obscure movies and actors being referenced. But the episodes are like funny history lessons. Keep up the great work! #Hocapontus 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @SanJoseSharks @GoldenKnights The 5 min major was bogus &amp; put VGK in a position they shouldn’t have been in. But giving up 4 goals in 4 minutes...that just can't happen. It changed how I felt about VGK advancing. At crunch time, the Sharks and Jones showed they were more deserving to advance #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - the 5 min major was unwarranted and put VGK in a position they shouldn’t have been in. But giving up 4 goals in 4 minutes in a game 7 when they were up by 3, I almost felt like they didn’t deserve to win. But I’m sooo glad they tied it!!! #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NHLCanes @DallasStars Playoffs have been ridiculous. If Caps lose tomorrow (which is crazy that they're in this position), all 4 division winners would be eliminated in the 1st round. Has that ever happened? Also, which Martin Jones shows up tonight? I think VGK will break him tonight #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - 15 minutes into the show, I truly believe this is the day Don walks off 😨  https://t.co/6HjzTF9JBB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killernj13 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES SPORTS TALK RADIO!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - thanks for taking my call. I stand by my claim that you guys are The Beatles of sports talk radio. No one is better.  #GooGooGaJoob  https://t.co/3dfnmjs0n3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I think there's an inside story as to why the Yanks celebrated like they did. I'm guessing it's something that leaked from the Red Sox about them. Otherwise, it's a yo-yo move by the team #Bigly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @wingoz @TMKSESPN - can we compare the Lightning being swept by the Jackets to the Yankees losing 4 in a row to the Red Sox in the '04 ALS? I know the scenarios are different...but they were both equally improbable when it happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Matz and Rosario tonight  https://t.co/ldFubpkGz9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - when you traded #Familia last year, almost no one was sad to see him go. He was Armando Benitez 2.0. WHY WOULD YOU BRING HIM BACK?!?!? For 2 years??? He was a liability last year and he still is. Please try to use him as little as possible. Thanks - Frustrated Mets fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaMarks Maybe the expectations were for Dragon porn??? Arya to kill her family and everyone in Winterfell? An alien invasion??? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - running Vargas out there every 5th game is roughly 30 losses. So the Mets would have to go 100-32 the rest of the season. They really shouldn't care how much they pay to fix this. Otherwise, it'll be another lost season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights @reavo7five He successfully kicked Kane's ass last night. Nice win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam In @RollingStone magazine's mailroom. All it took was one listen to this song (and album) and we were hooked...for life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, LA was down 3-0 in the 1st rd in 2014. We know how that ended (sorry, Don 😢). Do you think TB can rebound or is CBJ too good right now to beat 4 games in a row? Also,what do Sharks do with Jones? In last 2 games he's given up a goal every 5 shots taken #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @BlueJacketsNHL @TBLightning Maybe TB can come all the way back like LA did in 2014. But this is definitely an eye opener #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - in 2014, the @LAKings were down 3-0 in 1st rd and were outscored 17-8 at that point. All they did was win the Cup that year. So it looks bleak for @TBLightning (especially if they lose Kucherov) but there’s still hope #GameMisconduct #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - how about Logan “Steel Onions” Couture starting the 3rd period. He took one right in the nads yet he’s out there competing #HesAHockeyPlayer #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleSturino @BarryDavis_ @sauga960am Jared’s a sick freak. But how about an honorable mention to the Dell guy whose career went up in smoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - 2 things about Alonso sitting  1) If Dom Smith goes 3-for-4 with the game winning RBI, then sitting Alonso is a non-issue    and  2) Alonso can STILL get in the game as a pinch hitter and possibly replace Smith on the field<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I agree that Alonso should be in the lineup....but Dom Smith has also been hitting well so he should get playing time as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mets have been decimated by injuries the last few years and Yankees fans have shown little to no compassion because of it. You know what they say about KARMA 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES Yankees fans : "We can't win with all these injuries" Mets fans: "Hold my jar of tears" I don't wish ANY player harm...but in true Kay fashion, I'm going to gloat if the Yanks struggle all season because of injuries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic @Gatorade No love for out-of-town Magic fans??? Well, there goes my chances 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PureMagic #NBAPlayoffs #LetsGoMagic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I remember making calls to hear some scoring...but it wasn't Sportsphone I was dialing 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - if you slow Keith down, he'd sound like old guy Frank  #ItsTheGameOfBaseball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - me, after listening to your caller Keith  https://t.co/CWMwUZNvCt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I don't care who's a fraud or not...the fact that you guys have spent more than 15 minutes talking about hockey is TREMENDOUS!!! #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I'm a diehard @NYRangers fan. I'm not rooting against the #Isles ....but I'm not rooting for them either. And I definitely don't want them winning the #StanleyCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxBretosSports Mastella??? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I'm watching the Masters &amp; I want to say "sorry". I'm not a golfer...but Tiger at the Masters is must see TV. He's the exception to the rule. Otherwise, I'd pay the "sport" no mind. Your golf rants are on point 💯 #TigerWatch  @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @wingoz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights You're awake? How about the team? Because last night, most of them were 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca It's only 1 game, but Knights looked bad yesterday. They're my sleeper pick for the West in the #nhlbracketchallenge. I'll be out of contention next week if they don't snap out of it. What do you think is the biggest difference between this year's team &amp; last? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, the Mets tweet their lineup before EVERY game. Follow the #Mets, Yankee boy 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights My team is out, so I'm rooting for you guys. #KnightUp #VegasBorn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Amed_Rosario Lineup is great. The bullpen, though.... 😳  Hopefully, #Thor can get to the 7th inning   #LGM #LetsGoMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - listening to podcast of yesterday's @TMKSESPN ...Michael, have you ever watched #ArrestedDevelopment ? I challenge you not to laugh no matter where you watch...at home, on the plane, in the bathroom 😳 It's a very funny show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NJDevils @NYRangers I'm glad the #NYR have the 2nd pick. Less pressure deciding who to pick 1st. Assuming TB wins the Cup, do you think the Rangers would trade the Jets &amp; Bolts 1st rd picks? Also, what's the likelihood of the Stars making the WC Finals? 4 1st rounders would be nice!  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Obi-Don Kenobi....you’re our only hope  https://t.co/uC4SgTxXUC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I felt like yesterday’s excellent Carton interview “Heidi”ed #DropMadness19 . Totally stole Don’s thunder on his 3-peat. Congrats to the Notorious D.O.N., king of the drops.  https://t.co/H0JhhTKuw9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - close the polls. It’s no contest....congrats to Don on his 3-peat. He’s the Notorious D.O.N. #KingOfTheDrops #DropMadness19  https://t.co/N7fSr1I8nH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers Great job by David Quinn this season. Had the team competing most games while making everyone accountable. I’m betting you’ll be a playoff team next season #LGR #LetsGoRangers #Rangerstown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL - my son thinks TB will choke in playoffs so he’s picking BOS to beat CAL in Finals. I’m going with TB beating VGK (maybe COL) in Finals. #NHLBracket #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RothenbergESPN Should be an MLB rule change. Blow the lead, you can’t be credited with the W. Familia has earned a few wins this way in his career and he didn’t deserve them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Or “The Sausage King’s Revenge”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGR #LetsGoRangers #RangersTown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - I think Michael is hitting some of the old bubonge in Baltimore. Andrew did a good job with the seeding. Blame the listeners for their yoyo bumchuck voting #WellHeyWellHey  https://t.co/JImMpBYnap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I tweeted this when you let Ira ask Sam Darnold that 1st question on the air. I'm pretty sure there will be more personality exuded from him when he calls in than from Bowles. I really hope he doesn't "#SUCK" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Though it's tough to decide which team I want to make the playoffs, MTL or CBJ....I think the Canadians would give the Bolts a better fight in a playoff series. Agree?  Top 5: 5) Flames 4) Caps 3) Avalanche 2) Bruins 1) Lightning  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic @owen_fasolas Been a fan since Day 1. Playoffs or not, this was a good season. Hope the team continues to progress rapidly and become a force in the East next season #PureMagic #LetsGoMagic #TrueBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - i don’t care what you guys say...tremendous job by Andrew with his #DropMadness19 seedlings. 3 of the 4 drops are strong contenders to be the winner #NotThePeterRegion  https://t.co/8hZjFfqGGJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - having a Michael moment...now #Yankees fans are going through what us #Mets fans went through last season with injury after injury to the team. I don't wish ANYONE harm...but I'm kinda happy their fans are suffering #BadGuy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I was annoyed there was so much #Yankees talk to start the show. I wanted to hear more about the #Mets. But this whole '86 nonsense is NOT what I wanted. #Sad #NoCode<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - that last caller's quiet laugh HAS to be a drop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMBVW Thank you for the moves you’ve made to solidify the roster. Can’t wait for Sat when I’ll be in DC cheering the team on. Even my baby girl is excited about this season. Best of luck to you and the @Mets team. #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMets #Mets  https://t.co/4N0Oa0Kq3s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @sidrosenberg @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES  - why doesn't @RealMichaelKay finish the show on occasion? 🤔 #WHY?!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @ReneRivera13 Shouldn't have traded him in the 1st place. Glad he's back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN -what @Rosenbergradio said is true. #DropMadness is worth signing up for Twitter (though you already have Twitter if you're reading this). Today's Bobble/Blanket matchup is tough. Both are worthy of advancing. Make your vote count!  https://t.co/lurmpYyLZf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets The question is....@Pete_Alonso20 ??? Or @TheRealSmith22 ??? Or both??? Both equally deserving. I'll see you guys in DC on Saturday.  Sec 116 will be LIT!!! #LGM #LetsGoMets #Mets #NYMets #MetsFanForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - was that John Travolta answering the trivia question on the @HumptyCantyShow ? #IdinaMenzel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - oh man, today's #DropMadness19 is LIT! I can't believe "Staten batting 2nd" is struggling in its matchup. It's clearly the better drop.  https://t.co/P8WMI82Yz2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - it was Extra Winnings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleSturino Nice job, Michelle. I tweeted the question about the Knights. I'm a diehard #NYR fan but I do like the Knights in the West. The pickup of Stone has reignited the team &amp; I can see them going to at least the WC Finals if they stay relatively healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - love you guys...but I had to shut the show down and listen to the Game Misconduct podcast. I can't listen to another caller attack Izzo's handling of his player. It's ridiculous how soft we've become as a society. MAN UP!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - guys, leave @agundling alone #HeTriesEveryDay  My votes are in. Make yours count!  https://t.co/GroIbzbwan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @MichelleSturino @SiriusXMNHL Are the Knights as good now as they were during last year's amazing run?

This is ever-changing, but for today I'm going with:  Tribe Called Quest - Low End Theory Pearl Jam - Ten Blind Melon - Soup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - I don't need to hear any more of this Dolan interview (though I am) to tell you that you did a great job. You kept it 💯 with him  @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@23savage____ - Dolan gave you mad love on @TMKSESPN 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The Rangers are 16-22 in games decided by 1 goal, 7-13 in OT/SO gms. Quinn has them competing just about every game. This off-season by adding a scorer or 2 &amp; their young players progressing as they have, I see them making the playoffs next season. Your thoughts? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lopez2three45 - did you see this? @brielarson also went behind the concession stand to help out. I give the movie another 1/2 ⭐️because of this 😂. This was in Clifton, NJ #CaptainMarvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Fellas....can someone please put out an APB on Johnny Hockey? 1G, 11Pts in the last 19 games? What's going on with Gaudreau?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lopez2three45 Twitter making thing interesting. 🤔 That’s all I got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @Radio_Randy @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSonYES @TMKSESPN - gentlemen, I am raising my hand ✋🏽to volunteer to help RJ &amp; Andrew with #DropMadness2019. Just tell me how I can help and I'm there 💯  #Hello? #WhosThis #WhileGoodNotWeepWorthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - do they make police hats in Michael's size? 😬 #MyHeadIsNotBig #MyForeheadIsLong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN Papa rellena is the ish!!!! And with that double Cuban espresso, you don't need a plane to get to your next destination...you can just run there 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN Store has a sign that says, OPEN 24 HOURS. I went at midnight and it was closed. The next day I stopped in and I said, "I thought your store was open 24 hours". The guy says, "not in a row 🙄"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, thanks for giving me the Ice Pick for last Sunday's Preds-Wild game. Once again, you were right (I never doubted you).  With the Kings struggling &amp; primed for a rebuild, should their future plans include Quick? Would the cap hit be too much to move him? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - Chris Canty saying "You can't touch another man's meat" 😲 is like a 12 or 13 seed for #DropMadness2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -so the #Mets decide, rather than load up their roster with superstars (like Anthony from Brooklyn would love the #Yankees to do), they're assembling an All-Star team of advisers. I like the moves. Still need a pitcher, though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salced70 @JarvFromOz @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN And the guy who requested that Sunday pick (✋🏼this guy!) didn’t place the bet. But I definitely would have if I had the chance #NeverDoubtedHim<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - sure, he may be overrated as a player....but this was a great thing Carey Price did for a young fan.    https://t.co/Mx04EeTHp6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay You said Wade's shot was luck. Then compared it to Columbus discovering America (which was luck 💯). But don't we celebrate Columbus' mistake? It's a national holiday. Yet, you can't give Wade 30 seconds to celebrate his "mistake"? #BadGuy  @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca With 4 teams - Columbus, Montreal, Carolina, &amp; Pittsburgh - fighting for 3 playoff spots in the east, which team do you think will miss the playoffs?  My top 5 for the week:  #5 - Hurricanes #4 - Islanders #3 - Flames #2 - Lightning 😲 #1 - Bruins 💪🏽  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael tried to diss D Wade's buzzer beater by saying it was luck and compared it to Columbus discovering America. Don't we CELEBRATE Columbus' mistake? Why can't he do the same for Wade's shot? #BadGuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrainofJFK2013 @PearlJam @DaveFerch Now THAT would blow my mind. Thanks 🤘🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you guys need a hug  https://t.co/a2yAuXBNBI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - can someone tell me where the "you can get a bobblehead or a blanket" sound bite comes from? I recorded yesterday's episode which didn't broadcast on YES until 4:00 and I think I missed that caller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Injury-wise, the team is in mid-season form already....SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Where in the world is @TJ_Rivera_ ? Still rehabbing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The way the #NYR roster is constructed right now, what would be your top 2 lines offensively and defensively? Also, which players do you think they'll target this off-season? Panarin? Duchene? Karlsson? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithSLabell @PearlJam @DaveFerch Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyn7severedhand @PearlJam @DaveFerch Thank you. I’m in awe of her talent. I can barely draw stick figures 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - are you guys STILL talking about 86 yr old Mike's phone call reminiscing about the good ol' baseball days? You guys have spent about 5X the length of his call discussing it...and his call took 20 minutes (or so). #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - remember when Metallica came out with the Black Album? People complained they went too soft. But they were wrong, just as you guys are about Don. He's more subdued, but still has that edge he's always had #NothingElseMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam @DaveFerch I missed out on picking up the Fenway poster I wanted...so my 16 yr old daughter painted this for me as a Christmas gift. Does this count?  https://t.co/3jcH5XrBCZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv So did 28 other teams. And they didn't really "miss out" if there wasn't even a chance of it happening. No story here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJ_Rivera_ @GMBVW @Mets - I'm hearing a lot of names being mentioned....but where ya at, TJ??? I'm rooting for you, brother. Wishing you a healthy, productive season. #LGM #NYMets #Mets #LetsGoMets #MetsFanForLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL What are your thoughts on the #NYR trades? I think what they received for 2 players who were going to likely walk after the season &amp; a defenseman entering journeyman status, they did pretty good. It's a stretch but the potential to have four 1st rounders is great #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMBVW @Mets I meant the 30th. I’m so excited to be there, I wasn’t thinking straight 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - me, waiting for that old guy's story to end. Love that he's lucid at 86 years old. God bless him. But you're not sitting around a campsite sharing memories. The SHOW MUST GO ON! #YourPhoneCallIsOver  https://t.co/AGEkRZMgb5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMBVW There's a group of 10 of us @Mets fans that will be at the game in Nationals Park on 3/29. We'll be about the same distance behind the #NYM dugout. We'll make sure you and the team hear us chant "LET'S GO METS!!!!". #MetsFanForLife #LGM #NYMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - how do you feel about the #NYR moves the last few days? I don't love that they moved Zucc &amp; Hayes, but I think those were the right moves at this time. Lots of draft picks and cap space to make this off-season VERY interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN Would your wife really think you’re that....“shallow”? 😬😂  BTW...Bradley Cooper’s lady isn’t sweating Gaga at all, I’m pretty sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy - me, after Michael announces that Andrew &amp; RJ are working on #DropMadness2019  https://t.co/pHSQUhQQbg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Hey Don, Sidney Poitier says "hi" 😂. Yesterday's Ice Pick was a nailbiter. #RedWings almost pulled it off. Regarding the #NYR, what are their options with Shattenkirk? Does he have any trade value? Why do you think his production is so low this season? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @LeBatardShow @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @ESPNNY98_7FM Yes, this happened earlier 😂  https://t.co/FsFZAUIWt1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Don, Kurt Cobain would have been 52 today. He's ACTUALLY dead! #JustSaying #RIP #ComeAsYouAre #Dumb #AllApologies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca DON'T LET THE YO-YO BUMCHUCK CLOWN SHOES WINDOWLICKERS WIN!!!! At 29-11 (72.5%), like @RealMichaelKay said yesterday...you're doing better than a guy who FIXED GAMES! #TimDonaghy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -this show has been a whirlwind. First, Landon Collins was gone. Then there was a false alarm. Then it happened to be true. Then Sidney Poitier died...then he came back to life...and now Ice Picks is dead. My ❤️can't take this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - love the profile pic. Beautiful family. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "Who's Anna Wintour"? Seriously, Don?? You're in media...she's a GIANT in the magazine industry. Even if you purchase your attire at Target, you should know who she is. Love ya, but I'm #JustSaying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @JeffPassan - Peter &amp; Don...I was at the Wu-Tang/Rage concert at Continental Arena where Zack did a jump and sprained his ankle. Still rocked the rest of the show. Were either of you there? #BullsOnParade<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - you guys are making me uncomfortable 😂  BTW, I'm guessing the person Don is referring to is on the air from 10AM to 1PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallereyecenter @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Hey, it's the guy from "Abducted In Plain Sight" circa 1976  @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I love when guys like Joe call to CRITICIZE the show. Why listen? Why not watch the History Channel and leave you guys alone? The only people dying are those waiting for Joe to finish his thought. #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - we NEED to see Rothy's outfit. Help us out here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Lundqvist has been solid most of the season. But last night he didn't play well and has been on the losing end in the last 4 games he's played in. Should we be seeing more playing time for Georgiev as the season winds down? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Donnie Pucks - Happy Birthday, my good man. Hope you have a great day with your radio fam and your actual beautiful family. Thanks for entertaining us clowns on the show and #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(cont'd)   It's called "Big Sully Castaway in The Terminal at Philadelphia" 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - I like the Tom Hanks vehicle where he turns into a 10 year old,grows up,flies a plane into the ocean safely,but ends up on a remote island, is rescued &amp; taken to an airport where he has to live because he's sick &amp; is discriminated against (1 of 2)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I couldn't disagree with Peter more. I NEVER wear a dress shirt without an undershirt. Why? Because I'm fat...fat people sweat. Sweaty dress shirts are pretty disgusting. #PitStainsAreGross<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - that interview with #Messier was tremendous. That guy is, was, &amp; will always be a winner. He proved just how valuable he was when he and the Gretzky-less @EdmontonOilers won the Cup in '90. The '94 win with #NYR solidified it 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeGaffneyNOW @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay If I got this straight...Michael presented Don with the idea of making a hockey pick, Peter suggested Don’s picks should be a daily segment, and you “iced” the name.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Michael, outside of my wife, there’s no one I listen to more every day than you and the guys on @TMKSESPN . And sometimes I listen to you more (to her dismay).

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @nyknicks Yet, he pretty much said nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES -  I can almost hear in Scott Perry's voice that he wanted to yell,  "WE'RE TANKING, DAMMIT!" Pretty much a waste of 12 minutes of your show.   Moving on....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca McGuire's public statement was weak. He didn't apologize to @KendallCoyne . I was tweeting with someone who thought that an apology would make it more awkward.

<|startoftext|>@Veedoh_Nozna @KatieJStrang @DonLagreca Malicious or not, it was condescending. And on camera.  IMO, a public apology is warranted, regardless of how awkward it would be for McGuire. He didn't even issue it in his statement. A simple "I apologize to Kendall or anyone else offended by my comments" would have sufficed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veedoh_Nozna @KatieJStrang @DonLagreca It's possible. That would be the right thing to do. But what would also be right would be to publicly apologize to her since his cringe-worthy comments were broadcast to millions of people. And he should care what the audience thinks since he's made it his career to speak to us<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Donnie Pucks, some may say Mcguire's comments are being overblown, but I can't imagine him saying those comments to a male player. Ever. It was, as the term goes, a really bad optic. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @agundling @Radio_Randy  @TMKSonYES - Michael, all those drops &amp; you really don't want to fight for #DropMadness19??? Run it up the poll! Show the pinhead suits what your audience, who have made @TMKSESPN the top show in your time slot, what they want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - doesn't Jamal Adams recruiting Bell give the optic to the Jets that he is being a "team guy"? Maybe there's a perception by his pinhead suits that he's not interested in winning and now he's trying to prove them wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @JeremySchaap I'll bet you @Noahsyndergaard also has on Sex Panther by Odeon while posing for this picture. It's made with real bits of panther, so you know it's good. 60% of the time it works every time. #IllegalIn9Countries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - what a juxtaposition between 2 former Yankees relievers who were teammates.

<|startoftext|>@thetompujol @SNYtv And you are observant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca With Hank moving up on all-time wins list, do you think anyone can top Brodeur's 691 career wins? I'm betting it's up there with The Great One's points record as unbreakable. My top 5: 5) @GoldenKnights 4) @NHLFlames 3) @TBLightning 2) @SanJoseSharks 1) @NHLJets   #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Shabby Road 🙁 #Stinkerbockers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - hey Don...you're asking Peter about his dedication to the Redskins and why he doesn't cut ties to the team...but can't you do the same as a Mets &amp; Jets fan? They've combined for 3 championships in your lifetime, none since you were a teen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Saturday Night Fever is a musical like Die Hard is a Christmas movie #NoToBoth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - to Michael's point, I was born into being a Yankees fan, but switched to the Mets by choice in 1983 when I was a teenager. Maybe not my best decision in life...but I'm not switching back....never, ever! #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @RJinVegas The man's knowledge of football betting is impressive....but his blatant disrespect of Don (and even Peter) should be addressed next time he's on.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Don, when you missed last year's party, you called in and apologized for not being there, which was a classy, professional move. Peter could have at least called in...even from the 🚽 💩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Familia blew 6 of 24 save opportunities last season. That doesn't account for non-save opportunities where he may have given up the lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - RJ Bell has been wrong. You guys don't kill him like you just did with Don. He's 1 for 2. Give him another two weeks. I'm betting Don will be at least 70% right #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Closers are asking for $12-15M/yr....A's need a closer...Familia could be had for $10M/yr...A's say, "Nah, we're good". Mets sign him to be a setup man/backup closer...Familia blew 25% of his save opportunities last season. #WHYYYYY 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a 3 year commitment at that? Closers are asking for $12-15M/yr....A's need a closer...Familia could be had for $10M/yr...A's say, "Nah, we're good".

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The #NYR have been competitive but they're clearly not a playoff team at this point. What should their strategy be for the rest of the season?

<|startoftext|>@MetsFakeSkipper This move negates picking up Diaz. How do you close a win when the lead has been blown by Familia late in the game?

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I like the 3-2-1 point system. Strength of team you beat should not be weighed. That's the case for all team sports. But the TYPE of win matters.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Don isn't 100% right...though his name isn't in the title (as it should be), "The Don Show" is now incorporated into the show and he is prominently featured. Sure it's only 45 seconds long...but still 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I think the Yanks, as constructed right now, can be champs. It's not the talent that hurt them last season, it was their strategy. Not playing small ball in key situations and leaving tons of men on base is what hurt them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Michael, you really missed a chance to achieve "great guy" status. You should've told the guys that you didn't go to the @YESNetwork holiday party because you couldn't enjoy it without them 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - last week, my wife gave me a @Mets jersey with my last name &amp; favorite number embroidered on the back.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - the way I look at it, the Mets are paying $12.5 for the next 4 years for a veteran 2Bman who is coming in as their best hitter and getting a lights out closer. I'd take that ANY DAY OF THE WEEK even if Cano is good for only 2 years!!!! #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Michael, make the announcement after the Bowles interview. That is going to be so uncomfortable and difficult to hear....your announcement will bounce the show right back to its greatness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Todd from NJ probably mentioned Diaz after you dropped his call. So he basically said it to himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - the most consistent player for the Mets last year was Brandon Nimmo. Was he a top 10 prospect? Was Jeff McNeil highly touted? Top baseball prospects are more misses than hits. Diaz is a stud RIGHT NOW! If SEA eats $60M, this is a no-brainer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Sabres have no reason to hang their heads. They hung tough with the more talented Lightning and were a break or 2 away from getting the W (or going into OT). My top 5 after last night's games:  5) Caps (sorry, Jackets) 4) Avalanche 3) Sabres 2) Lightning 1) Leafs #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I really wanted to hear the "Best Of" Thanksgiving Day episode, but I was busy....celebrating Thanksgiving Day 🙄 Any chance that full episode can be made available as a podcast? I'd love to re-hear the great TMKS moments (so far) of 2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca What the NHL needs to do is find a way to market their young stars....get them in front of the masses because the general public in the USA has no idea who most of those players are. Perhaps use "The Don Show" as a vehicle? 😀 #GameMisconduct @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @agundling  https://t.co/8zHgiCvYPI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalderSports The Great White Dopes? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - can someone in the studio please replay the "What's A Computer?" commercial for Don and use that for a "The Don Show" episode? I would pay to hear that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - at 5 yrs of age, the concept of death is more conceptual than knowing the different time zones in this country #FACTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca **** CORRECTION ****   Oilers-Stars game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Listening to the Oilers-Canucks game last night, I thought their radio announcer was going to spontaneously combust when McDavid's goal in OT was waved off after review. I don't blame him since it looked to me like it crossed the line. Did you agree with the call? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Hey Don, looking at the #NYR depth chart, which defenseman (besides Claesson) should be odd man out? I know Smith would likely be the consensus, but I haven't been too impressed with Skjei or Shattenkirk so far this season #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, hope you both had a wonderful Thanksgiving Day with your loved ones.  Looking at the Western Conf standings, I'm surprised to see Calgary in 1st in the Pacific division. Is that sustainable? Or do you think SJ, VGK, or ANA will rise to the top? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - my 16 yr old daughter really wanted to get me the #BradKlausen poster from the @fenwaypark concert for my birthday but she couldn’t afford it on eBay.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - #Knicks starting 5 next year:  PG) Ntilikina  SG) Hardaway SF) Zion  PF) Porzingis C) Kanter (or Mitch Robinson)  And I'm sure they will pick up a solid FA or 2 with Fizdale as the coach. Mark it down!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Knicks saw Zion play 2 games and made the decision to TANK to try to get him! That is what's going on at MSG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - here's Joe from Green Township, the new Evangelical Pastor of the Michael Kay show, blessing the guys from the studio  https://t.co/wxULM9GZxn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - The Toadies is an underrated band of the early '90s. "Rubberneck" is one of my favorite albums from that era. #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Don would show Stevie Wonder pictures of his twins 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - think about it....the only Mets no-hitter wasn't really a no-hitter. And we saw the questionable play from 6 different angles. I'm with Don with his Joey D streak theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - here's the commercial I believe Peter was referencing   https://t.co/Gq77mnjf5d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - there should be a segment of yoyo bumchuck callers on the #TMKSBestOf show. #WellHeyWellHey #WhosThis #MattForte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - that time Peter or Don was in the studio (Michael was on the road) and one of them seemingly dropped an SBD....that was pretty funny #TMKSBestOf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Don breaking his microphone was one of the funniest moments on the show this year #LookAtThisGarbage #TMKSBestOf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - are there show podcasts going all the way back to early this year? There are so many awesome moments on the show daily, it's hard to remember the funny bits from earlier in the year. #TMKSBestOf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - this kid ate frozen Reggie bars from the late '70s #DontDoIt  https://t.co/Xrh2yFL8vd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Looks like defense in front of the net will be priority in #NYR practice the next few days. Too many deflections last night did them in. Who was the best you saw offensively &amp; defensively in front of the crease?   My top 5: 5) Columbus 4) Minn 3) Win 2) TB 1) Tor #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - being a Quarter Rican 🇵🇷, what's your favorite Spanish food? #AskLugo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I know you're giving away the $5K to increase ratings....but I'm not telling ANY of my friends. That will DECREASE my chances if we're all trying to win at the same time 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Don, there's a beautiful Marriott in Brooklyn near the Brooklyn Bridge. And downstairs is a Rocco's Tacos for your dining (and drinking) pleasure #WinWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - question for Don...would you watch a hockey game at Barclay Center solely as a spectator? I would guess no because 1) it's too far from Lagreca HQ in NJ and 2) the place is a dump for hockey games #AmIRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - last time the Mets had a Cy Young winner on their roster, they didn't re-sign him for 3 years...they instead traded him for another potential Cy Young winner who was only 20 years old at the time. In 2 years, we'll see what Degrom can bring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, I haven't followed hockey that long but I don't recall any in-fighting among teammates during a game like the situation that occurred with the GS Warriors. Do any come to mind that you can share? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - while Phil was under Tiger's wood, he said hi to Rachel Uchitel 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - Don went high &amp; tight on Blake Snell and his posse 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN -  Q: what do you have when you hold a mothball in 1 hand and a mothball in the other?  A: a really BIG moth 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I'm a smart man....not a certified genius, but I'm willing to test my intelligence against anyone. I don't understand WAR if my life depended on it. The analytics of baseball is way out of hand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @wingoz @GolicAndWingo @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @ESPNNY98_7FM I'll save Don and Michael the trouble....his name rhymes with Lion Windwhore 💯 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @SanJoseSharks @Capitals @NYIslanders @NJDevils Hey Don, the Caps looked like a different team with Wilson on the ice. Do you think having him back on the ice is enough to spark the team to ride to the top of the Metro division? And who on the #NYR can you envision in a similar role? DeAngelo is my guess #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN For moments like this? 😂  https://t.co/sMRqRqcI6p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I know Henrik has let in a few easy game tying and go ahead goals...but he’s been outstanding this season. He and Pionk have been the team’s MVPs this season. #NYRangers #NYR  #LGR #KingHenrik #ThisIsRangerstown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I turned on the show on @YESNetwork and for a second I thought, "OH WOW! Kay has George Clooney on the show?!?!?"....but then I realized it's Donny Pucks looking sharp! #SmokeShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - if Kristaps' lady friend was at the finish line, then you should FULLY appreciate Porzingis' hard sprint #SmokeShow #FloatShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Because if people said, "you put the lotion in the basket", that would make hockey very, VERY creepy 😬 Biscuits in baskets are far more pleasing.  https://t.co/RHS36UCsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca If you had to start a team right now with players 25 years old &amp; younger, who would be your starting 5?

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @FordhamNYC @wfuv The weight loss looks good on you, Flaco Kay. But I can hardly look at you next to @jodiapplekay . 😂 She's as radiant as ever. God bless you guys. And congrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Don, if you had to start a team right now with players 25 years old and younger, who would be your starting 5? Here's my squad:  LW - Gaudreau C - McDavid RW - Laine D - Seth Jones, Morgan Reilly G - Vasilevskiy #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Phil Jackson ran the triangle for 11 championship teams....what did Fisher expect? That Phil would abandon his philosophy just because he was the GM and not the coach? The only reason Derek was hired with ZERO coaching experience was TO RUN THE TRIANGLE! #CmonMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @Senators Don, great to see the #NYR on a streak. Well deserved, as they have gone out &amp; competed for most of the games this season. Besides Henrik playing out of his mind, why do you think they're winning now? Right lineups? Better defense? Puck bouncing in their favor? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - so good to listen to your show again. I was at a much needed spiritual retreat Thur &amp; Fri. While I was glad I attended, I did miss listening to the show. Thank God for life ....and for DVRs &amp; podcasts! #MattForte #SIDLUCKMAN #hilariousrant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I’m sitting in my hotel room, waiting for the fam before dinner, eating Cool Ranch Doritos and listening to Michael &amp; Peter destroying Don...and I almost choked laughing at the back and forth between you. LOVE YOU GUYS!!! 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - perhaps Garnder can be used as bait near the trade deadline? He's a gritty veteran who can be an asset to a team missing a piece or 2 to make a playoff push.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN I know this is an MLS post....LET'S GO #NYCFC!!!....but man, Ola Ray with the ish when Thriller came out. Besides a few minor roles, the world was deprived of seeing much of her in the years following the video's release.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - BREAKING NEWS....the Patriots already lead the Bills 14-0 in tonight's game #SnoozeFest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I know Peter shut down his social media accounts, but can you let him know how much this listener appreciates his input in your program.

<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN @RedSox Should be interesting if/when they get invited to the White House. I would give anything to see Cora fling rolls of paper towels to the president and his staff on behalf of our people #TooSoon?  (sorry, I'm obviously still bothered by that blatantly disrespectful moment)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Far less dramatic than 2014, but it still hurt seeing Martinez score that last goal yesterday vs #NYR. The #NYR are averaging 22 SOG last 3 gms after 45 SOG vs #Flames. What gives? Also, for the "too many men on ice" penalty...who's to blame, the players or coach? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HueJackson's career .205 win percentage is 2nd worst in #NFL history among all coaches w/ at least 40 games  Whose percentage is worse than that???  I see you Bart Bell, coaching the @Eagles from '36 to '41 w/ a .179 percentage. But you couldn't get fired...YOU OWNED THE TEAM 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetsFakeSkipper As a baseball fan and Yankees hater, only the #Mets playing "New York, New York" after winning the WS would make me happier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN @RedSox I was too young to witness Clemente but I'm proud to see a boricua lead his team to a championship (in his 1st year as manager). As long as they're not beating the #Mets in the WS, I wish Cora continued success with the Sox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedSox I love that you're doing this. Is it petty? Yeah...but that's ok...so were the tweets you're replying to. Let the haters know they got nothin'. And hit the #Yankees fans extra hard, will ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - when was the last time you saw a WS game where the teams had a combined .165 BA? I definitely attribute this to good pitching over bad hitting in tonight’s game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - Maeda with the cubes, as you like to say. Nice play nailing the runner out at 3rd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Watching the game like this  https://t.co/REw5mJBcMg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy Now, "Love To Love You, Baby" I figured out even earlier. That song was just...dirty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy I was about the same age when "In the Bush" came out and also thought it was about actual green bushes at that age. My brother, 16 at the time, used to play it A LOT (apparently he knew EXACTLY what it meant). When I hit puberty, I figured that ish out quick 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - just in case you didn't see this earlier. People praising Michael (well deserved)....but you're the straw that stirs the @TMKSESPN drink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don...I know you're in studio on @TMKSESPN but are you hitting us with a Game Misconduct later today? #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio -I know Michael gets the accolades &amp; Don is a great compliment to the Kayster, but @TMKSESPN would not be as entertaining without you. You can be a little "extra" at times (I say that lovingly 😬)...but the show has a freshness that only you provide. Keeping it 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Another hard fought game in Washington. They didn't seemed too fazed about facing the defending champs. Based on the last few games, I think the D-lines should be 1) Pionk/Smith, 2) Skjei/Shattenkirk, and 3) Claessen/Staal. Do you agree?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy I figured out what “Push, Push in the Bush” and “Come on and do it” meant around the same time that I figured out “Pull up to the bumper, baby”. I was 12 #FastLearner<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NJDevils @EdmontonOilers Hey Don. I'm sure you're frustrated by staying away from the kiddos w/ your conjunctivitis. Hope they don't catch it. What a pain in the eye 😉  What did you think of yesterday's #NYR lineup? I loved the energy they played with. They compete, which is all we want #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @ESPNNY98_7FM I'm pretty sure I would pay $9.99 plus tax for a Jeff and Stan Van Gundy daily or even weekly show. Love those guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - one of the funniest 11 minutes of comedy I've heard is @billburr eviscerating a Philly audience while counting down his minutes on stage.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - today's show has been entertaining so far, despite the tension among the 3 of you. It's like Thanksgiving in the Diaz household....full of love and dysfunction<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I love you guys but I have to be honest....I'd rather hear roll call from 10 callers than the Landon Collins interviews. I can't make out what he's saying and what I can make out, there's nothing of substance being said 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - so far, I've heard Bowles laugh hard 3 full times and 1 chuckle....so that's a win for the Over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv I'm betting they're not worse than the Orlando Tragic. I think Orl is counting on the ghost of Scotty Skiles to run the point (full disclosure: I've been a fan since their inception, which is why this tweet is dripping with sarcasm...YEARS of nothingness will do that to a person)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @Avalanche Devils have given up only 40 shots in 2 games (Sharks had 43 SOG just last night). If they keep San Jose to under 25 shots on Sunday, would it be fair to say NJ has the best defense in the league? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustinPalta @LillianMetsmom @MetsFakeSkipper Your team was gift wrapped the NL MVP in the off-season yet loses by 15 in a home playoff game and then follows that up with losing again at home and watching their biggest rivals celebrate on their field...again (remember 2004?)...but the Mets are a disgrace 😂  https://t.co/tVLTHS4acN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I like that Landon Collins calls in and provides insight (not much insight, but at least he talks to you guys). But the way he sounds with his phone connection, his handle should be TheMumble_21 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetsFakeSkipper Mets lose by 21 runs....Yankees fans let us have it Mets bat out of order....Yankees fans let us have it Mets have a sub .500 season...Yankees fans let us have it Yankees get clobbered in embarrassing loss....Mets fans have to stay quiet??? Oh, hellll no! #CueTheFatLady #SoxIn4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYIslanders @BuffaloSabres Don, are you as surprised as I am that the Sharks are tied with the Rangers for having the worst goal differential in the league? And is having Trotz at the helm the biggest reason for Isles strong start? Or is the team more focused w/o having to rely on Tavares? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @ByRosenberg @TMKSESPN - that was THE BEST reading of lineups ever 😂  Peter, thanks for your humor. The Kawhi laugh is completely bananas funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -after last night's tribute at MSG, Al Trautwig's voice was shaky. Then they cut to Sam Rosen &amp; he looked like he was going to break down on camera. It was a great tribute and you can tell how much John Amirante meant to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I have to be completely honest....I'd rather hear Don solo than with Dave. Too many times Dave sounds like he hits Mustang Harry's before each game 💯 #OhBoy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Capitals @AnaheimDucks Hey Don. Though I like to watch the @NYRangers games, it's always a treat to hear you call games on the radio. You are outstanding in what you do.  What do you think Kovalchuk's impact will be with the Kings this season?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @PredsNHL @DaveMaloneyMSG @DanGraca @ESPNNY98_7FM Best of luck to you, Donny Pucks. I'm so excited for this season. I know there aren't expectations of winning the Cup this season but I'm looking forward to seeing the next group (Chytil, Buchnevich, DeAngelo) learn from the vets.  #LGR #NYR #DropThePuck #ThisIsRangerstown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a diehard #Mets fan, I hate that @TheJudge44 is on that other NY team. He is outstanding in all facets of what he does. If the Mets had him and  @You_Found_Nimmo, we would have 2 of the nicest, most humble &amp; talented guys in baseball 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - sorry @agundling but Michael is right. I stayed overnight in Boston last month with my childhood friend who I've known for 35 years. I would trust him with my life...but there was no way we were sharing a bed. NO WAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the bad news is that baseball's regular season is over. The good news? ENN ON @TMKSonYES EVERY DAY, BABY!!!!!! #ImHackRosenberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @JasonWitten @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @ESPNNY98_7FM Apparently he's using Landon Collins' cell phone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -Watched the Mauer moment on @espn online during your show break. Very nice. I agree with Don...it would have been a bigger story if the last game wasn't on Sun. Which is why the @Mets celebrating Wright on Sat was a good call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Hey Don...my predictions?  It's going to be a heck of a season. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the Leafs and Sharks squaring off for the Cup. I think this will be the year that things click for the Oilers. But the Senators...they're going to be woeful. #GameMisconduct #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I hope you’re enjoying your day like I am. I sold my tix to tonight’s Mets game. This is a way better alternative to spend my afternoon/evening.  https://t.co/ez1oyAI6ki<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that congrats from the Yankees was bogus. It's a giant Yankees logo splashed across half the page.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm with @DonLagreca . I had tix to tomorrow's game and I sold them. I'm a Wright fan but I'd rather spend Sat with my family #TheWrightThingToDo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - hey guys....I made a video journal of the 9/2 concert @Fenway. I used iMovie which didn’t allow me to use your music. Otherwise, it totally encapsulates the evening.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Is it 3:00 yet? Peter made worse pick of '18 so far...how 'bout dem Bills? 😂 But Tiger Watch is going to be fantastic!

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL ALL RIGHT!!!!! Welcome back, #GameMisconduct. It's gonna be a long Rangers season but we're ready to do that hockey, so I'm excited. How much impact do you think Kovalchuk's return will mean to LA? And is there a better defensive tandem than Karlsson and Burns on the Sharks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam Depends on my mood at the moment...but I'm pretty much happy to hear "The Fixer" anytime.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fenway_West @pgammo @PearlJam @fenwaypark A great rock band that's popular can't be considered great? Makes no sense. Using that logic, I guess The Who really sucked!

<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Smart move. No need to risk injury at this point. Glad @Wheelerpro45 found his groove in the 2nd half (best numbers in baseball since the AS break). Now let's hope (yet AGAIN!!!) that the pitching staff is on point ALL SEASON in 2019. #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tjchel - hi there. I put this video recap of the #PearlJam concert together this morning. Wish I had better footage and was able to use their music with iMovie....but this pretty much captured the gist of the evening. Enjoy.   https://t.co/qeydKKU49m<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Given2Flyimages @Tjchel @ArtistWaves Great pic! And I can see my shoulder in the bottom left (blue shirt) 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tjchel @ArtistWaves @Given2Flyimages Still was the best concert experience I’ve ever had. And listening to the set playlist (I copied it on Spotify) and reading reviews like Jeff’s about the tour keep bringing me back. So glad I rediscovered them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArtistWaves @Given2Flyimages Great article &amp; pics. I was at the N1 show at Fenway. It had been 17 years since I last saw #PearlJam.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, when is #GameMisconduct coming back? Excited to hear about the off-season moves around the league<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy About 20 years ago, I saw David on a MetroNorth train. I was going to say something to him at Grand Central. I was walking in front of him but when I turned around....he was GONE!!! #BestTrickEver  P.S. I'm hoppy the 🐸 is doing just fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I was late to "find" them, gems like "Mind Your Manners", "Amongst The Waves", &amp; "Marker In The Sand" plus watching Eddie sing "Porch" as he was looking directly at me from 2 feet away at Fenway has reinvigorated my love for the group. #PJ #PearlJam #PJLive2018 #AwayShows  https://t.co/QLTBSn7Obv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - was a HUGE fan since '91 but after Binaural, I kind of drifted. Then you made the HOF &amp; I wanted to attend (since I'm in BK, NY) but wasn't in town. Then I listened to ALL of your music. Then I attended N1 at Boston (2nd row!!!). NOW, it's like '91 all over again!🤘🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I mentioned the same thing to my wife about Serena not giving Osaka enough props for winning. THAT would have truly made the crowd give it up to Osaka. She BEAT Serena, plain and simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter - I was in a similar situation but couldn't handle it. Couldn't stop the comparisons. Couldn't feel like I was "enough". Couldn't grasp that she may love me less than him. Big, BIG kudos to you for choosing love over doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay, @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I respected Adam for his football knowledge and reporting. It has grown leaps and bounds after this interview now that I know what he's done for love. It's such a tough situation to be in &amp; takes a strong person to endure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - not sure if you guys are aware, but there's a weird lag on Michael's feed on the @FOXSports app #3SecondDelay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -looking forward to hearing @AdamSchefter discuss his book. For 2 yrs, I dated the widow of an FDNY fireman who died on 9/11. I couldn't deal with the weight of it all. Takes a maturity &amp; confidence level that I didn't have 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I'm so looking forward to it. I know it may be a long #NYRangers season, but I'm hopeful that the kids (and The King) will be alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omriyounger @PearlJam Close to 8:00PM (20:00). There's a 10:30PM curfew imposed by the city of Boston which stinks. Hopefully, they'll come out earlier tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - I was at night 1 in Boston and couldn't get my hands on the poster I wanted before I headed back home. Typically, I don't buy concert merch but I really, REALLY want this particular poster. Any chance this will be available online? #PJLive2018 #TheAwayShows  https://t.co/Q6ZkJQSAd8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam @ange_meadows Night 1 in Boston #PJLive2018 #TheAwayShows  https://t.co/SVEDeNUFVr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanyaemery @PearlJam He was literally right in front of me looking straight at me and I was capturing the entire walk on video. Except....I DIDNT PRESS RECORD!!!!🤬🤬🤬 But yeah, it was pretty amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam I still haven’t landed from last night’s high. What an amazing, unforgettable show I experienced from the 2nd row. You guys killed it! #PJLive2018 #TheAwayShows  https://t.co/t76wrdy7gz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anxiously waiting #2ndRow #PJLIVE2018 #AwayShows  https://t.co/5SwY5mPJLZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam Heading to Boston in a few hours. So damn excited, I can’t sleep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I tell you, this whole "fire Boone/Girardi/Torre" narrative is precisely why I can't stand Yankees fans. I just listed a HOF mgr, another great mgr, and a 1st year mgr whose team is 2nd best in the majors....and you're complaining?!?! 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca #TwilightZone reference  https://t.co/lmNadDlvrM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I thought they were wearing the onesies I gifted them....but these are slightly different (and bigger). No matter....they still look super cute wearing their colors. God bless them #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I always wondered what happens when someone queefs during a live telecast. This....this is what happens 😂💩🤣  https://t.co/FGr4DTWun9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coachguida17 @_A4RON_ @SNYtv The Mets have used him incorrectly. But he still has to prove he can hit major league pitching, no matter what position he plays. Fans would be more tolerant of his defensive deficiencies if he tore the cover off the ball (see: Murphy, Daniel).  But his career avg is below .200😧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Why does your "next level" announcement look like it was created on a Commodore Amiga? Did I somehow time warp into 1985?  (if so, next year is going to be truly amazing)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - betting on Browns is Golden Knights adjace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I'm calling it now....the "Who's This?" drop not only should be a #1 seed in #DropMadness2019 (if the pinhead suits allow it) but I wouldn't be surprised if it won. It's that maj!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_A4RON_ @Jctrue0505 @SNYtv Man, that is optimistic.  I hope he's that type of player and that it happens real soon...but nothing I've seen so far convinces me that he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_A4RON_ @SNYtv In theory you're right....but I've seen enough of him over the last 2 years to feel like he's not ready. Offensively, he's regressed from last season. And he's in no way a defensive wizard, so I don't really see his value to this team.  https://t.co/qXSrNlYwHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Judging by his performance the last 2 years, Smith shouldn't be in the major leagues #Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearlJam - I'm at work, completely unfocused because I'm so excited about seeing you guys in Boston on the 2nd. I'll be in the 2nd row right in front. I've waited 27 years for this....but the next 12 days are going to seem...so...damn....long! #AllThoseYesterdays #PresentTense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Peter, maybe there's an "Enjoy Yourself" remix with #CardiB on it that you can play tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - Me, looking at Michael on TV right now (and I'm straight as an arrow)  https://t.co/8MIcmNnDLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - funny how #Yankees fans DESTROYED #Mets fans when Nats beat them up...not saying much now that they can't score runs. BTW, look at the last 30 games for both teams...this keeps up, both teams will be out of the playoffs #LGM  https://t.co/y7ISP2OzEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Mets game on #Facebook Watch is terrible. Nimmo goes down and there's no follow-up. For half an inning, they had the wrong score displayed 🤨. I understand they're trying to hang with the big boys (I'm looking at you @SNYtv and @Metsbooth) ...but they need to be ready #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - say what you're saying Michael is Peter.....spit the bit 😬 #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I disagree with you @Rosenbergradio about your Sam Smith comment. That's like saying because you do sports talk radio, you have to say you love the dope on the other station because he's a "legend". Screw him...&amp; screw Michael Jackson! #YeahISaidIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - the different iterations of hosting duties work because you're all interesting. But this show COOKS WITH GAS when it's the 3 amigos on board. Throw in @agundling, @Radio_Randy, &amp; even @NYC_AlexLee and there's nothing better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFGrAdventure Superman 100 out of 100 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, are you and the family going to attend any of the Mets-SF games coming up at CitiField? If so, will the twins wear the Mets/Giants onesies I gifted (if they still fit)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGelbs Had to duck....was almost hit by a flying pig #unbelievable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - at Brooklyn Bridge Park on Thursday, they're showing "Wayne's World" outdoors. See you there??? #PartyOn #Excellent #Schwing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I cleared my schedule from 3:00 to 3:30 so I can hear @RealMichaelKay explain his position re: the Clint Frazier comment. I know he didn't mean it the way it was received, but as you guys say...it wasn't a good optic #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti ** Paging David Wright **<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Noahsyndergaard @Delta @CitiField 1) Wait 30+ minutes for Shake Shack...there's something about the one in CitiField that I can't pass up 2) catch an inning on Shea Bridge...love the view 3) Stop at Carvel around the 6th...because ice cream! Regardless of team performance, being in CitiField is always a pleasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JdeGrom19 - thank you for not giving up &amp; pitching your ass off every 5th day. Thank you for giving #Mets fans some semblance of hope. Thank you for being professional &amp; not throwing your team under the bus (and a BIG bus it would be). And lastly, THANK YOU for being a Met #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyFreeze7 With that last name, you were destined to be a meteorologist.  It's a good thing your last name wasn't Juggle 😬🤡  https://t.co/QzJg1uKoqb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @alanhahn @RealMichaelKay @ESPNNY98_7FM VERY cool of Peter to let Ira from NJ ask Darnold a question directly #Bigly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanhahn @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I had to pick JUST ONE GOAT hip hop album....it's "The Low End Theory". There are a few others that can compete for that top spot....but for me, Low End earns the top spot with every listen. Midnight Marauders...also great...but not better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - too bad you didn't know how pitching would affect @lamelaza_7 at the plate....he could've been your Opening Day pitcher and raked all season long 😂 #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koolboblove @rockrubber45s WOW! Even if I didn't want to see it (I rented it on Vimeo to watch tonight 😉), I'd at least be curious after that @HOOPmag tweet.  Congrats on all the praise for the movie. Even without seeing it, I know you put crazy effort into it. Your success (&amp; legacy) is not an accident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN - you guys are lucky because during EVERY break, you don't have to watch that dreadful Lipozene commercial. I know it helps pay the bills, but I can't stand watching the Peetes anymore #DoneWithThem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that look when Michael is about to lose his mind. Paul from Trenton is a yo-yo for blaming Boone for the Yankees struggles and wishing Gerardi was back #YOURPHONECALLISOVER  https://t.co/sw2YGkReka<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimBreuer @DonLagreca @KevinJames @JerrySeinfeld To clarify, my tweet was dripping with sarcasm...actually, not dripping but completely bathed in it.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @SNYtv @SteveGelbs - great interview with today’s @Mets veteran of the game, Paul Lozito. Seems like a guy I’d want to have pizza with. AND he threw in an Ed Kranepool reference #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - I created a @Spotify playlist where the first track is the original followed by the rap song that sampled it. It's pretty solid. Check it out one day, won't you? And show my man DJ Eli (Toca's dude) some love at Cielo tonight    https://t.co/ZM54ITvNuI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @alanhahn @TMKSESPN - kudos to you guys on your 1st hour...solid show so far. But there should be a rule that prohibits @DonLagreca , @RealMichaelKay , &amp; @NYC_AlexLee from taking the same day off of work. You're all good individually but you're GREAT collectively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @alanhahn @TMKSESPN - Gary Sanchez is the baseball equivalent to Derrick Coleman....so much talent but the lack of hustle is a hindrance to his team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinJarell @OrlandoMagic Welcome to the team. I like what they've done so far this off season...hope it will indeed be a #Magic season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I guess now we REALLY know why Cespedes played for 4 teams in 4 years. Other teams stayed away. Mets signed him to a 4 year deal 🤦🏽‍♂️  BTW....now we also know why he won't slide #ItsBasicallyFallingDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN-with Tebow out for a few months, it's virtually a given that we won't see him called up to the majors. That's a shame because I was really looking forward to seeing Don's head explode #ClownShoes #EDKRANEPOOL  Also HBD, Peter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noahsyndergaard Any truth to the rumor that Jose Reyes has scurvy? 😬  (in all seriousness...get well soon)  #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mets-my pastor, a @Yankees fan, reached out this morning to check on me. I told him I don't know how much more heartache I can endure this season. He asked me to reach out to your organization &amp; see if we can go there &amp; pray for your team. So here I am asking  #YaGottaBelieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HDumpty39 @HLundqvist30 - my all-time favorite @Xbox game is @EA #NHL14. I STILL play regularly on the 360 (season mode as the @NYRangers).

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca SOLID #1 pick.  I used to have a CD player/clock which I used for my alarm. I would wake up to "Killing In The Name Of" daily. It was that song &amp; The Beatles' "Good Morning, Good Morning" that were my favorite songs to wake up to. Completely different tunes but both effective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Don....I find it odd that the #NYR have been awfully quiet this offseason.  Any guesses why?  Do they think they have enough talent to compete as is? Or are they setting up to make a big trade? (hopefully for Karlsson)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Slayer Boston's 1st album???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you won't ever tell me this is a squad that could compete for the #NBA title. Yet that's exactly what they did with @KingJames. So don't be surprised if he makes the @Lakers much better than last season  https://t.co/4wQoOJ88RY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Hey guys....how much trouble are the Islanders in now that Tavares is gone? I know how important he was to the team but with Barzal, Bailey, and Lee still on the roster and Lamoriello and Trotz now calling the shots, that should offset the loss a bit, no? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - what if Tebow has a Jeremy Lin moment in NY? Catches fire for a month, then fizzes into Bolivian (Mike Tyson reference)....wouldn't it have been worth it to call him up? What a story that would be #EntertainMeClowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - I had a doctor tell me to my face "For your weight, you should be 7 feet, 4 inches tall" I'm 5'10" 🤨  P.S. I've lost 40 pounds since 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this is baseball we're talking about...the reason they play in front of fans is to entertain them. If their minor league rosters are devoid of talent, then Tebow being called up wouldn't really hurt &amp; would be fun to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm usually simpatico with Don...but I disagree with him about Tebow. The Mets play in a stadium that sits 45K people. If Tebow can fill some seats &amp; not embarrass himself in the process, then he should be called up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Peter, the scene in "Fast Times" being referenced had the 13-year-old me playing with my Tonka truck...A LOT!!!! #Facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv I feel like #WilmerFlores has been on the @Mets for 12 years. Hard to fathom that he's only 26 years old. I wish everyone on the team had the passion and timely hitting that he possesses. #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VZWSupport Thanks. I would shout from a mountaintop to anyone who would listen that Verizon has the best service hands down. I've had AT&amp;T and Sprint in the past. I thought with Sprint's pricing and offer of 2-for-1 iPhones, it would be worth converting. That was a very costly mistake 🤑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verizon - I'm sorry. I'm sorry I switched to @sprint 2 months ago. I'm sorry I fell for their ads &amp; thought their service was comparable to yours. How sorry am I? I bought out of my lease contracts for 2 phones &amp; switched back to you. I'm so happy we're reunited #ICanHearYouNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - true story....I suffered trigger finger and costochondritis (inflammation of chest cartilage) playing Madden '13 on XBox. I was in career mode (30 seasons). I was 42 years old when this happened 😳 #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I put $100 on Swisher to hit a homer in the Old-Timers Day game and $20 that Don Larsen would make it home after the game...we all had a pretty good day! 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewFBrill Hey Andrew, my buddy Vince Z (@metsfanmax 's former baseball coach) asked me to say hi to you guys. So that's what I'm doing with this tweet 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - hey Peter....will you be at Great Adventure on Sat?  They have a wrestling event going on with Nick Foley and Jerry Lawler scheduled to attend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I've been a #Mets fan for 35 years, an Orlando #Magic fan for 29 years, &amp; a NY #Jets fan for 20+ years. I'm so sick of poorly run, under performing teams. It's killing my love for sports. All of my hopes rest on the #Rangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I posted this earlier today. It's kinda messing me up to think that I may be done with baseball.  https://t.co/E2Mwc7umcS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - take away the 12-2 start &amp; convert that to .320 ball (which is what they've played since then). That calculates to a 4-10 start. Add that to their record since (16-34) &amp; they would be 20-44, 2nd worst in ENTIRE LEAGUE🙁 #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if you're a #Mets fan, this is how you feel on a perpetual basis  #DownAndOut #Pain #Agony #Frustration #Anger #Hopeless #Sad  https://t.co/6lqTZQdBEh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetsFakeSkipper Being a #Mets fan   #ThatsGonnaLeaveAMark  https://t.co/dQzIuamRCP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sick of it....SICK OF IT!!!! @JdeGrom19 is pitching yet ANOTHER gem and this team can only muster ONE HIT!?!?!?! What the hell??? These #Mets are doing something I thought was virtually impossible....they're killing my love for the game #Garbage #Losers #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti I was at that game and was basically saying the exact same thing Terry was from sec 514, row 16. That was a BS ejection and it's a shame Utley never did get jacked the way he should have.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm kinda glad that #IHOP....er, I mean....#IHOb 🤨 is going through this backlash.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I was raised as a Yankees fan...then at 13 years old @keithhernandez joined the @Mets &amp; that was the start of my #mets fandom.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - #Mets are doing like #JRSmith and running out the innings. Seriously, they have no life in them. This team looks like it could challenge the Marlins for the cellar this season #Sad #BrokenDreams #EDKRANEPOOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VancityReynolds - went to see hilarious @deadpoolmovie last night with my daughter (yes, a little awkward...especially after the absurd #HappytimeMurders trailer 😬) Today, this came up as a memory from 2 years ago when she drew this picture #Deadpool #Deadpool2 #HolyChimichanga  https://t.co/isxQDCwrNd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - trying to watch @TMKSonYES on the @FOXSports app but it keeps going back 30 minutes every 5 minutes.

<|startoftext|>@NBCSports - As exciting as the #VGKvsWSH #StanleyCup Finals are, it would be about 23% less entertaining if not for Doc Emrick's call. I can listen to him and @DonLagreca call hockey games all day long<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - let's go back to the salary discussion.  If Stephen A Smith KNEW exactly how much $$$ each of you made &amp; confirmed a news report that published your salaries, he would be WRONG. He really wouldn't have any reason to confirm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Michael...not only do you have the year old listeners but you have Peter there to read "Goodnight Moon"....which he did a TREMENDOUS job doing, much better than John Sterling's version #Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - my relationship with the #Mets is like the movie Groundhog Day...I have broken up with them just about every summer since 1988...and every spring I come back to them #PerpetualHeartbreakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that shutdown by Peter was OUTSTANDING!!!!! That caller basically had the "oh, hey....well, oh hey" reaction #YourPhoneCallIsOver #LoseTheNumber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca A kinder, gentler Don 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - so I’m taking a page from @DonLagreca ‘s playbook and turning on my auto-reply. #DoNotDisturb #AutoReply #BetterSafeThanSorry  https://t.co/EBPlxp3TBV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought my day wouldn’t get worse after seeing the #Mets make an out for a lineup error, then losing on a game-winning homer to the scrubby Reds. Then I turned on the #Yankees game in the 8th inning 😫 #miserable #WhyAmIAMetsFan #YaGottaBereave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - #NCIS was rated higher because it was the last episode for a major cast member, Pauley Perette. #Roseanne is just a juggernaut right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - to make #Mets fans feel even crappier than we already do, I'm betting the Yankees outscore the Sox by a touchdown tonight #LockItIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - looked at the Mets boxscore....Cabrera batting .319....2nd best BA in the lineup? Pitcher Wheeler batting .273. No one else in today's lineup is hitting over .255 #MeetTheMets #Muts #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel worse now about being a #Mets fan than I did 3 hours ago. Last year it was about the injuries...no excuses now. They just suck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've felt this in the past, but today I'm extremely embarrassed to be a #Mets fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGelbs For the first 2 weeks, I thought this season felt like '86. Now I feel like this season is being 86ed. How do you mess up the lineup card???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougWilliamsSNY @HankAzaria @martinonyc Question for @HankAzaria .... how much of your dialogue in The Birdcage did you improvise? It's my favorite role that you've played....which role(s) were you most proud of playing and which one(s) were you not completely enamored with? #SheaAnything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what Don is trying to say is....when YOU score, no other score really matters!!! #ImRootingForMe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hard for the Mets to win when there are only 3 guys in the lineup hitting well, 4 guys batting their weight or less, and the catcher position is basically a cardboard box wearing a helmet #MeetTheMuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Don.....ask Michael if he knows who Lita Ford or Ann &amp; Nancy Wilson are. That may put it into perspective for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - hey @Rosenbergradio you messed me up....I started ready this to her in your voice. That was kinda weird #GoodnightMoon #SterlingsVersionStunk  https://t.co/49C4dW4ePH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @SOMPatriots Hey Don, good speaking to you and @Rosenbergradio earlier. LOVE seeing this pic of the twins wearing the onesies I gifted. They’re beautiful. God bless them always. Lets go Mets! And Let’s Go Rangers! (But how about then Golden Knights?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - DeMar DeRozan tried punching himself in the face after yesterday's loss....but he missed  #Craptors #InvisibleMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - if @Rosenbergradio keeps calling out men of the cloth like he has lately, he'll be known as Peter RosenBURN in his eternal life 😈 #ItsDarkAndHellIsHot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW...his name is Mike (but I call him Giancarlo 😂)  #JohnMichaelStanton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio  - hey Michael...my dad turns 81 today.

<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy @koolboblove Muy chistoso, senor Stretch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @ESPNNY98_7FM @YESNetwork @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio LONG day for you, Michael. Funny how no one is talking about the @Yankees slow start anymore. Winning is the ultimate cure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianCOHalloran @MarvelStudios @Jon_Favreau @JamesGunn @prattprattpratt @seangunn @DaveBautista With #BlackPanther raising the bar so high for comic book movies, I was afraid of a possible letdown with this one.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Michael....it worked....I guess God wasn't busy with other matters in the universe and was listening to your prayers 😇 Can't wait to hear Don's take on the #NYGiants #SecondPick #NFLDraft #BarkleyBlue<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the Thumbs Down guy being at the @FlavaFraz21 introduction to the Mets and getting unnecessary publicity was annoying because it was a distraction from the signing. I feel the same about the hoopla surrounding Meek Mill at the Sixers game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @GoldenKnights At least until the @NYRangers get back on track....then we'll need you to come home 😉 #LGR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - in 1996, a group of artists re-recorded a bunch of Schoolhouse Rocks songs...the best of the bunch was Blind Melon's "3 is the Magic Number"...R.I.P. Shannon Hoon  #TheMoreYouKnow   https://t.co/bJOkQ6VMUv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - with Michael's retirement, the @Rosenbergradio / @agundling / @DonLagreca talk show vehicle replacing @TMKSESPN was going to be named "Complex Offside Misconduct"...a shame Kay shortened his retirement to 3 seconds 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - your comparison conversation is driving me crazy because I have THE guy who Harvey should be compared to (but I can't get through on the phone after an hour of trying)..Dontrelle Willis won ROY &amp; a WS but flamed out in 6 yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I always think of Dontrelle Willis when I see Harvey pitch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you guys seriously put the "fun" in dysfunctional.  You're like the Kardashians/Jenners without the T&amp;A and transgender dad #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 Word!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @DonLagreca - do you agree with bookmakers who now have #VGK as co-favorites to win the Stanley Cup?  I know their success as an expansion team is unprecedented, but isn't their odds at 4-1 a bit of a stretch? Besides the Pens &amp; Preds, who do you think can win?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers - seeing the video of the Caps' Brett Connolly giving the little girl a puck reminded me of my son's 1st #NYR game in 2013 when @ChrisKreider gave him a puck. A simple gesture like that which took 1 second will resonate with my son (and me) forever #Rangerstown  https://t.co/vxdlW4OMvu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I don't know where Don will be on draft day...but I pray to the same God that there's a live feed on him during the Giants pick. We need to see his reaction in real time #BarkleyTakenSeconcd #TrumanShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I finally figured out who @Rosenbergradio sounds like when he does the Slomin commercials. Sifl &amp; Olly (on MTV in the '90s) had the Precious Roy Shopping Network. Peter would've been a perfect pitchman    https://t.co/p0cOhMKfFO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I agree 100% with @DonLagreca .  The Mets were on a nice streak but they're not playing their best baseball. Cespedes, Bruce, &amp; whoever is pitching &amp; catching are almost sure outs each time they bat...that's 12 outs of 27 for each game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @keithhernandez @newyorklottery As a kid, I was a Yankees fan because my dad was. But that all changed in '83 when my favorite baseball player Keith Hernandez joined the @Mets . The rest, as they say, is history. Now I'm a diehard fan who bleeds blue and orange and enjoys listening to Keith call games #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB - one way to handle the baseball schedule &amp; crappy weather....start the season in mid-April &amp; schedule some good ol' fashion doubleheaders. You may lose a few $$ but your fans &amp; players will surely appreciate not having to deal with postponements &amp; freezing temps #JustSaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN None! I hate the yoyo bumchuck listeners who watch and listen to the show with the purpose of trying to knock the talent. GO PLAY WITH TONKA TRUCKS!!! #MyGudness #ValuelessCall #YourPhoneCallIsOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @RumblePoniesBB @LasVegas51s So long, HanSMELL. Like what happens there, hope you stay in Vegas #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Of the hundreds of people I know who I text regularly, no one...NONE OF THEM...have the auto-reply function turned on. Not sure if Don is a pioneer or captain literal man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, you're one of the best, no doubt....but you sounded like Bob Ross with your call of Romine rushing the mound  #LetsGetCrazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I know everyone rolled their eyes in disbelief when Sandy Alderson said (tongue-in-cheek) that even though the Yankees traded for Stanton, the Mets were in good shape because they have Nimmo...two weeks in &amp; he's right #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - hey, 160-2 is still a very respectable record. Keep your heads up, gentlemen! #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMvsMIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeightWatchers - down 50 lbs...today is a good day thanks to #WWFreestyle #10ToGo #GotThis  https://t.co/VJkunvsyDX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is nothing, I mean NOTHING, as exciting in sports as @NHL playoff hockey. And what the @GoldenKnights are doing is absolutely remarkable. I know you agree, @DonLagreca &amp; @EJHradek_NHL. Congrats to #VGK on tonight’s win. #VGKvsLAK #NHLPlayoffs #DoubleOvertime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m seeing something different this season with the @Mets ....I’m seeing Cespedes hustle...like really hustle. I LOVE IT!!! It’s one of the reasons why this team is 10-1 #LGM #LetsGoMets #Yoenis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shakeshack @Mets @Citi @CitiField Couldn't agree with you more. And yes, we had a great time. The pic is from my baby girl's 1st Mets game. We lost to the Dodgers but it didn't matter. Having my family there with me meant everything! #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that was such a d-nozzle move by Peter. If the man wants to call Didi "DeGorgius", let him call him "DeGorgius" 😂  https://t.co/qSCxKsGQK3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Mets fans (like me) get snarky when they win....it's conditional.  Yankees fans are ALWAYS cocky! Even when they're struggling, they bring up history...because they can #SoAnnoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"some of the callers are also great like Kevin from Brooklyn &amp; Morris from Long Island This is the theme to The Michael Kay Show"  #BOOM #Maj #Number1WithABullet #MusicIndustrySaying #NotARealBullet #BulletsAreNowWizards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay - I think you need a "Garry Shandling Show" type song, sung by none other than @AmazingWillies....  "this is the theme to Michael's show,  he does the show with Don &amp; Pete, and sometimes we also hear from  Andrew G &amp; R.J...."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Hey @RealMichaelKay ...I know why @jodiapplekay was checking out cemeteries in Boston....she was looking for a cold Sam Addams 😉  #IMHereAllWeek #DontForgetToTipYourWaitress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NHLBruins Donny Pucks!!!! What the heck is going on with the Caps? How bad was yesterday's loss? For a team that can't get past the 2nd round, losing gm 1 HAS to be deflating, right? (what a bad penalty by Burakovsky with 5 min left)  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Next election.....R Kelly for President!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Citi @CitiField My favorite thing to do is head straight to @shakeshack as soon as I enter the stadium, grab a meal (always worth the wait), then watch an inning or two from Shea Bridge before going to my seat. #CitiSweepstakes  https://t.co/tAOB6gaNok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artiequitter - I can hear you talk about and impersonate @realtracymorgan all freaking day....so damn funny!!!   #53: Artie Lange  https://t.co/LMHncUaEGq via @RealGilbertACP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob @StretchArmy @koolboblove I would love to hear you guys talk to @donaldglover . He seems like a very intelligent and interesting dude.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mets - you would think the team would have stuck with the color scheme and gone with the Rally Kumquat or Rally Carrot...but I guess if the pickle works, then stick to it  #LGM #RallyPickle #AmazinMets #YouGottaBelieve  https://t.co/2MDVwCgYir<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - overheard out of the Marlins dugout:  "I never wear shoes....they make me fall down"  #TheBirdcage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I would ask God why did Michael give us the visual of him walking around his house with a jacket sans pants 🤢 #BadOptic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @M_Marakovits - 5 worst villains in cinematic history:  1) Anton Chigurh - No Country For Old Men 2) Bishop - Juice 3) Clubber Lang - Rocky 3 4) Bruce the shark - Jaws 5) Rose - Titanic  #MeredithAdjace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL - Gentlemen...I know Lindy Ruff would be considered the frontrunner to take over for AV...but if not him, who do you think would be the right coach for the Rangers?  Also, how far do you see the Golden Knights going in the playoffs? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that caller said "irregardless". THAT ISN'T A WORD!!!! Can Michael narc him to the Vocabulary Police??? #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - “it’s a quest for fun” is from the movie Vacation #WhatMovie @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I bet if @Rosenbergradio worked on Z-100 in the morning instead of Hot 97 and vilified Colin Kaepernick instead of defending him, he would be more liked by the @TMKSonYES audience #SayingItWithoutSayingIt #AmIRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Peter, I know about 73 people who watch the show and actually like you on it. So tell Brian to #TakeAWalk #ClownShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - I’m pulling for you. NO MORE SCORING!!!! #NCAAChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - if Andrew really does resign as commissioner of #DropMadness, he shouldn't write it....he should YELL IT!!!! It may win #DropMadness2019 which would be poetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - it looks like they're playing with their Tonka Trucks #BadOptics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - terrible calls...Kay calls Peter "Rothenberg"....man, do you guys need to press the reset button on the show. Maybe the 5-7 o'clock hours can be so good, we'll forget the first 2 hours #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN Just yesterday, Peter gave us "I know my region wasn't great"....that's at least a 7th seed, right? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - it's too close to call.  All 4 drops are championship caliber. I hope the excitement of this year's #DropMadness is remembered next year. No one should be on the fence about putting together #DropMadness2019  #ThatsTheAnswer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN They're playing the Mets in October 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - some hit songs from the group AWN (All White Neighborhood)'s "Straight Outta Pompton (Lakes)" album are....."Espresso Yourself"  and "Love The Police".  Both songs sample Barry Manilow beats 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - "I know my region wasn't great".....INSTANT DROP while providing results to #DropMadness  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - wasn't Kidd, it was Scott Skiles with the NBA-record 30 assists. Happened on Dec 30, 1990 against the Nuggets. I know because I WAS THERE!!!!! #TrueStoryBro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - when you want to watch the game but the Michael Kay Show is on at the same time...sorry for muting you @RealMichaelKay but I have to hear what the boys have to say on the show.  https://t.co/4Q1UItk8UP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @agundling @TMKSESPN - I think the "Whopper" guy's name is Eli.  If it's not him, then it's his vocal doppelganger #GottaMakeHimEatTheWhopper  https://t.co/pDJS5wo3A7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I know it's my constitutional right....but I literally can't cast a vote in #DropMadness.  My anxiety is at 💯 #FixThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @SaveTheFood commercial with the strawberries makes me legit sad every time I see it....and I don't even like strawberries. #Powerful   Now I don't know if I should buy less food or eat more of what I have #FoodProblems<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just saw a press conference where Cespedes spoke in English. Good for him. Maybe he's that comfortable now in NY. But I'm sure going to miss his interpreter @IamMelRod #SmokeShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I’m not one to defend Michael as he can be a bad guy at times....but yesterday’s “mic off” moment was cruel. He had every reason to be legitimately upset. But I have to admit, it was hilarious #MyGudness  https://t.co/uVQUecdzHV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - you should tell Michael they can't use his head for the beer because there would be too much head...they could only do it in a pitcher  🍺😂  You're welcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Thanks, Donny Pucks. I always look forward to hearing #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM  https://t.co/XJSBugO0mE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, which team was a bigger disappointment this season, Edmonton or Ottawa? And obviously the Knights are the biggest surprise, but who would be next?  San Jose or Colorado? Or another team? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca "Look at this garbage" makes me laugh....EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!!!!!  #ClassicRant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic 1. Penny 2. Skiles 3. Jameer Nelson 4. Steve Francis 5. Darrell Armstrong  Sorry, but that's as far as "Top" PGs go in your history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Gettlemen speaks about OBJ....Bridgewater may not be as healthy as we thought...Liangelo Ball entering the NBA draft...Lias Andersson scores his 1st NHL goal....so much to discuss today #ZaftigShow #ChockFull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Link is still no bueno.  Cuts out at the 8:43 mark  #LookAtThisGarbage #FIXTHAT  😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Haven't seen such cowardice from a batter since 2000 when Clemens was throwing bat shards at Piazza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiveraEddie_21 @WeightWatchers Great job, Eddie. And thank you for posting your meals. Gives me ideas on what to eat. Been at it for 6 months now and have plateaued (after 48 lbs), so I need to mix things up a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Don, the podcast is cutting out at the 8:43 mark #FIXTHAT 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @DonLagreca - hey Don, Georgiev finally looked shook against the Caps last night as he was getting blitzed in the 1st. Knowing how important it is to build confidence for a young goalie, do you think it was the right move to start him against Washington last night?#GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@You_Found_Nimmo Always rooting for you, not just because you're a member of the @Mets and super talented....but because you stay faithful and true to God. May HE bless you with great health and a productive career (and a fruitful marriage...congrats!) #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don is right, the comics give out their MYSPACE info at the end of Byron Allen's "Comics Unleashed" show, that's how old they are. I guess now that he owns TWC, he'll have "Real People" reading the weather? (insert rim shot)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - me, before and after watching the Lipozene commercial for the 163rd time this week. It’s torture!!! #NoLoveForThePeetes #MuchLoveForPeter  https://t.co/BDVuxfny8Q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - here’s why Michael should never ever where that shirt and vest combo again....ever!  https://t.co/yDa44wK9OL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM  https://t.co/6Pf0wfdxR5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael could wear that shirt and sweater combo at a future presidential debate 😂  #KenBoneAdjace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - are you watching the Yankee game on ESPN2? What do you think about A-Rod discussing how he handled his steroids drama?  Even though I don't fully agree with the picture he's painting, I think it's admirable that he's not skirting the discussion entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Major Auto World adjace 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if I stop watching your show, it's because of Peete. Not Rosenberg, but Rodney &amp; Holly Peete. That Lipozene commercial has overtaken the Kars For Kids commercial and the Apple "what's a computer" commercial) as my least fave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that call from Abe went from funny to creepy in 1 statement #ImWithThe3PeopleILove 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -  EVERY. COMMERCIAL. BREAK.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the replay of this great moment from yesterday's show 😭 @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES  https://t.co/Z6mS08AvgQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - seriously, I hope Lipozene is paying the Yes Network Kirk Cousins money for their ad. Do I have to see Holly and Rodney Peete EVERY commercial break? I've seen Rodney more on these commercials than I did in NFL games #TRUTH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Cajun Don not moving on in #DropMadness reminds me of when Fox canceled "Arrested Development" #GoneTooSoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey @RealMichaelKay ... I live in Brooklyn and stayed home instead of going into the office downtown. BUT I'm working from home because I have the ability to do so. Does this make me a snowflake???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - was driving when I heard this and LMAO. It was even funnier with the visual. Another classic moment on @TMKSonYES . This and the Omar rap were #Gold  https://t.co/3HwWwFzt5h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - no one is repeating "I'm Marty Lyons"....but daily most people think "YOU'RE DEAD!"...more relative to the fans, hence the lead #ThatsTheAnswer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - is that caller Eli the "You gotta make him eat the Whopper" guy?   😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm a Puerto Rican from ENY whose only golf experience is playing mini-golf...and I stopped what I was doing to watch Tiger on the course yesterday.

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the "eh..eh...Tiger...Tiger Watch" at the end of the intro is everything. Thanks, @Radio_Randy for making that happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaMarks @sarina Anita, I work directly across the street from Dead Rabbit. Can we chat about the NY teams over a drink or 3??? 🍻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - first 45 minutes of today's show can be described as "controlled chaos"....loving it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - to Don, for doing the right thing and apologizing to @agundling on-air  https://t.co/rx8xM8OPAn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just don't call 50 Cent, "Half dollar"....I heard he really doesn't like that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - when "Scarface" came out (the classic Al Pacino vehicle), my siblings and I (the Diaz Brothers) were constantly referred to as "freakin' cockroaches" #FushYuMeng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - this show is not 10 minutes in and I'm feeling all kinds of uncomfortable. This feels like Thanksgiving at the Diaz household 😬 #CantWeAllJustGetAlong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -hey Don, which team do you think will get the last playoff spot, NJ or FL? Which of those 2 do you think would be tougher against #1 seed Lightning (or Bruins)?

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy - thanks to you guys for last year's #DropMadness....it's the only reason why I signed up for Twitter.

<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 I bought tix for Thur &amp; Fri. Can't wait!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy @systemofadown Bruh...I didn't even realize how much it's true until I read this. #BlastOff #ItsPartyTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cajun__Don @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay I may start a Maui Invitational tourney to get Don's "The stink of a night shower" and Michael's "He bust the nut" in the mix #DropMadness2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @agundling He was too busy eating Philadelphia horsepoop to notice, I guess 💩💩💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - wait a second....where's "The Stink Of A Night Shower"??? How did that not make the cut in the Don region? #DropMadness2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - know who is NEVER going to be part of #DropMadness ??? Adrienne Watson. I don't know her but she sounds about as much fun as a paint drying contest. All those great lead-ins wasted...WASTED, I tell you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Cousins gets hurt this season (especially in pre-season), then that would give owners clear leverage when negotiating against players. That would hurt players chances of getting fully guaranteed deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - question about the Cousins deal...since his contract is fully guaranteed and this contract should set a precedence with how other players negotiate...will defensive players take it easy when going after him? (cont...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights You had one job to do But instead you played like poo Thought you were great 'til your team gave up 8 Now you deserve a "BOOOO!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - Raise your hand if your child has decided not to fall asleep but rather watch today’s episode of @TMKSESPN on DVR with you at 12:30AM  🖐🏼  😐  #ToddlerIssues  https://t.co/E0fq9rBNfV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I second that last caller's @DonLagreca praise....he did the same on my birthday...stepped out of the booth during 2nd intermission to say Happy Birthday to me #HesALegitimatelyNiceGuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Before taking shots at "The Sopranos",remember that the 2012 show "Vegas" (the Dennis Quaid/Michael Chiklis vehicle, not to be confused with the 1978 Robert Urich vehicle,"Vega$") lasted exactly 1 season. THAT'S disappointment #BOOM #BadaBing  (p.s. but please beat the #NJDevils)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@You_Found_Nimmo Amen!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I was happy to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday last night, I was looking forward to watching the @TMKSESPN show on DVR. It was even funnier with the visual. You guys had me cracking up in the middle of the night #InstantClassic #DropMadness2018 entry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - there I was driving early to LI...and all hell broke loose. @DonLagreca 's fight against the equipment had me laughing so hard, I almost got into an accident 😂😳Wrong day not to be able to tweet in real time #LookAtThisGarbage #FixThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Love it!!! God bless 'em!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - THAT'S what I've been doing wrong this whole time....I've been making out in Houlihans' parking lots, not Perkins #HesALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeightWatchers - why do I love your #wwfreestyle program??? Because this hearty bowl of chicken chili deliciousness is only 1 point!!!!  https://t.co/TUFfi2ciji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - me, upon hearing #DropMadness2018 is happening #CantWait #GottaMakeHimEatTheWhopper #UhHuhISee #MaxScherzinger  https://t.co/t1C01hkNAi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights @ManonRheaume @AlysonLozoff If there was a team that would be ideal to suit up a female goalie during a regular season game, it should be #VGK ...1) because what better place is there to take a chance and 2) it would make this storybook season even more incredible #InternationalWomensDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca 😂😂😂C'mon, man!!!  When Griffey was hitting with his hat on backwards, he was arguably the best player in the entire league. Cespedes isn't even the best on his own team (I'd take Conforto, maybe even Bruce, over Cespedes any day)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I opened my Twitter account last year around this time because of #DropMadness. I was recently thinking of abandoning it (since I'm not that interesting) but I remembered that #DropMadness2018 is upon us #WeKNOW !!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - best retired players in the 4 major sports w/o a ring:  MLB - Ken Griffey Jr, Ted Williams, Ernie Banks NFL - Dan Marino, Barry Sanders NHL - Marcell Dionne, Mike Gartner NBA - Patrick Ewing, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - am I the only one who thinks the @Mets should get Jonathon Lucroy? Their 2 catchers combined couldn't throw out the garbage, much less runners at 2nd. And they're not good hitters either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - hey @Rosenbergradio... so are you saying that since "The Shape of Water" won Best Film on a night where "black" Hollywood was being celebrated, that there was something....fishy??? 😬  #GetOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShayR916 @WeightWatchers I agree. I was a little hesitant initially admitting that I am on WW (“but you’re a man!!!”)...but it really does work. I lost 45 pounds in 4 months. I decided to take it easy in Feb and the #Freestyle program allowed me to maintain weight while enjoying some of my “old” foods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I like Tiger Watch....LOVE the original intro....HATE the new one. Bring back  #EhEhTigerTigerWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I saw Chris Canty once and asked him simply, "Hahn or Rothenberg"....and he just looked at me and smiled. Wouldn't answer my question (though he looked like he really wanted to). Who do you think he prefers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what @RyanRuocco said to @RealMichaelKay last time they spoke...  "I'm done with you....DONE! WITH! YOU!" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @nyjets @Buttlenews @espnbob @MartyLyons93 You'll be missed, Don #FamilyFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - love the pics of Marco and Jaylynn, Don.  God bless you all.  Can you post a pic of the twins in their Mets/SF Giants onesies I gifted? Maybe before they face each other in August since the kids might have outgrown the onesies by then.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - speaking of "the runs"....Michael's music choices just gave it to me #WheresTheBathroom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Hank is a better goalie but Richter had a better defense in front of him.  You don't need to be an great goalie to win a championship (Thomas, Crawford, Giguere). You just have to play great when it counts the most<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Not even close....Yankee Stadium feels like you're watching a game inside a hospital #Cold #Dreary #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, with the #NYR in rebuild mode, does this help or hurt AV? I feel like it hurts him because having Hank between the pipes for the next 2-3 years max means the team has to turn things around very quickly. Not sure AV is the right coach for that  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what is wrong with you guys!?!?!?!? It's McDORMAND!!!! #Yah #YouBetcha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - don't get it twisted...Tiger coming back is important...but he needs to actually compete before giving us DAILY updates.   God, I hope you don't start a David Wright Watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this is like listening to a Matt Harvey Watch  "Today, Matt pitched 2 1/3 innings of hitless ball"  #IDontCareIDontCare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if we HAVE to listen to Tiger Watch, PLEASE keep the original intro #EhEhTigerTigerWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - first look at what the #NYR received in the trade for McDonagh and Miller  #MyGudness  https://t.co/Q0NfPgeNbK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Only way this wrong gets righted is if McDonagh re-signs with the @NYRangers during the off-season #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - If the only major player the @NYRangers received for McDonagh &amp; Miller is Namestnikov, then I HATE this trade. 1st rd pick will be end of rd. The other 2 prospects I know nothing about but that sure doesn't seem like enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Noahsyndergaard Guess he'll be hitting 105 MPH this season?  It was great to see him out there today #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigloser99 HanSMELL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hansel Robles is to the Mets what chicken bones are to garbage cans....he stinks and will only get worse with time. Just dump him already. #LGM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@44HockeyRookie @DonLagreca @MSGNetworks @ArdaOcalTV If you're gonna take a chance like that, what better team to do so than with the @GoldenKnights ? It's Vegas, baby!!!! What they're doing as an expansion team is unprecedented....having a female goalie on ice for them would just add to the their amazing story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44HockeyRookie @DonLagreca @MSGNetworks @ArdaOcalTV A woman’s league is possible, but  I don’t think it would reach WNBA popularity in the States. I also think there will be a female goalie in an NHL game one day, even if it’s for the 3rd period of the final game of the season. And I think it would be incredible if it was with VGK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if Michael Jackson wasn't already dead, he would have died listening to Michael's version of "Man in the Mirror" #HeGone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - excited for the ENNYs....but more excited that #2018DropMadness is right around the corner. I think there have been enough drops for a NCAA and NIT tourney.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @MSGNetworks @ArdaOcalTV Hey Don, stayed up to watch Team USA beat Canada last night. Very happy for them.  I know Manon Rheaume played in NHL exhibition games years ago. Do you think we'll ever see a female goalie (or skater) in a regular season NHL game? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - how much of a loser must you be to take time to call a radio show, stay on hold for who knows how long, lie about what you're going to ask, and then try to embarrass the show host on air? #YoYoBumchuck #YoureBanned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if the NBA wants to maintain or grow their All-Star ratings every year, they need to somehow feature #MetteTowley every year. EVERY! #SmokeShow  https://t.co/uQ6IIwxa6U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Gentlemen, the save by Vasilevskiy on Sat was spectacular. Easily the best I've seen this season. Which unforgettable saves stand out in your minds?  The Hank save against MTL in 2014 playoffs &amp; the Ryan Miller save on Zetterberg's empty net attempt are my faves #GameMisconduct  https://t.co/OQg1qHMftO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - nice segue to @NYC_AlexLee 's traffic report. You're a pro through and through  @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - so Glen Sather &amp; Jeff Gorton say to you, "Don, where should we focus on the #NYR rebuild? What are your top 3 moves?"...how would you answer them?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - But Stallone has a statue...what does Gronk have? #HoorayForHollywood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - this Kings/Oilers game is tremendous. I thought refs were calling interference on LA’s 3rd goal. #AreYouWatching   P.S. Rangers stink!!! AV should be a bit nervous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this bickering is making me uncomfortable....but I can't stop listening #TrainWreck   (btw, I agree with Peter. Even though it was a bad move, that's between McDaniels and his family...and God, of course 😇)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm surprised the Mets didn't have Callie the prom girl introduce Todd Frazier #ClownShoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - is it possible Belichick used holding Butler not just as a punishment to Malcolm but also to try and motivate the rest of the team to really step up their games in his absence??? 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - that caller who called about the Eagles having an asterisk on their title....you can actually hear him walking while telling his story after Don blew up his preposterous theory  #TellYourStoryWalking #ClownShoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @cmcdavid97 What I see from the Rangers is a team trying hard but just isn't that good.  To expect Hank to carry the team night in &amp; night out when they're playing Swiss cheese defense in front of him is unfair &amp; unrealistic. It was a good 7 yr run but it looks like it's over #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - your earlier story reminded me of the Steve Martin vehicle #TheManWith2Brains  https://t.co/zT6Dyk3RmU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you look at the NBA standings and see your favorite team @OrlandoMagic is in last place. Should I get excited about possibly having @TheTraeYoung on the team next year???

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Tough to gauge if the Rangers are just not that good or if the injuries are drastically hurting their play.  Timing is terrible since it's happening around the trade deadline, so it's not clear if they should be buyers or sellers.  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - not since Christian Okoye was bowling defenders over have I wanted to watch a Chiefs game...until your interview with @PatrickMahomes5 . I hope he does well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca With the faint possibility that the NYR will be sellers, who are the guys they absolutely shouldn't move? I'd go with Skjei, Miller, and Buch.

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet &amp; calling me a friend of the show 👍🏽 You're right about amount of games on NBC Sports &amp; NHL Network.

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The NHL is under served on the national TV airwaves. And the parity of the league is unrivaled in any of the 3 other major team sports. Do you think ESPN or Fox Sports would invest in the league any time soon? It's a shame there aren't more people following hockey #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow #EllenBirthdaySwag + 🎁 As an amateur comedian, I have so much love &amp; respect for you. You have been doing your thing so well for so long....a true talent and good person. Thanks for being perpetually entertaining. And a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - since last night, I can’t unsee this. It was equally comical and disgusting. But you persevered, Michael. Suggestion: start talking about how much you hate ice cream...then use that as your payoff next bet you lose 🤔🍦😃  https://t.co/0jrOY6uEbp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I’ve heard the “Tiger Watch” theme music a hundred times and it still cracks me up every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - one word caption....PAIN!  https://t.co/zHwYLeysEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - have it your way. #YouGottaMakeHimEatTheWhopper  https://t.co/d51VorOx7D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - hey Michael, how do you turn a Whopper into an IN-N-OUT burger? You'll find out in about 2 hours 💩💩💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - the GREATEST @TMKSonYES moment I've ever seen. That was phenomenal!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you can have a 2 hour game if you have corporate sponsoring all over the broadcast in lieu of commercial breaks during every stoppage of play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I snack like crazy and I don't eat veggies nor do I like seafood. I'm 5' 10" &amp; was weighing an unhealthy 260 lbs. I started @WeightWatchers on Oct 9th &amp; have lost 44 lbs since. You want to lose weight, I strongly suggest WW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I am officially declaring the rest of my work day over...I can't focus due to #WhopperGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, in a few hours #CantWait  https://t.co/ADcalSVrme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael, you need to be the Big Mac in your White Castle and eat the Whopper. Don't worry, it'll just go In-n-Out 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - with identical records right now, the NYI &amp; NYR are both on the outside of the playoff hunt, 2 pts away from CBJ &amp; PENS. Of those 4 teams, which 2 do you think will make the playoffs? And do you think any of the current top 6 EC teams will fall out? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - can't wait to see Michael "enjoy" his Whopper today #GottaMakeHimEatTheWhopper #OhYeah  https://t.co/nTsQJAwvpN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv Like Dale Murphy, he was arguably the best at his position for a few years... but not long enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM  https://t.co/Jcj1my7X9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "a second well"....LMAO! 😂 #FirstWorldProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @NYC_AlexLee makes me want to be stuck in traffic....in dual Don &amp; Michael voice #Smokeshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the Ripken streak saved Ripken...he would've been benched otherwise. It didn't affect baseball fans the way the '98 HR race did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - why isn't the aspect of stadium fences not being as deep as they were in the 60s, 70s, &amp; 80s discussed as a factor for the increase in the # of HRs? It wasn't JUST related to PEDs  #FACT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Only 3 players topped 61 HRs. Those 3 players were the best of the best OF THEIR ERA! That's what the HOF voting is about. Are the numbers tainted?...yes. But there have been swings up and down in stats in its history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Radio_Randy @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN You're welcome. Seriously, your timing on the drops is impeccable. But please....no congratulatory letters on social media to 7 year old RJ "Sparky" Santillo  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @Radio_Randy is the Lebron James of drops #TheKing #30KDropsAllTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN "Get Out" as a nominee is a stretch. Average movie, at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael is so angry on the air today, I thought Francesa was back on the air 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the Whopper drop is hysterical!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - you have .200 callers chiming in today  https://t.co/Fx9rmUBLW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael going on angry rants and Don being the calm one is the new normal  #YourPhoneCallIsOver  https://t.co/XyFYneD8GB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Avalanche Hey Don....with 3 games left in January (w/ the Blues being their toughest opponent), the 'Lanche can likely finish the month undefeated. Who do you think has been more valuable to the team during their streak, McKinnon or Bernier? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "I got the big one"....too bad Peter wasn't there for THAT drop....at least a 5 seed in the #DropMadness2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @stephenasmith He sure was bloviating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I have been a loyal listener since 1947. If Michael doesn't eat the Whopper loaded with ketchup, mayo, lettuce, &amp; tomatoes....I'm bailing....BAILING!!!! That would be such a bad guy move! #YoureDEAD #LoseTheNumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - my wife tried to defend the Apple commercial with the obnoxious kid. We haven't spoken since Saturday #WhatsAComputer #WHY #ShesALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy When was this? Did you carry a "Will DJ for food" sign? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - people talk about how brilliant Belichick is...but listening to the payoffs on losses, Michael is far more brilliant.  Dying his hair, wearing Rangers gear, eating a Burger King Whopper....that's a WIN, WIN, WIN!!!!! #HeOwnsTheShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeightWatchers -  I must confess...this was a "bad" weekend. I tapped into my weekly points hard...real hard. I ate fajitas, a muffin, cookies, ice cream, popcorn, a bagel....and I STILL didn't gain any weight since Friday AM. I kept it under control, thanks to #WWFreestyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Hello, gentlemen. With Kreider and Shattenkirk down, should the @NYRangers make a trade or two soon? While a few players have stepped up their games, I'm not sure they can make the playoffs with those 2 guys out for a long period of time. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN Not his fault. He deserved to win. But he and his team didn’t make a pact with the devil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game. Saving. Play. #AFCChampionshipGame #JAXvsNE #Patriots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca First, Kreider now Shattenkirk down for a while. The @NYRangers should make a trade or 2 now, right? While a few players have stepped up their games, I'm not sure they can make the playoffs with those 2 guys out for a long period of time #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael's "mock" turtleneck joke was a "snapper" 😬🐢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaMarks You got that wrong. It was actually a half empty pint of avocado ice cream and a rusty spoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "I feel like I'm sitting with McShay &amp; Kiper"....yeah, their little brothers Corky McShay &amp; PeeWee Kiper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - closest NBA player to being a "unicorn" already has a nickname... The Greek Freak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - what did you think of "Get Out"? I thought it was awful! @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca  https://t.co/N3ifbuHpTG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - when you realize there's no #GameMisconduct today #Sad #LetsDoThatHockey #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo  https://t.co/aZ3LIrLjt3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - based on your recommendation, I finally saw #GetOut .... not sure how or why you liked it. I thought it was more like @DonLagreca 's feelings about golf #Garbage #2HoursWasted #NotScary #NotFunny #NoAPeele<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow - I had such a "real" dream with you. We were good friends who traveled together a lot. At some point, feelings developed but I was in denial. You kept pushing me to express my feelings. Then I did. Right when we were about to kiss...I woke up. LOL! What a dream! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - live (and bathe) young!  https://t.co/5rZOxiPmma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - needs more seasoning!  https://t.co/NKhzobdOmS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - nice record set by The King last night. 20 wins in 13 straight is outstanding. I'm pretty sure you'd rank him in top 10 all-time....but what about top 5? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - when @DonLagreca heads to Philly, his nickname should be “PhilaDonPhia”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I just realized I not only missed Michael &amp; Peter....but Morris as well. Now where's Kevin from Brooklyn? #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - after going 5-6-3 in Dec, the @NHLFlames are 6-0 in Jan. With 4 of their next 5 gms at home, they may go undefeated for the month. Smith is the hottest goalie in the league right now. Do you think the bye week will kill their momentum? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the way he owns the tv and radio waves, I wouldn’t be surprised if @RyanSeacrest made his way into the MNF booth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Francesa on MNF would be Derek Fisher as Knick coach adjace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - television manufacturers would love Francesca on MNF. Viewers will be replacing their TVs on a weekly basis #GoToPCRichardAndSon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet. We're on the same wavelength with our top 5. What Vegas is doing is indescribable. I'm already looking forward to the @espn #30For30 documentary in 15 years regarding this @GoldenKnights season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Blackhawks picking up Duclair was a good move on their part. He's a restricted free agent, but they're perennially a playoff team so he may keep Chicago in his long term plans  My top 5 this week: 5. Boston 4. Washington 3. Winnipeg 2. Tampa Bay 1. Vegas, baby! #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - an observation...if you don't want callers to dilly dally when they're up, then you shouldn't ask "How are you?"...doesn't that open up the opportunity for superfluous mall talk? Just say "Hey _____" and keep it moving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gappleSNY @SNYtv Oooohhhh....Dwight looks like he doesn't weigh on anything 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louievcde @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN The media didn't force KP to state that he's tired. He did that all on his own. Anyway, it's not that serious, so I'm done with this conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louievcde @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN I bet Giannis never complained about being tired 1/3 into his 3rd season. And Giannis has an NBA body built for the grind.  Not saying KP doesn't have a nice game and potential for greatness...but The Greek Freak right now is a better player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - remember when the folks at Ringling Bros had goats surgically altered to appear as "unicorns"? That was a lie and so is Porzingis as the proverbial unicorn. He's good, but not a superstar. The Greek Freak is a unicorn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm so connected to the show, that when you couldn't think of the Orioles' closer's name, I yelled out load at work, "Zach Britton"....like you could hear me 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Chapman is a DL stint waiting to happen. No way you trade Robertson for Darvish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - when the Mets signed Cespedes, they thought they were getting a Brooks Brothers suit. Instead he played like a Karako suit. So now they're afraid to buy expensive suits. Bruce is a Calvin Klein suit...nice but not too pricey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - for the record, I look great in my Target clothing. I don't need to shop at Brooks Brothers.....just saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the signing of Cespedes and minimal ROI on him last year limits the Mets' chances of making a big signing in the near future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the Jay Bruce signing is GREAT. They got a high end player for $0.60 to the dollar #LGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - when you're waiting for the #GameMisconduct tweet, then realize today is a bye  #WHY #ISleepTilNoon #ThatsTheAnswer #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo  https://t.co/RaPjZGzexB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 Ugh....those are the worst. I'm sure it took a whole lot for you not to smack the kid (and parents) down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 LOL!!! Sounds like that kids' parents have given up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca BTW...I think your glasses are on point despite what @RealMichaelKay and @Rosenbergradio say. But as a big hockey guy, I was wondering how would you look with a more familiar pair of glasses. So I present to you the 4th @Hanson_Brothers , Donny Hanson  https://t.co/WWzHpx5LRd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Hey Don, who are your midseason picks for the Hart, Calder, Norris, and Vezina awards? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Lagreca Hot Take Count for today - Nancy 1, Don 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - btw, I would watch @katienolan play with her hair for 5 hours #SmokeShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - hey Peter, ask Michael if it was @LAURASTYLEZ playing with her hair for 5 minutes, if he would have turned off the television. I bet not #ThatsTheAnswer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Your team is on bye Twitter feed is a bit light So I write haikus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Hey Don and EJ, what do you guys think about what Lias Andersson did with his silver medal? Were his actions more about being "spoiled" than "competitive"? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Radio_Randy Instant classic!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sack was just a setup...WOW!!! What a finish!!! #CFPNationalChampionship #GeorgiavsAlabama #UGAvsBAMA #RollTide<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if Peter left the show, he'd get the Chuck from Happy Days treatment...like he was never there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - I hope you light up Blob Raismann today on @TMKSESPN . He deserves Fire and Fury with his clown shoes article over the weekend<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I know how Don feels. I had my 3rd child at 47 years of age, 13 years after my son was born. I'm next level tired, perpetually  https://t.co/LmzGVHCk9G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the "high/low" game was better and more exciting than a Knicks game. Both guys deserve to win!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Glad you made it home safely last night, Don. I was wondering if you thought the Maroon hit on Doughty warranted a suspension? And if so, was 2 games a fair number?   My top 5:  5) Bruins 4) Knights 3) Blues 2) Caps 1) Lightning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSonYES - the good thing about DVRing the show is I don’t miss an episode when i can’t listen at work. The bad thing is I can’t tweet in real time. With that, here’s Don with Mean Joe Greene  https://t.co/MyKGHj2oyK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSonYES - real reason why Belichick quit the NYJ  https://t.co/fyHEIf0zpS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - watched yesterday’s episode last night on DVR. Wish I could’ve sent this during the segment when Michael declared himself “Sexiest Man Alive”....looking at this pic, it’s hard to disagree 😂  https://t.co/U9HZcAt9lG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay  @TMKSESPN - Michael, with this “bomb cyclone” in NYC (a bit overstated), will there be a live show today? With @DonLagreca coming in from Jersey &amp; you traveling from the land of the sexy pineapple, that leaves only @Rosenbergradio with an “easy” commute to studio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonicaBenavidez @WeightWatchers @SkinnyCowUS I literally use half my points on snacks. Sad, but true. But I have some “healthy” snack options (besides fruits, of course)...Enlightened ice creams always hit the spot...there’s a pumpkin pie recipe using Bisquick that’s 4 pts per 1/8th...&amp; Nature Valley oatmeal bars are 6 pts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - went to the supermarket to pick up some fruit...passed the pineapple section...left my cart where it was, left the store, &amp; went home to shower. I’ll never look at them the same again #KeyParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah @WeightWatchers @djkhaled I LOVE the #WWFreestyle plan. I crush snacks (I spend half of my points on them), hate veggies, &amp; my workouts consists of waking up &amp; rolling out of bed.Yet I’ve lost 36 lbs in 12 wks.

<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @DonLagreca I was heading home so i missed it. But I just saw it on DVR. Thanks for the shout out, @DonLagreca . Hope the Lagreca twins wear it in good health. Welcome back. With you guys back, the show was poppin’!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I watched the Spanish stations for the NYE countdown. At least the hosts and guests are super hot. Who cares what they're saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBronxTales1 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @YESNetwork Gotta disagree.  Peter adds to the dynamic of the show. It would not be as entertaining without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca WELCOME BACK!!!! Hope babies (and mom) are doing well. Did you receive the gift I left for you at the Holiday Party....with Kreider out and Mika still not 100% since coming back from concussion, do you think the Rangers make a move to add a 2nd line player? #GameMisconduct  https://t.co/dyiapefkJC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - can’t wait for tomorrow’s edition of #GameMisconduct. While your hiatus was completely understandable (and a blessing!), I’m really looking forward to hearing you talk pucks again. Hope you’ve thawed out from today’s #winterclassic2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I considered being at @CitiField for the @TheNHLWinter but the weather was too frightful. So instead I watch from the comfort of my home. Let’s Go @NYRangers !!! #LGR #WinterClassic  https://t.co/D3MfkEJbhH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic - I know today is the 27th anniversary of Scott Skiles setting the NBA record for assists in a game (30)...because I WAS THERE!!! Everyone was screaming for Ice Reynolds to take the shot with about 40 secs left in the game. #DroppingDimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diandrareyes @cm142034 @SFGrAdventure I just spoke to a rep. She stated the pass pick-up has been extended to May 5th. I specifically asked if that means I will keep the upgrade privileges and she said “YES”. Like you guys, I would love to see that in writing. Maybe someone from GA will reply on the thread 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diandrareyes @SFGrAdventure Thanks. I called yesterday &amp; questioned their ridiculous policy. I'm an hour &amp; a half away from the park. Seems silly to have to drive 3 hrs roundtrip just to pick up a pass. I've committed, they've taken my money...why force me to go there in 15 degree weather on NYE weekend? 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFGrAdventure Are we still able to pick up our season passes on Sunday at the gate?  Per your rules, I must pick up my pass by Dec 31st or lose my upgrade privileges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay   https://t.co/rE02B3VdMJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @ESPNNY98_7FM Looking forward to you doing that hockey on #GameMisconduct  https://t.co/C3kwKWNOOx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights As a Rangers fan I appreciate your team Glad you're in the West<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights I see your limerick and will try to match it:  Love the @GoldenKnights feed Laughed so hard once that I peed When most tweets are dumb And they make me feel numb Your posts are just what I need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - don't know why people hate on Peter so much.  Sure, he can be a little rough around the edges sometimes....but he's added a dynamic to the show that only enhances it. Looking forward to all of you returning on the 2nd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koolboblove @StretchandBob @ItMeJaren @rockrubber45s I have 1 movie downloaded in my Netflix queue. It’s my go to when I’m on the train heading to and from work. The Biggie part still gives me goosebumps. Every. Damn. Time.  https://t.co/jWWpV575RF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - so psyched to hear you call tonight's game. You've been missed by @NYRangers fans #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodzJohnny - I remember you from your WWF days.  Did you also work at a school in Brooklyn in the '80s?  I know there was a wrestler who worked at IS 171 in Cypress Hills but can't remember if it was you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @DaveMaloneyMSG @NYRangers @Capitals @DanGraca That’s great, Donny Pucks. Glad you’re back &amp; the kids are doing well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeightWatchers - the #WWFreestyle program is tougher to navigate since I’m not a veggie eater and I love my snacks. But it still works for me, as you can see. Christmas week was tough, but I still managed to lose another 7.5 pounds since Dec 4th (34 lbs total in 11 weeks) #Focus  https://t.co/doxhUqsNWo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I wait as the crew is on vacation Sure, there's a show...but it's not with THE guys No rants, nothing maj, no rooting for themselves It's another week of longing Jan 2nd can't get here soon enough And I wait and I wait 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my friend has never seen #Elf or #AChristmasStory. How is this even possible? They show ACS 12 TIMES IN A ROW ON 2 DIFFERENT STATIONS! Not sure if I should still be friends with this person. #DayAfterChristmas #CottonHeadedNinnyMuggin #ShootYourEyeOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @TMKSESPN @HDumpty39 @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @ChrisCanty99 Good times at @MillersAleHouse with e'erybody. It was great meeting you and hanging, Chase. Hopefully we'll do this again next year, if not sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL LOL! Did you tell her it was because Chad didn’t hold on to his Johnson? 😳😬😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL Brilliant! And he didn’t change his last name like Chad Ochocinco to make that happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, your mom was right...that is a gift for you...and it’s from me. Hope the twins are well.   Props to @agundling for leaving the gift on camera for the segment. @RealMichaelKay @TMKSonYES @TMKSESPN @ESPNNY98_7FM #TMKSHolidayParty #LagrecaWatch  https://t.co/cZQY4j9w0c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @ChrisCanty99 @RothenbergESPN @HDumpty39 And of course, my dude @CSquared2318<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a good time at @TMKSESPN Holiday Party with @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @ChrisCanty99 @RothenbergESPN @HDumpty39  #Zingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Papa Don, not sure when you’ll see your @TMKSESPN compadres....but I left something for you with the crew. Hope it gets to you soon. @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling #TMKSHolidayParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay This is a Christmas miracle 😂 Thanks so much. Truly appreciate it!  https://t.co/PiSQV2jHMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @CSquared2318 @RealMichaelKay I'm about to weep like I ate chicken fingers from the MSG suites #ChaseIsANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @CSquared2318 @RealMichaelKay Stop playing! For real????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - my friends bailed on me for tomorrow, so I'm going solo to the @TMKSESPN Holiday Party. Think I care? #ImRootingForMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "I PLAY WELL WITH MY MOUTH"?!?!?!? OMG, that's a #1 #DropMadness seed, for sure 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don. I 🙏🏽 the twins are doing well.  Was wondering if there was any chance you'll be at the @TMKSESPN holiday party tomorrow.  Just like the show....it wouldn't be the same without you #ThatsTheAnswer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSquared2318 @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN The Marlins may want to exhume the actual Sam Adams to fill a roster spot and pencil him 8th in their lineup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @MillersAleHouse What's the limit of raffle tickets given for toy donations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - would you say the excitement of having Stanton and Judge in the same lineup is equivalent to when Reggie was teamed up with Winfield? That was a BIG deal in '81<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @ESPNNY98_7FM @YESNetwork @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca Today you can truly say, "I OWN THE SHOW!!!" #ImRootingForMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Resourceful! God bless the Lagreca fam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - if Stanton gets traded to the Yankees this weekend, I'm betting my life savings...all $753....that there will be a mention of the Pythagorean theorem on Monday's show when Kay is solo #ItsBaseball #WeAreTalkingBaseball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - re: next week's holiday party, do you get 2 raffle bucks for EACH unwrapped toy you bring? Or is it 2 bucks per person, regardless of the number of gifts donated?  https://t.co/qfU9kwQo3n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN - re: next week's holiday party, do you get 2 raffle bucks for EACH unwrapped toy you bring? Or is it 2 bucks per person, regardless of the number of gifts donated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - me, now that I know @DonLagreca is safe and still on board.   It's Friyay, y'all. Hope you have a great show.   BTW....yesterday's EMN was incredible. I think I peed my pants #LagrecaWatch  https://t.co/EeSu9081FZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - FUNNIEST. ENN. EVER!!!!! I'm dying over here with the @DonLagreca drops 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - then the kids starting crying and he said "YOU'RE BANNED"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "I'M DONE WITH HIM!" ...hilarious!<|endoftext|>

Welcome to fatherhood. It's AWESOME! Praying that the kids continue to progress nicely. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Dudes can also be called Brosenbergs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I put in my request for the day off. It'll be Kay, Lagreca, Rosenberg, and me at Miller's Ale House. Now, if I can only get through at the 5 o'clock hour for the VIP treatment #ImRootingForMe  https://t.co/QRchR7Fo7o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN The drops for LaGreca Watch yesterday were fantastic. One that was missing that is maj is "the stink of a night shower"....that one kills me 😂 @Radio_Randy @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - yesterday seemed incomplete. No #GameMisconduct &amp; missing from @TMKSESPN. Not sure what your "assignment" is but I do hope you return very soon(like today). I swear if the pinhead suits are messing w/ you, I'm banning the mothership #ThatsTheAnswer @RealMichaelKay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL Islanders should NEVER say anything about another team’s attendance. Their games are @ 80% capacity on a good night. I’ve been to a few games at Barclays. It’s a nice arena....for a Nets game. But terrible for hockey.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Putting in my Personal Time Off form from work for the 15th. I don't care that Miller's chicken fingers won't make me weep....I'm going for the entertainment! #YouOwnTheShow #ThatsTheAnswer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @TMKSespn - this may be my favorite episode since I jumped on board a few years ago. You guys are on fire today.  Loved the show before, but Peter was the missing piece #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @TMKSespn - I'm expecting tonight's #ENN to make me weep like the chicken fingers in MSG's suites....tears of joy and laughter  #JustMightWetMyPants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @TMKSespn - I have to say....I'm more outraged by Michael's non-invitation and subsequently telling a flat out lie to Don than what the Giants did to Eli #BADGUY #SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @TMKSespn - this conversation with @BoogSciambi is both hilarious and uncomfortable....but more hilarious 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @BoogSciambi Hey @realmichaelkay, all I have to say is #IWishYouLovedDonLikeIDo #BadGuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @tmksespn - Michael wants to Make America Safe Again #MASA #CabNarc #YourPhoneCallIsOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @tmksespn - speaking of Death Wish, there's a remake coming out soon. Right up there with "Point Break" in reference to movies that never should have been remade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca - of the trades that have taken place since the summer, which do you think have been the most impactful this season to both, the buyer and seller? I'd say Schenn to the Blues and Smith leaving the Coyotes #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @AGundling - guys, I need your honest opinion....should I take a PTO day from work to attend the @TMKSESPN Holiday Party? Personal days are like unicorns at my job, but I'd love to hang with you fellas #KayLagrecaRosenbergandDiaz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DONLAGRECA -maybe the bogus interference call in yesterday's #NYR game cost them the W...but truth is they were flat 1st 10 minutes of the game. 3 goals on 6 shots is never a good thing. Desharneis played well in Mika's absence....but they really miss McDonagh #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Nice to see Kreider on his game. #NYR have needed him to turn it on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuraGOATsky65 @GoldenKnights You beat me to it  😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Wait....are they reading these tweets? Shouldn't they be getting ready to play? 😳😬😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers YES!!! Some fight from this team. Best way to knock 'em out is with 2 more goals! (oh, and don't let them score) #LGR #NYR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers What a move! Needs to be challenged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca "RECIPE FOR HEARTACHE", I said 😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh boy....Lundqvist/Rangers having one of THOSE nights 😔 Is it early Oct again? #LGR #LetsGoRangers #NYRvsFLA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaMarks It's a weasel move made by a once proud organization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @realmichaelkay @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Ben McAdoo will likely NEVER be a head coach again after he loses his job in January #ClownShoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet. I totally understand that you couldn't make it to the section on Friday, but just you acknowledging me was enough. AND you have a new fan....my wife thinks you're super cool. #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca - I know the #NYR are on a 4 game winning streak, but they've played unfocused and sloppy the last 2 games. Expecting Hank to bail them out is a recipe for heartache. Do you think McDonagh's absence is a major factor in their uneven play? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio -what kind of guy is @DonLagreca ? On Friday's #GameMisconduct he stated he would stop by the section I was in to wish me a happy b-day. Even though he couldn't physically make it, he found me from media row &amp; gave me a shout #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - THANK YOU for the birthday shout on Friday. I'm still laughing that I took off my cap thinking I'd hear you better....clown shoe move 😂 Anyway, just wondering why the #NYR can't put together 3 solid periods. Looked very sloppy at times vs DET &amp; VAN #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -again, THANK YOU for the birthday wish. Could barely hear you which led to one of the dumbest things I’ve ever done...took off my cap so I could hear you better..LMAO! Who does that? Anyway, nice win for the @NYRangers. Hank was spectacular. And I got a birthday #Win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - thanks for the shout out. I appreciate that immensely. You made my day, brother #IDoLoveTheSportLikeYouDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At @NYRangers game for my birthday. Hoping for a win and a visit from @DonLagreca . That would make me a happy, happy man #LetsGoRangers #LGR #GameMisconduct  https://t.co/mi3NipZAT1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving Day. I’m always grateful for #GameMisconduct. Thank you for doing this podcast. Most intriguing matchup tonight is Preds-Blues. I’m going with StL on home ice. I’ll be in da house for @NYRangers game...sec 224, row 12 #MyBirthday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - happy Thanksgiving Day. I’m grateful that I get to hear and watch your show every weekday. It’s provided so much entertainment for me. You guys are awesome. Enjoy your day with your families tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN It took Peterman 14 attempts to do what Brady &amp; Smith have done in 713 attempts. #Awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL As a Jets fan, I can tell you that while that play was a microcosm of that season....it's still funny as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don, missed my #GameMisconduct fix yesterday. With Malcolm Subban back on the roster, should he or Lagace be Vegas' #1 goalie until Fleury's return? Wishing you and your family a happy Thanksgiving &amp; I hope to see you on Fri at @NYRangers game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMezzolesta @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Oh great. Now I have to reprogram my memory bank because I had it wrong all this time. Please don’t tell me “Disco Duck” wasn’t a real duck singing. That would just destroy my childhood memories 🦆🎤🕺🏼🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "The tip makes you indebted to me. YOU CAN'T FLIP THE TIP!!!"...hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @denisleary had the best line about smoking...."the logo on the package could be a skull &amp; crossbones and they can call the cigarettes CANCER...and people will STILL smoke" #SadButTrue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Fish Heads was by Dr Demento<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - baseball is in its off-season, yet it's gotten more mention than the NHL. You guys haven't spoken a single word about our local teams. WE HAVE 3 OF THEM!!! And the Devils had a great win last night #LetsDoThatHockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - smoking a heater while delaying traffic? Not KOOL, man! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy I love when I get the notification that my email address will be removed in 7-10 days.  Who's managing their list, Barney Rubble????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - me, after realizing there won't be a #GameMisconduct episode for today #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo  https://t.co/IsXxpLHJ6c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Pete Carroll cost them the game. Fake FG to end 1st half &amp; challenging the clear non-catch was “McAdooish”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - what a sweet pass from @AdamHenrique to Moore to win the game. I hope all 3 local teams make the playoffs. Unlikely, but would be fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - STRONG opening 45 min. I learned more about McGovern than I ever cared to. And all I can think about when Michael said he talks about Rutgers stuff when he's with his friends is Al Bundy's 4 TD game at Polk HS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN Took me 3 hours from start of pain to being admitted to hospital. Thought one of them Alien thingies was coming out of me. Doc said “go straight to hospital. Do not pass Go and do not collect $200”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - 1/4 of the season in, Stamkos &amp; Kutcherov are playing like Lemieux &amp; Jagr.  Besides Crosby &amp; Malkin, is there another duo comparable to them in the league?  And here's my top 5 this week:  5) Wild 4)Blues 3)Jets 2)Leafs 1)Lightning  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - with Hank turning 36 next year, is it possible the Rangers would move him in the off-season by eating some of his salary? Should they strongly consider drafting a goalie in 1st round? I love Hank but the signs are there that his best days are gone #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Other than the season when they asked hard-working people to pay money to watch unemployed plumbers in uniforms taking the field, I can't remember a worse season for the NFL than this one. #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @GetSpectrum @Altice @optimum @DIRECTV Over 48 hours to get a technician to you? That's completely unacceptable. Besides....don't they know who you are? #IOwnTheShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jcamacho228 @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN LOL! I probably would've done the same. Glad you had that awesome experience 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - I turn on the @TMKSESPN show....and Joshua calls and turns it into the radio version of "This Is Us"...I just want to hug someone right now #ChickenFingersMakeHimWeep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - watching you guys crack jokes, bicker, support each other, &amp; attack the haters reminds me of why I like your show so much...you're like my family...sometimes it's love/hate but mostly it's love #IWishYouLovedTheSportLikeIDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL In Rangers case, they traded away their top 2 Cs in consecutive years and only received 1 player who can play the position well (Zibanejad). So they need a quality playmaker on their 2nd line as Hayes isn't a true center.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I have a strong inkling that my wife is taking me to the @NYRangers game on 11/24 for my birthday. If so, what are the chances of  me meeting my favorite hockey guy? (that, of course, would be YOU!) #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Lightning trade for goalie Domingue. If they're smart, they'll ship him straight to Syracuse to work on his game. Any idea why this trade was made? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights - you’re great when you win...but you even make an ass whooping fun to follow. I’m already looking forward to your next game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - all these tweets about people switching from FAN next month....they should have switched a LONG time ago. Can't think of many things worse than listening to Francesa blather incessantly for hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Liked Vlad's @boonieves question on #GameMisconduct as well. As a proud Latino (Puerto Rican from Brooklyn), it would be great to know he's "one of us" 🇵🇷🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Hurricanes' attendance over the last 4 years is dreadful.  2nd to last in 2013-14 season then dead last each year since. Karmanos has stated they wouldn't be moved if sold...but how can they be profitable filling less than half the arena each gm? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enes_Kanter - every team....EVERY TEAM....would benefit having a player like you on their squad. Much #Respect on how you squared up with the Princess last night and didn't back down. This @nyknicks team has a lot of heart. It's refreshing to see after all these years #Knicks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -  Rangers are on a nice streak and seem to be firing on all cylinders now...but what positions do you think they need to strengthen for sustained success?  #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @RealMichaelKay , I like the thinking of offering @carlosbeltran15 the chance to interview for the Yankees managerial job...but doesn't this go against your thinking that they won't hire someone with no experience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - have you ever seen a team start 4 goalies in 11 games like the @GoldenKnights have? Assuming Subban &amp; Fleury both return this week, is it a given the Fleury will be the #1 goalie? Statistically, Subban has better numbers (in 3 gms vs Fleury's 4) #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - I know Don says it doesn’t happen in the NFL....but McAdoo should be unemployed as of tomorrow afternoon. #Jints #LittleGiants #Awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @shattdeuces @NYRangers Pretty, pretty, pretty......pretty good! #ImRootingForMe #IceChips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I was having a great day, listening to your show at work....laughing &amp; enjoying...and then you had that tender hockey moment...Don longing for Michael to love the sport like he does...and I've just been a mess since then 😢 #Sad #IceChips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess we've had it wrong the whole time.  His name should have been spelled Louis C--K  #LouisCK #LouieCK #LuckyLouie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Aw man, early #GameMisconduct. Didn't get my ? in on time. Want to know with @boonieves back on ice what lines should AV go with for tonight's game? I say  1:Kreider, Z, Buch / McD, Holden 2:Nash, Hayes, Zucc / Skjei, Shat 3:Vesey, Boo, Miller / Staal, Kamp 4: Grabner, Desh, Fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Ezekiel Crush  https://t.co/tExHtBHwab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - the game that NEVER ends. This is how I spend my commute to and from work on the train.  https://t.co/k6uZYIaNSc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet and sharing your story on #GameMisconduct  Did you do this to your card after Korn dissed you?  😂  https://t.co/1qoCG9c80a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - you've stated you were a Devils fan in the past. Who is your favorite Devils player? What would be your Devils dream team? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - the @TBLightning are putting on an absolute clinic against the Sharks. Scary good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "He thinks he knows...which makes him dangerous" 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that caller Michael sounded like Morris' grandfather #CongratulationsOnYourLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy Future president?  Don't laugh....it happened  😨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuffedPlay @LisaLampanelli @usweekly @XtinaGaribaldi @Heytravhey Nice seeing you earlier today. Best of luck with the play. I'll make a date with my wife to go see it soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Sammy Soso....in a few years he's gonna like Eddie Murphy's old white man character in "Coming To America"..."where's the spoon? A-haaaa"  https://t.co/00NOp4JrYW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers Obviously, there's more to winning &amp; losing than the PP, but it certainly helps that they're in sync with the man advantage #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - @NYRangers 1st 10 gms PP stats-19.5% PP &amp; 77.7% PK...2-6-2 rec. The last 6 gms - 33.3% PP &amp; 88.2% PK...5-1 rec #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -even though VGK have lost 4 of 5 they're still top 5, IMO. How many teams can compete w/ 4th (rookie) goalie? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TheHumble_21 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Tough interview. You guys are asking the right questions but Landon has to be diplomatic. He can't be 💯 with his answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM  https://t.co/7oI2NWMvu3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @AnitaMarks @ChrisCanty99 all night. It's no wonder she went 7-0 on her picks. Don't hate, congratulate!!! #ShesANiceWoman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I met @AnitaMarks &amp; @ChrisCanty99 on Thur night. They were talking football ....1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -Rookie Keller of ARI has 10 gls...2 more than Eichel,Larkin,Marner,&amp; Panarin combined. What's going on w/ them? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - there have been 2 players with 60 or more goals in the last 20 seasons. Do you think Kucherov can top 60? 70? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNNY98_7FM - thank you for the opportunity to hang at @BrooklynBrewery with @ChrisCanty99 &amp; @AnitaMarks . #LetsGoJets  https://t.co/sgnTXA7ODy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RaySanti - @TeamCJCorrea just messed it up for every single dude out there #proposal #TopThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti The #Patriots introduced their new backup at practice today  https://t.co/WuZCuMzNHi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights ....looking for another goalie 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights YOUUUUU!!!! You're good!!!!  https://t.co/DwGsfV653w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -good thing he only won money &amp; didn't have to attend a concert w/ you  #HesASorryMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN She was passing gas while this pic was taken 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights What a great hockey story The Knights have been this young season But Tavares can't be stopped #Fuhgedaboutit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenKnights Welcome to Brooklyn. We keep your ball 💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - listening to Lyons stomp on Bob, it reminded me of Peter yelling "DREAM PORTAL!"😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealingMB 5. Being a Mets/Knicks/Jets/Islanders fan 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I want to see the Knights at Barclay Center tonight. Care to join me? I got your ticket! (nosebleed adjace 😁) #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - have you ever seen 3 goals scored in 34 seconds? That was a crazy scene in Winnipeg yesterday. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - turned on the @NHLNetwork after the Cowboys game...the @NHLJets are treating the Pens like they’re an AHL team. Holy smokes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - maybe @JackCurryYES can be MF DOOM for Halloween  https://t.co/R5qnQxIzXr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - STRONG interview with @JackCurryYES . And you guys are just getting started 💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @JackCurryYES DROPPED A MF DOOM REFERENCE!!! OH SNAP!!!! #ALLCAPZ #MADVILLAINY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I look forward to #GameMisconduct every day. Great to see it gaining momentum. Hope the #NYR can gain momentum as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic BTW...you should also boast about having the top scoring frontcourt in the league (avg 72.8/gm). No team is within 10 pts of that #Puremagic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Nice game from Boo Nieves. Though they weren't really challenged by ARI, good to see #NYR play focused. My top 5 are TB, LA, StL, Pit, &amp; Veg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaMarks - I missed last night's nail biter (40-0??? Really???). However, like you, I WILL watch Stranger Things 2 this weekend. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boonieves - great game last night. Wish you continued success throughout the season and your career #LetsGoRangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boonieves -don't know your heritage but you 1) have a Spanish last name &amp; 2) play for the @NYRangers so you're already in my top 5 faves 💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - will you go to Barclay Center for a hockey game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -it's likely those on the WestCoast thought the Yanks thumbs down thing was stupid too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosenbergradio -  agradecido...pronounced ah-grah-de-SEE-doe. Not trying to clown you, just wanted to help you with your espanol #MiGente<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - call me a theorist, but I think AV starts Pavelec today to cover him if they lose. It will be because they had their #2 at net<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio - if there were analytics for @TMKSESPN calls, it would be 47.6% of them are dumb #YoYoBumChucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - oh boy...I think Sam from Long Branch is going to make Michael's heart explode 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Don said, "You pulled a Peter"....yeah, but whose????? #IPulledOutTheHappyOrgan 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay DOH!!!  https://t.co/7hc1BJ88tb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling - who were you talking to on today's @TMKSESPN drop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeMiceElfAndDie @BleacherReport Kyrie??? Is that you on your "secret" handle???? LOL!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @ROSENBERGRADIO @TMKSESPN - 9 yrs ago, Donnie had no managerial experience. He does now. Why isn't that valid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti He also thinks the earth is flat, soooo............  https://t.co/6O0hX89Naf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BleacherReport He also thinks the earth is flat, soooo.....  https://t.co/NU7UaJN9dG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy The Sweatiest Taboo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay It didn't make sense to give Mattingly the job in '08. But he's an experienced mgr  now. And Yogi was a legend &amp; managed the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @RealMichaelKay, why do you keep talking about a decision made 9 years ago?Donnie now has experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - if the #NYR lose to the Coyotes tonight, there will be another skipper let go in NYC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca J Schwartz is 3rd in goals &amp; pts. I don't know much about him. Is he that good? Or benefiting from playing w/Schenn &amp; Tara? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - Which pitcher did you most like playing behind? #AskMookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCoachESPN Sometimes fans forget that though they're getting PAID, players are human.Good to see them enjoying the GAME of baseball.Great series so far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougWilliamsSNY @SNYtv Expectations will be through the roof next season &amp; pressure as high as it was when he took over the team.Sometimes,enough is enough. #CeeYa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic I love it. But I'll love it more if you're still on top (or close to it) on April 8th. Great job so far. The Magic is back! #PureMagic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - to quote Don, that was poppin'  #HowardCosell #FlavaInYaEar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - back in the day, I really admired Asia Carrera's body...of work 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay With all due respect (Ricky Bobby reference)..I don't understand that argument. Donnie now has the managerial experience he didn't have then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KMDiNero @TMKSESPN #DropMadness2018 will be much more interesting than the actual March Madness, for sure.So many drops, they made need to do a #DropMadnessNIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael thinks Jersey is in a different time zone 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - how far are you guys from a hospital? One of you will go into cardiac arrest soon 😨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -back to back dumbbells. It's so bad, Don probably wishes you had 10 guests #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I love Don’s expression after that YoYo Bumchuck caller #ClownShoes  https://t.co/hZnwdHUB5V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael needs to stop dissing Game Misconduct. It's a GREAT podcast #WhatThePuck ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - so if Michael breaks up w/Jodi, they're having beers together? #BestFriends #SheGone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hey Don....obviously I know you're a Rangers guy....but do/would you ever go see the Isles play in Brooklyn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca What do you think about Bishop being pulled w/ 36 min left in gm &amp; only down 1 goal? Hitchcock said it was a "wake-up call" #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -I'm not exactly sure...but I think I peed a little laughing at this time zone segment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @BartScott57 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Bart's still knocking people around beyond his playing days 💯 Loved his scorching hot takes on Reese &amp; the Jints<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mets Edgardo Alfonso #GuessTheMet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Here's a hot take...if Rangers get embarrassed by Coyotes on Thur, AV is gone! This team is too talented to play so poorly #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Sounds like @Rosenbergradio is spreading fake news about you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL That's very cool. To show how everything has progressed over time. Yet, Maggie's still pregnant...and not even in her 3rd trimester 🤔 LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - I wonder if ESPN will offer Kaepernick a job on @TMKSESPN when they oust Don #YoureFired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Love the podcast especially when EJ is on. It's great hearing you guys talk hockey. #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @EJHradek_NHL Stars have found their groove. Where would you rank their 1st line (Benn, Seguin, Radulov)? I say 4th behind TB, WAS, &amp; CHI #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm so gullible I Googled Randy Hahn to see if he really was related to @alanhahn . Not even close 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what about Grant Hill?  He had about 16 surgeries on his foot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Coyotes are BAD!They play Chi @ hm then next 5 on road.They could be winless thru 12 gms. My top 5 are TOR, LA, NJ, TB, VEG. #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob Thx for liking my 1st tweet but I bet you didn't want to touch the 2nd one 😳 I went on the Google to research. I found the reason. Pa'lante<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - 2017 Yankees are the 2014 Royals in the #1 media market. That makes it a great story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Part of the #NYR problem is that Vesey &amp; Nash combined have 1 more pt than you or me.Could either be a healthy scratch soon? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - listened to your podcast w/ Jose Andres. Is dude a chef or a politician? I think he answered 1 question as asked 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob I find it odd that neither Rosie nor J-Lo mentions the other when talking about their time on In Living Color. Things that make you go hmmm🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - just heard your podcast w/ Rosie &amp; Eric. Dope! Wish I could have been there but I was dealing with Irma in PR that week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN How about taking the 98th caller instead of the 1st? Or how about an online entry and you pick 1 random winner a day? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - as someone who uses the YES app to watch @TMKSESPN , I have ZERO chance of winning contest 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - did @Rosenbergradio just say his thing got cut off?!? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay -zen Don was asked if he wanted to go to Yankees' game. He answered,"Nah, I'm a stay"😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -this yr ONLY, it's ok for Mets fans to root for Yanks...it's a great baseball story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @NYRangers Hayes &amp; Kreider have also underperformed. They've been down 1-0 within the 1st minute of play 2 times in 7 games. It's been a cluster....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -here's the problem with @NYRangers ...Vesey &amp; Nash combined have 1 more pt than I do🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -Hayward injury was horrific..but the Livingston injury was worse NBA injury I've seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I think Girardi is waxing poetic because he was so close to getting fired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio - I'm a diehard Mets fan...normally hate the Yanks...but THIS team is different. Am I a fraud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @CanadiensMTL @GoldenKnights Vegas has as many pts as Bos, Mtl, &amp; NYR combined! Are they legit? Would a win in either of next 2 gms (StL &amp; Chi) validate? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca With all due respect to Vegas &amp; their great start, they're not in my top 5, which is: 1) TB 2) CHI 3) TOR 4) NJ 5) StL #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelFhurley An errant throw ties the game so it was gutsy. True, Lobaton was back safely...but Baseball 101 teaches you that you have to stay on the bag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelFhurley Initially, I felt it bailed the Cubs out. Then I realized not reversing the call would penalize them after a great play by Contreras &amp; Rizzo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HLundqvist30 @ProCamps @PlayersTribune @Citibank My son went to the camp in Aug 2014. You spoke with him and signed his helmet. It was unforgettable for him...and me. Thank you, Hank #LGR  https://t.co/xfWHr0pr9y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -I'm a diehard Mets fan but I'm happy for Girardi. Would've been a TERRIBLE end as mgr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Sonny Gray should start Gm 3 ONLY IF the Yanks are 2-0 in the series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Peter should've thrown in the Maloney scream during that "key party" segment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Avalanche Avs off to a good start after being picked to be last in the division. Do you think this quiets the Duchene trade talks? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Not a Yankees fan but glad they won. Would’ve been a terrible way for Girardi to end his run with them. Now everyone can move on from gm 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Same dude??? Word??? Wow 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - have you guys even discussed the Dolphins' Blow line....er, I mean O-line coach?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @GoldenKnights It’s helping me forget the terrible start by the Rangers. 😕 You have to love what the Knights are doing if you’re a true hockey fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - if this keeps up, I may have to switch allegiance from the Rangers to the Knights. What a great start! #VegasStrong #LGR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Chicago trading Panarin to get Saad back is working very nicely for the 'Hawks.  Do you think it was an even trade? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio-Yanks blow game 2, OBJ blows his ankle, Dolphins' coach blows...so looking forward to @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - (overheard in #NYGiants locker room) "Has anyone seen our playbook???"  #Awful #Sad  https://t.co/PbrP6xbcE4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I know it was preseason, but how great was it to see the @NYRangers on ice last night? #hockeyisback #LGR #NYRangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @JdeGrom19 At this point, his 15 wins represents 23% of total wins. Plus he's 2nd in NL in SO. That's a Cy Young type season. Thank you, @JdeGrom19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I'm so glad Eli &amp; the Giants sucked as much as they did to deflect attention from Harvey &amp; the abysmal Mets🤮#NYMets #Suck #Awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael's Larry David impersonation was worse than his Tyson #prettyprettyprettybad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @TheGarden @MSGNetworks I don't care that it's just the 1st preseason game, I love this so much because it means HOCKEY'S BACK, BABY!!!! Game on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - loving technology right now. Close Fox Sports app, open ESPN app. Not missing ENN 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN 2 things....1)did you pick up the book? These days, connecting with Jesus seems like a good idea &amp; 2)I see a bit of Robert Pattinson as well  https://t.co/c7eEPtB5iP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @LAURASTYLEZ And I know @RealMichaelKay will agree with me 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - however, when ranking morning hip hop DJs, @LAURASTYLEZ gets the nod over Peter 😳😀😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Petey getting ethered by the Kayster. HOW DARE HE throw Charlamagne in the convo 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I was thinking about how we haven't heard from Kevin from BK. Now where's Morris???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -I root for the Mets, Jets, &amp; Orlando Magic. Thank God the Rangers give me some hope 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Michael and Don...let's get this show started right  https://t.co/b2PsTaXa0d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - THANK YOU for #GameMisconduct. It's a shame hockey isn't more recognized as the great sport it is. People need to wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob Ok. I have my blank TDK 60 minute cassette in the JVC ready. I don't want to miss it. That's what's good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - BTW...I finished "Ozark" last night...the Jason Bateman vehicle. Good show!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just check your Rolodex for the phone number 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - can someone PLEASE give Michael a Snickers bar?!?!  https://t.co/Lo3mUVj8Gm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "stupid baby clown shoe garbage"... drop madness worthy?  It's at least a 12 seed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - it's not outlandish to think that Eli will get hurt. He's 36 &amp; has no protection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -the offensive line is still terrible. If/when Eli gets hurt, this season is OVER!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -last time I heard fighting like this, our lawyers told us to be quiet #Divorce #CeeYa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - so far, today's episode has reminded me of Thanksgiving with my fam #Dysfunctional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - 10 min into the show, &amp; I'm already uncomfortable. And Larry David isn't there yet 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - love Don's new street vernacular #Maj #BlowingUpMySpot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro - just heard you on "What's Good?" with @StretchandBob . Eres MUY chistosa. Loved the interview. Funny, insightful, and real! 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - fellas, can I find the What's Good podcast with @rosieperezbklyn anywhere? It's not on the NPR site that I can see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @ESPNNY98_7FM @YESNetwork (Larry thinking) "Did I really commit to going on @TMKSESPN?  Do I have to answer questions from callers? Ugh" 😂  I can't wait to hear this!  https://t.co/P6lUR5MDWu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob -just curious, what's your favorite hip-hop album from start to finish? Mine is Low End Theory (&amp; Enter the Wu-Tang Clan too)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Mets I loved Fish. And my parents styled my hair like Wojo. Good times! (&lt;--- another great show)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -love how Peter asked A-Rod how he feels about Stanton's pursuit of a tainted record 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - That caller was hit with too many foul balls...$8K for Rizzuto card? #HolyCow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - where's the love for Comic Book Men, another Kevin Smith vehicle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - last caller sounds like a younger Morris....like if Mo was 60 years old<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio I couldn't agree with me (and you) more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio - you guys are the best on the radio. Here's to many more years of #TheMichaelKayShow  https://t.co/CEW6h0G4HK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -so glad GM is BACK! With additions of Radulov, Hanzal, Methot, &amp; Bishop, do Stars have enough to make playoffs? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelianblack ESPN promotes their sports personalities, as long as they don't display their true personalities. I smell a suspension which is a damn shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN I didn't even mention the Nets  #irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Mets....Knicks...Jets....Islanders...there's a pattern in New York, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to LaVoe while driving in PR with mi gente #WEPA !!! Back home now looking forward to catching up on @StretchandBob #whatsgoodnpr  https://t.co/eh5E2j8GKD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@koolboblove Fortunate to be on west side of the island...still crazy tho. And it's Jimmy Castor Bunch up in here #ItJustBegun #HurricaneIrma #Aguadilla  https://t.co/0EJjUmAxh5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 1st visit to PR in 13 yrs, &amp; #HurricaneIrma comes &amp; ruins it. Praying for those in its path. #PRStrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I'd rather see a mink coat wearing Namath bobblehead. Better reflection of how he looked walking around NYC back in the days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koolboblove @StretchandBob @NPR Like Stevie's friend said...this episode was "chevere".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob Would def been at 9/7 show in BK (Bell House is in my area), but I'll be in me &amp; @rosieperezbklyn 's motherland 🏝️...if Irma doesn't ruin it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy - I'm a BIG Beatles fan. Hearing you cutting up "The Word" made my armhairs stand. Same as when Beasties sampled "The End".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - I never wanted to be famous (rich, maybe...but not famous). But now I do so I could sit with you dudes for a chat 💯 #WORD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - your podcasts are dope. Informative &amp; entertaining. People I didn't know much about made me Google their names &amp; causes 👊🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMets  https://t.co/QrN1rVIrZm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay  Pinhead suit: "No BP show at 6 so viewers can see @Rosenbergradio" 🤔 "On 2nd thought, replay '78 WS instead"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow Here's another nugget from my past. It was a rough childhood to say the least. #ellen15  https://t.co/kIfWMztOzs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow For my best friend's Sweet 16, I was her partner.  I was half the man I am now...literally &amp; figuratively #ellen15 #PuttingOnTheRitz  https://t.co/nl9aTOCV73<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - despite the frustration, pain, and disappointment felt throughout the season....you will ALWAYS be our team #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMets  https://t.co/LGc6ffIPNy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - wait, @RealMichaelKay...when you say you "do" bachelorette parties, do you mean you announce them? #YoureScaryBro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - my 3 favorite rants are the Reyes one, the Cespedes one, and the Raisman one (CLOWN SHOES!!!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN -This guy @RealMichaelKay sounds like he's taken too many punches to the head. "turn away"...yeah, right #WatchForFree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetsBooth - Sanchez can't slide back to first because his chest is killing him. Hence the short lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Or the guy who inadvertently 🙄 threw a 98 MPH pitch at a batter's head. I'm with @Rosenbergradio on this one...he meant to hit McCann<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - what are the odds that Ray from NC is watching this episode? He'd probably croak 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "You don't know who could touch you" should be at least an #8 seed in #DropMadness2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @DonLagreca showing excitement about tomorrow's fight 😂  https://t.co/KFhAhjJYi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic Outstanding starting five.  My 2nd team would be: Skiles, Anderson, Scott, Lewis, &amp; Grant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - sorry Michael, but I'm not buying what you're selling. Betances meant to hit him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Like Lennon, McCartney, &amp; Harrison...you guys are better together than apart on @TMKSESPN #TRUTH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @Buster_ESPN So much to discuss after yesterday's WWE match. Betances deserves a 10 gm susp. No punch thrown can do the damage of a 98 MPH ball to head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers - when are the Winter Classic tix going on sale?!?!?! #WinterClassic2018 #LGR #NYRangers #CitiField #ImReady  https://t.co/PRFbjzvjhl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BeePs79 @DetLionBlood Great tweet. Do u always include subjects that have nothing to do with conversations on your replies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetLionBlood This will likely be more exciting than the upcoming #MayweatherMcGregor fight. Chump move by Cabrera. Play your game and talk with your bat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN - I think Thomas will help @kevinlove 's numbers as he'll find him more than Irving did #DropDimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN - this trade will serve both teams well.  But next season, it helps Cavs more #Depth #ContractYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN - name the rest of Iverson's teammates when he won that 1 game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN - Even losing Nets 1st pick, Celts still have Lakers 1st pick if it falls within #2-5  #STRONG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL A shame Dreamcast didn't take off like it should have. I thought the graphics were best around at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL I have my Dreamcast w/Crazy Taxi in storage. Never getting rid of it. Also had 2600, Colecovision, NES, Genesis, PS, PS2, Xbox, 2 360s, Wii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlagreca -I don't know what mystical power that eclipse had, but I saw Cespedes slide to make a catch last night 😳 #Whoa #LGM #NYM #Mets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RothenbergESPN @Rosenbergradio - I think YES would have shown the Canadian Curling Tournament before showing @TMKSESPN #SAD #NoRespect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN Not sure what's the big deal...I looked right at it and my eyes are just fine 😎 #SolarEclipse2017  https://t.co/QlevoXlLAd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay I saw the eclipse....no big deal. And my eyes feel fine 😎  https://t.co/7FBgl93mcp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I'm going to check out the eclipse at 2:45 so I can be back at my desk by 3. #KayAndDonEclipseTheSun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure what's the big deal...I looked right at it and my eyes are just fine 😎 #Eclipse #Eclipse2017 #SolarEclipse2017 #SolarEclipse  https://t.co/4GPSC3Wjah<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - get John Sterling to read the rant. That would be TREMENDOUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Hooters wings are my absolute favorite...I don't care who's serving them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - playing devil's advocate, should there be a Malcolm X statue in Harlem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca  @agundling @TMKSESPN - love the perspective brought to the show regularly by @Rosenbergradio .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSleter315 @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy I couldn't remember who he directed that rant to...but yes, that also needs to be added<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - poker? I just met her???? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - his lady friend is like Chapman on Cubs...get the win then #SeeYa #Sex 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @TMKSESPN - only one way to find out if that was the best rant ever #RantMadness  https://t.co/9cIzN4i7Tg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the MetroPCS commercial played on your breaks makes me want to NEVER use MetroPCS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the Jeter Meter 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryannorton317 @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy You're right.  That has to be at least a #3 seed.  There are plenty to choose from. And I'm sure there will be many more by March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Matz needs to be shut down, whether he's healthy or not. He's hurting the @Mets #Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling @Radio_Randy @TMKSESPN -a few more rants &amp; there could be a #RantMadness in March 😡  https://t.co/G33r5Bw1K1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow I know you like cute baby videos so I want to share my favorite one (my son &amp; daughter SnapChatting) #BabyGirl #SnapChat #Love  https://t.co/dCwSypYTWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @teixeiramark25 is a network programming genius. Maybe call it "Clown Show"???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -good thing about #Mets being out of contention since May is it hurts less in Aug 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @teixeiramark25 is like Morris from LI...the more I hear him, the more I ❤️ him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I'm not a wrestling fan but that was a good interview. Ross is the real deal #Strong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL Yeah, that's pretty tight. Well, team's GM &amp; VP need to earn their paychecks &amp; find a way to keep the young guns on the ice 30 min/gm LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL Difference is...McDavid (20) &amp; Draisiatl (21) will be hitting their prime toward the end of their contracts. Oilers can be beasts next 8 yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STHinSouthFL @PaulaAbdul She's still very attractive &amp; YES, she should message you. That way you can rush(rush) to her. Maybe she'll be #ForeverYourGirl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay - In Game of Thrones speak, Steve was Dracarysed by Don #GOT #Lit #ClownShow  https://t.co/Vp8a4nfi92<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StretchArmy @koolboblove @rosieperezbklyn @EricHaze I would be upset that I can't make it if it wasn't for the fact that I'll be 😎 in Aguadilla, PR 🇵🇷. Looking forward to hearing the podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Steve is to the phone what #45 is to Twitter #CLOWNSHOW #LoseTheNumber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - not watching but I envision Don looking like this during his rant #YoureAJoke  https://t.co/sWfqUVQfCW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Michael with his mood eyes.  Here he's rooting for the Mets  https://t.co/CaPuKNQxgb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - so Michael has mood eyes? Do you have a ring to match? And what color does @jodiapplekay see most?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - can you two please not fight?  It makes me nervous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Love you guys...but I miss the ridiculousness of @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Gary Cooper was a hella actor. Garrett Cooper is a mediocre player. Just wanted to state the obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I missed the Maloney scream. Good to hear it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti He's a human lottery. Not sure what's going to be called from day to day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli @StuffedPlay What do you have when you're holding a chicken ball in your left hand and a chicken ball in your right hand?  A really big chicken!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli @StuffedPlay What caused the pudding to get moist?  It spotted dick  😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli @StuffedPlay I have a cheese joke, but my kids tell me it's no gouda 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti - how the heck do you work with this maniac @RothenbergESPN on a daily basis?  Que Dios te bendiga 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Sterling is your big reveal? Not since Geraldo Rivera opened Capone's vault have I been so mislead 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN -I stepped away from my desk for 20 minutes. Did Michael announce who his Centerstage guest will be? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Stephen Colbert? Ricky Gervais? Dave Chapelle? Louis CK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I think it's an legendary comedian. Other than the few I've already named, I'm guessing Lewis Black.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Dave Grohl? Eddie Vedder? Weird Al Yankovic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN Steve Martin? Dave Letterman? Carl Reiner? Bill Cos....err, scratch that :-/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - how about Mel Brooks? Or Jerry Lewis?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - so no Jeter or Obama. Maybe it's Jerry Seinfeld?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - actually, I'm changing my guess to #44...BAM!!!! #YES #Centerstage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - you booked #2 Derek Jeter on Centerstage. That's my guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - his Waldman impression was SPOT ON!!!! #SourShoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still amazed that #45th showed more outrage over @Kmart dropping Ivanka's clothing line than the deaths in #Charlottesville #ThisIsNotUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti   https://t.co/xyPO5ARG9y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay YOU OWN THE SHOW!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TyDButler - the show needed more "flavor"....but it was by no means terrible.  https://t.co/kX5M5FiA3e<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MLB @Mets @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - HanSMELL Robles does it yet again #WalkOffPitcher #HeStinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB @Mets HOW MANY MORE TIMES!?!?!?!? #HeStinks #DFA #HanSMELL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SEE THE @Mets LOSE WITH ROBLES ON THE MOUND?!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StretchandBob - nice work on this podcast. Music at the end was tight too @StretchArmy @koolboblove @MrEddieHuang @NPR #WhatsGood  https://t.co/67mcl6gQKf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HLundqvist30 My son went in 2014. You signed his helmet. He said it's one of his most treasured possessions.  Thx for making an unforgettable memory.  https://t.co/eAeggnq2RQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mets @ynscspds Got my tix yesterday!!!!! #LGM #LetsGoMets #NYMETS #Mets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the term "walk-off pitcher" is ever used in @MLB I'm pretty sure the @Mets Robles would be the prime example #HeStinks #LGM #NYMets #Mets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - that's an East Coast opinion. Maybe in the left coast Pujols &amp; Posey are = to Jeter &amp; Ortiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - I'm with you, bruh  https://t.co/rrjiRgp56e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - ALF was SOOOO underrated. #IKillMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - look at Mr Met...vilified for giving the finger. Wasn't even a middle one #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - can't wait for Peter to book that fan on the show like he did the NJ Transit doofus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SonnyGray2 @RealMichaelKay Welcome to the @Yankees Sonny! And best of luck  #NYYankees #BronxBombers  https://t.co/GrnWGjewlS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN -I'm a HUGE Mets fan &amp; a known Yankee HATER but it's hard not to like THIS Yankee team. Their fans? 👎🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli - the mentoring you gave me STILL resonates after all these years. I'm glad we crossed paths long ago. Helped shape my humor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli - remember me? I hope so.  I recently did 2 bringer shows at @CarolinesonBway after a loooong layoff  https://t.co/6B6vlPsfrI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Reservoir Dogs!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I don't usually trust other's judgements, but I'll give Ozarks a watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -Don is getting spiritual today..no beginning, no end..sacrificing the show #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -Mets chances of making the playoffs is as good as staying employed at the White House<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - any truth that the Mets traded a case of Gatorade for a 6-pack of Bud Light Lime? 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @agundling @Radio_Randy -too bad Sonny can't wear number "Seven" #SDRE #underratedband  https://t.co/11WjufRnm6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - this phone call almost has me in tears. I ❤️ Morris. #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - tying D Naughton &amp; J Wildenstein references, she looks like An American Wildcat in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay -I usually work while I'm listening/watching @TMKSESPN. But when @teixeiramark25 does his segments, I stop &amp; listen #Respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I love listening/watching @TMKSESPN....but it's just not the same without you.  Hope you're enjoying your time off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti I asked Siri to give me directions to Mofongo House in the Heights. She replied, "I did not find any information about Moe's Fungal House" 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @seth_lugo Pineapple on pizza isn't acceptable. Cable Guy is good,but not the greatest movie ever (Borat is 😂).And a hot dog is a sandwich..sorta kinda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Addison Reed was 1 yard away from blowing back-to-back gms. 2 foul balls that were thisclose to being fair. No wins are ever easy for @Mets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio Dath ludicrouth! #HowDareHe #HackTyson #TimTyson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -great call by Paul. A parent needs to monitor his/her child's progress &amp; decide case by case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti Safe to say, that comparison "Reek"ed 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonas_SNY @SNYtv @JdeGrom19 @sal_licata @nydnraiss @PLeonardNYDN @DailyNewsLive Maybe since Santana closed out the '08 season (July-Sep).  He went 9-0 with 7 no decisions (4 of those games Johan left with the lead)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRagazzo @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio If @Spumoni_Gardens pizza = J-Lo, then the pizza in your pic = Aretha Franklin #TooBig #NoRespect #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - shout out for the Hector Lavoe mention during yesterday's @TMKSESPN . It was quick but I caught it #MiGente #ElCantante<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca  @TMKSESPN -I had L&amp;B's pizza this evening...clearly the J-Lo of pizza. Thanks for the analogy, @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - only thing funnier than hearing Kay do Tyson would be Tyson imitating Kay #TheeYa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @teixeiramark25 @TMKSESPN - RANT WATCH IS OVER!!!!! And what a spectacular way to end it #GolfIsGarbage #BritishOpenThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @teixeiramark25 @TMKSESPN - are we seeing the beginning of the Lagreca &amp; Tex Show? 2 friends talking sports? #SeeYa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti @AnitaMarks Anyway, again..thanks for taking my call. Hope I can hear sports talk tomorrow 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti @AnitaMarks It's not worth my time, your time, or anyone else's time other than those directly affected by Simpson's release.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti @AnitaMarks - hey, thx for taking my call. I was cut off but I wanted to say that while "the world stood still", mine didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMattWolf @VicMonte @RealMichaelKay Borderline call with @RealMichaelKay response.  https://t.co/TCVtoUzTBN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - can you help a brother out? If I get there at 8:00, will I be the only one at the park?  https://t.co/aQQa2Oz54E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - OJ is free. Great! Now he can continue his search for Nicole's killer #OJSimpsonParole #ManInTheMirror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OJ made a living avoiding defenders. Made commercials avoiding airport passengers. Tried to avoid police. Lots of conflict! #OJSimpsonParole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets - unfortunate that @seth_lugo won't get the W today. Pitched a hella game #LGM #NYMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic My favorite "Big 3" ever! #LetsGoMagic #OrlandoMagic #ThisMagicMoment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OJ says he's "basically had a conflict-free life". Can someone please explain to him what conflict means? #AlternativeFacts #OJSimpsonParole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv @TriStateFord Leading off the bottom of the 5th...JO-SE REYES!!!!  #SNYFord5thSweepstakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca What time will everything wrap up?  Can't make it at 5 but would like to stop by later, if possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Sounds like Omar needs to call in.  He always fires Don up #OmarLovesToLose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNYtv I believe Noah had more than just a hand in designing his bobblehead doll 😳 😂 @RonDarlingJr @MetsBooth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers - do you have an idea as to when the Winter Classic tickets will go on sale?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Can you please send Robles with Ramirez? #HeStinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaeAndSyd -like the flyest dude on @espn , I ❤️ ice cream runs with my baby. I miss Scott. I 🙏🏼 he's resting in peace #ScoopsForStu #LGM  https://t.co/P3UfFmb8xC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - THERE'S A REASON WHY HE'S ON HIS 4TH TEAM IN 5 YEARS. Cespedes is this generation's Albert Belle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - I remember watching Steve Sax's throwing woes on the George Michael Sports Machine #WayBackWednesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN -I hope Don makes a weather reference so I can find my Farmer's Almanac. I know it's around here somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN -the episode when Kramer references his cigars &amp; that he has Cubans...&amp; they're actually Cuban rollers 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN -in "The Contest" when Kramer walks into the apt, slams money on counter, &amp; yells "I'm OUT!!" is bananas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - is there any truth that Mark McGwire got juiced by kissing Jose Canseco before games? #AthleticKissing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - I'm guessing they stayed at the airport hotel after their passionate kissing 😯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca There's a difference between "born in" and "from". Melo was born in Brooklyn but he's from Baltimore because that's where he was raised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny @TMKSESPN - this is quite possibly my fave Lagreca face. It articulates pain &amp; frustration without uttering a sound.  https://t.co/slSp6hmlCa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Espngreeny - how do you pronounce the name of NY's basketball team....Knickerbockers....or Stinkerbockers?  #TheLatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Pi-Az-za  (clap, clap....clap clap clap)  https://t.co/FDq0VUUN4Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AskNYRShatty  Welcome home. If you could only have one, would you rather have a HOF career or win a Cup with the @NYRangers? #IWishYouBoth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been an @OrlandoMagic fan since Day 1. And @Iam1Cent &amp; @Shaq are still my favorite Magic players ever. HBD, Penny #DroppingDimes  https://t.co/SmfEL7ledz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please remind me why I'm a Mets fan? Also, can someone find a way to get Robles off the team? Thanks! @DonLagreca @Espngreeny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop hating, @RealMichaelKay  This man is a ROCK STAR!!!! #LizardKing @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @AmazingWillies  https://t.co/XcIw5CRIZ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - I got a hummer while listening to Tesla...but that's a story for another day #Signs #WhatYouGive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - can new GM Perry help the Knicks, a team that has been in Arrested Development for 20 years? Maeby 😁  https://t.co/WkERMiafa4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti @IanBegley @AnitaMarks He reminds me of this character from Arrested Development, which explains the Knicks over the last 20 years. Will Scott help fix it? Maeby 😁  https://t.co/kuSkGJxHG4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti But I sure remember my mind blown the first time I heard "The Show" on Mr Magic's Rap Attack #OldSkool #RealHipHop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti I don't think Doug E Fresh remembers who he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay - is the @DonLagreca rant watch over after this call?  #MadLoveForIra #SittingInFilth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -I was drunk once and made out with a pig who I thought had 3 heads but that's a story for another day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Actually, @RealMichaelKay took more days off last month than the Sports Dope and @TMKSESPN STILL won. Because it's a better show  #MyGudness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - don't worry. Even with ESPN inexplicably airing a doc about your @TMKSESPN competitor, you'll continue to gain traction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - I'm really perplexed...are people defending Francesa or just simply hating on you? Mike w/o Mad Dog has been simply awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - I know how important ratings are...but it doesn't necessarily equate to quality. @TMKSESPN is HANDS DOWN a better show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Kay, Lagreca, Rosenberg, and Me...that's why @TMKSESPN is #1 @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio #ImRootingForMe  https://t.co/edFXutGeQ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio -I used to listen to WFAN years ago...and I'm sorry that I did. The @TMKSESPN is so much better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -remember that time Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 pts in a game? Yeah, right...oh wait...that DID happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I walked in the gates when they opened at 5:45 and STILL waited 1/2 hour at Shake Shack #BAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - remember that time Mantle hit a home run the length of 2 and a half football fields? #NeverHappened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - did they use the metric system to measure Mantle's homers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I believe it was Sid Finch that threw the pitch that Mantle hit 700+ feet  #Wow #CMonMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USPS - you're all about quality service. Even your shipping boxes are 1st Class!   https://t.co/6iR6KNVw13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @HDumpty39 @TMKSESPN - Never mind...I take my last tweet back..@RealMichaelKay is a BAD guy...talking about your mom like that!😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @HDumpty39 @TMKSESPN - (in response to @RealMichaelKay trying to come off as a bad guy)..."Trying too hard, bro!" #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @HDumpty39 @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Phil's pool should look like this since the Knicks are under water since he took over  https://t.co/u5c64FsmzI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - trade Salas for 6 bottles of Bacardi and Coke #FairTrade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I finally saw Cespedes slide and it was AWFUL! And of course, he gets hurt #ItsBasicallyFallingDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - "Raw" was too vulgar for me. "Delirious" was better, IMO #ItsJustSoRidiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - excellent point, Don.  Stick to your roots and you'll be okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -though not nearly as big of a star,Dane Cook has also disappeared from the face of the earth #DNozzle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Murphy's most recent success was as a talking donkey....A SMART ASS! And that was years ago #SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Eddie Murphy's fall from superstardom is pretty much unmatched<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay  https://t.co/gAcslTM5Db<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca -just saw the USA Women's Hockey team in the ESPN Body issue.My question is, do they all use CCM sticks? (in O'Neil voice "WOW")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaySanti I thought the HR Derby was moved from Miami to Da Bronx #BAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - is the HR Derby a week early? Pineda is awful today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - # of hits with your bat against @Al_Leiter22 -0...# of hits with your body -8. Better luck next yr  @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @bw51official @AmazingWillies The only thing that may have made it even better was....more cowbell! Other than that, it was outstanding!   #IGotAFever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - you're doing the show alone today....but don't feel lonely. I'm with you, bro #CountOnMe #TuningInAt3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca - I'm at my desk at work, smiling and clapping. Loved the beach bash ep<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay LOL! You have me Googling 25th amendment. Thanks for the lesson. And as bad as Phil is, who says the Knicks would hire someone better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Dolan showed just how much he cares about Knicks fans when he extended Phil's contract another 2 years. I wouldn't pay a dime to see them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I kiiiid! No questions, just wanted to make you laugh like you guys make me laugh everyday. Love your show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - BTW...can ESPN Radio stop playing that La Quinta ad about "winning in business"? 💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I loved spending some time away with my fam, but I missed this show's crazy banter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - your convo about porn &amp; passwords reminded me of The Cable Guy.."the pathword ith.."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I wonder when was the last time the other Mike had a convo like this on his show 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - The Minion Kay Show....everyone's so happy!!!!!  https://t.co/Hnju2IbqYh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay-Michael, hope you had a nice wknd. Was @ Yankees gm on Sun,2nd time @ "new" stadium. Hardest thing to find there? Burgers! 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - 4 Gs on 11 Shots was brutal. Can't blame the deflection on Rinne but he should've stopped 2 of the other 3 #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - NO CALLS FOR THE NEXT 45 MINUTES...PLEASE!!! You have .200 callers chiming in 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - I love listening to you guys, but your callers are killing me. It's Windowlicker Friday 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - hope you got to see that game-winning shot. What. A. Game. #PENSvsSENS #NHLPLAYOFFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - at least Humphries, Odom, and Disick didn't end up like this  https://t.co/9WQpLsIZiP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - 70 is 69 with a fing....oh, never mind....there are kids reading this #DirtyJoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the handshakes at the end of an @NHL playoff series is outstanding. Love it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN  @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - How I envision the convo between Cruz &amp; @Rosenbergradio would've happened face to face  https://t.co/rnxSMzRLpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN  @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - probability of catching a foul ball doesn't change regardless of how many fans in attendance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay Thanks  https://t.co/8BuuaVIQ4u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay - "TEX" number is 44202?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay - Here's the @DonLagreca rant meter.  I expect this to go full red by end of the show #MetsStink  https://t.co/IotfXJdyM3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Richter with a record-breaking awful game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Skelly or skully...however you call it, it was THE game growing up  https://t.co/aCFH2LuHq4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio -not sure if the Sens will win...but this could have been the result if you took @RealMichaelKay 's bet to rename @TMKSESPN  https://t.co/UTXDMhvUbx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - please explain to @DonLagreca &amp; @RealMichaelKay if they don't get the reference.  Thanks 💩  https://t.co/butN3LM5Be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN -If they put a Sanchez area in the Stadium &amp; the fans made a mess...would it be a Dirty Sanchez sect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - right now, Irving couldn't even shine Pippen's Jordans #HOFer #GottaPlayD #6Rings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Kyrie Irving in the mid-90s would have been Terry Porter adjace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN HANDS DOWN!!!!  Kyrie is great, but Pippen played great on both sides of the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - @Rosenbergradio 's Pippen comment was Kendrick Lamar GOAT adjace #NoWay #PippenPlayedD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - If there was a sovereignty for windowlickers, Steve would be King (and Omar the Prince).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN - I smell a dual @DonLagreca &amp; @RealMichaelKay rant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Judge/Conforto comparison hasn't been seen here in NYC since Mattingly/Hernandez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Depends....is Omar calling in? #IHopeSo #OmarLovesToLose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - I love how some of your followers are like modern day Monty Halls #LetsMakeADeal #ChanceAdamsForAPackOfGum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN I wonder who ratted him out? Maybe the pig squealed! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @robgsellman Pulling for @robgsellman to find his groove. He's got great stuff...just needs to keep pitches away from the middle of the plate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Very likely...but a Senators win wouldn't surprise me. Other than gm 5, they battle! @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay- so you would give up the name of @TMKSESPN to @Rosenbergradio if the Senators won the series? Hmm... @DonLagreca @agundling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay-did you say you would give up the name of @TMKSESPN to @Rosenbergradio if the Senators won the series?@DonLagreca @agundling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Did the same in gm 4 until the 4th qtr. He knows that to beat GS, EVERYONE on that team needs to play at their very best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio -my theory on James' gm 3 dud..he purposely played subpar to challenge team to lift their game 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - yesterday a @TMKSESPN listener asked what 6 teams share a name? I came up with Jets, Giants, Rangers, Cardinals, Kings, ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping they bring "magic" back to Orlando #LetsGoMagic  https://t.co/nHcYn9O5U1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay At times it seems like the drops are played too often...your &amp; @DonLagreca 's faces let us know when.But most of the time they are hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - want to point out a highlight from Milone's start on Sun...he got 4 outs, 3 on Ks 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN HOFer??? His numbers say no, but my heart says yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @PredsNHL They showed a lot of fight against the Ducks. It's too bad @RyanJohansen19 won't be on the ice with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - @RealMichaelKay 's Salt Lake City story was gold. So was the replay of the @jodiapplekay call 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - highly dependable, slightly dysfunctional...and sometimes sleep-inducing 😴 #IKiiiiid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Lebron had a bad game, that's all. He'll have a triple-double in gm 4. #Believeland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN - I'm sockless right now...so what's going to happen when I hear your bullpen stats? Toeless??? 😨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN-listened to yesterday's show, then watched it on DVR.Was like mom &amp; dad fighting during Xmas #awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling - the timing of your @DonLagreca drops are PERFECT! #ThatsTheAnswer #WeKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - just not the same without the D #WhosBad  #WhosDa?  https://t.co/7fEMta3fIS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I haven't heard this much in-fighting since I went back home to visit my folks 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN -just today, you guys have about 20 drops for the 2018 #DropMadness #YouGonnaLetMeTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic I'm SOOOO glad your former GM has no role in selecting your pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Matt Harvey = Dontrelle Willis 2.0 #NoConfidence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Truman Show and The Cable Guy are both grossly underrated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - the SNL episode @RealMichaelKay was referencing from Feb 10, 1996   https://t.co/MxTTkgAnC5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - @Rosenbergradio was dumped for something on Monday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RB_Mrs - I know @espn is downsizing...but you deserve a little extra scratch 💵 for working with bad pipes tonight. Hang in there, trooper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I should be on my way home...but tonight's #ENN is so good, I'd rather get yelled at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I am actually LOLing!!! 😂 #OleDeader #DonRantWatch #ItsBasicallyFallingDown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - Georgina Jeter sounds worse than Julia Gulia #bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN-an MLB pitcher who can't get 5 outs instead of 3 shouldn't be in the majors. #PERIOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay-did Meredith know you weren't feeling well? Because she didn't laugh at your rainbow &amp; unicorns comment.Thought that was odd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heydb - just saw your interview with Pop 😂 #GetOutWhileYouCan #Boss #HappyMothersDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay - at one point during yesterday's Jeter ceremony, I could have sworn I saw a rainbow and unicorns 😁 Great job by all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES - he called Ottawa's arena a dump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - he called Ottawa's arena a dump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @agundling - I'm betting the house that the @DonLagreca rant watch will be over today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca-defense was weak,intensity low,&amp; the offense stalled often.But 2 for 24 on PP was the difference this series,IMO #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the F--K is Hoffman standing by himself in front of the net?!?!? WAKE UP!!!! LETS GO!!!!!! #Blueshirts #LGR #LetsGoRangers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @agundling @TMKSESPN - That wasn't a rant, it was bait. Don totally baited Omar to come thisclose to an aneurysm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN - Omar is the anti-Morris #HesNotANiceMan #IHaveNoAdmirationForHisGifts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HDumpty39 @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN - I agree with Dave. As a Mets fan, I wouldn't root for the Yanks to win a championship if you paid me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @agundling-I'm catching up on this week's #ENN &amp; just heard @Rosenbergradio bewildered about Kent Hrbek's twin 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio-NBA playoffs are the most boring in team sports. Like Christina Hendricks, it's too top heavy😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling @Rosenbergradio-it should be changed to caller #98 or something like that. Not fair to those on delay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @agundling Does he accept "funny money"???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio-EVERY moron questioning Peter's position on @TMKSESPN would switch w/him in a hot second #TRUTH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca They should have checked Pageau the rest of gm after his 2nd gl. Not enough 🔥 in this series so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - if the Rangers play w/ same physical intensity as they did vs MTL, they can come all the way back...agree? #NYQuestForCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca  - even though Caps won, does giving up 2 gls in less than a minute affect Holtby's confidence for gm 4? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay -during last nt's gm, Keith Hernandez stated Mets didn't have right to force MRI. Maybe your source needs to call @TMKSESPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - amazing Utah story Michael. Tell us another 😂 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN I like when you host @SportsCenter w/ @TheCoachESPN &amp; do your dance party thing. But I'm not mad that @RB_Mrs is working tonite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN - I couldn't agree with me..or you...more. Playoffs w/o @DonLagreca is .250 playoffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kfstacks @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Any truth that Michael uses Touch of Kay to dye his hair? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling - I forgot Peter is out today. Maybe you should discuss on tonight's ENN  https://t.co/dLJZ3o2rDk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #Knicks were a music festival, they would be #fyrefestival. What a #dumpsterfyre. Shout out to @WNFIV &amp; @DylanACOP for their reports<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYRangers Unbelievable save! WOW!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio shouldn't trainer Ray Ramirez receive blame? Mets have constant conditioning issues<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - how surprised would you be if the Oilers upset the Ducks? EDM seemed unfazed by the moment last night #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - I think @ChrisKreider will be the @NYRangers star of this series. He turned it on towards the end of 1st round  #NYQuestForCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Why not air tonight's game on USA Network instead of Law &amp; Order(!)? I would think they'd have a better chance of grabbing viewers on USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay w/ a HUGE plug for @DonLagreca &amp; @HDumpty39 on @TMKSESPN.And he's absolutely right...the best #gamemisconduct #nyquestforcup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Preds sweeping 'hawks was unexpected but all season I felt like the 'hawks weren't as strong as last year.Agree? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @jodiapplekay She's a nice woman! And you're a blessed man, Mr Kay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @NYRangers @ESPNNY98_7FM Called you on Tues &amp; stated more pressure on MTL...even more now. I hope it doesn't go 7, but if it does they've shown they can win at Bell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Kreider with the swing and a miss....I'm just sick to my stomach with this game. 😖 Go #Blueshirts #LetsGoRangers #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers defense asleep. C'mon guys... #LETSGORANGERS !!!!!#Blueshirts #LGR #StanleyCupPlayoffs2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY AREN'T THE  @NYRangers GETTING CALLS?!?! 😡 #refsucks #LetsGoRangers #LGR #StanleyCupPlayoffs2017 #Blueshirts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @TMKSESPN @Radio_Randy The "you're hurting me drop" while Morris is on the phone is absolutely hysterical 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RothenbergESPN @TMKSESPN Morris is always .350...love that guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN He gone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Thanks for referencing my call from Tues night about who has more pressure. Still say it's on Mtl  #nyquestforcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca - Henrik, Mac, &amp; Skjei have been very solid but Rangers need Kreider &amp; Miller to step up to win this series #nyquestforcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Buffalo dismissing Murray &amp; Bylsma...bad look for the Sabres, in my opinion.  Your thoughts? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay Morris sounds like Sol Rosenberg frm The Jerky Boys "I'll bring my glasses &amp; my shoes"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @RealMichaelKay I must say "He's a nice man" about 3 or 4 times a day #DropMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Posted this last week. Serena is 🔥🔥🔥   https://t.co/pwHorxsL55<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @RealMichaelKay I want to sit down and have coffee at a Denny's with Morris #HesANiceMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling STOP IT @RealMichaelKay !!! There has to be a #DropMadness2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling @RealMichaelKay The Rangers 3 word phrase is a cruel, cruel joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling Can you start a @RealMichaelKay rant watch? Tomorrow is day 1  #KayWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Mystery solved!!!  https://t.co/I0vaWNjGEi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio A Frederic Weis reference? I see him every workday on my office wall  https://t.co/lOtvj4Ku5O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Bullpen was spent. Degrom was cooking. He's your ace. LET HIM PITCH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio He could get hurt in the shower like Dustin Johnson. Or that guy who got hurt sneezing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio But Degrom HANDLED the batters in the 7th. Overpowered them. Let him start the 8th!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrafixJoker @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio The Dummy Llama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Some use death as motivation and that's how they cope. God be with Isaiah &amp; his family through this difficult time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio The Rangers wouldn't have advanced w/o MSL when his mom died in '14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Maybe Kristaps will express himself on Twitter or IG like today's athletes do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - "Makes a better day even better"....eventual #13 seed in #DropMadness 2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Degrom overpowered the Marlins in the 7th. Let him start the 8th &amp; see what happens. Stupid move cost them the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca - Collins had to manage based on situation. With the pen tired, he should have stayed w/Degrom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Games like Saturday night's...aside from Rangers losing, do you enjoy the game more watching it or calling it? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelpsUSA Your first line above Has too many syllables Count before you post 🖐🏽 #nationalhaikupoetryday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krispykreme posts pic Celebrating Haiku Day Now I want donuts 🍩 #NationalHaikuPoetryDay #krispykreme #Donuts  https://t.co/VqWIkbc6dz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca No podcasts today? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio I listened to DAMN this morning. I'm officially retiring from listening to hip hop. If that's the best there is, I want out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers Thank you JT for your stupid penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers Gotta score...gotta score...GOTTA SCORE! #LetsGoRangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN @coachella Cam is wearing a print my abuela would look for at the tela shop to make a pillowcase #whatnottowear  #RIPmama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbretosESPN It's the main reason why I like watching you &amp; @TheCoachESPN...you fellas keep it 💯 on #SportsCenter (same for Neil &amp; @stanverrett )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love to see @mbretosESPN and @TheCoachESPN dance like no one is watching on @espn #SportsCenter  😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca 1 game late but Boyle with a sweet, sweet pass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anderson on 🔥🔥🔥 What a play!!! Stick save behind his pad #CapsLeafs #NHLPLAYOFFS #GoLeafs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dumb move by Holtby. Better hope it doesn't cost them. #CapsLeafs #NHLPLAYOFFS #nhl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely nothing beats @NHL playoff hockey in sports. Nothing!!! #NHL #GameOn #nhlplayoffs2017 #StanleyCupPlayoffs2017 #NHLPLAYOFFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Maybe Terry should start Robles tomorrow...since he loves his bullpen so much. Well deserved loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell is @Mets thinking? Degrom should have gone another inning. Now it bites you in the ass. Nice move, geniuses. #NYMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Supernat creates rhymes on the spot. Just because he's not selling records doesn't mean he shouldn't be recognized #realhiphop #realtalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could've been Great Friday but @NYRangers lose a tough one then the @Mets lose in the 9th. At least I know #HeWillRise in 2 days #GodIsGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL @CanadiensMTL Rangers wanted it, Pacioretty wanted it more that possession. Hate the outcome but must give credit where it's due. Still @NYRangers in 7 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca BTW...games like tonight's...aside from the disappointment of Rangers losing, do you enjoy the game more watching or calling it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca No disrespect to Kenny Albert but I really wish you were calling the games. I love the emotion &amp; intensity you bring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling Absolutely warranted rant. Cespedes is great but slide, coño! Play, player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling Is it official?!? Rant watch ends today?!?  YES!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio So @RealMichaelKay is starting pink eye #DropMadness #PEDs #Stinkeye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN You keep Lagares over Grandy. You still have Nimmo in the minors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN An outfield of Cespedes, Conforto, and Bruce is deadly! Cut your losses with Grandy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN (in Clemenza voice) "Leave the Granderson...keep the Bruce"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agundling @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca If I ever call @TMKSESPN I'm talking while I'm on hold just to make sure no one "disconnects the guy"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @HLundqvist30 with another glove save #blueshirts #LetsGoRangers #LGR #NYRangers #KingHenrik  https://t.co/BbmO6Xyl7Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only the Lakers &amp; Pistons finished the season w/ a leading scorer with fewer than Fournier's 17.2 pts/gm. #OrlandoMagic needs to address it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrlandoMagic Been a fan since Gm 1 in '89 &amp; ride w/ you thru highs &amp; lows. PLEASE HIRE A GM THAT DOESN'T SUCK! #OrlandoMagic #LetsGoMagic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The King didn't just stand on his head...he was almost levitating. How do you think Habs will respond in Gm 2? #nyquestforcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Phil deserves the vitriol hurled his way, but the NBA's worst GM was fired today in Orlando. As a Magic fan, I am RELIEVED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Glass..Karlsson..Edmundson...big night for the secondary guys. Hoping old friend Boyle scores gm winner vs Caps #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca My 12 yr old son thinks it's awesome that my tweets have been read on #GameMisconduct. Thank you so much for the cool points! 👍🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Not even Tanner Glass' family would have predicted he would score the 1st goal of the game #LetsGoRangers #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca You left out Phil &amp; Melo #sickofit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio I guess you can say @RealMichaelKay made @DonLagreca put his PP away @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES  #NYQuestForCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I have the Caps losing to the Ducks in the Finals #NHLPLAYOFFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @HDumpty39 Nice job on putting away the PP and changing the podcast name to Quest for Cup #nyquestforcup #LetsGoRangers #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNNY98_7FM @NYRangers @TMKSESPN So when you say, "Be the 5th caller...." do you wait to give those listening online or through the app a fair chance since there's a delay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers @zuccarello36 Woooo....those are LIT! 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio No one could tell that Prince basketball game story like he did. May he RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca What chance do you give Toronto to beat the Caps in the 1st rd? If Caps lose, would Trotz's job be in jeopardy? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The playoffs are finally here!Is there more pressure on offense or defense for the #NYRangers to win this series? #nyquestforcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYRangers We're so ready for the playoffs #Blueshirts #NYR #LetGoRangers #LGR  https://t.co/hYoyUHsOxC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSonYES @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay In response to Yes replaying your John Mayer conversation.....still true  https://t.co/27zC8VzRk1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN I look forward to listening to Game Misconduct daily. @DonLagreca does a great job with the podcast #NHLPLAYOFFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Why kill Porzingis? His D won't get much better but his improvement from last season is only behind KAT &amp; Booker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca 2 Cups in the last 5 years wasn't enough to save Sutter &amp; Lombardi ther jobs in LA. Do you agree with that move? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SFGrAdventure Traveled an hour and a half to a half open park?!? Not really a #GreatAdventure 😡 #SixFlags #MaybeNextTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Dude, 2nd time we're on the same page today! #CableGuy #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay So basically  @Rosenbergradio is the radio version of The Cable Guy #ChipDouglas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay The Raskin sisters &amp; Calvin and Hobbes have been discussed before Tim Tebow  😂 #SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio I almost fell asleep.... it's like the War &amp; Peace of callers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay 2 old friends and a weird, creepy cousin @Rosenbergradio 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay YES!!! Far Side was MAJ!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmksespn @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay I'm with Peter. Where the heck has Hack Raskin been the last year and a half?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca #AlternativeSitters #FakeNannies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamJMarquez My man!!!!! Hope all is well, bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN Is it possible/likely the quest to be #1 starter for #Mets could create friction between the starters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thx for reading my tweet on GM.❤️ the podcast.I'm a @NYRangers fan but am rooting 4 the @NYIslanders to get in.Have a good wknd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Schedule Frank Fleming again...maybe an in-studio visit...that would likely put an end to the streak 😠@RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca My top 5 this week:Caps, Pens, Ducks, Canadiens, &amp; Oilers.Who do you think wins the Calder, Matthews or Laine? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Instead of a shark, the @TMKSESPN has jumped the Fleming @TMKSonYES #Sad #MoveOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio One of the most awkward moments on @TMKSESPN ...good that you can laugh about it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new favorite commercial is the @Chase one with @serenawilliams &amp; @StephenCurry30. She is 🔥🔥🔥 playing ping-pong #IGotNext<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES I love how I can't tell if @RealMichaelKay is kidding or wants to rip someone's head off. It's scary funny @DonLagreca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Is it true that A-Rod is married to J-Lo. If that happened, would they be called Lo-Rod??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I never smoked a cig thanks to Mr. Schnitzer. Scared us straight in the 4th grade ('79) #GoodGuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teixeiramark25 is batting 1.000 so far on @TMKSonYES @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio What time will Rafael Santana be on? #ILoveThe80s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio CBS replaces Simms with Romo...and didn't let Phil know before the media? #BadGuys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca NHL hasn't had a 70+ G scorer since 92-93. Do you think we'll see someone top 70 Gs any time soon? If so, who? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling I know it won't return until next Mar, but I miss #DropMadness. So much fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is #NationalBurritoDay, which means tomorrow will likely be #NationalDiarrheaDay (or #NationalToiletDay). Aint that some ish! #LiveMas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurnerSportsEJ Intelligent, funny, inspirational, even handsome I guess 🙂...but your finest quality is being spiritually grounded #TrustGod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @TMKSESPN Yesterday, @RealMichaelKay criticized the Mets for tribute to Bartolo. 4 words for him: Tino. Martinez. Monument. Park<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I already knew this....but Ovechkin is a bad, bad man! Great game so far. #LGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay More ping-pong balls doesn't guarantee anything in NBA. Improves chances but isn't like other team sports where worst is assured high picks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay Teams with less than a 10% chance of winning lottery won 1st pick 10 times in 30 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay In last 30 years, worst team has won NBA lottery just 6 times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay Guys, pace yourselves...you're tiring me out #exhausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay You guys speak about the Nets so infrequently, I forgot they still existed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay If @Rosenbergradio got hit with a flying chair at #Wrestlemania33, he'd make Don's prayers...#SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay Good thing Ben isn't named Richard 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay Don looks like Ron Jeremy's brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio When you go to someone's house, you bring a pie or cake...not SCOOTERS!!! #KissAss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thx for reading tweet on GM. My ? re: arranging 2018 schedule around Olympics isn't just about Ovechkin. Others will go as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryannorton317 @RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN Good thing you didn't snap a shot of you taking out your happy organ 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to @NYIslanders game on Sun. Hope they stay alive in the playoff race until then. Would love to see a "win or go home" game #Islanders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL Couldn't have come at a worse time for the Pens. Hope Letang comes back good as new next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Would NHL schedule fewer games during 2018 Olympics since some players (like Ovechkin) may go to Korea anyway? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN @agundling Winner, winner, chicken dinner #DropMadness  https://t.co/Iw9defeTo4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoltsJolts @RealMichaelKay As @RealMichaelKay would say...lipstick on a pig. But at least the playing surface is better. Still an eyesore though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES If Harvey poops the bed, then it gets even more complicated. Where's Bartolo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN I have turned Tom Seaver down. Can't stand hearing him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets @Noahsyndergaard Let's hope the coincidence ends there.  That '78 team was 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Worst turf I've seen. MLB should be embarrassed for having a team play on that crud. Best part of the stadium is the Hitters HOF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay I've been to the Trop...it's hideous. If Oakland is worse, then I hope the A's move soon. Very soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if anyone has already stated this, but #TheWalkingDead JUMPED THE TIGER! I'm done! A horrible end to a terrible season. #TWDFinale<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Catching the last 10 minutes of #nationalchampionship game after watching @TMKSESPN on DVR. A champion has already been crowned @DonLagreca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay No way @DonLagreca would have covered #Wrestlemania as well as you. Right, @Rosenbergradio?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Crazy thing is @RealMichaelKay will lose sleep over this....even while laying down next to Jodi...SAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Your #DropMadness idea was absolutely brilliant &amp; a maj success @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Thank God #DropMadness is over. My productivity from 3-6PM for the last 2 weeks has been in the toilet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to @DonLagreca. And sorry, @RealMichaelKay, but your GMC flub is already a front runner for @TMKSESPN #DropMadness 2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay Lansky drop will be like Apple's 1984 commercial. Will only hear it on "Best Of" shows #DropMadness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Friend had #Wrestlemania on tv. Not a big fan of lucha libre but was very impressed when I saw you on the ramp. Tux was 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Just watched @TMKSESPN on DVR w/ @teixeiramark25. He was outstanding. Hated him as a Yankee, love him on the show. Good get!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I take it back. Good shot by Grabs...phenomenal save by Murray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca .350 Grabner scores that OT goal. .200 Grabner shoots it low enough to be stopped by Murray (it was a great save though)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio #DropMadness final is so big, it should be on ESPNDeportes covered by Dan LeBatard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio Are there Vegas odds for #DropMadness? 💰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio Gonna miss "fat little jerk", but WE KNOW who's the winner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay If John Sterling was on that call with @jodiapplekay, he'd say "Every kiss starts with a Michael Kay"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay There should be a Yankeeography episode of how you hit it out of the park with Jodi.....SAVAGE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Damn, @RealMichaelKay...that was gangsta! No wonder why Jodi fell for you.😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Can "like fat guys eating barbecue chicken" be an entry in #DropMadness 2018?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Voted for "Penalty Helmet"...it was stated as matter-of-fact as it was ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca only wears heels on Saturday nights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay "Nothing's for free!!" SAVAGE!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @agundling I just can't decide 😕 #DropMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay Ellsbury is so bad, he's helped @Mets fans forget about Jason Bay's contract<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay The Ellsbury contract may be the worst in MLB history...if it isn't already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay The brashness of @Yankees fans,as if wearing the jersey is enough to win a WS, is why I always root against them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN I knew when @Rosenbergradio said weeks ago, "We should do a #DropMadness" that it would be great. Totally lived up to the hype!💯👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca @agundling  #DropMadness Final 4 is 🔥🔥🔥 All are legit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like retiring the side in order, we've got 1-2-3 days to go for #OpeningDay #LetsGoMets #Mets #CapsOn  https://t.co/2Mcv3e0pPe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca As a HYUGE Mets fan it pains me to say this, but...Yanks are poised to be maj by 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay Gsellman deserves to be 5th starter. With Matz's injury, Gman should move to 4th and Wheeler 5th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Great podcast today. Been waiting for Grabs to get anywhere close to early season form. And NYR need Henrik to be The King again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @agundling "You mispronounced your own name on national television,how can that NOT be a 1 seed"💪🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardestyespn @AndrewFBrill Thx 4 taking my call. I say NBA should pit Knicks, Magic, Nets, &amp; Lakers in a CHUMPionship tournament #theysuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @TMKSonYES The Don and Kay regions will be as close as the '84 AL batting title race #dropmadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSonYES @RealMichaelKay @YESNetwork @Rosenbergradio  Who's Casey Stengel? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Oilers traded Gretzky...Mets traded Seaver...Nets traded Dr. J. Would Rangers trading The King be that far-fetched? Just asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca The 5 Ls were to playouff teams. He'll be 36 next year. If the Rangers lose in 1st rnd, is it preposterous for NYR to shop him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I love The King...I do. He means so much to the NYR. But he's 2-5 in his last 7 gms, giving up 3.71 gls per gm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Just threw up a little in my mouth 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Listening to that game show music, hope you have your bell bottoms on for this segment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio The "cash me outside" girl is getting a reality show. This country is a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Is there no way they would trade Henrik, get talent or picks, and go after Biship who's 5 years younger and comparable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet on #GameMisconduct. Even tho Henrik's under contract for the next 4 yrs, he's not the same goalie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow How's this for a yearbook pic? The glasses were over tinted prescription glasses...the hair doused in Stiff Stuff 😂 #4ellen  https://t.co/VaWH67xXy9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Would @NYRangers pursue Bishop or Bernier in offseason if Henrik struggles down the stretch and in playoffs?  #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Which players on the @NYRangers, @NYIslanders , &amp; @NJDevils do you see being available in the expansion draft? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio But Penalty Helmet, Meyer Lansky, &amp; Fat Little Jerk are STRONG!  #DropMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio The Don bracket has 4 legit #DropMadness winners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Gsellman a starter....make it happen...please! #LGM #LetsGoMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarioBosquezAlc Hi Mario.When I was trying to break into stand-up comedy, I did a show with you @ Gotham. That was pretty cool. Just sayin'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAURASTYLEZ LOL! Just saw your cover photo and it reminded me of last year's April Fool's Day prank at work.  https://t.co/tWFcotDfOR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio @DonLagreca When Rocky and Apollo hugged on the beach...it was a bit much...just a bit 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @RosenbergradioThat song is from "There's Something About Mary"-a Cameron Diaz or Ben Stiller vehicle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Even better vehicle for Lavar Ball...."Hidden Figures"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay Hey @Rosenbergradio...how was Peter Luger's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Lavar Ball should star in "Get Out"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I think  @RealMichaelKay watched more NCAA basketball this weekend than Phil Jackson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio ESPN is lowering their standards for ratings....SAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Does Jane Krakowski do crack? Hmmmm...probably!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio At least his name isn't Geoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @DonLagreca Hey @Rosenbergradio, I hope your suggestions are better than Kay's.I almost killed myself watching GF3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Sorry @RealMichaelKay ...John Mayer is a lot better looking. But you have Jodi...so you win!!  https://t.co/m3SLlnJ8tu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio When you Google John Mayer, an image of vaginas pops up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Freddie Prinze Jr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Is Mayer a bigger stud than Tommy Lee?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Cameron Diaz has a great last name...but she's so overrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Ladies &amp; gentlemen, your Las Vegas Wagers!!!! 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio You don't need to be good looking to get the ladies. Ask Marc Anthony  https://t.co/VDfQlpBapm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio I had Domino's last nite, placed plate on my stomach &amp; laughed.Wife thought I was nuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio I may create a separate Twitter acct so I can vote for both Kay drops #DropMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay I think Gsellman will be the Bartolo Colon of this season's rotation....under the radar 15 game winner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay Our President looks in the mirror every day and thinks he looks good...#SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJHradek_NHL You discussed this on #GameMisconduct with @DonLagreca today.Rangers D plays with greater focus w/o The King between the pipes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @DonLagreca What was the last rant? Last one I remember was the "CLOWN SHOES!" rant against Blah Raismann.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca With @NYRangers pretty much a lock for 1st wild card, how much rest should AV give his players over next 2 weeks?#gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets Gsellman definitely deserves it. #LetsGoMets #LGM #stillgottabelieve  https://t.co/Ya2GUx8IkD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeHughesDraws @JulySunflowers That face says it all, doesn't it? 😂 @ARaanta31 and the @NYRangers D were great tonight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Enjoy Luger's. Get the thick bacon. 🥓 It's maj!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio Crosby "nailed" him 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio I liked you before what you just said about the Kaepernick situation. Now I have more respect for you. That was ON POINT!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I wouldn't be surprised if the Maloney scream wins #dropmadness. It's outstanding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Henrik isn't the equalizer he once was. He doesn't compensate for the def's shortcomings like he used to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thx for reading my tweet on GM. I feel the Rangers defense is tighter with Raanta at net. They'll need that during the playoffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Ask Steve...what happened to the Russian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay It makes Dolan almost as guilty as Phil with the lack of action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay I understand that Dolan wants to be hands off but he needs to force the issue with Phil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca If The King struggles closing out the season, will Raanta be the starting goalie going into the playoffs? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets I know his name doesn't carry the weight that Harvey's does, but Gsellman should be your #4 pitcher. 💯 #letsgomets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio THAT ALREADY WON #DROPMADNESS 2018!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN Rangers penalty kill is similar to .250 Don<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN @Rosenbergradio Michael, your bracket is tough because your drops are LIT! (ask Peter what that means)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN They'll even lose the draft lottery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN If they reach the Nets' level, that would be worse. I look forward to seeing them get the 4th pick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @agundling  No vote button on the 1st one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca "The poll is up right now" needs to be considered for #DropMadness 2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca You heard it in the stands, you saw it on the field; they had FUN at the #WBC. No showing up, just fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca 20%?!?! Alternative Facts!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca If it's done all the time, it loses its effect....kinda like tattoos 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca In the Latin baseball culture, celebrating is expected &amp; even encouraged. This is where MLB is heading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca The demographics have changed. Baseball players are not predominantly white men anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca AMEN!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Can everyone please remember that baseball is A GAME!!! Like, to have FUN! The #WBC is an exhibition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca If it sounds racist, and it smells racist, then it's RACIST!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca 3 pts in the last 14 games he's played in is pretty pedestrian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet. Early in season, Grabner was lights out. I thought even with him cooling down, he'd be productive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PAT-RICK EW-ING (clap....clap....clap clap clap)  #Georgetown parts with John Thompson III after 13 seasons  https://t.co/m3YYKHfX05<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at the boxscore of the #WBC final like..... #worldbaseballclassic #wbc2017  https://t.co/4BasI1rxrS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Rangers are 9-10 since 2/13. Grabner has 1g &amp; 3pts since 2/13. Can they get back on track with him struggling? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Rangers PK pre-ASG was 83%, post-ASG is 72%. Why such a disparity? Is Girardi being out that big of a factor? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSonYES Savage!!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe @cocobalentien from Netherlands should have been #WBC MVP. He put up softball numbers in this competition. #worldbaseballclassic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Great game call today. Always love your energy. Unlike the Rangers...they played like .250 Don<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay, @DonLagreca &amp; @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Here we go again! My gudness!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @TMKSESPN Nice job with Julius, guys.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca I don't like the current format either but it is what it is.Thanks for another great Game Misconduct. LGR! Gotta beat the Isles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ @DonLagreca Thx for reading my tweet earlier. I meant to type Habs, not Caps. "Oh jeez....oh no"....I love Game Misconduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Unless an ASG is played in addition to the WBC games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay I like the idea of #WBC being played during All-Star break. But it bypasses an All-Star whose country's team doesn't qualify<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Even if you don't read this on the podcast, I'd appreciate your opinion on this. Thx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca 1st wild-card @NYRangers have mor pts than 1st place Caps in Atl div. Will NHL change playoff seeding next year?#gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mets That's great...but save some for the regular season :-) #OpeningDay #NewYorkMets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdiDiaz44 Felicidades, "hermano". Y buena suerte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Their inconsistency is MADDENING! No way they should lose to NJ. Is Grabner still on this team? #APB #milkcarton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio The players were once fans..they seem to forget how they would've felt back in the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca If NBA no longer schedules 2nd game of b-to-b on a Sat or Sun, this problem goes away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brwcrwdcd41 @RealMichaelKay Injuries are unpredictable. It could've happened in the 1st inning of a spring training game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Too many windowlickers not only have a voice but an avenue 2 b heard thru social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN Thanks to social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @TMKSESPN It's life imitating art #HouseOfCards<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio The FAN is where 2 1/2 year olds listen to sports radio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay Did you mean President Clown Shoes?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet on #gamemisconduct.  Totally agree with your top 6. LGR!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca NHL hasn't had a 70+ G scorer since 92-93. Are any of the young stars good enough to top 70 Gs in a season? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Assuming all @NYRangers defensemen are healthy, who should be top 6 going into the playoffs? #gamemisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio - Individually &amp; collectively, @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca &amp; @agundling are great but @TMKSESPN isn't the same w/o you   💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VinZarate Liking your own tweet is like kissing yourself in the mirror (A-Rod) 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca If Woody the Cowboy and Jake Gylenhall (he's a nice man) had a baby, he'd look like @agundling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca I wonder...do more football players suffer from those diseases more than other team sports' players?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio  Thx. Before Drop Madness, I thought that was a Jim Carrey sound bite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Unless you pull a JPP...different story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Injuries happen...in training, exhibition games, World Series games, at home...where you are when you're hurt is irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay-so if the Yankees team is standing around Didi &amp; he's seen by a Yankee doctor, that makes a difference in his injury? Nope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Is that really Melo laughing in that drop? If so, when did that happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Next WBC will be on ESPN or some other major network in 2021 esp if USA wins. It's been very exciting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio I still have the 1/23 ep saved on my DVR.The Maloney scream during ENN was comedy gold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca The Don region is bananas.All 4 drops deserve to move on."Entertain me" &amp; "Tear Your Hair" has my vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca My Gudness is a drop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca The most compelling NBA storylines now are individual stats, not team related.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Thanks for reading my tweet on Game Misconduct 🏒 LGR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosenbergradio Your boy Francesa's bracket is officially garbage. All Final 4 teams he picked are out! Let him sleep on that. #ClownShoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN Trying to get all my work done by 3:00. Then it's time to "entertain me clowns" #DropMadness #YoureNotClowns #ImAFatLittleJerk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay Didi could've been hurt in Tampa. What's the difference? Either scenario, he's playing ball &amp; preparing for the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca #GameMisconduct for my last question (sorry, I'm a Twitter newb)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Grabner has 1 g &amp; 4 pts in last 13 gms. He had a similar drought in Dec. Is this why he's on 3 teams in 3 yrs? Too inconsistent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonLagreca Is the inconsistency with the @NYRangers due to not establishing if they're more of a physical or finesse team? #GameMisconduct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay @agundling #Why #IDontKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HLundqvist30  In Aug 2014, my son went to your goalie camp at @ChelseaPiersNYC. You signed his helmet. It's his most prized possession. Thx  https://t.co/vGTPK81Jyv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli I signed up for your workshop and found out I was a shitty comedian but have always been grateful for your support back then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli your reply..."Sam, 1st of all, YOU ARE GAY! Secondly, I ❤️ you &amp; think you have the potential to be a very funny comedian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli I took a 4 week course at The New School with you and was disappointed you didn't ask me to do a routine at the workshop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaLampanelli So I'm going through old emails and find one you sent to me in Sep 2000 after I sampled one of your workshops at @StandUpNY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay (Chevy Chase as Forest)...."I'm Forest Gump and you're not"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay NONE of those guys would have been good as Forest Gump. NONE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca (reason why Gigi is winning)...SEX!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMichaelKay I believe the Russians are voting for Gigi....TERRIBLE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay Hoping "My Gudness" doesn't intentionally foul seconds before the polls close<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio @agundling this grilling of Andrew reminds me of the DeVos hearing<|endoftext|>
