<|startoftext|>In the same week that the government voted down the People Before Profit motion to pay student nurses and midwives, Cabinet signed off on a whopping hike in pension for some of the highest paid  public servants in the country.

<|startoftext|>And it will require putting public health before the profits of private business.  #PartitionIsBadForPublicHealth  Read more about Zero Covid strategy here:  https://t.co/Y9CH4Wn7Wp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But doing so will require a genuine all Ireland effort, not merely the lip service we have seen so far. It will require Stormont &amp; the D√°il stop using the border as their buffer. It will require Stormont &amp; D√°il breaking from the Tories in London. #PartitionIsBadForPublicHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This total lack of ambition will cost us many lives. As an island, Ireland is uniquely placed to lead in Europe in implementing a #ZeroCovid strategy, as has been done successfully in Australia, China, New Zealand, Taiwan, Thailand &amp; Vietnam. #PartitionIsBadForPublicHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Westminster, Stormont, &amp; D√°il don't want to implement restrictions cos they want profits moving again for big business - but they won't say this out straight. Instead, they would have us believe it is unwise to implement restrictions as Covid will spread across the island anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But while they organise privately together, publicly they use partition as an excuse to deny proper safety measures.

<|startoftext|>This is not the fault of ordinary people, but the fault of a govt that failed to build up ICU &amp; testing capacity when the opportunity was there, failed to crush covid, allowed the seeding of second wave in meat plants and never took action to bring the virus back under control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Clearly govt strategy has moved from ‚Äò‚Äôflattening the curve‚Äô‚Äô to ‚Äò‚Äôliving with Covid‚Äô‚Äô, but it is unacceptable to put workers in danger to keep profits flowing.  Covid-19 must be classified as an occupational illness, and workplaces should be inspected for compliance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outside of the meat industry, healthcare workers account for 28% of all Covid-19 cases in Ireland to date, with some 8,976 workers diagnosed with the disease. 329 have been hospitalised due to Covid-19 and eight have died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But this is exactly what SHOULD happen. We have already seen that key workplaces are the main source of Covid clusters. The meat plants are an obvious example, where lack of health and safety enforcement or sick pay for workers, have allowed the virus to spread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aramark are laying off workers in AIB HQ, without fair redundancy, and refusing to recognize the union.  Workers had contracts that included fair redundancy, but now @Aramark have scrapped them.

<|startoftext|>The vacuum of political leadership from our government has allowed far-right figures try to build their own movements off the back of public anger.

<|startoftext|>Yesterday pushed the Debenhams workers struggle forward significantly when the workers occupied buildings in Dublin and Cork.   Workers in Dublin were arrested by the gardai.

<|startoftext|>The campaign to save St Mary‚Äôs nursing home is escalating, as they take their case to the High Court.

With Covid on the rise, closing vital nursing homes is insanity.  https://t.co/kG6f6r8lZy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharp contrasts here with #Golfgate. It takes a tidal wave of public outrage before the elites face even the slightest repercussions.

<|startoftext|>This Saturday, certain figures on the far right will be trying to mobilise a crowd in the city centre to promote an anti-mask, anti-vaccine, conspiracy based agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must direct our anger against this government properly -not in a way that puts other workers at risk. We should be fighting for rigorous testing, for more resources for our schools, for housing, and for a National Health Service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Refusing to wear a mask is not an act of defiance against the government. It is an act of harm to the healthcare workers who have already risked their own safety to keep us all safe.  Anti-mask is anti-worker.   https://t.co/mhqW4mes0e<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Labour issues went to the Workplace Relations Commission for conciliation but the workforce were on top of it. They were ready to strike. Then managers started breaching other important long-standing sick pay arrangements too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When lockdown happened- contrary agreed procedures in the workers‚Äô collective agreement- workers were elbowed out without proper notice to shut things down. Managers gave no consultation, ignored the collective agreements, and brought non-union agency staff in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We call on the Irish government and @rodericogorman to take immediate action and commit to ending Direct Provision.  There are 183k+ vacant homes in Ireland. These should be opened up for everyone who is in Direct Provision (and everyone who needs a home full stop.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead, they are marginalised and sent to horrible Direct Provision centres, where their basic humanity is infringed and they are re-traumatised.  The death of Arif is a loss not only to those who knew and cared for him, but to Irish society as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make no mistake about it, the Irish state is complicit.  When someone comes to this country seeking asylum, they have come from a situation of great trauma, and often, a very difficult and painful journey.  What they need is support to process the trauma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arif from Afghanistan is the second asylum seeker to have died in Direct Provision in less than 5 months. He was placed in a dark, small and cold room during isolation at Tracey's Hotel, Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan a few weeks ago. He died by suicide yesterday.  https://t.co/BEjJdN3jOt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Endless stories of teachers &amp; SNAs with underlying illnesses, whose own doctors and in some cases, consultants have deemed them unfit to work in a school environment, are finding their healthcare experts over-ruled by Medmark to just ‚ÄòHigh Risk‚Äô and told to present for work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where HIGH RISK was enough to have people cocooning during lockdown, it now can push them back into the classrooms, as a new category of VERY HIGH RISK is required to stay away from the workplace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Medmark is a private healthcare company, contracted by the Dept of Ed/Skills since 2008, to certify Teachers/SNAs as fit or unfit for work. With the reopening of schools this week, Medmark have made news by redefining teacher and SNAs illness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We must demand the state urgently looks at providing decent childcare, so that grandparents are not put at unnecessary risk and the extreme pressure on parents is alleviated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other side of the coin, the lack of resources available to schools means that there is a high likelihood of Covid clusters, which leaves both children and grandparents at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The complete lack of universally available childcare means that many grandparents will continue to collect children from school, even at risk to their own health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How this is compatible with the stark reality that grandparents(particularly grandmothers) make up a significant proportion of childcare in Ireland - remains to be seen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unless this government adopts zero covid strategy &amp; goes after the virus in places like meat factories &amp; direct provision, these rolling lockdowns will continue indefinitely. A long, deadly dance, simply because FF-FG-G won't take on the beef barons or move asylum seekers out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The entire county remains in lockdown because of this govts failure to ensure safety at the plants. Since then, the only change is that workers will be subject to uncomfortable weekly tests. The conditions that allow the virus to spread remain unchanged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meat workers at Kildare Chilling factory left up to two weeks waiting for test results. No sick pay because govt has not introduced legislation to this effect. Workers on ‚Ç¨350 from the state, which is effectively subsidising the plant due to its inability to keep workers safe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fianna F√°il Minister breaks govt's own restrictions 1 day in - in the same week they propose to have Garda√≠ raid homes without a warrant to crack down on house parties.

<|startoftext|>@NormaFoleyTD1 must answer a number of key questions:  1.      How many students/teachers can be safely in a classroom?  2.      Should students take public transport to school?  3.      Will schools be reopening in counties that are currently in lockdown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With growing evidence that children can transmit the virus the reopening of school has implications for all groups and generations in society.  The government plans are too little, too late. Insufficient resources have been allocated to ensure a safe reopening of schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Minister for Education must come out of hiding to answer some very serious concerns about the re-opening of schools.

<|startoftext|>Over the last few months, money has been sucked out of their accounts, allowing them to project poverty and claim that ‚Äòthere is no alternative‚Äô to ‚Äòstatutory redundancy‚Äô.  This week, the staff of St Monica's held a protest outside the building, demanding fair treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The staff of St Mary's Retirement home, Caritas Convalescent Home, and St Monica's nursing home are facing surprise redundancies.   They are been told there is no money for redundancy packages. But the Sisters of Charity have plenty of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Care centres run by the Sisters of Charity are being closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs.   Managers are presenting the closure as the result of a complication from a HIQA requirement.   But the sale of the land on which the Sisters of Charity operate is the real reason.  https://t.co/6nDkeQA9RS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must organise against this govt, landlords who evict tenants and bosses who put workers at risk.

<|startoftext|>After all, it comes just over a week since the news of big outbreaks in meat plants, and not long before that, the clusters reported in Direct Provision centres.

<|startoftext|>People Before Profit have been raising the issue of safety at meat plants for months, but workers and the wider community are still being put in danger by government inaction.  The govt decided to put the profits of the beef barons before public health - we've got to push back.  https://t.co/IntzQ72u4E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The meat barons are a powerful lobby and are key players in Irish capitalism. So instead of imposing regulations on business, Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael issue voluntary protocols and turn a blind eye to the terrible conditions of workers.  https://t.co/YxlBEmx1ZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>90% of meat plant workers still don't get sick pay. They are still forced to work in overcrowded conditions. Kildare, Laois &amp; Offaly lockdown necessary now but was entirely avoidable if these workers had been adequately protected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Increased restrictions: Kildare, Laois and Offaly due to clusters in meat plants, where workers are still working in unsafe conditions. Workers still being put at risk. This in turn is risking further spread in the community. Unsafe workplaces must be inspected and sanctioned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Residents of the Skellig Star centre in Cahirciveen  - which saw a big outbreak back in April - had to go on hunger strike before the government finally agreed to move them out. Direct provision was always inhumane and cruel - now it is extremely dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs no coincidence that the outbreaks are in meat factories and also in Direct Provision. Meat plant workers are usually low-paid migrant workers, forced to work in cramped environments, and return home to overcrowded living environments where social distancing is impossible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The stigma around menstruation also perpetuates period poverty, which is a serious issue affecting thousands of people in Ireland.  A 2018 study revealed that half of girls between 12 and 19 have struggled to pay for period products in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Furthermore, 43 per cent didn‚Äôt know what to do when they started their period, 61 per cent had missed school as a direct result of their period, and more than half surveyed felt their school provided inadequate eduction around it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stigma and shaming attached to women‚Äôs bodies and periods in particular has very real consequences, as recent research by Plan International Ireland revealed that a staggering 55 per cent of girls in Ireland felt embarrassed discussing their period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland continues its long run of body-shaming women with the pulling of the #tampax after complaints from 84 viewers who presumably, would rather women get on with the business of reproducing the human race, without talking about any of the biological functions involved.  https://t.co/3z3QvFNjFx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The suggestion that the company is on the brink of collapse is disingenuous because there are massive cash reserves in both Aer Lingus and Its parent company I.A.G.  It would appear the company is willing to impoverish it staff to bolster its profits. #aerlingus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is occurring in #aerlingus is the full consequence of privatisation. The company is using Covid-19 to reduce staff payments.

<|startoftext|>The latest murder of Rayshard Brooks makes it starkly clear that police racism is a structural issue in the USA.

<|startoftext|>This Councillor had nothing to say about moving asylum seekers out of Direct Provision or migrant workers who have been unable to socially distance at meat plants, but instead targeted peaceful protesters who have largely implemented socially distant protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday, South Dublin Councillor David McManus said that those who attended #BLMIReland protests should be docked their ‚Ç¨350 Covid payment.   Read more about the origins of Fine Gael here:  https://t.co/XlEVmpyP6f‚Ä¶/25/the-shady-origins-of-fine-gael/ #FineGael<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/kYUQFzUWQG  The criminalization of #BlackLivesMatter protests in Belfast, Derry and Dublin is in stark contrast to the indifference of the state at flagrant breaches of Covid restrictions by Keelings, the meat plants, and building sites. #BLMIreland #PSNI #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The PSNI are criminalizing black lives matter protests in Belfast and Derry. It does not go unnoticed that there have been no charges against beef plants who have flouted Covid 19 restrictions, putting workers lives in danger. No, the fines and cautions are reserved for protests<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RBoydBarrett telling @LeoVaradkar that it is not enough to decry racism as ‚Äúa virus‚Äù whilst refusing to condemn Trump. Will the govt dismiss the US ambassador as they did the Russian ambassador?   Will they end the racist #directprovisiom system here in Ireland? #BLMIreland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To equate our anger with the wholly different anger of the far right is breathtakingly disingenuous and trivializes the dark history of far right segregation, oppression, and genocide. It's an insult to victims of racism.   #leovaradkar #notmytaoiseach #finegael #racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are angry that you refuse to publicly condemn Trump, and that your government continue to let US military airplanes refuel in Shannon airport.  We're angry that your govt blocked our fossil fuel bill, hurtling us closer to climate catastrophe, which will displace millions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar People are angry that you say ''racism is a virus'' whilst your government presides over the incredibly racist Direct Provision system. We are angry at the hypocrisy of Fine Gael MEP's voting against increased search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Varadkar: ''It's anger, it's rage''   Yes @LeoVaradkar we're angry. People are angry that in one of the wealthiest countries, children are growing up in B&amp;B's. They're angry at the deaths in nursing homes, some which could certainly have been prevented with adequate PPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The far left and the far right. One wants housing and healthcare for all, the other wants to oppress and harm minority groups.  To @LeoVaradkar these are apparently both the same thing ü§î  #leovaradkar #finegael #notmytaoiseach #taoiseach #racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Far Right and the Far Left aren't very different to me", says Varadkar.  What a strange statement. You would think someone from a party like his would know the difference.  Remember what Fine Gael's roots are?  https://t.co/lMQFb3j2Qx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëèüëè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only time Varadkar has said anything about the murder of George Floyd was to use it to defend Direct Provision. When it comes to condemning Trump and the racist US police state, calling in the Ambassador, stopping troops using Shannon, he's been silent. #notmytaoiseach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo Varadkar described Direct Provision as a "service", where asylum seekers are given a place to stay, food, and a bit of money. Were the Magdalene Laundries also a service provided by the Church? What a way to describe a gross abuse of human rights #leovaradkar #notmytaoiseach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Varadkar said Direct Provision is not the same as someone being killed by the police. Should asylum seekers in Ireland somehow be grateful for this?  You Jung Han died by suicide aged 36 in a Direct Provision centre in 2016. She left behind her 6-year-old son.  #leovaradkar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the same bail out that was given to the banks was given to people who need it, we could continue this payment for six years! Why are people‚Äôs lives less important than banks?  #varadkar #dail #finegael #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government claims that the country will not be able to afford the payment. But we were able to bail out the banks for ‚Ç¨64 billion. In comparison, three months of pandemic payments has cost ‚Ç¨5 billion.  https://t.co/IBLjrddsXe #varadkar #finegael #covid19 #dail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our rulers want to frighten us off the streets.  But they will not easily squash the uprising that is underway in the US.

<|startoftext|>It was a symbolic move designed to show that a new era of repression is coming. Trump is sending in the military to crush the protest movement. By coincidence, on the other side of the world the Chinese regime is also cracking down on protest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night Donald Trump came out of his bunker in the White House to walk across the street to St John‚Äôs Church where he was pictured holding up a bible. Police cleared the way for him by attacking demonstrators. #GeorgeFloyd #Trump #USAProtest  https://t.co/BKLrQ6o74F<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fine Gael probably regret giving the ‚Ç¨350 Covid-19 payment. It has exposed the extent to which people were struggling on low wages and in precarious work before this crisis. We cannot return to that. Sign the petition to keep the Covid payment!  https://t.co/FmBOrTVgdL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today, take a moment to reflect on the seismic history-making period you were part of, and perhaps a moment of reflection too, for the lessons and the strengths we can take from Repeal, into the fights ahead.  #repealedThe8th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Direct Provision system, the housing crisis, extortionately expensive childcare- all of these structural inequalities also impact hugely on the question of choice.  But our amazing victory in 2018 showed us what is possible with people power.  #repealedThe8th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For migrant women, trans and non-binary people, or people with disabilities, who do not have the same freedom of movement as their Irish counterparts, our abortion legislation contains huge barriers to accessing the healthcare that is their right.  #repealedThe8th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are still battles to be won.  The 12 week limit, combined with waiting periods and conscientious objection pushes many women dangerously close to the cut-off period, meaning many still have to travel to access care.  #repealedThe8th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The landslide YES vote for #repeal came off the back of a years long campaign, led by women all around the country, who fought, who told their stories, who rose up to challenge the establishment, with a bravery that must never be forgotten. #repealedThe8th  https://t.co/IOxxrpr4QL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That Dorel died whilst working on the frontlines for just 10.80 per hour should be a cause of great shame and a damning indictment of a callous government who for all their talk of ‚Äò‚Äôheroes‚Äô‚Äô, have failed to back that up by ensuring safe working conditions and a living wage.<|endoftext|>

It's true about the need to prevent mass unemployment which we could be facing in the aftermath of the crisis.  None of that is necessary if the state intervenes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The inescapable lesson in all of this is that with a major emergency, you cannot let austerity and the market dictate the response.

<|startoftext|>At start of April, unelected Minister for Transport Shane Ross said he was considering allowing airlines and tour operators to issue vouchers instead of refunds when flights were cancelled.  Yet again, this government acting in the interest of the wealthy instead of the majority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under EU rules, airlines are required to refund the cost of a ticket in full to passengers within 7 days of the scheduled flight date. This means Ryanair is acting illegally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week Ryanair wrote to customers inviting them to apply for a voucher.   Voucher may suit some, but with approximately 1M ppl out of work, and unsure when/if their jobs will resume, many will need the money back in their accounts, as per original commitment made by Ryanair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryanair - a company that made ‚Ç¨1 billion in profit last year according to the Irish Times - is refusing to refund customers for flights cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis.  @Ryanair had told customers that they were processing repayment, inviting passengers to apply for refund<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>State also implicated- as a 14% stake in Bank of Ireland, who are part of the consortium of banks that put Debenhams UK into administration and Debenhams Ireland into liquidation. State must accept insist that Bank of Ireland reverses its position and protects the jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Contemptuous treatment of workers by corporations is not new, but it highlights the ludicrous nature of the capitalist system, that leaves workers in complete insecurity, even after decades of service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Workers across the 11 Debenhams in the ROI received half an hour‚Äôs notice that their jobs were gone.

<|startoftext|>These are political decisions taken in previous FF/ FG regimes, that included giving developers massive tax breaks in order to get them to invest in private care homes.

<|startoftext|>@bridsmithTD said the situation with patients in nursing homes, where over half Covid-19 deaths have occurred, should be declared a national emergency.   https://t.co/i7rnCZ50Sv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without proper testing, we don‚Äôt know the true figure for how many people have the disease. Ireland could even be near US figures per head of population.

<|startoftext|>Despite having a huge pharmaceutical and medical equipment industry in this country, we are scrambling around for PPE, we‚Äôre lacking sufficient ventilators and have failed to implement the testing regime we needed.

<|startoftext|>Prior to the crisis, Ireland had 5.2 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population whereas the EU average was 11.9. Even Italy whose health services are now overrun had over 12 and countries like Germany had 34, a figure that rose to 50 as they prepared for the crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A return of FG/FF to power will not only fail to give effect to the demands for change in the GE, but would also mean returning parties, whose misguided policies degraded the public health system and other key services which we need so badly in the crisis we now face.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#CarbonTax shifts blame + costs from big polluters onto working people and the poor.

<|startoftext|>Why #CarbonTax Won't Stop #ClimateChange.  Carbon taxes don't challenge the real causes of emissions. In Norway, carbon tax is very high but reduction in emissions are circa 1.5% onshore and 2.3% overall which is not effective and nowhere near what we need to achieve.<|endoftext|>
