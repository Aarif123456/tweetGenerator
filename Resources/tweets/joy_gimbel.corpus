<|startoftext|>@Frankensteins31 @annettesnders @kateredleaf As an American I do agree with you, “freedom” is abused here in so many ways. It isn’t the freedom to put others at risk. It’s also arbitrary, smoke away but we are banning vaping? When will the US grow tf up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frankensteins31 @annettesnders @kateredleaf I think it’s a misuse of concept if freedom here in US. You’re NOT allowed to make others sick by refusing to wear a mask, social distance. As in it impairs others freedom to live in society normally.  #COVIDiotInChief #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kate_freedomer @kateredleaf No, many r horrified of the abysmal failure of @realDonaldTrump to handle a worldwide pandemic here, so we are now the epicenter while countries begin to open.

<|startoftext|>@chadpradelli The irony, pious bitch jabbing her finger, how dare u give safe help?! If her child were an addict well ok. To church in hood against it “there but before the grace of god go I.  No wonder Portugal is SO far ahead, as US addicts od daily #Philadelphiashame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Americanresists @NYGovCuomo It’s not even E-cigs that caused any deaths. It’s THC laced w Vitamin E but doing research as a politician is pesky apparently #ivapeivote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Look at the black market from China , fentanyl that’s killing opioid addicts in high numbers? You’re creating a black market for adult vapers that will kill &amp; will be on your hands #vapingsavedmylife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo You’ve clearly not even read any research! It’s not even E-cigs that killed anyone, cigarettes kill over 400,000 a YEAR in US alone. Vaping helped me quit forever, &amp; I only like flavored?! Guns aren’t “urgent”? Big tobacco lining your pockets #vapingsaveslives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbredesen @NYGovCuomo That’s my fear, it will most certainly return teens to cigarettes, which kills 400,000 in US alone each YEAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evoshua @NYGovCuomo It was, which clearly he didn’t bother to even research!?! But cigarettes are fine? #vapers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabe50286054 @NYGovCuomo Well it’s cabbibus vapes that contain the dangerous vitamin E that’s caused the 6 deaths, but clearly he’s read NO research. I doubt all do but u should find out which tbs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@przjohnathon @ChickenGate @NYGovCuomo Not nearly as much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adrienne_fein @NYGovCuomo I hope you don’t vote for him again, this is not the way to curb teen vaping #VapeBan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guyatavapeshop @xLAWx_ @mcowan226 @lubin_alison @NYGovCuomo No they don’t. They helped me and many adults quit smoking for good. It’s pot vaping that has caused health problems from vitamin E oil<|endoftext|>
