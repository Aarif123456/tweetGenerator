<|startoftext|>Glad to see that I wasn't the only one who took such delight in watching #Gizelle get lit tf up last night. It was one of the few good things to happen in 2020 😂  https://t.co/ds1wW0Uerv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smokeclouds45 Almost? Those old broads are definitely logging in to IG and rubbing one or two out while looking at their shirtless pics. Especially Annette. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew Chile! I’m still bummed that @iammrssamuels went full-tilt Sharkeisha on @candeegal, but DAMN!!! I love that throat punch she laid on Gizelle.

<|startoftext|>@blogitch @rhiles2760 @SteveSchmidtSES Sarah Palin just became the face of a movement that was already under the surface.

<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB That’s exactly why he supported that asshole, but he’s of no use to Trump so he’ll let his black ass go right to prison. I look forward to his perp walk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveSchmidtSES I really like you Steve, but you spent a lot of years watching this Frankenstein monster being built and now you’re appalled when the monster goes on a rampage.

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump They look cold af! 🥶😷💀⚰️👋🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump left people who trust him out in the cold? Sounds totally on brand to me. 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalelle Well I'd say all of the grassroots Biden has been able raise (and Trump hasn't) is a pretty good indicator of how enthusiastic his supporters are. MAGAs is just bored and looking for a party to go to. Put your money where your mouth is, I say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Can hear them on the Westside too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @IvankaTrump Any truth to the claim by Aubrey O'Day that Ivanka likes lickin kitty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamchanteezy Cube is a poseur. He wants to play politics because he thinks it's a game. He's too stupid to understand how policy is developed and too much of an asshole to admit he got a lot wrong and could use some help. He's turned out to be a huge disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather He went from smug as he waited for the slam against Joe he thought was coming to complete humiliation when he realized Netanyahu wasn't taking the bait. 😂😂 What an embarrassing 🤡 #BidenHarris2020Landslide<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm getting dragged into this #PresidentialDebate2020 that I vowed not to watch. #Trump is flailing and I like it. Drinking game idea: Take a drink every time the orange asshat says he's been treated "unfairly." Such a whiny baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoteMarsha I bet you'd really like to know, but I don't think he'll fvck you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Shut up Jason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Yeah. He sounds shaky. Guess he's not comfortable having to not just yap like a hit dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli  https://t.co/eyHqtVFPAk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC I'm giving it one muting to see if Trump acts an ass, then I'm going to Netflix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMES123 He's not gonna get the chance to get me again. I'm committed to not watching. I'm sure there will be plenty of video of anything interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux she earned every bit of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeniAnn48 @vote4robgill He looked great to me. He would have looked better if he had punched her in her ugly face! Spitting is always an ass-whoopin' worthy offense, but during a pandemic?? I would landed on her two seconds after she landed on the pavement and beat her senseless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vote4robgill She ended up exactly where she deserved to be. I would have sent her to the pavement via a kick in the ass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins The should and will. Fuck that guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikedawson010 @TonesOfMusic I've seen them many times over the last 20+ years. Never been disappointed once.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @JasonMillerinDC I just can't imagine voluntarily sleeping  with that hideous creep. If I saw that bloated neck and vagina mouth coming at me, I would vomit. Yuck! 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse Maybe he threw hands with Amy McGrath and she punched him in his lipless mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Great.  https://t.co/DOsi8SiO4k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have always felt that people with Down's are angels on earth. Totally pure of heart and able to sense genuine goodness in others. This just confirms it for me. #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that I'm complaining, but how on earth are people still being played by the Borat character? All I know of him is what I read when stuff like this happens, but I would recognize him as soon as he entered a room. These dudes are so stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesHuntingto7 Thanks James. We just have to stay sane for a couple of weeks and hopefully we will have something better to look forward to.  Be well! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesHuntingto7 My take... Women: Devout Catholicism and very anti-abortion. Men: Admire the "machismo" and "wealth" This is the older Latino crowd. Younger Latinos seem to not believe the Trump hype and are supporting Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC It's like watching a blowfish out of water flopping around only that's sad. Trump's spasms are just ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BMLewis2 @RachelBitecofer @MSNBC Rachel said last night that MSNBC is not responsible for this even though they will be broadcasting that nonsense. It's very clear that their hosts are not at all happy about this move. I'm going to take a break too, but I don't plan to take out my anger on them forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelBitecofer I will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care that she's 87, but if she thinks Lame-ass Lindsey is a great leader, I don't ever need to vote for her again cuz clearly she has bad judgment. I would love to see a good (Dem) alternative to @SenFeinstein that CA can get behind. Is @meenaharris interested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @cspan Are you trying to get them to cancel you? Scared that the #JoeBidenTownHallABC will perform better? They should have never booked you, but now you two can have each other. #BoycottNBC #BoycottTrumpTownHall  https://t.co/wrbES5it35<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC Where's your child support payment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMES123 I reported a bunch on here yesterday. Haven't gotten any reports back yet. The MAGAts were using screenshots instead of linking to the article as a way to get around Twitter not letting the link post. I still reported that shit. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist You're the cutest! Fuck that lonely incel bot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have switched my morning @MSNBC routine to @CNN and I won't be watching ANYTHING @NBCNews related for a while. I'm gonna miss Joy, Nicolle, Rachel and Lawrence but I don't care. What they're letting Trump get away with is gross! #NBCBlackout #BidenTownHallABC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Um. Native Californian here.  No plans to move. Haven't experienced a single brownout and I wouldn't vote for you even if you pointed a gun at me on 5th Ave.  You're not winning CA, Tiny. Not a chance in hell! 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HufManHufAmazin @pablo_honey1 @realDonaldTrump Yes. I'm sure that's what the tabloid story says. 🙄 Ok. Enough of this. I have a life and you are boring. You're dismissed! Run along now. #muted  https://t.co/3kUJ0rf1Yi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HufManHufAmazin @pablo_honey1 @realDonaldTrump Verified by whom? The "computer guy" who just happened to make a copy of a "customer's" hard drive and give it to Rudy G? Puhleez! 😂  I hope Hunter Biden is just waiting until the election is over to start suing these idiots. The Biden camp shouldn't dignify that trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know which townhall I'll be watching. #BoycottNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HufManHufAmazin @pablo_honey1 @realDonaldTrump I don't read tabloids. Especially when they run manufactured stories.   So VPs are required to release their "personal business" but a president isn't?   Hunter isn't on the ballot and normal people don't believe this stuff anyway. Roger Stone's dirty tricks aren't working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HufManHufAmazin @pablo_honey1 @realDonaldTrump But someone who is not the president is supposed to release his personal emails which is HIS personal business? Y'all so stupid and two-faced 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah. Just as soon as you release your taxes and give up that DNA sample for the woman you raped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOsrin I've gotten a couple of surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awgaffney Enjoy the rust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcpr And Ice-T is definitely not a Mad Red Hatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Djinnaat @WajahatAli There's a definite "who do you think you're talking to? " tone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli I'm sure the fact that Sen Harris will likely be the first woman VP despite not growing up rich and white, attended an HBCU and a public university for law school offends her greatly. She's a snob who probably adopted Black kids so she could save them from their blackness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@butlerecssg @mmodi93 I always notice the contempt in her voice. Like she's offended that Sen Harris is held in such high esteem and she needs to knock her off of her high horse.  She comes off as an uptight Junior League snob with a stick up her ass and chip on her shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMES123 Ok. I knew I liked you. You are one of the few people who publicly admit to liking candy corn. I love it! But it has to be the Branch's brand made with honey. Don't forget to put your Oreos in the fridge 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Baboon @SeldenGADawgs @SenateGOP @DineshDSouza @jack You still don't know anything. The emails and pics are fake. It's time for Hunter Biden to start suing these idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk  https://t.co/qpZ1Bokz2D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@of_utu @icecube I don't think anyone had that one on their bingo card. So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraDiBella15 They'll just stand in line without one. I think most of them probably live around each other so it may not be a huge problem unless they try to go inside the polling place without one on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiecouric That's where the DVR comes in handy for anyone who wants to watch that trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson I just don't get people who don't know how to spell "loser" especially since they all spell it wrong the same way. It's like the mind-numbing number of people that misspell "definitely" with an "a" in place of the second "i"  How does that happen? 😬🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 If he weren't up 14 points, do you think that Rudy would have planted this fake story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal @grey_geena @mmodi93 We BW call them "Weaponized White Woman Tears." I've seen them deployed many times. It's the "mean old angry black woman scared me with her loud voice and cutting eyes" routine, which is funny to me coming from the people with the legacy of brutality against us.  https://t.co/lR8rs94inp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmodi93 She has most definitely displayed a snooty, superior tone when speaking to Senator Harris. I was wondering if I was just hearing things, but it seems not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@icecube You aren't negotiating sweetheart. You are being placated for a couple of weeks because it's to the other party's advantage.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelPRush1 @DanScavino So desperate and funny that Rudy thought this would work. Reported 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvgRightGuy @DonaldJTrumpJr They also don't have a story on their homepage that Trump raped a 13-year old girl and that story is actually true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheFreeRadical1 @AlanaKStewart @Twitter You freedom lovers sure don't like when other people exercise their freedom. Twitter nor Facebook are obligated (legally or otherwise) to let you on their platform or dictate what content they include on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icecube Facts: You're being played for positive press for Trump and clout with the Black community riiiiiight before the election. How can you not see that? I thought you were smarter than that. #Sucka  https://t.co/4sh0nEdggt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Disappointed to find out that Ice Cube is another sellout, but as we know, money changes everything. #FuckIceCube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WonderKing82 Katrina is a half-black sellout. She just plays a white woman on tv.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast I'm not watching that trash, but even if he does get more eyeballs on his nonsense, it won't occur to him that maybe people are watching to see him completely implode. I can't believe @NBCNews allowed itself to be played like this. #ShameOnNBC #BoycottMSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @CNN and now I see why people dunk on @CillizzaCNN so hard. Is he completely unaware that Trump was the first one to refuse to speak to @SpeakerPelosi after she read him for filth and told him "all roads lead to Putin"? Shouldn't a "journalist" know that?

<|startoftext|>@Nor_toriousLKL @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff That's fine, but I wasn't attacking you. I just don't get how you misinterpreted what I wrote. 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nor_toriousLKL @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff I specifically wrote emotional/psychological issues as well as  self-esteem issues. All of those things originate in the mind. How on earth did miss everything except that one word?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nor_toriousLKL @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff Isn't that what I've been saying? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redterrier3 @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff I've wondered about that. It really does seem more weirdly obsessive. I have ZERO tolerance for pedos, but I don't think EVERY rich person is one just because they're rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenS41 @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff Nah. I'm book smart and have plenty of common sense. Both were encouraged in my household.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geniewebster @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff Not sure. I'm speaking generally, but it seems like there is a profound neediness in the people I see online participating in the nonsense. Even a sadness sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLeeInSF @knuckleheadhome @AngrierWHStaff Yep. Friends of my friend litter her FB timeline with talk of "the elites" It's so weird to me that they actually use that term like it's a real thing. The minute I see that or "deep state", I tap out. Nothing good comes from those discussions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knuckleheadhome @MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff I think it's a bunch of scared people who are happy that they found camaraderie with other scared people. Typical cult behavior.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff That sounds like an issue of emotional intelligence to me, but I hear ya. There are definitely those who have extreme trust issues. One of my very smart friends falls into that category. She thinks everything is a scam to "steal our freedom" Yeesh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newpresidentpls @Mach1Group @AngrierWHStaff Wait a minute. I saw a dude ranting last month that JFK Jr. was going to reappear on the 16th of Sept. Now it's the 17th of Oct.?

<|startoftext|>@MarkLeeInSF @AngrierWHStaff I seriously think it's more of an emotional/psychological issue than an intellectual one. I know book smart people who fall for this conspiracy madness.

<|startoftext|>@WalkerBragman But he and his ilk worship Trump. Why aren't these guys ever radicalized to start a war with the rich? Why do they want a race war and not a class war? Maybe because they care more about their white "supremacy" than their poverty?🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Not so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanPage needs to stop thanking him and call him out for continually going over time. That's his strategy and he's not going to stop. At least acknowledge that you know what he's up to. These moderators are useless. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMargaronis @Magga_DN Yep. He breaks the rules too. Just more politely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCFKA_NCSteve @rwcogito It wouldn't be localized swelling. His whole face would blow up. I was on heavy steroids a few years ago and got the "moonface" effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenKennedy @aravosis Steroids will make his whole face puffy and round. He wouldn't just have one puffy spot. Looks like swelling from trauma of some  kind to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preach Joe! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlreed42 @realDonaldTrump I did notice the weird color of his hair too. Dude is a big ole mess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Holy fuckin' bronze Jesus! Who painted him today?  https://t.co/niPVR2Ler3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Voiceoverlady1 Some people won't get the sarcasm, but I get the vampire humor. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually love not seeing or hearing him, but #WhereIsTrump?  https://t.co/OUjmTMEMMg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWulfsohn Trump looked at a 10 year old and said he'd be dating her some day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artist4ever I'd want to know. It's not your fault that dad cheated, and you have a right to know your family if they want to know you.  I wouldn't force it and I'd reach out the siblings only though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5  https://t.co/muahnNcLBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "ENTITLED"  He said it in all caps folks. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Has your wife had an orgasm yet? Worry about that small fry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_defender Yep. And she's gonna lose big!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarthaMcSally He's the only one who thinks you won 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MarkMeadows @senatemajldr @kevinomccarthy @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer She and everyone else knows what you're trying to do. Why now, Tiny? You can show up like Ed McMahon with one of those giant fake checks for $12,000. I STILL won't vote for you!  https://t.co/0Y4JKntUN4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Her voice could kill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ Who's a lyin' sack? YOU'RE a lyin' sack.   Just because you're made that Joe Biden actually has a heart so he knows what a heart-string is, doesn't mean that you get to lie about the message.  It was gratitude for coverage and concern for people not as lucky. #LyingLiar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRThompson2 I got bot checked the other day and had to give my phone number. I only use the web version so I don't keep my number on my account. Usually I can remove it. Now it won't let me. If I try to remove it, I get the "bot check" again which means I have to re-enter my number. Annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InfamusElGuapo @illegitpres @CNBC Not in my part of LA, but it sure as hell ain't strugglin'. You can still live very well even in places like Bel Air and Malibu on 400K. You'll just be living in a nice house instead of an estate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNBC Maybe in LA, SF or NY, but that's a lot of money in some big cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cljmo And in that scenario, he tries to find a way to only give it to people in the states that voted for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digweeg @TheRickWilson I think he really doesn't want to do anything that will help Blue states. Especially if (when) he loses. If it doesn't help him, he couldn't care less about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schumann786 I watched Joe live on MSNBC. I believe Trump's stunt was over before it started because I saw that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcpr Or actually kill you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTLA Ewwww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Uh. No.  Signed,  A Native Californian  #BidenHarris2020 #DumpTrump  https://t.co/tVS5Czq160<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love this! ☺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ugh! Just go away already. You're exhausting 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Perhaps her parents should have taken her phone (or gotten her a standard flip phone) when she started airing the family business months ago. They literally created this little monster. Though I trust Claudia more than I ever would her lying mother. 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChacoNapoleon @RudyGiuliani Really? How do you think they're pulling it off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani I guess vampires are immune or are they? We'll stay tuned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NachoProfessor2 I'll probably go grab a couple of sausage mcmuffins and a coffee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden  https://t.co/7uTn3Xei8F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystalball As usual, you've tweeted something stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ApolloAnthony3 @Speechlady6300 @lc1_summit @brenonade It's the drop in dosage that's going to be his wakeup call. He's getting enough to reduce the lung inflammation, but as they titrate down he may have a rebound and the slightest movement will have him gasping AND wheezing. He'll be too exhausted to move more than two feet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTBmom @lhbari @ProjectLincoln We all know how truthful those things are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Damn! Do we know why Drudge has been coming for Trump's neck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTBmom @ProjectLincoln Word on the street is that he does both himself so maybe he didn't infect yet another person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ssnarkismygame @ProjectLincoln Well that's all the internet snark I need today. I can go to bed early!  https://t.co/NPyRYWHLXx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Yes. Use of the word "strongly" must be used at least once a day by all employees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Trash on trash. Which one of you is the top?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgallman @realDonaldTrump @TimMurtaugh So maybe this #TrumpCovidHoax was a way to get #JoeBiden to be the one to walk away from the debate.🤔I wouldn't want to be within 100 ft of a reckless dude who supposedly already had COVID. I wouldn't blame Joe for canceling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Trump probably doesn't really have the virus, but still. Time to build Joe a hermetically-sealed plexiglass booth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why hasn't someone found a better fitting mask for #JoeBiden so that he doesn't have to keep adjusting it? This should not be a hard thing to do. Please someone get @JoeBiden a mask that doesn't slide down his face. It's distracting and he shouldn't be touching it like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang The stock market didn't tank COVID was already the biggest story of the month (and the last 6 months) He wanted to pass up on the next debate (this will probably happen) Clever enough to find a way to change the news from his taxes and gain some sympathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now would be the time that I would tender my resignation if I worked for that fool. If he does have it, I wouldn't let him expose me to it. Some of the #RoseGardenMassacre attendees who have tested positive are going to have serious cases. Just a matter of time. #TrumpCovidHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm back to thinking that he never really had it.   If he does have it, this "medical team" is just as irresponsible as the Orange Menace and also a danger to society. They sounded just like his cultists. #TrumpCovidHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Over 200K Americans have died from this virus, but OK 🙄  Why do you hate Americans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump DONE! #ByeDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephe96 @JRubinBlogger @DrPhillipsMD They help. They aren't foolproof, just like condoms. And in such a small, closed space, that was just careless and stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Reckless and dangerous for no good reason??? 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 How drunk are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcool111 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Ewww. That weird, tiny baby thumb always creeps me out. 😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClydeElkins3 @JohnathanPerk Oops! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald I've always thought hospitals are "quiet zones" I can't believe that cops are allowing this disturbance of the peace. Their cult leader should tell them to go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Happy birthday! Now tell us more about that skincare regimen 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Madame of a "high class" SC brothel.  https://t.co/qFJtp8N91R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kanew @MSNBC This was kind of surprising from Alex Witt because she makes no secret of the fact that she is not a fan of Trump's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonostrower @AP So they've never heard of metadata? These are dangerously stupid people. 🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse 😂😂😂  https://t.co/V9kwvOr4Qk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhowardbrowne No Sweetie. Prove you're right. You're the one making asinine accusations.   Trump and company were stupid and careless all by themselves. No need to target idiots 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharNatPumpkin @nbcsnl That seems to be the consensus. Though I'm seeing mixed reviews on Carrey as Biden. That's really what I'm interested in seeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was looking forward to the @nbcsnl season premiere but I forgot that Chris Rock was hosting. I threw him in the same trash can as Clown'ye a while back. I'll just DVR and skip over him. #SNL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solidarityvta @PreetBharara It airs at 8 on the west coast and replays at 11:30. I saw it was on around 8:30 while I was channel surfing. I have Spectrum cable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli He probably knew before that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PauleyTeeks Give it a few more days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkfecke And I've never heard or seen him use AMAZING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorigspeaks I think so too. Why would his doctor recommend a man of his age to NOT be tested? That sounds fishy. He just doesn't want everyone to know that his stupidity got him infected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleopatra_USA @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump What a stupid "explanation" 😂 A thousand people will be diagnosed today and they didn't have it in January either. Are they being targeted too?  Trump and his hard-headed, ignorant friends brought this on themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump They were only targeted by their own stupidity.   If he ran onto the highway and tried to dodge oncoming cars, would you ask if he was targeted when he gets hit by a truck?  https://t.co/Dgz4gN11tX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who's on tweet duty today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZerlinaMaxwell We never could. He's even corrupted medical professionals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Totally agree with 2 and 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gnuseibeh @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden  https://t.co/WKqMU5tkQq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@focused4USA I'm guessing he has it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrLeanaWen @kurteichenwald @realDonaldTrump I miss you Dr. Leana ☹ I was wondering why I haven't seen you on MSNBC for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrgaillot @JoeBiden If it's only for a couple of days. Monday, it's back to the street fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden Yep! And you looked fabulous this evening 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoYouEvenLif WB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC  https://t.co/IasAlIfzxm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Yeah. Claudia already put you on blast. What did y'all do to that girl? She don't like you at all. Not shocking, but damn! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On Monday, @JoeBiden needs to not only put his negative ads back up, he needs a new one that highlights #Trump's bad judgment and example that has resulted in several people in his orbit testing positive for COVID-19. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smartsuzysunset @gtconway3d @michikokakutani I don't know what they did to that child, but she is determined to get her revenge! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasie  https://t.co/rrhOAVD5Ry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveSchmidtSES @JoeBiden I've been seeing his ads all day. They are the hopeful, positive ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it looks like the super spreader event was that justice nomination,  not the debate (yet). The Notorious RBG had to let'em know that there are consequences for not obeying her wishes. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smartsuzysunset @gtconway3d @michikokakutani Yes she does. She just released a statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mymonkeybutt12 @vote4robgill @BillRob06744883 That's what I think too. I had a portable tank two years ago, and there was NO way to hide it. That's a strand of his dumb hair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vote4robgill @JonathonInkin @BillRob06744883 There would be a tank of some kind supplying the oxygen. Even he's not big enough to hide the smallest tank under his clothes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk You don't think a call from the WH doctor saying they want to admit him would be enough? Seriously asking. Not being snide. It seems like that's all it would take, but you may be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidFCarty @pkcapitol @Susan_Hennessey @RepTomGraves I did the same thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HubertJ40429163 @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Not according to him. He'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS This timing is just too convenient for me to buy this completely. Tons of bad press for both of you right  now is a really good reason to want to go underground for a week or two.

<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress  https://t.co/LUp7fAZwy1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is #Trump possibly trying to get out of debating, facing the press or dropping out of the race? This is just not sitting right with me.  #trumphascovid19 #TrumpIsALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdanClay Start looking for a new job<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump So now the "deep state" gave a 74 yo, obese and unhealthy man Corona virus? Did they slip it in his Big Mac or his KFC? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Does seem weird that everybody was negative on Tuesday, then everybody tested positive the same day. So everybody caught it yesterday?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeeKatLee1 @charliekirk11 @CNN Yes. I love relating to a woman who thinks it's beneath her to think about kids in cages.

Something Trump will NEVER be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone who voted for Trump or third party 8n 2016 just to "stick it to the Dem establishment" is responsible for the end of this country as we once imagined it could be. The Civil war I feel is coming is on YOU GUYS! Fucking brats 😡 #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeanathanThaGod @TheMikelCrump @sirhottest Girl, go sit down somewhere. You're boring and dismissed! 🤣 #muted  https://t.co/ZcJL5Wu9Ga<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanathanThaGod @TheMikelCrump @sirhottest I always do me. I'm awesome. Why would I do someone else?🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden should refuse to debate this ignorant piece of trash going forward. The Orange Menace is not at all serious and it's a waste of his time. #Trump is a disgraceful clown. #Debate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanathanThaGod @TheMikelCrump @sirhottest Are you processing his claims or something? 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 I may just stick with the MSNBC coverage rather than try to watch. I'll give it a few minutes though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BoscoJankovic1 @RealCandaceO @JoeBiden That chunk of moldy cheese can't run!🤣 He didn't really want a drug test. He just likes to distract with nonsense. He has people on the record who say that he abuses Adderall. He doesn't want to go there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@la_ashdown @TheMikelCrump @sirhottest Apparently, I thought so. Duh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briankoppelman I also have ADHD and I am prescribed Adderall. The drug is not the problem and no one is demonizing it. The problem is the abuser of the drug suggesting that someone else is. We're laughing at HIM not making fun of people (like us) who truly need the drug and use it responsibly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsJustGinaP Yep.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So do y'all think the Orange Addict invited Lyin' Tara to the #debate? They only got 20 tickets each so Joe couldn't even accommodate all of #RapistTrump's accusers if he wanted to. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_Schaeffer Nope. I'm still not sure if I can watch it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @JoeBiden Why should Biden dignify the request of a KNOWN drug addict? And since when has a drug test been a debate requirement? You are a horrible person and karma won't be kind to you. Sometimes it skips a generation. Can't wait to see how it works out for ya😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The TX Medical Board should suspend @RonnyJackson4TX medical license! What kind of "doctor" lies about someone he has never treated on national television? He sounds like a damn drunk too. Somebody should drug test him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndigenousAI Good grief. It's not "racist." No one is being oppressed by this foolishness. I admit that I laughed at the name bc it flipped the script on his Sen Warren insult. However, once NAs voiced their hurt, I chose not to promote it. I'm not racist bc I thought it was funny though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redevilone @dcexaminer Neither did she 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Because it's true???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer Such soothing, reassuring voices used to let Brad Parscale know that he was safe and they were going to take care of him. I bet #BreonnaTaylor would have loved such treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMES123 Yep! The only joy I get from his "presidency" is that I know he's been miserable every single day of it. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brad Parscale is 6'8" and fit. His wife called police saying that he had a gun, he had hurt her and was threatening to hurt himself. He sure is lucky that he's a rich, white dude or he'd be dead as fuck! #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump He's probably writing it off as charity or something in order to lower his taxable income.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson He has the weirdest little thumbs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Exactly! While I appreciated the flogging of Trump, I've never thought that the guys from TLP were actual friends of Dems, ESPECIALLY George. I've never followed him and only mildly interact with his tweets. He's an ultra-conservative who just happens to hate Trump. That's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica They hate Trump. Not Republicans. Especially the ultra-conservative ones. I've never thought for a second that they were on our team beyond getting rid of the Orange Menace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PoliSue2 @GorrellTrisha @thomaskaine5 Even when he's not as fluid in his speech, the substance of what he says can't be denied. He showed an impressive command of the facts, I thought. I'd rather have someone who knows their stuff than a smooth talker. Trump is neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErieErieErie1 @acwelling @thomaskaine5 I believe it was Monmouth. I saw something on MSNBC this morning. I never thought Mitch had to worry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@caylynmarie71 @kingsrush @DanceMoms It's a very realistic portrayal of tween girls trying to act "mature." Any grown woman can tell you that she went through the same stage. In the YouTube, TikTok age, the older girls they emulate are racier than they were when I was 11 though. Still totally normal behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard @netflix Did you actually watch the movie? I just did and it's not even close to being child porn. It is very realistic about how tween girls interact with each other as they try to fit in and be popular with other kids though. Apparently, you were never a little girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast He looks like he's out of breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually watched #Cuties. It was good. There were a couple of cringey moments, but it was a typical coming of age story of a tween girl trying to be "mature" to fit in with the in crowd. It is in NO WAY "kiddie p0rn" Pedos are attracted to age, not twerking.    #CancelNexflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natearbz @meghan_hays9 @tom_champerdog @JoeBiden @Sept11Memorial He handles a piece of paper she had her bare hands on. Then he touches his mask. When he hands her the flowers, their hands touch.  I said what I said! Now YOU chill the fuck out!  https://t.co/jGPHGpFUq9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momuvtwo @meghan_hays9 @tom_champerdog @JoeBiden @Sept11Memorial Their hands are definitely touching. It makes me nervous every time I see him that close to anyone other than Dr. Jill, and sometimes, even her. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meghan_hays9 @tom_champerdog @JoeBiden @Sept11Memorial I love this, but I want him to stop touching people. We have to keep him healthy and cootie-free for the election and beyond. I don't want anyone touching RBG either. 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sebastian13v It won't be long. So far he's just a fading "journalist"🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blvckbvrbie Nope. How many angry letters did you write about Toddlers and Tiaras? There was one episode with a 5 year old dressed in the hooker outfit from Pretty Woman as she danced provocatively. It's inappropriate &amp; something a pedophile may enjoy watching, but it's not actual pedophilia.  https://t.co/e9fwQUqOOE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PcolaBucsfan LOL. OK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blvckbvrbie I'll "literally" watch it and judge for myself. If I find it as appalling as a single episode of Toddlers and Tiaras, I'll turn it off. Even then, that doesn't make it pedophilia. I highly doubt sex with or between children is happening, but I'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this pearl clutching from phonies who think that "purity balls" where young girls are forced to "marry" their own fathers has me curious about this Cuties movie.

<|startoftext|>@pleppert It's all nonsense to separate her from blackness since we are a major constituency, and they don't want us to identify with her. She descends from African slaves just like all colonized black folk do. Kamala and I could share a great-great-great-grandmother for all we know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud to say that I have never seen a single episode. #KUWTK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vorona93980654 Yep. This is also why there's not the same level of racial tension between black and white where slaves were not imprisoned in the country of the slave holders. That separation made those islands feel more like the black people's home than slaves here in the U.S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vorona93980654 I've never heard the Blackness of Jamaicans questioned until Kamala rose to prominence. It's mind-boggling. Usain Bolt must be so confused. lol  https://t.co/QTqLtrLRHo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen several stupid people make comments about how people from Caribbean islands are not Black. What do they think "Black" is? Black people descend from Black Africans no matter where they currently reside. Kamala, Cardi, Rhianna's Black ancestors are no less Black than mine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JameyKnox @TheDamaniFelder @iamcardib Sweetie. I am black. I'm black because I descend from black people who dragged to the Americas from the African continent.

<|startoftext|>@gance_linda @Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Ok. So you’ll be calling bullshit on tweets by the Orange Menace that start with  People are saying  Many people have said Very credible sources have told me from now on? Assuming you haven’t already 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Wtf? That makes ZERO sense 😯 Comey sabotaged Hillary because if she won she couldn’t fire him since he had something to hold over her???

<|startoftext|>@Tweet4409 @gance_linda @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Nope. I believe that people in politics gather information that they think will help them or hurt their enemies. All these books written by his ex employees are full of things they didn’t talk about for years. He hasn’t sued a single one of them for libel because they didn’t lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump I’m neither.  Yes. I sure do believe that many people have heard that and worse from him.  This is politics. People store information and use it when they think it’s useful.  Were you this upset when Comey re-opened up the Hillary email crap weeks before the 2016 election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gance_linda @Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump The reporters at Fox, CNN, NBC, Reuters, AP, Washington Post etc., know their names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arigotch @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump People have said they DIDN’T HEAR IT. That’s not the same as HE DIDN’T SAY IT.  I’ve been in plenty of rooms where I wasn’t a part of every conversation so I know things were said that I could neither confirm nor deny even though I was there. I’m sure we all have that experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_tom_spidey_ @Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump They’re playing the semantics game. They didn’t hear that “specific” comment at that “specific time.” I wonder how many of them can say the have NEVER heard him say ANYTHING like that EVER? So many dishonest creeps protecting that vile creature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tweet4409 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump How many times have you questioned the “many people” Dump says tell him outrageous things? Probably never.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell Was this the site of the Bowling Green massacre Skaryanne talked about? I can’t think of any other fictional unrests dreamed up by this administration. There was nothing but peace and quiet at that inauguration cuz no one was there. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arigotch @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Why are y’all only focused on ONE event? These comments were said to have been made at various times and places over the years. Y’all never question his anonymous “credible sources” but any anonymous criticisms of Cheeto Jesus are obvious lies. Puh-lease🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DelrayAvener @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump What’s lame is how you MAGA think anyone who speaks against him is lying. Anonymous or not.  I’m sure y’all will say that Michael Cohen is lying even though he was his lawyer for 10 yrs. Y’all say Mary Trump is lying and she’s known him her whole life. But he NEVER lies🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rayhiros @dixon003 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Yep. “I didn’t hear it” and “he didn’t say it” are two entirely different things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamsIbe2 @CuredByTheBLood Wtf are you talking about? I CLEARLY stated that violating ANYONE’S privacy is WRONG! Not my man, my mama, or my friends.

<|startoftext|>@tiggey5444 @JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Probably some of the “many people” or the “very credible sources” Dump claims tell him things all the time. 🙄 BTW, where is that report “his people” put together on President Obama whe he “sent them to Hawaii” to investigate him?

<|startoftext|>@JudgeJeaninefan @realDonaldTrump Just because HE didn’t hear something doesn’t mean other people didn’t. These were also comments made several times in different settings.

<|startoftext|>@WilliamsIbe2 @CuredByTheBLood Why does what’s on HER phone matter? No one has the right to terrorize another person for ANY reason. And he’s acting a fool because he got dumped. Not because of what he saw on her phone. I would have dumped his ass too! What’s on my phone is no one else’s business.<|endoftext|>

What about the Black casino workers he didn't want seen on the casino floor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Have you ever known the intimate touch of another human being? You're kinda creepy so I'm guessing not.

<|startoftext|>@netcit2 @tedcruz They probably didn't know because they're not sitting at home with a hard on looking for a antifa websites. Almost makes you think that Teddy Munster knows exactly who bought and redirected the domain then posted this to start some sh!t. Hmmmm 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SweetFnLucifer I've always loved your tweets. You're an incredibly clever and talented writer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MGF_83 @DJMomoTheGreat @alicatamerica @atrupar Portland is 70% white. Kenosha is 80% white.   You must live in a cave somewhere cuz cities are not 100% Democrats.

<|startoftext|>@angryblkhoemo Do tell me how this is racist? I don't think that word means what you think it does. lol Also, I don't think #Strokeahontas cares much about people being ableist.  https://t.co/5vKpe7OEMO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJMomoTheGreat @alicatamerica @atrupar Definitely. But the Trump people who are working to discredit the movement and turn would-be allies against it are more dangerous. There need to be more sit-ins than marches. That would make it easier to weed out the troublemakers, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahPekarek Who thought a tube of spit was a good marketing idea? 🤮 #blocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alicatamerica @DJMomoTheGreat @atrupar There are many bad actors who support Trump who are showing up to be destructive. That's why they are focusing on majority white cities where it's easier to have white supremacists infiltrate the movement and create chaos.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jessica87710505 @TMZLive I guess it's getting better. I was a teen in the 80s and the most diversity there was then was a few Jewish and Japanese families.

<|startoftext|>@sleep4_aweek @blueheartedly @DanielBRichard Stephanie Ruhle and Ali Velshi talked a lot on MSNBC about why the stock market hasn't tanked.

<|startoftext|>@Jessica87710505 @TMZLive I don't know if they did it on purpose, I'd guess they probably did. However, I grew up in the South Bay and MB has ALWAYS had a racist reputation. I've experienced it firsthand. No one from the SB would be shocked if this had happened in MB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereandnow54321 @TMZ Oh Sweetie,  do you really think there are videos of Black people threatening to call the cops on white people for the crime of merely existing? Really? You're trying to be provocative but you're only showing your ignorance and low key racism. You can  shove your "whataboutism"🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do white folk get so upset about the use of "Karen" as a way to describe entitled soccer moms (who are often white) acting a fool?

<|startoftext|>@hereandnow54321 @TMZ People have been doing exactly that for years which is probably why you used that name in your example since I doubt you actually know a Shaniqua. I don't and I know hundreds of Black women. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RexChapman I’m not “body shaming” but I’ve noticed that so many cops are overweight and probably not very fit. Maybe if they were in better shape, they wouldn’t be so quick to shoot.

<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @CNN He's garbage. He's on my list of people I'm ashamed I ever liked. Fuck that guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClintKamstra @ThinkRightUSA1 Yeah. I saw videos like that. I didn't think it would be normal for the cops to be providing any kind of support to anyone they thought was a protester. I could see them supporting a militia person though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThinkRightUSA1 @ClintKamstra Do cops usually give out water at protests? To anyone other than another cop? It does seem a little oddly friendly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @PRoadrunner8776 He's not serious about taking a drug test. He's just trying to put some bs out there to make HIS people think that when Biden cleans his clock in the debate, it was because he had some super drug that helped him. I wonder what drug he thinks improves debate performance?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the main reasons Repukes annoy the hell out of me is their constant, straight-faced lying and gaslighting. @ScottWalker is sitting on @MSNBC just lying through his teeth about the conventions, COVID and everything else. He's trash!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPNomWatch @MSNBC @kimKBaltimore She can have all the views she wants. She wasn't the only one they didn't broadcast. I would have changed the channel myself. I have ZERO interest in her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBolzy @MSNBC @SpeakerPelosi @NYGovCuomo You don't have to watch the coverage on that channel if you're not happy with it. Fox may be a better option 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBolzy @MSNBC @SpeakerPelosi @NYGovCuomo A statement of fact about a pandemic that is killing thousans of people daily is not divisive to me.

<|startoftext|>@sorryimjake @kreeptrina @x_labz @anselmenocap @itsjodarling Maybe. I don't follow the dude, but there are many people who were once super famous and they aren't anymore. He makes money through deals with big brands. If they bail on him, most of his income is gone. He doesn't have the ability to make his own products in large volumes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeTrozzo @SlayWay24 This is a picture on social media isn't it? Who posted it first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sorryimjake @kreeptrina @x_labz @anselmenocap @itsjodarling So? He's an attention whore. Without fame, he won't be as happy about the stuff. That's just icing on his cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_labz @itsjodarling I will never willingly contribute to the wealth of someone who has made it clear they hate me. That's like taking booty calls from a dude who calls you ugly in public because he's a good lay. No thanks. I have self respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Her basis is that he's a damn criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Nope.  https://t.co/aq2UB8fsmx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Did the media call Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal a "private matter"? I would think this would be more disturbing to someone who was horrified by song lyrics.

<|startoftext|>I've decided that for my sanity, I will not be watching @MSNBC until it's time for @DeadlineWH. I don't think they would dare interrupt Nicolle to show Trump lie and brag for an hour. If they do, I'll be turning it off again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reneefanatic2 @StaceyMadelineK @ilenesreality A big child who probably costs a lot to feed  I don't know why anyone would think getting him was some prize.

<|startoftext|>@Drain_Bramage14 @Tennesseine It's so awful. What it tells me is that I watch too much tv. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Farleyfan @MSNBC That would take 5 minutes. @cnn isn't still broadcasting that trash. They can also show clips of the craziest stuff later. I'm not going to watch them hang on his every word again like 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this is shocking. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshMankiewicz I'll never get prominent people who do shit like this. They have to know that the urge to out them is too great. They always get outed for the most part. High-priced call girls are the only ones who seem to keep that stuff to themselves unless subpoenaed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this #RNC2020 NC trash on @MSNBC right now? Is this equal time? Will there be time taken away from the prime time program? This is repulsive! Y'all let this disgusting asshole play you every time. Fuck y'all. Time for Netflix. #TrumpThreatensAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 Mine too. She once started calling my friends to ask them if they had heard from me because I didn't call 2 hours after she left a message.

<|startoftext|>@StaceyMadelineK @ilenesreality Asuelu ain't the dude you "trap" by getting pregnant. I bet she wakes up every day wishing she could turn back time and use a condom and he was still in Samoa.  His greedy ass family thought they got lucky that he married a woman whose family is rich (in their eyes).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were Kalani, I would never let Asuelu's family anywhere near my kids again. The nerve of his awful mother to say that she "doesn't care about the kids." Bitch, I don't care about YOU! Collect cans ya greedy old hag. #90DayFiance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @TeamTrump Whatever you say Jason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael should be embarrassed that he let that wildebeest Angela come to his country and treat him the way she does. The colonizer is strong in that one. Does he have a sister who can beat the bitch out of her trashy ass? #90DayFiance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedude039 Claudia strikes me as a smart girl. Maybe a little bratty right now, but she's gonna be a strong woman, I think. If the Conways are trying to turn down the negativity and focus on their kids, I totally support that. Things were getting really ugly for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedude039 I didn't hear that about George. I just read that Claudia is trying to get emancipated. I'm sure all of this infighting has really damaged their family. It's too bad that Kellyanne was willing to support an obvious idiot and let things get to this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkibopMoss @pink_petite4u He's not a bad looking guying at all, but I think even if he slimmed down, he'd have to put on a lot of muscle because he really does have a bit of a feminine body. He has tits, hips AND a badonkadonk. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pink_petite4u That man has the worst build! I would never want to see him naked.🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slamclickrkel Angela calls off the wedding EVERY damn episode. Michael must really want to move to the US to put up with that trailer rat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Asuelu's mom should go back to Samoa where the rest of the kids can take care of her. His first priority is to the kids he made, not to her or her church. His whole family is abrasive and annoying af! #90DayFiance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SMeitli @educatedadult1 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Sure. But not on taxpayers dime to line my own pockets. He's charging the American people for the use of his golf course.

<|startoftext|>@jbarro Why shouldn't they? That's his son. He's supposed to shun his own child because of some childish Trump bullshit? Trump should hide damn near all of his criminal kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His name is Brayden Harrington and he's my new hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look how damn handsome Joe Biden is. Donny Dump could NEVER! #DNC2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020  https://t.co/EGfqg0vbdh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meenaharris Well Joe says y'all family now so they have to tell you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sherriAmitchell Especially when he realizes that they don't have time to copy the amazing job the Dems have pulled off. This convention has been incredible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara I teared up with the intro from Hunter and Ashley and completely lost it with that video. My nose is running and my eyes are red, but I feel good 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I picture Trump's team trying to digitally create pictures of him being a loving father to his children right now. I bet he doesn't have many, if any, pictures of him holding them as babies. #DNC2020 #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! This sweet boy going on national TV and pushing through his stutter like a champ 😃 I will fucking fight anyone who messes with him! #DNC2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk All of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How would you know? Someone just told you what a tend is last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mchooyah @Delta You sound like Al Bundy talking about those 4 touchdowns 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mchooyah @Delta My favorite airline! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwedishNewFish I still don't know how I feel about Kennedy going after Markey though. Doesn't seem like he deserved it and it's more about the Kennedys thinking that a MA Senate seat must always be occupied by one of them. I like Kennedy, but I have some feelings about this 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley  https://t.co/2fXTDSiUnH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smartsuzysunset I don't get it either. I like Liz, but it was time to move on from her a long time ago. There are some really savvy, smart people who are still whining about her. They need to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 Yay! More bacon for Willie 😋So glad that you have one less thing to worry about 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump Hmmm...In the ENTIRE statement, I distinctly recall her starting with "I don't think you're a racist" You already know that and there is plenty of video so good luck with the gaslighting 😂🖕🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@briebriejoy And I'm still appalled even though he lost most everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris Are they American born or transplants? My nephew's wife was born in Jamaica and moved here as a little girl. She identifies as Jamaican. They have two kids now. I'll have to ask her if she's comfortable with AA for them. It never occurred to me how she might identify them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_seminnis @JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris It's an addiction! I seriously can't go to sleep at night without putting some on. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_seminnis @JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris Thank you. I appreciate the thoughtfulness. We all get this kind of stuff wrong at some point, but a genuine attempt to understand and do better is how we eventually get it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris I think because Jamaica is predominantly a Black country now, people think it's always been, and they forget that Black folk got there through the slave trade and their roots are African.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_seminnis @JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris I still use Black for myself, but I'm not offended by the other term. Many Black people who descend from African slaves incorporate something African like Afro-Cuban, Afro-Latino, Afro-Columbian, etc. Here it was Afro-American before it changed to African-American<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @KamalaHarris She was born in America. Her father could be called "African Jamaican" if he wanted, but Kamala's nationality is American. Jamaican is not a race. She's of African descent just like we are. Our ancestors just got dropped off at different places. She's a Black African American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonysamurai75 @ErikaAndiola @MichelleObama OK. You're done. I'm not doing crazy Q conspiracy theories. Be on your way! #muted  https://t.co/NZfiH4VG99<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonysamurai75 @ErikaAndiola @MichelleObama Obama wasn't president in 2005. And unlike Dump, his administration released unaccompanied children to family sponsors instead of keeping them detained indefinitely. They also made an effort to keep families detained TOGETHER.  https://t.co/18VC5dQ7ow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpKennels @davenewworld_2 There was a dude like that here in LA. He was in the country illegally, and he would roll up to restaurants in his state-provided wheelchair looking for ADA violations. He sued one for having the mirror too high. They finally deported him.  https://t.co/oLC9uEOQS2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErikaAndiola @sonysamurai75 @MichelleObama Obama didn't separate families 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Girl, when are you going to figure out that no one cares what you think? We only ready your tweets and respond to remind you that you a gross and loathsome toad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayawiley Always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antipodean59 @seanhannity Who cares? He's sitting in a chair fully clothed with his hands on his lap. A fully clothed woman is massaging his shoulders in a non-private room. They are obviously not alone since someone took the picture.  https://t.co/DbFb5cn7dQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity So two people, fully clothed with at least one other person in the room holding a camera is something that concerns you? 🤣🤣🤣🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Take your benzos and go to bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meenaharris I missed it ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden Such a beautiful couple. Then and now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mel_Ankoly @RealKHiveQueenB A smart person with some pride would do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB 40 years later he wants to tell the world that his woman walked out on his ass for a hotter man? He's lucky she didn't meet Joe around the time this pic was taken. He would have never gotten her in the first place. #HandsomeJoe  https://t.co/sg1II327VI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 What a dick. He knows what he's doing. There's no way you don't know your music is that loud. I can't wait until this shit is over. I'm seriously looking into buying or renting a free-standing house so that I don't have to share a ceiling, floor or wall cuz people suck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 That's horrible! My neighbors (below me) had a baby a few months ago and he's not walking yet, but I'm dreading it. I had a toddler below me before, and with hardwood floors it doesn't matter either way. I listened to that little asshole run around for two years. Ugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli  https://t.co/8P16pZ9HF7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Girl! I never watch CNN at that time, but I did today and Anderson did not disappoint. It was painfully funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden Is it OK that I sometimes refer to you as "Hot Dr. Jill"? You're just so gorgeous that it just flies out of my mouth.🥰  Looking forward to hearing you speak tonight Future First Lady!🤗 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdcmedlock Well there are buildings and there are architectural masterpieces. Most modern buildings suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMikeLindell Dude. Tell @andersoncooper you smell something burning and you have to go. Get off of tv right now. YOU. ARE. EMBARRASSING. YOURSELF! This would be painful to watch if it weren't so damn funny  Dr. #MyPillowGuy is gonna save the world from #COVID. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump He knows she dead, right? She's not going to campaign for him to get all the women who refuse to vote for him to change their minds. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eiggam5955 This is fake. Some things shouldn't be joked about these days unless you make it clear that it's parody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andersoncooper is really embarrassing this #MyPillowGuy dolt. Why would this fool go on tv so unprepared? You say there was a test of a whole 1,000 people🙄and you can't cite the test or anything about it??? He's ridiculous and so is anyone who listens to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So do you or don't you believe in polls? You keep flip-flopping about them. Probably because #TrumpIsLosing! #BidenHarris #ByeDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myemuisemo Haha. That wouldn't surprise me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Dumpty Dump is trying to pander to Susan B. Anthony now? Guess he doesn't get that she's another woman who wouldn't vote for him. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously! Fvck @mitchellreports She is the ONLY one still talking about the "birther" crap about #Kamala. I think SHE is the one who really wants to perpetuate this nonsense. I can't stand that nasty toad-faced broad. Ugh! I keep forgetting to change the channel😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JosephJFlynn1 @jaketapper @MichelleObama @KamalaHarris But here you are. Giving it attention.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald True, but I do love the fun and energy of the in-person convention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDawson73 @CamiLee13 I've seen that, but I've heard that sometimes a "like" was really a "comment"  Next time I see a unexpected like from someone I follow I'll go to their page to see if it shows up in their liked tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDawson73 @CamiLee13 I've heard that commenting on a tweet can show up as having liked it, but I don't know how to confirm that. I comment on their tweets all the time but I've never liked one. 🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Then why are you watching and touching yourself, Gums McGee?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @MichelleObama Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBJDPCNT643 @KevinMKruse @TomSugrue Nah. I'm having too much fun reading all the awesome comments about night one of the convention and how excited people are about #BidenHarris2020.

<|startoftext|>Took a quick peek earlier to see if Fox was airing the DNC, they weren't which is fine since I wouldn't watch it there anyway, but if CNN and MSNBC don't air the RNC Hannity and the MAGAts will go into total meltdown. #DNCConvention<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC @anastasiakeeley I really want to have dinner with your family just to watch these exchanges. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders And not a single damn time have I said that making it possible to see a doctor is a bad thing. I'm pretty sure that I said healthcare is a right. I just know that access to and actual healthcare are two entirely different things.   I'm a Big Picture kinda gal🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eiggam5955 Haha. He was shamed into deleting that nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders What more can you say? You don't seem to get that being *able* to see a doctor is not the end all, be all.  Seeing a doctor doesn't guarantee you'll get treated or treated well.   Negligent care is no better than no care at all. But you just keep pretending that it does.🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKatiePorter He'll never be as prepared at you. I'm not sure who could be. Can't wait to see you in action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders I have a chronic condition and ALL of my docs are either Asian or S Asian cuz I see a lof of specialists. Lucky for me, they're all great Again. If M4A was implemented today that does not guarantee that you will be seen by a doctor or given adequate treatment even if you are seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders We need to be focused on right now is re-training medical professionals to stop believing crap like "Black people don't feel pain" We need to be creating programs to guide more BIPOC into medical school to serve those under treated communities with compassion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara What's Adam doing back there? Did he ruin everything?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @CNN Quoting CNN now? God you are such a phony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see @mitchellreports  is going to spend another election cycle harping on issues that aren't important and shouldn't be given air. Kamala is eligible. Let it go already. Can @MSNBC retire her tired, boring ass too? I forgot to turn the channel. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders Even wealthy black and brown people with private health insurance aren't always provided the healthcare they have access to and deserve to receive. There are very important things that have to happen within the system first to make access worth it.   https://t.co/O85PHFV63f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders I don't disagree that providing healthcare is a human right. My point is that "access" to healthcare doesn't mean that that healthcare will be provided. Every child in this country has access to public education, but not all of them get an education. It's not as simple as access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cptnrawrpnts Preparing to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bloo95 @DemHugh @CoriBush @BernieSanders M4A is not going to change racial bias by healthcare workers against poc.

<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress @realDonaldTrump So close that he was golfing as he lay dying.🙄 I would have been in the room holding my brother's hand until he took his last breath. Unless there was some legitimate reason why I couldn't be in the room with him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Am I the only one that suspects Robert Trump died from COVID and it will never be disclosed? All because of his corrupt, dingbat brother's ineptitude?

<|startoftext|>@Vorona93980654 I hope these companies get a damn clue. The fact that many of our drugs, PPE, and medical equipment are manufactured in China is just stupid.

<|startoftext|>Watched the last two minutes of the #trumpPressBriefing and noticed that right after he rambled on about companies moving their manufacturing to China, he waddled off the stage before anyone could ask him about all of his goods being manufactured there. #TrumpHasNoPlan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johntuff2 @pariusus203 @c_cayla609 Who said mixed equals Black? I know half Latino and half Filipino people who have the same coloring. She looked like Mariah Carey to me though and she is a Black/white mix. Black folk don't claim every brown person. Some of y'all we definitely DON'T want! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rrrrronni @c_cayla609 I never said just because of the Ottomans. Maybe some N African Arabs stopped by🤷🏾‍♀️ Cleary the thought of you having non-white blood brothers you. I know y'all think you're white, but y'all are not Anglo-Saxons. That's what I think of as "white" people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meenaharris @USPS So now the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate is hurting, not helping, small businesses?  He's the fvcking devil!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko I love Nicolle. Never miss her, but I don't think she's right for MTP. She has a fun and sardonic delivery that I don't think they would allow her to have on a straight-laced Sunday show. I like her realness, and I think her current show is a better vehicle for her personality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TT_Darko @pariusus203 @c_cayla609 It's not just her coloring. Her features aren't super European either. That pic of her with the afro definitely looks like a biracial girl. I don't think it's an accident that she took afrocentric pictures. She and her handlers know she looks mixed &amp; they use it when convenient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rrrrronni @c_cayla609 So you know for sure that centuries ago, NO woman in your family may have been abused by a non-Albanian man? A lot of Southern Italians have a hard time admitting that they don't look like Northern Italians because the Moors added some spice to the sauce. They're just tan 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @Porsha4real but there is no such thing as "not seeing color" There are white ppl who don't prejudge bc of color, but they see it. If you were with 5 of those ppl and if someone walked in and asked "what's the black girl's name" all 5 would say Porsha. #raceinamerica  https://t.co/g45oXYsfhT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rrrrronni @c_cayla609 So I'm sure there are many Albanians with Persian ancestors whose great grandmothers raised their babies to identify with their culture and not their rapist's religion or culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rrrrronni @c_cayla609 I'm not sure how religion factors in? You have black people in this country w/ light skin &amp; eyes who have two parents who identify as black. That coloring comes from slave rape, not assimilation. "Ethnic cleansing" by raping the women happened to every invaded country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahtheWrit2 @JohnathanPerk Have it in my queue and I don't think I'll ever watch it. Just thinking about it hurts my heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aintshitjunior @Rrrrronni I did and it sucked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rrrrronni @c_cayla609 Yeah, and olive skin in the Mediterranean came in large part from invaders from the ME and North Africa. Anglos weren't the only ones to rob, rape and pillage in other countries. 🤷🏾‍♀️ The Moors and Persians left plenty of brown babies in Europe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pariusus203 @c_cayla609 Well you never know who might show up in that family tree. Could be a brotha in there somewhere 🤣 That region has so much mixture I actually wouldn't doubt it. My ex is half Lebanese and he has a cousin in Lebanon who you would swear was a mixed girl. Hair kinkier than mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jabronixpie @pariusus203 @c_cayla609 Yeah. I worked with an Albanian guy and a lot of people assumed he was Persian because of his coloring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Have one of them destroyed another black man or stolen the creative ideas of another black woman who doesn't have the means to fight back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@savage_purpose I'd tell so that there would be a record of me making it known that the dude gives you the creeps. First thing the cops ask on true crime shows was "did you tell anyone about what was going on?" Tell on his ass TODAY!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 You are a true patriot my friend. 🤣  I'm a dog "liker" not "lover" My bestie thinks it's cute when her dogs jump all over visitors. I told her that she better check her canines if she wants me to ever come over again. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinMissing @davenewworld_2 A collapsible 6 ft pole should work nicely to spank that ass at a safe distance. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_cayla609 I'll admit it. When she first came on the scene, I thought she was mixed. Albania was part of the Ottoman Empire so there's probably some Middle Eastern and North African in her bloodline which would account for the olive skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly You should be. Wishing you continued strength to keep winning!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@melh0210 @WajahatAli Yes. You can drop off your completed ballot at a polling place. My parents have been doing it in CA for years. Should be all states.

<|startoftext|>@fsaronson @WajahatAli They're are "Postage Paid" here in CA. We don't have to put a stamp on it even if mailed. I'm not sure about everywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladyterp2 @WajahatAli Fine. Flood them with phone calls and messages. They're gonna be doing that anyway. I'm also recommending this to my friends, family and neighbors. We can all spread the message within our communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anitamlre @WajahatAli We have to play with the cards we're dealt🤷🏾‍♀️no one expected this.  The DNC should be creating a website educating people how to correctly fill out the ballot and running ads promoting it. People need to know that it's actually more convenient than in-person #USPSsabotage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli I don't know, but the smartest thing people can do is to fill out their mail-in ballots and take them DIRECTLY to their local polling place and put them in the dropbox. No waiting in line and no dealing with the corruption going on at USPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dantoujours @entreprenoober @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump You're wasting your time and intelligence on this fool. He's constantly wrong and clearly doesn't even understand the article that he posted. But like most fools, he just keeps digging. I muted his idiocy. I can only ridicule stupid people so long before it becomes cruel. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump You probably think that your family should be entitled to a $1M life insurance payout because you bought a policy the day after you got a terminal illness prognosis saying you'll be dead in 3 mos.🙄Nope! Your family would be screwed because you didn't prepare well.🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump What fucking part of CONTINUOUS COVERAGE do you not understand???🤦🏾‍♀️ I have REPEATEDLY stated that you HAVE to have previous coverage to MAINTAIN pre-existing condition coverage. They do this so that people don't wait until they get a diagnosis to buy healthcare insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump No it doesn't. Have you actually read this? Private healthcare insurance just means that you're not getting it from an employer or using a government program.  https://t.co/Uiny6mnMgA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump That's EXACTLY how it works.🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump That's why there's the ACA/Obamacare.

<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump This applies only if you didn't maintain continuous coverage  https://t.co/i8Ewy8J2MN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump A waiting period is fair for those who didn't cover themselves, but then buy insurance once they need it. It's like trying to buy car insurance AFTER you have wreck or buying life insurance after your doctor tells you that you have 6 mos to live. That's taking advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump Everybody should maintain continuous coverage. When I left my job last year, I got insurance through the Obamacare exchange. I have a chronic illness and my current insurance has been covering everything the whole time bc I had NO breaks in coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entreprenoober @dantoujours @Katherine101364 @JHoganGidley @DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump You didn't read this. This is for people who don't maintain continuous coverage then buy insurance months later. Those people have a *waiting period* for pre-existing condition coverage, but they still can't be refused insurance as they would have been pre-Obamacare/ACA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly Girl, don't I know! My best friend is gay, and he will not hesitate to tell me "No. You are not going out like that" or sweetly ask "Think it's time we go get a pedicure?"🤣 I love my "best bitch" 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWOSullivan Dear, everybody in my life cares about my feelings. Including my parents. Otherwise, they would not be in my life. My parents raised a confident, empowered woman. However, they did not let a 3 yo call the shots, and they shouldn't have. I'm glad I had discipline in my upbringing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly And he's a fabulous gay man so it's an even bigger compliment. Gay men don't just throw around compliments. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly @briantylercohen I registered to vote online so I don't think there is a signature, but I'll use the one that I used on my driver's license. That's the one I use when I want my name to be legible. Otherwise, I just scribble it on receipts and stuff like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly @briantylercohen Thanks! A guy I worked with sent it to me cuz he thought she looked like me. I was like "OK. If you think I look like that, I'll take it!" 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWOSullivan And seriously dude. Let it go. I was kidding about cutting his hair while he slept. It would probably come out lopsided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWOSullivan Oh FFS! And people wonder why kids are suicidal when they fail at anything these days.🙄  My parents didn't consult me or ask me about my "feewings" when I was 3. They picked my clothes &amp; styled my hair. I have two degrees and live in a $3.5M house now &amp; I don't resent my parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly @briantylercohen I've never done it either, but my parents have been doing it for years and I have a few friends who have been as well so I have some people to consult if I get stuck. I think it's pretty simple though. Just gotta make sure your signature is correct. I use a couple 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly @briantylercohen I can't find a date, but it should be soon. I got a mailer yesterday to request a ballot in another language if I needed one so I'm thinking probably next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wafflebaby2 For me, it's because I'm lazy. The part I hate most is putting the groceries away when I get home, but walking around, putting things in a cart, then taking them out the cart so they can be rung up, loading bags in the car. I hate it all. lol Now, I only have to put them away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wafflebaby2 OMG! I thought I was the only one. I use Instacart. I hate the grocery store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeinreichHolly @briantylercohen CA hasn't mailed them yet, but when I get it, I'm filling it out and dropping it off the first day they start accepting them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Renewed Hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen These creeps will stop at nothing. I'll be dropping my completed ballot at the dropbox at my polling place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @latimes is trash. Pass it on...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Wha happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tify330 @Drea_got_rage @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump They are trying to make it look like he's doing something, anything, to distract from what an epic failure he is and the fact that #TrumpIsLosing because #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Oh. Is he trying to pretend that Obamacare hadn't already done that?🙄   The huge news is that you guys know that your base is stupid, and you have no problem taking advantage of it.  OBAMACARE IS MAJOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbinsmail @EmilyFravel13 @CCROZV @KatiePhang @RepSwalwell Send that scarecrow to the cornfield. I muted her butt-hurt idiocy an hour ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carville is right. People aren't working, so stopping payroll taxes does nothing. #Trump knows that saying that he's stopping a tax, any tax, works in his favor because his stupid base only hears "tax stopped" Doesn't matter if it helps them or not #TrumpFailsAmerica #trumpresser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @CNN carrying this Trump nonsense? Oh well, back to Joy @thereidout<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeffmason1 Press conference?🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWOSullivan @RepSwalwell 🤣🤣🤣 Who hurt you? Please find someone to give you a virtual hug cuz I think you need one. 🤣🤣🤣 I was JOKING! I would never put a 3-year-old in a man bun.

<|startoftext|>@EmilyFravel13 @robbinsmail @KatiePhang @RepSwalwell Is the Congressman's son neurodivergent or are you making this about yourself?  I threw a temper tantrum because my mother wouldn't buy me a lemon at the market. I didn't get the lemon and the donuts she was going to buy me went back on the shelf. I never demanded a lemon again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyFravel13 @robbinsmail @KatiePhang @RepSwalwell It was a self-righteous tirade. Better? My nephew was a model child. He never expected anything for following the rules. He's like this to this day and he is now a father himself. My parents didn't bribe me. I knew who ran things. The parenting you describe is how Karens are made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyFravel13 @robbinsmail @KatiePhang @RepSwalwell Was that attack really necessary? Kids these days are fragile af because the word "no" wrecks their entire world. Letting kids put a ransom on doing what they should is a bad idea. A haircut is like a bath. You WILL do it or toys will disappear. You don't get more for saying "no"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell I'm thinking a night time, he's dead asleep, home cut is what you're going to have to do. Maybe it will be so bad that he'll never turn down a professional cut again. Or perhaps a nice "man bun"? Or you can do what Kourtney Kardashian did...  https://t.co/q7fUlfneA3<|endoftext|>

He betta not do something stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB 72% THC!??!!! How tf are you even functioning? I would probably be in a paranoid panic, afraid that I had brain damage. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vorona93980654 @MSNBC Maybe they have a basement they can lock him in. That would be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump REINSTATED. These are not NEW jobs 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurtbardella @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump He definitely never took out a full page ad insisting that 5 innocent black and brown boys be executed, then refuse to apologize or acknowledge that they were exonerated. Trump is trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. And as an "official" black person, I can confirm that 99.9% of us were not offended by what Joe Biden said and it was in NO WAY "disparaging." Kanye and that pastor who used to be a pimp are the only ones likely to jump on that stupid bandwagon. @MSNBC needs to cut it out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NRA Is there an intelligent adult there who understands what words mean? Dissolving the organization has nothing to do with guns. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/un3wn2rMU2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB Were you on the text message he was going to send for people who responded to that fundraising email a couple of days ago? It said they would be told first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuncheeBurro @RealKHiveQueenB Gen X will show up for the liberals. Older folk are more conservative, but I think the fact that Joe is a devout Catholic and Trump has treated Latinos horribly may move a few. Older Millennials will likely show up too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuncheeBurro @RealKHiveQueenB Maybe older Catholics, but my Gen X and younger Catholic friends use birth control and aren't anti-choice like their parents and grandparents were.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaCooper @Vorona93980654 @RealKHiveQueenB True.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB What's the plan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden No worries Joe. We know you and we know what you meant. #WeKnowJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vorona93980654 @RealKHiveQueenB Others have taken their time, but this time it's stressing me out. Time to get people ready for battle. This pussy footing is exhausting the troops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB The article didn't give a lot of detail, but that clickbait headline is definitely trying to stress us all the fuck out😠 Girl, if this man don't just name Kamala already and quit messin' with my head, Imma lose it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB Oh shit! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB I was not pressed by the comment at all. It was a clumsy, but the truth is that most black folk were born here &amp; have a shared culture. Latinos in the US tend to come from different continents &amp; countries. Most speak Spanish, but not all. Many cultural differences as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJayapal How? Medicare for All wouldn't have made tests and PPE appear out of thin air 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TACP_TICK @akattorney @DonaldJTrumpJr The majority of black people are American and have never been to Africa. We tend to share a culture created here. Latinos in this country come from many different places like Mexico, Central &amp; South America, and the Caribbean and there are many cultural differences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akattorney @DonaldJTrumpJr He is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JungleGoldScott @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Nope. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You're an idiot. The Latino community in this country is made up of ppl from Mexico, Central &amp; South America and the Caribbean. They share a lot of culture, but there are lots of differences. The majority of black ppl in this country are from here. Black folk remain unbothered.  https://t.co/4kPIlt2ned<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli So your snack became a whole meal? Been there! 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB I like Kamala, Val and Keisha in that order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallen2010 @ProjectLincoln Yes. Please explain what  "we're last so that means we're first" means😳  https://t.co/ktHhHbAc1L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux I've run into a couple of those on my OG acct. When you disagree, they attack with stereotypes like: You don't know your father  Using ebonics  Accusing you of being "uneducated" They are just a bunch of angry idiots looking to bond with each other cuz they can't get laid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @Rosemarie4311 This is coming from someone who had a CEO who was shocked to see me as the new receptionist, then have him later tell my boss that I was "really good at my job. She doesn't even sound black!"🙄 *That's* why black folk give the side-eye to the "articulate" compliment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @Rosemarie4311 I try to explain this to white folk, and they REFUSE to get it. It should be a compliment, but it often comes off like shock and condescension. It's like men telling women (especially blondes) that they're "so intelligent." It may be true, but sometimes, it just sounds funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastorlocke @McAllisterDen Missing your tithes "pastor"? Anyone that needs a church or congregation to have a relationship with their god is a an even bigger fraud than you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're leaving? Sweet!!!😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Didn't see that coming! 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsTanbirC @RealKHiveQueenB Maybe you should have a Zoom party. I'm guessing no one would show. You strike me as a person with little human interaction due to poor and very weird social skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsTanbirC @RealKHiveQueenB Unlike you, she has actual friends and a sex life. You've got a crush on an old man who can't get his sexless, pimple covered dork squad to show up and vote for him. Good for you!👍🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad she called @MSNBC out. I'm so tired of the endless Trump coverage. Just like 2016, they are more concerned with ratings than whether this monster is in a position  to destroy the world. 🖕🏾  https://t.co/D7vJnNCop0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vertov @RealKHiveQueenB She's currently killing her competition, but there's only 1% reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB Maybe that's why I'm tired all the damn time lately! I'll be so glad when ALL this shit is over.  https://t.co/msiYdxujDb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB Yeah. She's an impressive woman but I don't want to be fucking exhausted again. Fighting about Susan with stupid people will wear me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB With all the people Trump has killed with this virus handling debacle, I can't believe they have the nerve, but they do. I'm not here for that drama either.  It has be Kamala. There are a couple others I can accept, but not Susan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB They want to Benghazi her to death. They are so obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wufi_DeSade @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump I've seen so many clips that I'm not even sure I need to watch it now. I hate hearing and seeing him so much that I may not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wufi_DeSade @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump I'm gonna watch it OnDemand later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep. You've completely lost it, Tiny. I don't know if you should take more or less meds though 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PJnmarie @SassyCanadianCk Dude, no! She cusses like a little kid who just discovered cuss words and isn't quite sure which ones go together. Her cuss word mixing skills are lacking! 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@exavierpope As a proud and practicing atheist, I don't at all agree with your initial point, but I'm still giving you props for that scorching! Perhaps the colonizer should look up the word "colloquialism"🤣  https://t.co/sXlIzDMtf8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@apex_ralph The fact that the world is watching this foolishness is horrifying! 🤣 Thanks for the support. I am one of millions who is looking forward to voting out the orange monstrosity currently terrorizing us all. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lifeofchaughnk @MicheleMarraiSA @borzou Sadly, it appears that an embarrassingly large number of people do not. They have watched too many celebrities be referred to as "stunning" and think the word means "really pretty" Fuckin-ay! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicheleMarraiSA @borzou It's now embarrassing to see how many people don't know that stunning is the same as shocking or what the context of word usage is. Good lord!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@habiturauhl @borzou Why don't people understand the context under which words are used? I'm fvcking stunned by this unbelievably intense explosion. My jaw literally dropped!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legsofbrass @borzou "stunning" is not always a positive thing. Horrible things can stun you. This stopped me in my tracks and made my jaw drop because I was "stunned" by the sight of this devastation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy. Fuckin'. Shit!!! Rarely does my jaw literally drop, but this was just unbelievable. Just horrifyingly terrible. I'm shaking. 😱😱😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux I think she saw him as a snot-nosed kid who was taking up oxygen that belonged to people who had earned their stripes. They all kinda treated him like an annoying child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump SEND BARRON TO SCHOOL!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namelocterry @SirEverValiant @mhrob @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 That’s really rough for kids. Not having a trusted tribe whether all the same or a mix makes for a not so enriching environment. I would check for some Meetup groups that might bridge the gap. I bet you’re not the only family wanting some diversity in the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn I still can't believe how not serious these people are about a job that is *the* most serious in the world. This dingbat is talking about tv ratings for Trump's ignorant ramblings when we're on track for 180K dead Americans by the end of the month. Ugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurtbardella @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH Nicolle is awesome! I step away from the computer for a break to watch her everyday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirEverValiant @mhrob @namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 I like Penasquitos and Rancho Bernardo though I never wanted to live that far inland. I mentioned the military bases because you may end up with neighbors who originally come from places that are not diverse, and they liked it that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB Send that broad packin'! I don't like her at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 Still not too many families in Hillcrest even after the La Jolla crowd started really gentrifying the area after the gay community cleaned it up. I'm surprised to hear that about Mira Mesa schools, but I haven't lived in SD in over 20 years so I'm sure some things have changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 Of those choices, I would have gone with Mira Mesa. The more "progressive" parts of San Diego are Kensington, North Park, Hillcrest and Mission Hills though Mission Hills is crazy expensive. As a woman living alone, I loved living in Hillcrest. Gay dudes made great neighbors 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 Yeah. Inland North County can be tricky. Vista is pretty red neck. San Marcos is only slightly better since the university was built, but it's still a little sketchy. Also close to a military base so you're gonna get some hicks from other parts of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShizzyHendrix @namelocterry @davenewworld_2 Sounds like a perfect plan to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShizzyHendrix @namelocterry @davenewworld_2 There is definitely Klan in places like Santee. There used to be a lot of skinheads too, but they were a bunch of punks who just pretending to be tough. Some Que-Dogs beat the shit out of a bunch of them once and they got a lot quieter. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhrob @namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 Oh, I know. I worked in La Mesa and lived in El Cajon for exactly a month. In that time I had two different trucks carrying old red necks scream n*gger at me as they drove by. Never had those problems in Mission Hills or La Jolla. Go figure?🤷🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Yep. The media is truly horrible at covering that creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 I'd put a big ass BLM banner on my garage door and have my daughter write it in glitter on the driveway. Let that fat old fuck come on my property trying to erase it. He'll wish he hadn't!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@namelocterry @ShizzyHendrix @davenewworld_2 San Diego is a military town so you get a mixed bag. It's more conservative than LA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 It was Kimberly Atkins. I don't know what poll she was looking at though. I know the KHive hates her, but I have always liked EW. I DO NOT support her for VP though, and I don't know any Black women who do. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BFIPodcast @lisakaysheppard @davenewworld_2 Interesting. Thanks for this info. I'm curious to learn more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFIPodcast @lisakaysheppard @davenewworld_2 I've read that Hitler had strong interest in the occult and the Nazis looked to many cultures for sources of supernatural power. These symbols were appropriated for the power they represented by evil people. I don't think the intent was to make the symbol evil, but here we are 😞<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Teesa_Michele Barack Obama for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Broadsword_6 @JohnParshon @theblaze @GovMurphy You are wasting your time with this fool.   He's more concerned with being a "rebel" than giving af about his fellow man.  He'd probably eat indoors at a restaurant cited for having vermin and rodents in the kitchen just to "own the libs" Send Mr. Gump on his way. He's useless!  https://t.co/FlOwbwJbGt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did any of this happen when he was Vice President?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze *aren't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze And his nonsensical EO about internet censorship is unconstitutional. No American has a right to social media account on any platform. Twitter can shut us both down in the next 5 minutes and there's NOTHING we can do to force them to reinstate us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze Those selfish a-holes are being denied any constitutional freedoms. Why are you so against doing something in the public interest? Why is protecting your fellow citizens so infuriating to you? You probably call yourself a "Christian" too. I'm sure this is what Jesus would do🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze @GovMurphy An EO is an EO. Never called it a law. But again, the MAGA crowd cheers whenever Dump signs one.  At this point, the city should just shut them the fuck down permanently! The same way filthy restaurants are when they don't comply with ordinances in support of public health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattytwo2 @theblaze What the fvck is a "metal statis"? You clearly AREN'T an intelligent person so save such questions for someone who is. At least I've won a Spelling Bee. 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattytwo2 @theblaze  https://t.co/JvR5v8c4P5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze @GovMurphy Well then they should take their grievance to the Supreme Court and let them work it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze But y'all looooove executive orders when the Orange Asshat signs them. A governor is the chief executive of their state. They can enforce rules via EO just like Dump does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g67preston1 @theblaze I'm sure you're jealous you weren't invited, but you're a broke nobody so why would you have been?  Don't come on my tl with this nonsense. #PedoEnvy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze @GovMurphy Seriously. WTF is wrong with y'all? Why is trying to protect citizens from a deadly virus so offensive? Unfortunately, all of you ridiculous, hard-headed ppl aren't the only ones that will get it because of your foolishness. You ppl are just ignorant and awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich Do we think he's setting up his only chance at a dignified exit? A heart problem or something that requires resignation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnParshon @Broadsword_6 @theblaze The executive order signed by the governor calling for a shutdown of all nonessential businesses. He's well within his rights which is why they were arrested for violating the order. Their landlord should terminate their lease and the city pull their license.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk  https://t.co/6vhlupzgHx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SantasTavern @theblaze Rules regarding a public health crisis probably not illegal. They control which businesses can operate in the city. If they don't want to follow the rules. Pull their license and toss their sorry asses in jail if they attempt to operate illegally. Apply some huge fines too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrioticBadger @theblaze Nope. These are commercial, not residential tenants. City can shut them down by pulling their license all together if they want to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maryannejersey @theblaze Stealing utilities is illegal. What are they gonna do? Move out all of the electric equipment and replace it with manual equipment? May as well work out at home, take a walk or run. King Trump 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantasTavern @theblaze Not illegal if the city gave the order. They don't have to grant them a business permit either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaizyChains @theblaze Won't that just send them to the streets where there are lights and running water? Good plan, girl genius.😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff I asked the same thing, it seems the crazy orange one tweeted “There’s a cure for COVID. America wake up!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NairBobby @DavidOAtkins @Acyn Holy shit! He’s so dangerous. Thanks for the info. I didn’t see that nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitSprings @JohnathanPerk Here’s a good list to get you started.  https://t.co/nuX0mVFPTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwedishNewFish @RealKHiveQueenB @JuneSummer1 We’re stuck in the Groundhog Day from hell! 😫😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitSprings @JohnathanPerk You’re welcome 😊 A friend of mine who has the same concern as you curated a reading list. I’ll get it and share it with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwedishNewFish @RealKHiveQueenB @JuneSummer1 You missed nothing. All the same crap will happen again tomorrow. No need to catch up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidOAtkins @Acyn Which tweet got removed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitSprings @JohnathanPerk I totally understand. It’s a lot of work and a lot of ppl just want an easy solution. Best directions I can give you is to seek knowledge and listen to poc when they share their experiences. Don’t get defensive or say “not me” That’s the quickest way to make a poc shut down. 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitSprings @JohnathanPerk I would recommend starting with a variety of books written by black authors. Writings by black intellectuals like W.E.B DuBois, Langston Hughes, and Frederick Douglass to get an understanding of the black psyche beyond documentaries produced by white ppl for a white audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitSprings @JohnathanPerk I appreciate that Kit, and I have spent a lot of time trying to help white friends figure it out, but some very smart ppl have helped me understand that’s not my job. The fact that black ppl are still a mystery to whites after 400 years in this country is one y’all have to solve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk I get so tired of the "why am I being left out?" whining. That "good trouble" came out of necessity because black people were being brutalized.

<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk I'm still trying to put my finger on it, but I'm getting the feeling that the "white folk" part has something to do with it.🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer This is just sad, and a cautionary tale about what seeking the limelight when your hands are extra dirty will get you. This dude graduated 1st in his law school class.

What is wrong with enforcing truancy laws? When I was in HS, it was definitely a deterrent from skipping school. Also, it affects the funding that schools receive from the state, which hurts already struggling areas the most.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PandaGetsHangry @skb_sara @HKrassenstein @AJLovesUSA It's *an English troll!   You probably think that "gooder" and "funner" are actual words.  Looks like some white people need to learn English so they can use it.  😂😂😂  https://t.co/he0U4d7EBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@strataharmony @Nikki_Cush @MarkTJay3 @skb_sara @HKrassenstein @PandaGetsHangry @AJLovesUSA So you admit that he *can* complete a coherent sentence? Unlike Sir Slurs A lot. But at least he can identify an elephant when he sees one. 😂😂😂  https://t.co/iTNw5yS0xs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 Yeah. It will take a few days. Funny enough, mine popped back into place when my arm was relaxed and I wasn't thinking about it. Your muscles are really tight right now bc it had to hold that funky position all night. Hope it corrects itself soon. I know that pain an it sucks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 I've woken up with a painful, stiff shoulder. It was definitely the result of sleeping on it in a funky position. I stretched and try to wind my arm around (like a softball pitcher) to knock it back into place. Then one day it just popped and felt normal again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiltonFang @davenewworld_2 No. That's why they have an intercom system that allows you to buzz people in. I ordered in a lot after having surgery and I could not physically go down to meet a delivery driver. Luckily, my neighbors aren't racist, busybody assholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC I think they're trolling him with how ridiculous he looks describing this nearly impossible to "pass" test that he "aced". It's getting old though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelharriot Why are you hatin' on the Oxford comma? It's so cute!😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica @boogieordie Unfortunately, that's exactly the optics that Trump wants the country to see. A bunch of rowdy, angry black folk "attacking" the police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk @DirtScienceRx Nope. He was getting what he wanted no matter what.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blackwomenviews Hmmm...Very wrong.  I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt that he means 'so overtly racist that he's openly trying to stoke a race war' cuz this is too bananas for me to function normally otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maxrah10 @Sean_Fox_ @AndyOstroy Then he should post it as "do you want the US to become like Serbia?" It's just dishonest as presented now and it's not necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @AshaRangappa_ @RadioFreeTom @waltshaub I've seen this posted a few times and I suspected that this was not in the US.

<|startoftext|>@ConcerndBassist @janegruppalli @AdamParkhomenko She died a few years ago, but she apologized for this behavior and was pretty mortified by what she saw in herself. I still find myself screaming "DARK SIDED" every now and again though. Lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TX_WalkerRanger Probably. Aren't y'all all about "we go all"?  Anyhoo, I asked direct questions. If you don't have the answers, especially because you don't agree, all you had to do was say you don't believe the JFK Jr. stuff or mass arrests of certain people going to Guantanamo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TX_WalkerRanger @HillaryClinton A lot of people in the QAnon universe have. @TheRickWilson has been bound for Guantanamo a dozen times. When is this reckoning coming for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TX_WalkerRanger @HillaryClinton Wasn't she and a bunch of others supposed to "go to JAIL" at least 10 times by now?  Where is JFK Jr.? I thought he was "coming back" on 7/16?  Y'all kooks need to stop making predictions cuz you REALLY suck at it. 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DLoesch Last time I checked, Kanye has never carried a baby so he certainly wasn’t aborting one. Kim Kardashian is a very wealthy woman in her own right and fully capable of making that decision and providing for how ever many children she chose to have. He’s full of crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SolunaRain @FredTJoseph When I was between jobs, I was able to get my Well Woman checkup and 6 months of bc pills for $20. PP provides a great service for men and women who don’t have the means to pay for expensive doctors’ appointments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody out there who is seriously thinking about voting for Kanye West ought to be ashamed of themselves. That man is not well. Encouraging him to keep doing this to himself is selfish and abusive. This is no longer funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Pretty much any place that's not 74% white is gonna push back. Hollywood won't put up with that nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnathanPerk Exactly! They want chaos not an actual fight. The 'hood will fight back and they know it. Fvckin' punks! 😠<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iPunkinPie27 @notcapnamerica Heck yeah! I buy all the tastiness I usually wait for movies to come out on cable. If it's something I really want to see, I might do $5.99 OnDemand. Those sky-high concessions are so that the theaters don't go bankrupt for licensing those movies. They make little on film itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica I'm not paying $20 to watch a movie in my own house. It doesn't even cost that much at the theater and they have a killer sound system.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lindquistcait @FeminemiIy It's good. You can watch it on Amazon Prime. She's very raw and honest. I don't think the way she's been treated is fair, but she does take responsibility for her part. She was a young adult. We all did regrettable stuff at 22.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindquistcait @FeminemiIy She said they flirted and that's why she showed him her thong as a green light. Did you watch her documentary?

<|startoftext|>💔😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMZ It probably is her, but as usual, TMZ wants to be "first" so they decide to confirm on their own. Fvcking ghouls!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyAlbright @Higgs_Boson46 But they WANT to believe her. Even if she confessed to making it all up, they would say she was forced to do it. They are horrible people who don't care at all about her. It's all about smearing Joe Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyAlbright Those ghouls know that all it takes is putting crap like that out in the universe.  Why would U of Delaware even have that? Are they that stupid? Don't they know that Pedo Jeff kept records like that and the FBI has it?  I hate them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wickedirishmn @RealKHiveQueenB He's so icky. Some of my finest roasting of a Berner was him. Unfortunately, that account was murdered last week so I can't re-read them. He finally blocked me after weeks of 3rd degree burns 🤣 Glad he's been exposed for the creep I told him I knew he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAgStone Stop trying to groom teenagers!  https://t.co/9z3QWZIkMI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestMyTether @lauraklein113 I'm sorry that you guys had to deal with that. Especially from some self-righteous dork.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB That creepy little weirdo is a predator. His manipulation in those DMs were textbook creep. He knew exactly what he was doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauraklein113 Haha! He blocked me a couple of months ago after I called him a sexless weirdo. I knew he was a creep. He just looks like one. I could also tell he was projecting with his faux outrage about Biden. That was just bait to go after young girls apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beezeebeezeebee She was pretty, but her eyebrows were shit then too. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@authorLizStone Do it! Lol This is my backup. My other one got murdered. Hope you'll follow me here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica There's a whole page of thicc booty boys and I'm just finding out about it? I'm slippin'!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#JoeBiden is going to have to come into office and make undoing all of the horrible things that Trump did a top priority  the way that Trump made a priority of undoing all the great things #PresidentObama did. I think he can do it! #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyAlbright Some never learn🤦🏾‍♀️  https://t.co/seDRwhtClg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyAlbright I think they want her to impeach Barr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Enough about golf. Let's talk about Mary's book and page 65 where she confirms that you can't control your bowels so you sit around in your own shit. You're even grosser than I thought 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This creep lies with such ease, and the sheep eat it up and never call him out on his verifiable lies. We gotta get him out of our house! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #Biden2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica @CaslerNoel has been saying this for years. Looks like he was telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist  https://t.co/V0WqHxcBho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux Wow! That's odious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosemcgowan @realDonaldTrump Why don't you give her half of the $100K took from Harvey Weinstein to keep you from warning other women about him? Think of how many women you could have saved from him if you hadn't taken the money and ran? #shameful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lappos They're never sorry until they get caught. Girl bye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica This is the worst gay porn I've ever seen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq He finally shows up to the party and y'all act like he learned to speak in complete sentences or something.  https://t.co/LwVTjAnANr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you hallucinating, Tiny or are your people spoon feeding you nonsense again? #TrumpIsLosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyAlbright Good grief! These idiots are relentless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist Yes! Poetic justice 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DNCWarRoom He must instruct these creeps to lay on the praise when he does this stuff. It's so inorganic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePhang @kurtbardella These people are pathetic. It also proves that if Trump had behaved like a president, more people would have worn masks and fewer people would have been assaulted in Costco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lappos @RealKHiveQueenB @DailyLibber @purpleragu Is she really suggesting that poc's preference is Liz? 🤔 Not any that I know, and I'm just going to assume that I know more poc than she does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trumpanhator2 *He* called someone white trash? Oh, the irony 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis I just can't feel bad for these people. I do feel bad for anyone who came in contact with him and was trying to do the right things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby @Stop_Trump20 I sure hope so.  In the meantime, can I get a re-follow on my backup account I'm building? Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica I don't want to retweet it. That's fvcking gross! 🤢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SusieTipton1 I most certainly do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshNBCNews And you can still tell that he's scowling 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for all the follows ❤ I'm slowly climbing back. Can someone retweet this and help a fellow #resister get to 500? I follow back. #VoteOutTheGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morninggloria It always boggles my mind at how not superior the people who claim to be actually are. They are usually beyond basic in every way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux I don't like him either! I asked @MSNBC the other day why did they make him the go-to Black dude? He's on morning, noon, and sometimes at night. Ugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josecanyousee Not cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptMarkKelly @zookeeper125 You're the coolest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReesusP Wow! These bigots are repulsive. I hope there aren't a lot of Latinx folk who want to be associated with this garbage. #Biden2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica Chris, why are you not following me back? You like my comments on all your "booty meat" videos😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Sally. They got me. Can I get a re-follow on my backup?Thanks! @SallyAlbright<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yagoskidmark @flyaway_k I can feel the fierce energy.😀 Thanks and followed back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dleisert Thanks! I love beagles. Followed back 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Morning old and new friends! Thanks so much for all the follows. I'll be following you all back as soon as I finish making my coffee. Have a fantastic Saturday! #Resist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica Ooh! Baby got a thicc azz! Just the way I like it 🤤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeNME12 Roid rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist Take care of you. We're not going anywhere.  https://t.co/tOa2DROWEX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FeminemiIy @lindquistcait I guess I read it wrong. It sounded to me like Clinton was a predator that created a situation that she couldn't say no to. My point was that the situation was created by Monica since she initiated things so he would have had to reject her. Breaking things off? I don't know 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FeminemiIy @lindquistcait No. You didn't. Again, those are words that she used about herself. I only pointed out that she herself said that she initiated things. Whether she thought later that she could or even wanted to end it, I don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindquistcait @FeminemiIy Vili was a child. Even if he had a crush that was just a gross situation.  Yes. There's a power imbalance, but I was just pointing out that she said that she made the first move. I've been infatuated with a boss who I eventually dated him so I could relate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FeminemiIy @lindquistcait But she's said many times that she initiated the affair. I watched her tell Barbara Walters that she lifted up her skirt to show him her thong to let him know she was interested. I think the woman was horribly mistreated by the press, but she says that she wasn't his victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard *you're<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard She got off easy. Spit on me and your getting a flurry of closed fists! She would have passed out for real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unseen_Shield @madeleinerivera Yeah, I'm sure you love integration and you're super offended by this. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetroitSteel_ He wouldn't have been able kneel or stand up without help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@800money And he says it like it's a good thing. That man is an imbecile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Translation: This was going to be more embarrassing than Tulsa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica What "language" was that written in? Good Lord!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux The criminality of these creeps knows no bounds. I pray that karma is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Sasha! The Berners got me and this is my other account. Can I get a follow back? Thanks! @SashaBeauloux<|endoftext|>
