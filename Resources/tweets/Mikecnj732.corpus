<|startoftext|>@TheClosedFist It was awlful.  The AEW CHANTS were deserved lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PedroPaddy He’s like the guy from the 80s and 90s. Vladimir the superfan... we have to find out who this dude is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who’s the guy 1st row center two nights in a row AND he always has that seat at PPVs ???  Tonight he has the tan hat and a goatee #RAWAfterMania #wwe #wweraw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsIzzyMania It was just very flat.  Maybe it was the length of the show and the crowd was just exausted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsIzzyMania I thought a lot of the endings were awkward.  I agree with you the end was a wierd finish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKellyKlein You were awesome and killed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKellyKlein you really kicked ass at the G1!  I loved your match and became an instant fan!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamjohnpollock Amazing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@travisbrowneMMA you da man!  Nice job taking care of @BretHart at the #WWEHOF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ringofhonor REALLY BAD FORM to do this run in at #G1SuperCard.  It left all this in attendance wondering what the hell happened and took away from most of the Tanahashi match.  #BustedOpenNation   Thoughts? @BustedOpenRadio #NJPW @njpwglobal @njpwworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it me or is the #wwehof2019 #legacy group just sad??  I mean there are some guys there that should have been given their spotlight.  #wahoomcdaniel #brusierbrody #sdjones<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carlruiz I say 3 because of the many snowflakes out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carlruiz Most people want a good 3 but many ‘spice lords’ love a solid 8 on the Scoville scale.  In your case people would want it to enhance and not take away the flavor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannonSharpe Bullshit!!   And why did they shoot at all.  WhT happens to the Autistic man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THETOMMYDREAMER So sad to hear this news<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Uber_Support Why is it since your service fee being added do I need to provide drivers with almost turn by turn directions?? Aren’t you providing them with nav? This is consistent with multiple orders.  Raise the fee and less services? Doesn’t seem fair @UberEats<|endoftext|>
