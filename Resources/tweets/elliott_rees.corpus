<|startoftext|>@SPARRY1425 @air_ambulance @EmrtsWales Night vision goggles and a very powerful searchlight. Also we recon sites with applications like airbox and google maps to identify landing sites before we lift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A 12 hour night shift and privilege are not two words I would routinely associate. But tonight is an exception.

<|startoftext|>@ozzati37 Nope. 500mg in two sites. Bioavailability seems to be pretty good IM. They can always have a top up if need be via the infusion once access has been obtained.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Superb paper featured in the @TheResusRoom from @BJAJournals.

<|startoftext|>Strong work @JoeBiden.   And now the real tantrum starts. 👀  https://t.co/ZHZanZUDaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m just going to leave this here...it has aged very, very well 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChippyLyn @huwbbc I might have to give it a go. The sky news reporters are keeping very neutral but you can tell they think he’s lost the fucking plot. The best bit is when they interview trump supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PBSherren Unsettling though it is, it’s very entertaining watching him unsystematically dismantle himself in front of the world media while @JoeBiden bides his time 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChippyLyn I’ve had sky news on continuously for 2 days in the house. I have to watch the press conference he gives after he finds out he’s lost it all. Fuck knows what he’ll do. But I expect it’ll be outstanding 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChippyLyn It wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t actually giving these speeches from the White House. Can you fucking imagine that happening in the UK 😂🤣😂. “Those vote counters in Croydon, not honest, you need honesty, to count votes, in Croydon, legal votes, not mail votes” 😂 Wanker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF was that? 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>STOP THE TWEETS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredibly surprised to see this f*cker piping up 👀.....thought you’d be keeping a low profile given that last time we saw you, you were preparing to be fellated by a “15 year old girl” in front of a hidden camera 👀 @BoratSagdiyev #borat #rudygiuliani  https://t.co/iaIRFWHCJJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict a riot #USAElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshGasDoc PPE is very flattering .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump declaring his suspicions over the disproportionate amount of postal votes for #Biden. I expect that’s because Biden supporters aren’t f*cking dense enough to attend a mass gathering in a pandemic and have elected to #StayHomeSaveLives #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simultaneously declaring both that you have already won an election before all of the votes have been counted, but also the election is “a major fraud on our nation” - quite nicely demonstrates the cognitive calibre of @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drtmr It’s unbearably close. I’m genuinely intrigued to see how trump reacts if he loses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very Borat-esque 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giles_gary @EmrtsWales @WelshAmbulance Thanks for having us! Feels like only yesterday I was sitting in that classroom with you teaching our driving course 😂 what a fun filled 3 weeks that was 😂 gaaass gas gas gas 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great day teaching traumatic arrest management and Post-ROSC care on behalf of @EmrtsWales / to a cohort of new @WelshAmbulance paramedics in their induction. I don’t have a voice any more as a result of constant shouting, one of the drawbacks of a socially distanced classroom 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I miss something or has the national lockdown be lifted for tonight? Kids in groups of 7-10 wandering around going door to door. What the actual f*ck. 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a fairly standard @EmrtsWales selection day simulation 🤣😂 @JonesTheBosher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish my ability to spontaneously awake at the crack of dawn and be unable to get back to sleep was as prevalent for the days I’m working day shifts.....and not nights 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pilotlight172 This is my new favourite Gif<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 You can’t be spouting shit like “we need to stand up for our rights and overthrow the WAG, they’ve got too much control over us”. And then moan about a government letting the virus get out of control 😂. If you’re not part of the solution - you’re a big part of the problem..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/2 One thing the last couple of weeks have taught me is that many many adults with access to social media have child-like brains. The very people with #supporttheNHS profile pictures etc are up in arms about not being able to go to the pub / get their nails done for 17 days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@derwynjones81 @carlhudson2 Iawn ***t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted I can’t do @MovemberUK . Sadly the need to wear an FFP3 will prevent this. It has nothing to do with the fact that despite being 27, all previous attempts to grow any significant facial hair have left me looking like I have some sort of horrific hormone derangement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrChrisHingston But we won’t be able to carry extra propofol with the additional weight of a malinois 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrChrisHingston Definitely a case for this in prehospital care, more for staff than the patients 😂. Can wait for a day where I pull a miniature daschund out of the retrieval bag .. 🐶 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drtmr I have a vague suspicion trump is gong to get re-elected 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KangarooBeach It would definitely have its ups and downs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanHurll @WelshParaMedic In what scenario?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll take 6 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic The trick is to gain parents consent and do it before child realises what has happened. If they’re coherent enough to decide let you stick something up their nose but go near them needle they probably weren’t that distressed to begin with 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic Agreed. Oramorph would be a lot safer and other trusts seem to like it. Kids who are completely inconsolable with severe pain / injury ive historically used IM morphine to gain some control. V. high threshold for doing this though. Last time was for a 2 year old w. bendy femur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic Yes, this would just mean they get the drugs quicker - without the paramedic making the decision in isolation. Drug interactions etc to consider too etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic Not sure about fentanyl. Despite the fact legislation wouldn’t need to be changed. A lot of people think it’s just a fast acting morphine - it’s not. Can cause severe cardiovascular collapse in certain patient groups especially in extremes of physiology if your unfamiliar with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic Could see a case for carrying some of them, particularly the antibiotics - with the caviat that an ACP or GP actually makes the prescription as microbiology can be quite complex and guidelines change frequently with lots of considerations to be had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_andy_pandy_ Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_andy_pandy_ The extensions or the Masters? Let me know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoroughly enjoying reading the opinions of the royal college of bystanders on social media and their highly informed views on how the pandemic should be managed.

<|startoftext|>@whelanjp @Keenleigh999 @benWAST Really? @whelanjp 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whelanjp @Keenleigh999 @benWAST Or as above....having CPR whilst the tube is going down 🦠 💨 😷 ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keenleigh999 @benWAST @whelanjp Indeed.......probably also worth considering that these patients in study are paralysed when they’re tubed so unlikely to cough...unlike ours that are having some “heavy chest physio at 120bpm ” - when we tube them...so not sure it’ll impact intra-arrest practice..😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting @Keenleigh999 @benWAST @whelanjp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP EVH 🎸 😔 🤘🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thanks to @SwanseaPHEMS for inviting me on to talk at the virtual pre-hospital and emergency medicine conference today. Very well organised event given the COVID restrictions. Thoroughly enjoyed the other talks too in the background whilst I finished my presentation 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshParaMedic Interestingly nasal cannula actually work by filling the dead space in the airways with oxygen and thus displacing other gases. If your patient breathes through their mouth - they still get the benefit of it. It’s why we put nasal cannula on people during an RSI induction 💉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LowriSeren @iamcardib I can’t wait for my next airway viva. “Dat dangly ting, right at the back of my throat!”  ....the uvula?... 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrDavidRouse @ncl_medic I totally agree....but we are expected to withhold an aspect of clinical management for the presentation under the guise that it is potentially occurring - just think it’s interesting..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDavidRouse @ncl_medic 2/2 - I just thought the term “cardiogenic shock” as an absolute contraindication with no definition of what that actually means at face value to a pre-hospital. I agree - very vague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDavidRouse @ncl_medic I’d agree as a general definition. But how is that quantified prehospitally? Ventricular dysfunction to the point where systemic “shock” occurs is a very arbitrary thing with true cardiogenic shock at one end and clinically undifferentiated “heart failure” at the other 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting update.....at what point does severe LVF stop being severe LVF and start becoming cardiogenic shock?  https://t.co/4PO6B2vDWi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waharrison Agreed, just stopping them from trashing around so you can manage their airway and breathing. Fact remains. Outcome will b same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison would you administer midazolam to a patient in status epilepticus? (Note dose is higher). What would you do if they lost airway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison our hart team use ketamine, not CCPs. As did our hems before they were CCPs. My turn to ask a question...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison what about the contributors from every uk ambulance service? Do they also not know what paramedics do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison I may be mistaken, but I was working on the assumption the association of ambulance chief executives knew what paramedics did...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison it's obviously come from somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison I'm fairly sure the Royal colleges didn't add it because they fancied a laugh. I'm sure there's probably evidence supporting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison that's not what it's indicated for, the patients receiving this are already losing A+B. Its to prevent it becoming permanent..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison not as a life saving intervention in the prehospital environment to facilitate the maintenance of a patent airway in the field..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison in that context yes, but that's to facilitate another procedure. Reducing dislocation for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waharrison I can't speak on behalf of other trusts, but on my patch every ems resource carries a minimum of 1 device capable of ETCO2<|endoftext|>
