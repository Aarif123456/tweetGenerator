<|startoftext|>@TheCleftonTwain LOL- I think I have the writing part down.  As an introvert, however, social media is a mystery to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRafieyan I suppose it all depends on the relationship. However, if sexy texts are something you keep secret from your bf- the answer is YES.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheCleftonTwain Without a doubt,it feels like a full-time stress monster of a job. I have over 2k follows on this platform &amp; am lucky to get any engagement on the content I post no matter what I do. üò± Social media related to my job is probably the most anxiety-ridden aspect of my life at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCleftonTwain I love writing. Nothing can take away from that part of the process for me. But, I'll admit having to find a voice to build social media platforms in a digital landscape where no one seems to give a fuck can be soul-crushing at times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrDBerger Speaking as an introvert and someone w/ massive social anxieties. It's good advice. It isn't easy.  But if what you're currently doing isn't working, mixing things up a bit might result in a different outcome. Some times stepping outside our comfort zone is the best way to grow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tylorkunkle Thanks.üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennamoreci The first two episodes drew me in, but it quickly unraveled with all of the unmarked and confusing jumping around, weakening aspects of the storytelling imo.  Henry Cavil is sexy, but the character was just that, nice to look at and perhaps good at killing shit. Otherwise, meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hanako is a humorous teenage girl, with a taste for adventure. She has always longed for more than the mundane until the day she was bestowed the sacred bow of Artemis and her destiny began to unfold.  https://t.co/oXCC42yXjt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lscott__ He looks like a twinky Henry Cavil in some of those clips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B0SSED1 @ABC Probably wouldn't do a lot of good when the man's ears are completely shut to the truth. He doesn't even think climate change is real.  At one point he called it a Chinese hoax. I wouldn't waste my breath either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Writing my first book was a lot of fun, however trying to edit everything on my own is overwhelming at times. I wish I had some guidance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read that agents don't like prologues, although I've seen a lot of books that have them. Are prologues a thing of the past? lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A HUGE part of writing a book is rewriting.. *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Writing a book is a journey of creativity, joy and doubt. But most of all, EDITING! lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe I have amazing, heartbreaking and fun stories to tell, I hope someday someone will want to listen to them. :) #Determination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScrivenerCoach  Very true.A lot of great writers were  told no many times,before they got that one YES, which set everything into motion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>37 followers!, I'm officially famous in my own mind, haha kidding. Have a great day everyone. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another day of writing.I hope an agent will see the potential in my manuscript. It's tough,but I have to let the struggle make me stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justpublishing Great article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11:11 - My wish is for an agent to love my books and get me published,lol :) I need to share my stories and my literary passion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JensenAckles Hottie! ~ I cant wait for the season 10 to begin tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankieJGrande LOL So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveLeBel This sounds like a very fun read, I think I will check it out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm almost done outlining my new book.#Happy. I can't see myself doing anything else with my life. Being a writer is my true passion. #Hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Transcico u can speak ur mind&amp;you can attempt to educate them,but ultimately, it's up to them what they do with it that given information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Transcico re;serial killers,No.u probably can't force some1 2 change who is mentally ill, without empathy and crazy, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Transcico Serial killers?smh.Where did that come from?lol.I think you are grasping at straws now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supricky06 LOL..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Transcico u can't force someone to change their mind,or ways if they don't want to.True change has to come from within,it can't be forced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never offer someone ur kindness because u expect it to be returned.Do it because it's in your heart, and w/o the expectation of reward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ranceypants @lindsaysherer Zankie! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankieJGrande Cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Transcico @supricky06  Yelling puts someone on the defense, and when they are in that place,it makes them less likely to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supricky06  I know this feeling.I've tried to speak from my heart and it fell on deaf ears.But I spoke my mind and then I left it alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckSambuchino @WritersDigest I've learned that doubt will always be part of the creative process,However,my passion is stronger than it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankieJGrande Super cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankieJGrande Hello! :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wish I had someone w/experience to read my work and give me honest feedback. No luck with agents so far. But I wont give up! #Hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Derek_Haines @justpublishing Excellent advice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting a book published is far more difficult than writing it, lol. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankieJGrande super cute. &lt;3 Zankie and Ari.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Believe in your dreams, even when no one else seems to; only your heart can keep them alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supricky06 @sampepper That whole tweet that he typed is bullshit.  But whatever, let's not give people like this attention?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@supricky06 My wish; is for you to be able to express yourself on the Ellen show! And to find an entertaining use for those 1k condoms,LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a writer, I find characters who are flawed more interesting to write.Perfection is boring, and leaves no room for a journey of growth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateyGabrielle @PaulJolleyMusic Stunning picture. So handsome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulJolleyMusic Are there any music videos planned for any of your future singles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It isn't always easy, but never give up on yourself or your dreams.The struggle is what makes us stronger in the end.  http://t.co/jB67cHOJQZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At what point does someone become too "famous" to reply to the people who made them famous? lol..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulJolleyMusic I really enjoyed the song "Given you" when I saw you perform it Paul! Great lyrics and vocals.I'm so buying these songs! xo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Inspiration. I'm working on another book series, as I research more agents and wait on replies from my current submissions. #Hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H_Combs That is pretty sad, our country often fails to take care of our own, yet we go out and play world police to save everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to find my way...  http://t.co/x3npJZB2CX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupDaily06 We all need to vent from time to time, although not everyone is lucky enough to have someone listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supricky06 I wish people could genuinely connect with each other more than just the internet, and to see someone's heart vs a screen name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never let any1 make you think that you aren't worthy,because they are simply blind 2 the beauty of your best qualities. #Believe in yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish more people had the courage&amp; heart to simply reach out to someone else. We all need to feel accepted and understood on some level.<|endoftext|>
