<|startoftext|>@ImSpeaking13 Down.  Knives down. Spoons up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bless you, Beth Moore!  May you be secure in the knowledge that the words the trumpists will now hurl at you only prove your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich Wait? Are you saying when people can vote with equal ease Democrats win?  So suppression is your preferred method of winning?   Damn, thanks for confirming what we all believed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harry Styles wore it better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany imagine a brown child this age taken away from parents and locked in a cage.  You are a part of this #trumpLegacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano For clarity, I was telling them to GTFO, not you. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano Let's get an amazing Dem lined up to humiliate her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano GTFOH   I don't every want to see the *rump name here again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyk1827 @StevenTDennis In other words, shut downs have to be complete.  Weak links abounded.  Better ways to secure food and needs through curbside and delivery along with strong government financial support so people can stay home and housed. #TrumpFailed to lead and here we are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So much so.  #trumpisirrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan You know, it's actually true.  I haven't cared one lick about his tweets. I don't follow, I don't look and even retweeted screen shots barely register.   #WeAreOverYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar And when we had the millions and millions in the Women's March they jeered us.  And here they are delusionally fighting for the 56x loser with no self awareness whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScientistSwanda @Rich3Dawg Well done!   What is the likelihood, concern, falsehood, that this could go awry and cause autoimmune issues?  Which other current widespread vaccines use this biotech and what have we seen longterm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregMolidor I believe the appropriate cartoon prop would be an anvil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k It's a very frightening thought.  But I had this fear for Obama too.  We have an amazing Secret Service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davideisaacson @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Exactly.  He wouldn't have his seat if it wasn't for the abhorrant district lines and disenfranchisement.  NY AG should sue!!  It's their right, or something...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Seditious MFers.  Don't even try to spin it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImSpeaking13 I rarely use drive thru now, but curbside pick up I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briteyes4u @JourneyMeasured @CalebJHull Yours is a phony account that promotes lies.   Anyone who can read knows that's not how this crime happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull You are literally LYING about Brandon Bernard's part in the crime.  That's NOT what happened and that's not even what he was convicted of.  Jesus, seek help and meds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Covid_Drumpf @LabyrinthWeaver @realDonaldTrump @Twitter No this is his official PRESIDENTIAL account.  That was decided within a few months of his term.  He can't block people, he is accountable here.  Not a personal account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is literally killing people to own the Catholic Christian President-elect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis My husband has been noting that it's becoming more acceptible to be more "evening" and going out attire.  Fashion model instead of business.  Part of me likes it, part of me thinks it's to diminish women as serious professionals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @CNN How can you still be surprised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence Oh, now votes count?  Make up your mind.  Is it only white republican votes? That's what it sounds like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vrijmetselaar56 @mmpadellan @Bajagirl2 Paxton wants a pardon.  The others are in rabid cult country and don't want to be primaried in 2 years.  They know it will lose, but they save face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vrijmetselaar56 Hat tip to the educated verified folks I learned it from on Twitter today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any of us could have writte this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mwilsonua @SeattleSusieQ @TravisAllen02 Not silly, I was just about to ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vrijmetselaar56 They did NOT file a lawsuit.  One AG did.  TX Ken Paxton.  Looking for a pardon.  The rest filed amicus briefs.  Basically to cover their cultness from primarying.  It's not the same as filing buy any stretch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pacifickisslive @DavidBegnaud @feddeathinmates @realDonaldTrump HA, he wants to put people in front of a firing squad.  HE gets off on this crap.  Ultimate bully and coward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesignationSix We did.  We cut satellite tv too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottinankeny @Kris_Sacrebleu Well, that's in line with the true weakness of today's GOP.  No backbone to call trump and the cults BS to the carpet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews No, he will allow them to investigate and find nothing, because it's bs.  Who do you think he is, the corrupt trumpian gop cult?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YUM!!  This popcorn is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Texan_21C @CathyTX @mjs_DC Ha, as if.  When in the last 40 years has the press helped democracy?  Sales, hits, ad revenue, control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@althea89157 @Dknight10k Good sir?  Oh, just gag.  That's so disgusting. There's some deep psychology happening in this letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leslsenior Straight to Russia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity We've grown wearing of GOP spin.  It's over.  Rebuild your party into something sane.  Mitch, McCarthy, Graham, Nunes and Gaetz have tainted the brand forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts @NRA Don't be so sure.  One thing this twisted party is all about is voting in unison despite the bickering.  They hate dems more than any issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGJackBrown No, they did not "join".  They just said "Oh, that's a good idea we support it".  That's VERY different than joining the lawsuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyTurNBC Where's the lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure I can definitely do Canada, only some of Mexico, but I suck at African countries.  Trying to do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount He's trying to be fit healthy Biden.  Biden's got 20 years on him and is still more fit.  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity You keep telling us HE's the president, so yeah, buck stops there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mar_a_Hell_No Maybe he will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickSvitek It looked likely?  He got 7M more votes and 306 EC.  Enough with this BS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ResisterForever Is it OUR artwork?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC He will see his infamy as a net positive.  For him it's all about attention.  And a title Man of the Year is seriously what he lives for, even if it's for negligent homicide and cruelty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Unless you mean South Shore and south Staten Island I'm going to say you are way off the mark.  My racist ignorant cousins are all on board with #FascistTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmsexton_ He's really determined to destroy the US before he "goes".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Biden in the White House, Potential to take Senate, Vaccine on the Horizon, and the cool people I follow on Twitter!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who would you cry over if they blocked you?  Top 3.  Me:  @TeaPainUSA (I laugh daily and he keeps me sane) @aravosis  (I have been following him since forever, 2001?, AmericaBlog days?  @atrupar (My informer)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamAinsley @Smilan317 That's weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smilan317 I'm blocked by someone really liberal.  Either I got caught up in some troll blocking or it was an error.  I could have said something stupid, but not enough, I hope to get a block.  Rob doesn't strike me as an arbitrary blocker.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's remember who he is and how badly he's angling for a pardon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenskahn @aravosis Actually, I don't think it is.  (Reading further into today's tweets from Texas)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis I've lost track.  Is this Cruz' boondoggle or is that still to come?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan The fact that your brain makes a leap from "it's best not to put your face near grandma this season" to "War on Christians" has got to be the most privileged insecure thing I've read all week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnes_Law Elections are states issues.  SCOTUS can totally toss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KildayMorgan @Freeyourmindkid HA, that was my first thought.  But then again, so does Adam Schiff, and he can lay down law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost States run their elections, not feds.  This case is as good as tossed already.  This is grandstanding at it's laziest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScoutGreen1 @AdamInHTownTX @JamesSpragens @cspan @JoeBiden And his minions all screech about their FREE-DUMS from masks.  Please, trump is an anti-masker and promoted it as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamInHTownTX @ScoutGreen1 @JamesSpragens @cspan @JoeBiden He had treatments costing over half a million dollars and a helicopter ride to a private suite.  You think they'll give that to you?  Your logic about who survives and doesn't is faulty.  No one knows who dies and who gets a cough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar He's older than Hitler.  And less healthy.  There will be no 2024.  Especially if he's in prison or exiled in Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KhiveBidenBro Maybe he can keep flying to Cuba.  Didn't he want a resort there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan How would that even be possible?  What a stupid thing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR Why do you care?  Have you denounced trump's BS  "election scandal" yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MurphyVia @iamblessedboy @seanhannity You didn't answer the question.  Why do corporations get to "SIT BACK" and collect welfare checks then?  That's OUR tax money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel794041099 @MurphyVia @badmutha44 @iamblessedboy @seanhannity You forgot her statement that 'nobody wants to "Set back".'  Oy vey, no wonder this country is going to the crapper, look at what some states call educators.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidWayneMarks @FoxNews No he's a loser. BUT it wanted to be a dictator. For sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews But he and Ivanka will ll still hold patents and do all sorts of business with them, right?  Taking jobs from Americans in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm She's a piece of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepPaulMitchell Why do you sh*t on the working class then?  You'd think having had it rough you'd realizing during a pandemic people need healthcare and help so we as a nation can survive this.  OH wait, you're a white male aren't you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Sucks for you that the shoe is on the other foot doesn't it?  (Not that I believe your BS anyway)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CandaceTX @nwayne66 It doesn't take that much. It just takes white woman privilege.  I pissed off a blond former fox news woman or her followers by calling out her misogyny.

<|startoftext|>@Renard_Beringer @NYPDnews Why?  What are those rates?  How come that's your immediate focus.  Oh, can't forget the pooor men.   Dear GOD, why is it anytime a focus is on women, especially in a situation where women are the majority of the issue, men, especially white men, center themselves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Yes and no.  Nothing matters to him but blind loyalty.  He thinks he's some kind of Don for real.  He's sh*t toast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA Unfortunately no.  It's also why he'll begin his 2024 campaign on Jan 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMorgan @kylegriffin1 Is it a thing though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman What the hell is a pre-emptive pardon?  Don't you have to plead guilty or be convicted of something for a pardon? WTH?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelockhart Here's how I see it though.  Our parishes are being really particular.  The archdiocese wants to be the one to make the final determination and they are.  Lots of sanitizer, masks, smaller occupancy, no choir.  Religion and politics shouldn't mix.  That said, I only live stream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonrog1 @PaulWartenberg Exactly. I'm mind blow.  I'm lucky at my parish, but I am sick of the hypocrisy of those who worship the gilded golden calf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany Poor victim.  I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life, generations of my family have, we have never not been able to celebrate with Jesus.  Stop being a fake martyr so you can ignore babies locked in cages at the border and black people being murdered by police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dbennett_ks @JoeBiden I think he means going forward.  Sounds like he's making a promise. I want to see serious concrete action in this admin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden START BY: Change the laws that call for people with mixed tribal heritage to CHOSE only one tribe thereby diluting their heritage in legal terms.   antiquated and bigotted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfbuschi You haven't been paying attention to the policies he's implimenting that will be difficult to undo.  He's giving Biden a lot of busy work when he takes over, thinking it will keep him from focusing on Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you not packed yet? Sh*t, get back in your room and don't come out until you are done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgc617 @AdamParkhomenko @EricBoehlert I have.  I follow accounts I respect , sub two one newspaper I relatively trust, and I follow FOX for the counterbalance.  That's all I need to know to see how screwed we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert I DON'T CARE @nytimes!!  How many damn articles are you going to write about the angry racist losers?  I never saw you follow HRC voters around these last 4 years, hanging on their every word.  I don't see you interviewing diners full of Biden voters for their hot takes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again I say, I love this Pope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What trump is doing while we're all laughing.  PAY ATTENTION!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasminBuffy1255 Whether I would or not, I still wouldn't go.  They are bigillionaires.  They should pay their workers for time off and slow the spread of this damn pandemic.  We could be done with this in 6 weeks if we tried.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Douglasreber Everything he thinks he says.  He knows he won't be that much longer.  So he bloviate that "HE IS THE PRESIDENT" because he's projecting the knowledge that he's a failure.  He knows we are laughing at him at this point.  Making him crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point Karma is just having fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliemason @DemFromCT He's losing his power and lashing out.  He hates that he will just be the same loser businessman that has to keep working the con, and respected leaders now know he's a joke and inept.  And he knows it too.  Narcissists hate humilation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa @andrewdgravy Yes, and as long as online mass remains an option I'm staying the hell away.  And then still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE that the Macy's parade has brought in all these bands from the canceled NYC parades.  St Pats, West Indies, PR, and Pride.  I LOVE THIS CITY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStuff wooooorth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you like watching more people die?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC Alanis approved.  I think they were singing live, which I honestly respected more than all these lipsincers.  I wonder what the actual Broadway show is like?  This seemed out of context. Favorite so far was "Schuyler Sisters"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already sliding backwards.  Trump was just the catalyst.  The work, ladies and gents, is only starting.  BidenHarris have an uphill road.  Work WITH them not against them if you don't want GOP control in 2024<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamliptak So, they WANT intelligent people to stay away from organized religion?  This is what I'm hearing. Good move Barrett (I won't give her an acronym like RBG, Ruth EARNED it)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaTriedHoney No.  She's as bad as they all are.   She's a gold digger and a con.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity He pled guilty.  He himself.  To working with Russia.  And you are okay with this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winman953 @BaddCompani He's pardoning anyone who was loyal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlie_savage So what?  I mean, we all know he is guilty as sin and went to prison.  It changes nothing that a criminal pardoned a criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandaceTX Why are they "harder for Biden admin to reverse".  What could he possibly do with a policy that can't be undone by new policy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrankyBelle My therapy is the yelling into the void.    But I do feel bad for people who are feeling awfully alone these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jr_kosik @kevinabosch @AdamParkhomenko Same here.  Especially the GOP white women.  They need a place to parade their children's daily mediocrity.  I say that as a white woman, disgusted with their shallow fake political stances that really are just privilege.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LUVDALS @Yamiche Right?  And that guy is only there because he can put all the pieces back together in the right order and then begin the move forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenMab87 Exactly.  When GOP and Cult call Dems the "S" word it's just talk.   But the moves and decisions by the TrumpCult are demonstratively the acts Fascism.  Those who study real coups and dictatorships say all the benchmarks are being hit step by step, right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews So, basically if he did not have something most Americans have no access to, he may have died.  Yup, sounds about right.  QGOP could not care less about the rest of us, only the elites.  They just watch us die and applaud their "Good fortune" of access.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrianAllen0784 @seanhannity It was!  The way the media called her out for not doing her job and taking the taxpayers money.  It was glorious. SHE'S SO FIRED soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity She doesn't call on anyone lately.  So?   She can't handle the truth.  She can't tell the truth. She's not doing her job and we the taxpayers are paying her $130K salary. Also, How is she on campaign staff AND Administration staff?   Can we say conflict of interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal I do love Sally Yates.  A think a seat will open on SCOTUS and that's Merrick's place, but the giggles if he were AG.  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod Lately she really doesn't call on anyone.  What 5 questions in 3 weeks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenMab87 This is true.  We didn't make one last year. Literally no one came to our door and arrested us.  Matter of fact it was one of the best Thanksgiving meals I've ever had!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Loooks soooo  much like Eric Trump.  So weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this legal?  If so, this should end Jan 21.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elizejackson Where is this lovely sign?  Which city?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis @PressSec @kayleighmcenany And the @CNN buttwipes will take her back for "balance".  They are so far down the rabbithole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She already knows she's got a "career" on OAN after this gig.  She's coasting out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Yes, those "lawyers" sure did seem overwhelmed.  I think an exorcism might be the remedy for their derangement.  Trump lost again and again this week.  Get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, the schadefreude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rockcenternyc @BirdCentralPark Can we keep him?  Huh, please, can we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BolosBozo @dbennett_ks @JYSexton He's still going to lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @dennisaoconnor No she's not.  Lara trump SAYS she may.  God, these people will do anything for continued attention and we give it to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReallyBozo @ElieNYC I'll go for this only if @PreetBharara goes back to SDNY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that makes sense then!  Let's see what was going in in KT and SC, shall we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They why air it and stir up the cultists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Why would they wait for that.  NO one believes that will happen.  No one.  Instead they let the white terrorists get riled up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio No one but republicans like republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews He's busy trying to manage with an uncooperative fascist trump transition team.  He's too focused for this BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkruzel Oh, so these threats to someone's life he calls about.  But when his terrorists want to kill a governor opposed to him, he fans the flames.  This is your guy GOP.  All yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying not to fall into this trap of a coup. But I'm not going to be settled until he's OUT of the WH and Biden is in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ @lacadri34 I've been using "Outgoing".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votewander @davidmweissman So, if someone said you killed your neighbor, we should assume evidence is there just based on this accusation and even if you say otherwise you should be locked up? Very tricky thing this fabricated imaginary unknown evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D4Real8645 BuhBYE.  And please, be a stranger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they also want liability waivers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theguybrass @onlytruthhere @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump The figure is, since in truth, they *(rightwing nuts) just believe all covid stats are made up.  https://t.co/8tQH6AXwVZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer Why isn't trump conceding?  Why isn't the transition team in action?  Why is trump locked in the WH?  Why is the press not hounding this 24/7?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the system worked. We found the voter fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@techdef @thehill Bingo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forget trump.  Let's let the grown ups talk now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoanieVee1 @lacadri34 ME  $20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onlytruthhere @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump They still say the number of deaths is exaggerated by 10x.  So that figure means nothing to them.  They think it's "fake" as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity The perfect 2020 tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is over.  Trump LOST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apoorva_nyc @CDCgov Trump CDC, or the folks who still want to work there in January?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_tianastewart @D4Real8645 Looks like not seeing him in 7-8 years was the right call!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup.  Just stay home republicans in GA, they won't count your votes anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiggzDog @gumbotronix @seanhannity Yup.  And no one is going to stop you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiggzDog @seanhannity OLD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiggzDog @seanhannity Dude, by my knowledge of it's contents and sean's exaggeration I obviously looked further than his tweet.  Yikes, you couldn't even figure that part out yourself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity UNbelieveable the number of people who just take Sean at his exaggerations and cannot read for themselves.  No wonder the trumpcult is so easy to control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiggzDog @seanhannity HAHAHA.  Not even reading the article.  So panic prone, the right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting move.  Let's see how that works out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing what money does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod I hope everyone had the toilet paper stash already.   Fool me once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveThreeP0 @SharletteH @davidmackau Pathetic and self serving yes.  Comparisons to trump end there. We're not going to agree he's trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters I couldn't care less.  What do Biden supporters think of Biden?  What do they think about the mess trump has made?  What do black supporters of Biden think?  Why do we have to constantly hear about the same white evangelical losers over and over going on 5 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Ruble too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveThreeP0 @SharletteH @davidmackau Don't diasagree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq Why didn't he do it before the election when the Dems passed bill after bill on election security that McConnell refused to take up in the Senate. Don't try this sh*t now.  Too LATE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larker16 @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Hon, take that lying crap to ParlXX.   Anytime trumpies say this stuff it just shows their incredible ignorance.  That's NOT how it works.  Sooo stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU LOST!  and now we'll watch you lose over and over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharletteH @davidmackau I was about to say this.  He's been going at it since March.  I know he's a egomaniac, but damn, why is everyone supposed to be superhuman in the middle of this crisis?   Cuomos mistake is even having this. conference  Just shhh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nlicalzi @harrysiegel okay, bud. have a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nlicalzi @harrysiegel None of these links make him trump. That's the beef I have. Don't like him, his policies and his behavior.  Fine.  Plenty don't.  But anything like trump? No way.  Not even close.  And honestly, after 3 links people start rolling their eyes, you can stop googling now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nlicalzi @harrysiegel He's may be egotistical , but he's still not trump, not a by a long long shot.  Trump is a genocidal traitorous racist grifter, who wants to punish NYC for not loving him.  Andy just likes attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaHoule Both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nlicalzi @harrysiegel OH FFS. No, not by a long shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caroljsroth M*A*S*H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blindgolfchaz @FoxNews 1) Trumps tax plan expires for citizens, so your taxes were always going up under HIS plan.  Biden's only if you make over 400K 2) People who aren't racist don't support racist and bigotted policies, like trump's.  Ergo..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Yes, I await the day.   Funny how 4 years ago you enjoyed the chants "Lock her up", now, not so funny, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch @GSAEmily Exactly! There is no struggle.  Only selfishness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BOOM, Bishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell @D4Real8645 @GSAEmily @JoeBiden @GSAEmiliy has only one choice but is too weak to make it.  I'm sorry, I feel no pity, she's playing politics while people's lives hang in the balance.  Too much power for one person to wield.  Let's rethink this going forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blindgolfchaz @FoxNews It needs a little ruining. Any country that has 71M people voting for a racist traitorous seditious misogynistic incompetent maniac and that ilk needs some serious remodeling.  Knock down walls, put in an addition.  I'm here for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIght, once the crazy man is out of office I could see why countries would feel better about making deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blindgolfchaz @FoxNews You're thinkin of McConnell.  Dems tried to push through a lot that he blocked.  Put the blame where it belongs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Stick with the winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProgBeliever @Bookgirl96 @orgainkorgain Frankly, it's a survival skill.  Be proud.  There's a lot of a$$holes out there who look perfectly normal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is another lie.@Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blanquita0789 @sfpelosi Status quo is only because McConnell stopped everything coming out of Dem House.  We must finish the work in GA so we can get something done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God bless her!  Brava!  Joe and the two women who will have his back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Neither does McConnell who wouldn't take up Dem's election security bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremyherb @KristenhCNN All she has to do is her job which is prepare the INCOMING NEW PRESIDENT by signing a damn piece of paper.  Gimme a break.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder But doesn't it take Pence?  He seems to have ghosted the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Thing of beauty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotdiggityDR Hell no.  I do it constantly.  They should have to wear bells, like lepers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkusJRussell Already overturned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MoMoDdotcom @varindersingh24 Its really not that hard!  I mean in a month I'll be covered by a scarf anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara Case in point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MommaBrookie @catspongeJessie @DDarkskinned  https://t.co/SC2C8VqGPa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catspongeJessie @DDarkskinned @MommaBrookie Because Louie Gohmert got on OAN and said that the military seized a server that has all the true votes on it.  And CA turned red. Can you believe this shite?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MommaBrookie This and evangelical homeschool is what has destroyed the brains of people for the last 30-40 years.  People teach their kids BS and the states can't do anything.  Then they go to evangelical colleges and on to Congress.  Absolute fact.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeJoPro Outgoing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's checking off his Putin list.  Then he'll try to seek asylum there, in complete irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A question worth asking.  He is in $421M worth of debt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KildayMorgan Exactly, why is this so hard to imagine?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PTekach Which is a normal response.  Politicians are never saviors.  And broke con men like trump for sure aren't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers He's right to do so, but I'm so skeptical of his motivation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesignationSix Sit back and relax!???????  Holy shit.  Every woman knows that's a rape threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_Coal @2MuchSpin @FoxNews This makes it alllllll the sweeter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyShnark Lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭  I hate emotionally manipulative things but this is so beautifully done, it's not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Why are Republican men so fragile and hysterical all the time?  No one is "canceling" Thanksgiving.  Dear God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @Twitter Or hide them better and keep them as evidence of his sedition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse The next 4 years will be like a F'kn detox for us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET OVER IT, we need to move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 True, I've been learning a lot about my own culpability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I believe Biden when he says DAY ONE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBenCarson Jury is still out:   https://t.co/DsX8dsTvcX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBenCarson God is good?  Because only people in power (for now) can access healthcare?  You, sir, do not know Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mac1170 @DC_Draino What the losers watch when they need their "safe space".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I project you won North Carolina.  Okay, it's yours.   Better now?  You still LOST the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What took so long?  Alaska doesn't start counting mail ins until Nov. 10th.  Jesus Cracker, you'd think as president you'd have someone around you that knows something, anything about our elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski If he lasts past 11:59pm on Jan 19th I'll be shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio And Biden will be YOURS on Jan 20th!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very cool map.  WEAR YOUR MASKS!  Especially on the train!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 This is how it's been every time his Maj Leader.  Need to take that from him for the final time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan It's greed and hubris.  They want what he appears to have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill What he means is let's bring the POC who have been grifting with us on board to really mess with folks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stacy Abrams did not do it alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a president elect should?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuckerCarlson Zombies are an incredibly forgotten voting block.  https://t.co/GFw8MEOFn7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff Thom Hartmann said if he concedes he can no longer fundraise through his campaign.  So we see what's really happening here.  Grift until the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Note the women don't have first names.   But I do love Vern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @DanSullivan_AK Who called it?  OHHHH The media?  Really, now.  I see how this works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan It's only 20 that we are dealing with.  Oy vey.  The media makes it sound like 50%.  They need to shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse Hamilton, hands down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios Stop making up stuff.  He's out.  He's finished.  He's looking for new ways to grift and redirect money.  He can do it out of the white house at this point, better than in.  Less scrutiny, he thinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, let's not do this again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanKeefe @VineMan5 all of GA?  Or just Atlanta?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omar1618 @VineMan5 @BrendanKeefe 150 at most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyEGardner HA, so we can literally watch trump lose AGAIN but in slow-mo.  Fantastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity That's okay.  Better to not be a cult like Trumpublicans.  We still think for ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious You should see the screen shots from the Cult's safe room at Parlxx.  It's nice of them to gather in one place for the coming investigations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Oh, wow, what a hero.  https://t.co/9LIqvtpEfV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins Wait, so Mitch and Lindsey DIDN'T ACTUALLY WIN?  Should we do a recount?  How does a man with a 14% approval rating in KT win?  Yes, please get to the bottom of this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@digby56 Last one, orange turd!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiftForever67 Some of that is people forwarding to either mock or discount.  This isn't all support.  But yeah, why are we giving them oxygen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That moment when you almost send a complaint letter to someone because you were thinking of them when sending the letter to the actual recipient.  https://t.co/7iJgQYCCcQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/PmZNXGZ3Wg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exoticgamora They can grift as long as they don't concede.  Trump has to stop his fundraising scam the second he concedes.  That's tells you everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 John Barron, is that you?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gniluapnawak His brain is melting.  He'll be babbling and drooling in 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieGabstonH Agreed, but the phrase itself did damage to fence sitters votes.  Polling is even showing that.  I want to seen police massively defunded, yet I had to overcome an initial aversion to the phrasing. People right of me reacted viscerally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've said this from day 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast In Texas?  You mean, he wants to figure out how the hell Cornyn won, too?  Let's do this thing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKatiePorter Someone needs to rein in Pompeo, Barr and McConnell first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount @mkraju This smirking smarmy POS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnharveyphoto @TimOBrien  https://t.co/juyJxo4QxY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnharveyphoto @TimOBrien He's not in charge 1/20, no matter what.  Look at what the SENATE, yes, senate passed in Sept - S.Res.718 - A resolution reaffirming the Senate's commitment to the orderly and peaceful transfer of power called for in the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano Haunting of Bly Manor.  I have one episode left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzygeiger Yes, let's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgeidner @tbluvoter Remote for pandemic yet voting about taking away healthcare for Americans in the middle of a pandemic.  Sounds about right for GOP.  Let's see how compassionate they really are. Don't hold your breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WenkeLuke @SCOTUSblog You are ridiculous.  Up to that point for profit insurance was running away with increases and denying coverage to people in need.  These measures assured they couldn't dump you in the middle of chemo or in ICU when the bill got too hight.  Young and stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going on NOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please wear a mask, is now seen as a nationwide mandate by the cult.  The ones who are all about civility can't understand it when they actually see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohalloran23 @Newsweek They all talk out of both sides of their mouth to put up a good front for the cult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB @KiKiPosting @JoeBiden @ReverendWarnock @ossoff Or Joe can rule by EO and acting staff.  Why not?  I mean, I'd prefer law, but good for goose good for gander, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kitten0409 This is the new game.  They learned from their cult leaders.  They should be charged for every day they gum up the works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod They are all liars.  They'll be back to Twitter and Facebook in about 3 weeks because they need to show off their meals, their painted toes and their kids mediocre accomplishments and Parler just isn't the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mar_a_Hell_No Why did he quit?  Why didn't he stay and fight until he was fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @chestnut_daniel #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 Oh yes. No doubt.  Education is key. Must squash the destruction of our schools.  Focus on inner city and rural education.  Truth has a liberal bias afterall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest @D4Real8645 Good thing Joe never said he's "pack the courts".  Balance, maybe, appoint yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCPolitics @MattMurph24 I never want to see her interviewed on TV.  Once she's out she's yesterdays news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlowNYC Geez, did anyone even watch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H_MitchellPhoto They should have thought of that before they terrorized people.  Lemme tell you if I were that scared I would have barricaded myself *inside my house and then had my weapons ready.  This was unbelievable grandstanding BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 So, let's keep working to make it all blue. ;)  Then we don't have to worry about working with ANY of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcherring I say it's both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimOBrien @johnharveyphoto Actually it's only dangerous if we pretend it is.  He's a wounded dog with a festering gangrene limb. He may be barking mad, but he's easy to contain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaPotash @DrGJackBrown No, rob them of oxygen.  Biden's not worried, Preet Bahara is not worried.  Until they are, I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @gabreyman What's happening?  A protest?  So what?  They cannot strap their AR15s on and march thru DC.  It's just a louder more obnoxious Tea Party.   Stay home, enjoy getting ready for Tday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieGabstonH @votevets This is why he won't get away with it.  It's clearly designed for chaos and media attention.  Ignore him.  Ignore his crap.  Focus and support Biden unconditionally until Jan 20, then expect things or make noise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvkaybee @chukswealth @supitsshekinah @JoeBiden I guess McConnell should have taken up that election integrity bill the House sent over.  Hmmm Mr 14% approval won. That's suspicious.  That's weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffRBennett They'll be ready for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 @MikeBacon65 @ktbenner @djrothkopf No, he's staging a Chaos.  This is all he knows.  It's all he's ever done.  Baffle 'em with BS, as my dad used to say.  In the end he's still going to be out. And eventually indicted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktbenner Karmic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks you @AAACares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeigerNews Do they think they can bring their AR15s and play terrorist in DC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycetache No.  Trump is just doing his same ole chaos making schtick.  Stop panicking, it feeds him.  Do you think Biden/Harris and the House aren't preparing?  Is Preet Bahara panicking?  Sally Yates?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone just calm down and follow @AlGiordano .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano Why can't I retweet this. It's a beautiful summary and directive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just the sheer fact that he used the word relaxed in this sentence makes me super happy.  It's gonna be okay kiddos.  Preet could relax!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vuduchyld @donwinslow He has told us everything he was going to do four 4 years.  Biden and Harris and the House are ready.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Think in these terms.  Everything Donald Touches he walks away from and blames someone else.  How is this different?  It's trump admin PTSD talking.  It will be fine by Jan.  Messy until then, but fine.  Follow @AlGiordano<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grinningbamE @NBCNews FIX MY HOUSE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @GOPChairwoman Yes! I'm totally alarmed that the losing party is trying to usurp a US election with lies and corruption to keep trump in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Wouldn't all those involved in the "investigation" also have to be involved in the corruption and coverup?  I mean he can't just "report" what they don't investigate, right?  They'd whistleblow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal They don't mention the pacifier, but I'm sure there's a pacifier involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Biden won more than trump in 2016.  This isn't going to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KhiveBidenBro @lacadri34 Why do they let him?  Who's show is he on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano ROFL ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano No, I'm allll with you.  I'm saying, in NYC all he had was Guiliani (and the corrupt ilk through the decades).  He's got more noise and bloviating behind him at the moment.  Hence why it looks worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ_Mouton I'm going to hang an American flag again starting Jan 20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliVelshi If they value future employment they will jump ship now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlGiordano He didn't have the Senate, USPS and an entire cabinet at his disposal either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump I thought you folks were against legalizing drugs?  Are you high?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k He wants that. He knows he isn't good enough for anything.  He's going for infamy.  It's gonna get bad folks.  But we'll still win in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mshepherd62 @travisakers @kayleighmcenany My brooklyn born dad said this all the time. (usually when we were trying to get away with something)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's hopeful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benFranklin2018 @gabreyman Let em.  They have every right.  And ignore them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claudia_silver7 @AAACares  I pay a ton of money each year to know ANY tow company u send will assist me. If I have to wonder if they will chose, I will stop this ridiculous insurance and just "pay out of pocket" as necessary.  Logically, I should already be doing that, don't make it easy to quit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffRBennett Biden should make everyone "acting".  They allowed it for trump. Then in 2022 congress can pass a "you can't do that rule" for the next gal to bring back tradition and order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Jacoby @KamalaHarris After 45 white male presidents - I can't decide which is the stronger force in this crap tweet, misogyny or racism.  Hmmm.  Tough call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon Cowards and sociopaths cannot directly confront.  They let others (in this case twitter) do their bidding.  It's just like how he gets his minions to do violent acts.  It gives him distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawStory Everyone better get the payment up front for the hate rallies he'll be holding for the next 4 yrs.  And @NBC, @ABC, @CNN @FOX, @MSNBC it might make sense to not give his sedition oxygen and free air time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawStory Lemme introduce you to the word EVICTION then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes NYT, I DO NOT CARE one crap about these people anymore.  How come I don't see interview after interview of BLM Biden voters?  Their thoughts, their needs, their desire. Go to a diner in Philly and find them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Except the manufacture themselves said he lied.  So, there's that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad we are Catholic, like Biden.  Cause this evangelical hoopla makes our sometimes hard to understand faith looks SOOOOO normal.   #HandMeARosary<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HenryHvdson @katyperry And I don't agree with that sentiment.  I will protect my black friends rights before I protect my racist brother in laws feewings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal I don't know who these white people are, but all those around me are severely divided into two camps. There's no singing around the campfire happening. There's unfriending on FB, moving to Parler, and the Resistance faction says "apologies and behavior change before forgiveness".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Sure, let's watch them lose twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity No, not true.  But still, there's no similarity.  Florida was literally the deciding state.  Trump has no route.  He lost BIGLY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis He didn't have anyone for his own transition.  Biden will be able to get the truth elsewhere anyway.  I don't trust a thing out of a trump admin.  Not a damn thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman People are lost in it.  Hopelessly Jim Jones lost.  What's our move to counter it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HighwayVagabond @TMZ He loses everything he has.  He ruins everything he touches.  That's not going to miraculously turn around.  He may have a bump, but then he'll self sabotage with his narcissism and poof....(Don't forget his $421M debt.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wdunlap @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich What it tells you is we don't have a real problem in voter integrity.  And if we did, why didn't Mitch McConnell do anything about it these last 4 years when asked to by Dems?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NY1 @APaolicelli17 I dont give one crap.  You didn't spend 4 years asking HRC voters how they felt about the trump admin.  I'm sick of hearing from the cult constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickPetree Actually because I knew I was voting for him I never listed to his stump speeches.  Tonight was the first time I heard it.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  Especially GOP lite who tuned in.  Don't be a  Mr. cranky pants today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Move on, Sean.  This loss has just sealed your job for 4 more years of sowing hate against an administration.  https://t.co/knpYUu2h32<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can someone make posters of all our presidents through Biden 46 that just has a black spot in the area for 45? Classrooms everywhere will be better off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HEY this has been fun!!  Let's keep rolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 I hope he slinks out sooner, in the dark of night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Except President BIDEN!!  Who really received the most votes of any president in history.  That's why he won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW.  #YOUREFIRED<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I LOVE YOU MY TWEEPS!!  WE DID IT, WE GOT HERE TOGETHER!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Did you read the article?  There is no voter fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz How do you function?  Let me be clear for you:  To...have...antibodies...you....ARE....COVID+  How you feel is a separate discussion.  This is why the GOP hates edcuation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was was a headache to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJuttaHBrink1 @iproofer1 This is the only thing keeping me behaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaraLeaTrump Who are you?  Why are you lying to the American people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prosecute this man to the fullest extent of the law. And change laws so that this does not happen again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX But is he SICK?  I mean, positive test means nothing if you don't feel a little something.  May deniers experience what they have mocked others for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darylsturgis @MattMurph24 He's always had the anti-midas touch.  That's why the fluke that got him into the WH has resulted in so much destruction and disaster.  It's against nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's young, he'll do fine.  But he's not getting trumps golden treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarefreeRush @realDonaldTrump I keep seeing this post copied and pasted.  How stupid are these retweeters?  None of it makes sense.  If it were real...GO, please.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Delicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotpageNews His quote seems personal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Maybe stop talking for a little bit.  I say this as your biggest fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo @JoeBiden @CNN @MSNBC I shut it off Wed.  They say nothing.  Just wait for the tweet from Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Funny, I won't forgive anyone who voted a second time for the fascist trump either.  What's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading lots of comments from trumpers about how the election isn't even over and the Dems are splitting up, giving them the opportunity is 2022 to sneak back in.  Let them think that while we Abrams the hell out of them going forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmandoNDK I thought PA was getting ready for final call this am?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemocracyInn @MoMoDdotcom She should talk to her daughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  And it all started with trumps involvement in Wrestling.  He learned how to manipulate crowds.  He knew even when people *know something is made up, they can still be persuaded to spend money and rabidly support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouiji board calls it for B-I-D-E-N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vrijmetselaar56 @ColoradoDavidSu Wage Theft is much more than raising the minimum.  It's literally corporations and businesses skimming people's wages.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just had the best thought.  Joe's gonna pull OAN's WH press credentials!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieGabstonH including FOX, and the spawn OAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu You'd really hate wage theft then.  Spend some time learning about it then review your tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC AOC, take a mental health day.  I love ya, but this is really crappy timing.  Read the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz You won your seat, just do your dang job and vote for COVID releif for people, not corporations and stop d*ckin around with this election fraud crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have been waiting for this day since 2016.  It feels personal at this point.  Let's GO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This all seems so fitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are trying to take the wind out of our sails.  CALL IT.  Biden has the most votes, the most EC votes, he won.  Trump has no path forward except coup, and we are not doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lark2rule Report from home!  Just like the early Quarantine days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmandoNDK Somebody had to talk about it after Nov. 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Where's Barr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Check this out, they don't count the mailed ballots until the 10th.  https://t.co/YNKjUxtUpY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankdpi Close: " counting of mail ballots in Alaska, which won’t even begin until November 10."  https://t.co/YNKjUxtUpY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankdpi I swore Thom Hartmann said something about them not counting until Nov.10 or finishing then.  Something weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan This week keeps getting better for team trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Mary Trump understands this sentiment intimately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veterans_Resist @Ooy @mmpadellan And that doesn't matter to trump.  If you call before he'll start the "recount narrative"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal This is preposterous. The media is in cahoots with the GOP for sure.  Delegitimizing the incoming admin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure You just summarized what 70,000,000 of us are thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar But he can't handle being a loser.  So this is blowing his mind.  I'd love for him to use FOX as his new punching bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden  @KamalaHarris  You guys are following our next leaders, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs Sounds more like passing your advice back to you.  Why can't you accept it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drop for Biden in AZ.  Yikes.  I cannot take this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason_elAvocado Alll his legal woes.  Watching his debts pile, his properties seized. His family facing RICO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marston4ca42 @JoseyRider They are in on destroying the legitimacy of the Biden Administration.  They will make their money off of the nonstop aggravation of the radical right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsmithoakland So just end it? God.  We are all the victim of Narcissistic injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to break up the media monopolies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH SNAP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ_Mouton Well, we never got the taco trucks on every corners.  I'm not sure this is a good second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @ProjectLincoln It motivated me to motivate others and not throw in the towel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dems need to grow a spine and gonads.  This is what it's going to take for 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal Help is arriving from Texas.   https://t.co/YWGn23Pkxk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyTurNBC Aren't they? Man, I'm so confused, now the GOP corporatists are playing "mom and pop" protectors?  The con never ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flexlibris @TheTattooedProf This is it right here.  He makes scared misfits feel like they are "something" and have power.  We need to recognize that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill His time was before the election.  We wouldn't be in this mess now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macy5875 Oh yes.  How can you trust their take on anything now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal @Eedwardsellis Maybe even in cahoots with states so they don't have to deal with the madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeRich44 @realDonaldTrump 5 he will hopefully lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure Hatred, anger, racism, toxicity is what they run on.  Meaner than trump?  I doubt it, but they might bring in a smarter villian next time.  We will be prepared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevesilberman @Toure He's also DEMANDING (in all caps) that they send money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YEEESSSSS!  Who do I call, where do I send money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meiselasb @gabreyman Time to invoke 25A.  He's breaking down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we are at the place where we 25th this maniac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProgBeliever He's a bully and a coward.  He will sneak out in the dead of night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MadisonKittay @AdiosMcconnell Scramble his internet, cancel cable, and cut off his McD supply - He'll be out in an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennycohn1 Texas Latinos were fed a lot of red republican nonsense.  There are only corporate own radio stations in rural areas.  There was a pandemic, hurricanes.  It was never going blue this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennycohn1 Okay, this article is 2 days old.  What did they find?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sweety, they are counting the mail in ballets now.   You told your supporters not to use mail in ballots.  You Effed yourself.  And I'm here for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Does he know we are in the middle of an out of control pandemic?  Maybe he wants to, you know, govern?  Oh, WTH am I saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanityFair I'd pay per view this episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@870South And he's been fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerschelWalker How about we stop with this BS.  People voted correctly.  A) We are in a pandemic.   B) GOP States made it harder to start counting early.   C)Those states voted and we will count those votes like the Constitution requires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Let me say it slowly so you understand.  YOU      TOLD     YOUR      PEOPLE    NOT     TO   MAIL     IN      THEIR      BALLOTS.  That's what's being counted now.  All the Dems who did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nate_Cohn Maybe the aren't calling it because hey are afraid he'll find a way to cheat.  Extra methodical, extra certain makes it harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani So, let's just pretend for a second this is real.  if you are dead on the rolls, it doesn't mean someone can vote for you. Signatures have to match, ID / info has to be presented, address needs to be verified.  And when you are caught you go to prison.  So, lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Based on what?  Less votes in NV, AZ, PA and GA?   Less national votes?  Any work you do through your packed courts just proves your corruption and guilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse Well, who owns them?  Are they a monopoly?  What do we expect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henrynathanmia @jaketapper He can't.  Twitter won't let him before networks do.  I just read that on another thread.  We are all hostage to the networks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent I'm hoping they burn out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is asinine.  Every single politician deals with loss and they are not coddled.  His narcissistic injury is not our problem.  Seek mental health professionals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill  https://t.co/19OtwU1WZK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity The fact that he won proves one of two things.   GOP is corrupt and rigged the SC election or the Dems didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out this representation.   Best one yet and it took the French to figure it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ Excuse me?  POCs gave us a task.  That task was to work directly with our skinfolk and help them accept their racism and fix it.  We didn't change everyone, but we became a block to assist them.  Damn skippy we are celebrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX You are barely a breath from her level of conspiracy craziness.  The fact that you even think there are "irregularities" is ridiculous.  If dems cheated you'd be gone, as would McConnell, Lindsey,  Collins, Cornyn and Nunes. Face it.  Your guy lost.  Get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Oh, he found the next victim of his revenge train.  Typical abuser.  Once the wife leaves get a girlfriend immediately and start the whole cycle over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Not a damn bit.  He's a genocidal maniac who employed Steven Miller to be as cruel as possible to non-white people. He idolizes Hilter and worked hard to be him.  He's going to go on damaging our country as leader for 2 more months and more with his TV network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar They love the attention, they feed on chaos like trump, and they are republican owned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyvclark20 @AdamParkhomenko Hell to the no.  We get to celebrate the hard work, the struggles, everything we did to get people to the polls.  The work isn't going anywhere, it can wait a day or two.  Mental health is needed to keep going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helloimjonnyash @AdamParkhomenko three times during the night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko At this point probably just passing out.  This has been exhausting.  I'll celebrate Jan 20th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smartassicus Agreed, but he gives us that opportunity to stop the bleeding and turn in the right direction.  I bet our allies are thrilled.  God, the stories and laughs they are going to have about this giant orange asswipe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smartassicus Nah, I'm thrilled.  He'll want to fix everything trump stole from him and O.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k Not your best tweet. You can do better than rape jokes.  You have, actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is an excellent point @JoeBiden @SymoneDSanders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain @AndrewYang Pete could have one.  Kamala could have one.  Biden did. Enough people hate trump and want to give the democrats a shot at, once again, fixing the GOP mess.  How about you stop propping up lunatics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Mediocre WM says what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeamar914 @Acosta @MariaSpiniello Good, then we can sell TX back to Mexico once they all get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielledsouzag Steal, like GOP stole Merrick Garland seat?  Over 200 judicial seats?  AND RBG seat.  Yeah, we know republicans know all about stealing things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodrigooEsparza @danielledsouzag Who is cheating?  Where?  And where's the proof? Liar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atlasmariek @GeorgePapa19 If they were so worried about election security why did Mitch McConnell refuse to do anything about it.  He himself said they were fine.  There is no case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgePapa19 What will?  Your treason?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @DebraMessing Enjoy your hard work paying off.  We'll fight another day, after some mental heath days and celebrating.  Then get back to work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeamar914 Not yet I don't.  Not counting these chickens quite yet. I've seen what this madman can pull off with evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq We only lead by 4M of us.  68M think trump is the direction for this country.  You are damn right we have our work cut out for us.  Starting in education, and obliterating cult right network/cable media.  Send it to am.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BIDENHARRIS2020  That's it.  That's the tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeresistance1 Seriously, I have saved tweets and FB posts that are coming back to haunt folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Did Ivanka get this from you or you from Ivanka?  No FOOLING that's exactly what's happening.  IF you have an issue, maybe you should have taken up the cause of securing elections, but you didn't because you said they are secure.  Don't believe yourself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump And that's EXACTLY how your sick dad is currently losing.  It's not rocket science.  Our elections have been proven safe by his own team of investigators.  And Mitch refused to increase security because he said it was unnecessary. BYE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanDwig79 @msmoon61 @RoguePOTUSStaff I guess I'm jaded and still don't trust any polling.  I will hang on to everyone's optimist coattails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shermichael_ @AprilDRyan @JoeBiden No.  I won't celebrate until its official.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can everyone be so cavalier about this?  trump has pulled wins out of his arse his whole life.  This ain't over until all the votes are counted and he's out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronjcarpenter @GOP Wow, right out of the bat you admit you are a cult follower, not a civil servant of the American people.  Disgusting.  You don't work for HIM, you were for your constituents.  All of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GregAbbott_TX Well, you disenfranchise PRIOR to voting, so of course it's more streamlined.  One drop off box per county?  ID laws?  Lawsuits on drive thrus that went back and forth.  Come on, man.  Save us your BS about efficiency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll set an alarm because I cannot make it 3 more hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's not how this works and WI will prove it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch this, Retweet this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KildayMorgan Lemme tell you, all that energy will shift something.  Praying Biden supporters need to pray for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbaltv11 It's probably best I keep my reaction to this news to myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BecuJeanne @Chayes1025 @dont_koolaide The fact that any of them have a job says it's not rigged.  But for ALL of them to still have a job.  There's no rigging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamilyMindedcom In the middle of Covid, unemployment and increase in homelessness, read the damn room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot believe we are going into the 3rd night of not being sure how late to stay up.  #zzzzz  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon But they are still in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrampaJoe6667 @mattgaetz Is this a "Sir" story?  Everyone in the room, eh?  Was the big man crying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz John Lewis' district will give this state to Biden in poetic fashion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GA, time to register your friends who didn't figure out how important this really is, in time for runoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where were these f*kkin reporters the last 4 years.  Hell, since COVID?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomiahonen PA I don't think GA is flipping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is worth the time to read all the way through.  Maybe even save it for later in your Bookmarks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeesssssss!!  I have my plans for the rest of the year now.  Get him elected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParZevil Vegetable tempora<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!  Mute these traitorous b@stardi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA The White House?  We will, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smartassicus You're killin me smalls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KhiveBidenBro @lacadri34 I'm skeptical<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@USATODAY @nicole_carroll What in the hell took you this long?  My God he's being doing it since he lied about the size of his inauguration crowd and hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara It's nice to transition from Obama directly to Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated Saying their only King is God. He is in charge (true). And that no one should gloat about a win no matter who it is.    Curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepGosar @realDonaldTrump Whose back?  White privileged rich guys? Gimme a damn break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IowaGOPer All dictators have followers.  That's how they can inflict as much damage as they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@in_pubs Not at first.  Then yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trabucco_gary @morningmika @RobinFree19 But 68M people take his remarks at face value and are ready to engage in violence to "save him and democracy".  Despite the face that hes a lying criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Actually there was,  but the racist fascist trump cult also came out in droves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_emme_ternet @brat2381 Calls.  YOu can also make calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Sure.  Here's trump and DeJoy slowing USPS in democratic areas to damage Bidens election chances.   https://t.co/MGEDVPKpi0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds like trump knows he lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindaar36182215 @brycetache Very funny.  That's my plan too.  It's out and dusted off, but I will not jinx until it's settled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar They can't disappoint me.  I have so little regard for that state it's impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Hopefully he will be banned from twitter in the meantime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icecube Because it's a lie.  He never does what he says he's gonna do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Marmel Hi, I'm here for the sandwich @Shoq mentioned.  Ham and cheese on everthing bagel, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I'm so pissed.  I forgot Nevada's noon announcement wasn't Eastern Time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBCPR @thereidout @mitchellreports @MSNBC Andrea tends to piss me off.  She's not going to do that this time is she with the whataboutism two sides crap, right?  When trump lies about elections SAY IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastordan Are you trying to jinx things?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin FINE him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo Why are you tweeting a lie that has been debunked?  @Twitter @TwitterSupport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UbeShortbread That's why I asked that initial question though.  Because, my understanding, albeit possibly erroneous, is that parole shortens prison sentence.  So if you remove parole...  Hence why I'm trying to work through it.  And yes, I've read New Jim Crow, I'm on the side of reforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Sttttooopppppp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump report this tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind And have someone yell the results to him live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse I'll say it one more time... we are done with polls.  Never ever believe them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycetache What's happening in PA why is Jason Miller gloating?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yater1 @JasonMillerinDC Taxes, bills, certain applications need to be Post Marked by due dates. Why is this such a big deal? IF that's done, it counts. States don't certify elections for weeks. This is just a big deal because trump made it one.  You never cared before and its been this way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennEmartin *government system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennEmartin My first thought, more like a social worker, but then isn't that still a pathway for people to abuse power and go back to the same behavior.   I'm honestly asking. I agree with you 100%, but I guess I don't trust any system to do right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennEmartin I believe you, but curious what the alternative would be, longer jail time for the offense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, I kept ignoring this meme, but now that I see the whole thing, it's perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so unbelievably sick about NYPD.  While we are mostly a FDNY family, I do have some boys in blue in the tree.  I haven't talked to them in about a year.  :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottinankeny I think it's all very luckily.  I have been convinced the Devil has trumps soul, and unless he's ready to reap soon this is one more win he'll give trump.  (This is the craziest crap you'll ever see me post, but I said what I said. 🙃)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Also, what if we had another GOP Senate member defect to Indie?  Would that give Dems majority?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Come on John Ossoff runoff.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DzinerChristine @ananavarro Male Toxicity and patriarchal church mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis newt's tweet should be reported<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k Start working on (hopeful) special election for senate and midterms.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GadiNBC @MattMurph24 @NBCNews These are trump people...Isn't Biden ahead there?  Sure, go ahead and stop counting. Fine by me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Abolish it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Is this where we are supposed to proclaim LAW AND ORDER!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithLeBlanc63 @aravosis @realDonaldTrump Let's just call it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq Why do you think we are all still awake at this hour?  WTF can sleep with that knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Isn't trump behind?  I Mean if they really want to stop things now, okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting soooo sleeepy.   Come on states, give me a Biden win so I can go to bed and celebrate tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis He's fundraising for lawsuits.  He's that broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChilliOHGirl59 @Paula_White That's exactly what Paula's kind of faith teaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paula_White Yes, please Lord, deliver us from the evil that is trump.  Don't let him steal any state elections using his packed court as a weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jojoptyoga Start by asking...where did you verify these numbers?  Or block them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nitabirdonit That and consuming calories seem to be my own ambition tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's the pepper spray?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelcrowley down is not low enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theRealElleDee @PreetBharara This is where I am, but work was hard enough today.  I may be dangerously stupid tomorrow if this keeps up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisDJackson @PreetBharara That's not eastern time is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara I just kept waking all night and checking.  Probably the same tonight.  Someday we'll sleep again.  Not yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrRHendrickson @Alex_Kack Is this gonna work as well as this did?  https://t.co/6fJHAv1Z91<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCressman Nah, they will just form the "New Tea Party".  Their hate isn't done.  They have a charged up angry audience.  The midterms will be a fiasco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @TeamTrump @RyannMcEnany @sonnyjoynelson So if God chooses Biden will you accept His will?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko That means he'll only win by what, 5000 votes?  Is that math right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryPeters OH YAY!!  I have friends who worked on your campaign.  They are so thrilled.  As are we all. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @SenatorCollins Something smells.  Her vote against Amy Barrett, her polling, then her win?  Nah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamsojinxy @lacadri34 @harrisonjaime check the post offices!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYDailyNews That guy that stepped right in front of him is my hero.  He was ready to body check him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Popehat @ProjectLincoln Here's the deal, did they even help?  I totally expected their efforts to make this more of a landslide.  And I recognize they are indeed conservative republicans.  Enemy of my enemy type deal.  All good. Because what they aren't is the part of the GOP of hate and racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crupicrupicrupi Why, they are so obnoxious to listen to and my Tweeps know more and say it in 180 or less characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshdcaplan  https://t.co/Y5LBoajHQo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump HA, he ruins the integrity since inauguration by lying about fraud and illegal immigrants voting and now he says "damage is done".  DUDE, you are the damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @staceyabrams I don't think it will be low.  Those terrorists have good information networks.  It will be a fight.  But we can win it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 My joy comes from knowing he's upset and may soon go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB That guy is a piece of work. Guarantee he walks around in camo and tactical gear and a beer gut like he thinks he's God's gift to women.   "You are a criminal" gives me George Zimmerman angry vigilante terrorist vibes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May she guide him from above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blaireerskine I hope that bitch is right! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrodyLogan @chestnut_daniel "Where were we? What was the last question?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertjdenault @HC_Richardson Well, and he's riling up his terrorist organization to do the dirty work for him in WI and PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Oh Sweetie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycetache Conservative Californians moving to Texas might have made it redder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@likeagirlinc Only because he's got a more disastrous scenario lined up.  He'll open TrumpTV and create his chaos that way.    But maybe he'll leave but he's still not leaving "graciously".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get ready, Tea Party and their racist ilk are gonna gear up to take midterms in 2022.  We start that fight next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandaceTX I think, like the TikTokkers, they mess with polls and skew them to blue like Trojans (and not the good kind)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a white woman, I cannot thank you enough.  I promise I did all I can, but it's going to take white men to change self hating white women's minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hunterw @MillenPolitics Priceless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freedomrideblog If Bernie had been the nominee, trump would have a landslide victory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Crying and virtually hugging!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cali_gators @Shoq We "assume".  And I'm not one for assuming anything right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmraff @CabalClair @DemWrite Defund police and kill oil/gas narrative helped scared white people vote for trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemWrite Runoffs, not special election. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Oh, irregularities like counting ALL the votes?  NOW he wants counting after election day.  Funny how that happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k HEY, we white women need help getting those women to understand their selfsuppression.  Only men can do that it seems.  Too much self hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmVoteDem I can.  Upstate NY and OH super white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And white women, (except me and my friends and tweeps) suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal Please GA..   Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a BIDEN WIN means with a Trump senate:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaddCompani Um, wait until you find out the civilians are ex cops or their spouses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CajunBlueAZ1 @cwall1221 The media and trump painted a very plausible narrative that was amplified by trusted sources.  Add uneducated conspiracy lovers and boom....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CajunBlueAZ1 @cwall1221 Their information is vastly different from ours. If all you got was Q, OAN, FOX you'd feel justified. They are propagandists, manipulators, it's a systematic driver.  Yes, you have to have a slightly black heart, but there was a time even I believed the CP5 were guilty 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattholt33 @andrewdgravy What's the threshold?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonNYC5yve @EugeneLeeYang @thekoreanvegan Oh.  Sorry.  No sleep.  I didn't even pay attention to the actual number.  I just know for a fact my nephews are radicalized buttwipes because of their parents.  I said what I said, BIL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonNYC5yve @EugeneLeeYang @thekoreanvegan Their racist parents have a huge affect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmandoNDK No more counting except for my counting when the counting isn't the counting I wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta He can't afford it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@steve_vladeck @BabyTrump11 One more time for those in the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Cause people voting for Dems mailed in their ballots.  It's pretty straight forward actually.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSignorile you said you were going to bed.  Oh, so did I.  oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar ok, call me if anything important happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews "Wah wah wah wah...I wanna win and I'm gonna say I won even though I haven't...wah wah wah."   Is that about right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShireenKahlon Texas is too gerrymandered, too much in oil and Abbotts pocket.  Too suppressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDratch Oy, the rash!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaddyFiles I never believed a single one.  I never will again after 2016.  I think people lie to pollsters to mess up the whole system.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Texas fights uphill in a tornado each time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbluvoter @realDonaldTrump Excellent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSignorile Same.  Getting harder at this hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's not going to work.  WE understand how voting works.  How ballots are cast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johncusack It's taking more than words tonight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Was this a surprise tho?  We need the unexpected ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KildayMorgan Oh GOOD, I said no without thought.  What do I win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiveThirtyEight @TrinityMustache This is called HELL scenario.  And I say NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McWordNerd @DirkSchwenk Well, remember MI hasn't counted mail ins, right?  I have hope for MI.  I think it's going for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k @20thgrader I'm going to just hang on this belief to get me through tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McWordNerd @DirkSchwenk They pledged loyalty to trump and the Russians rigged it for them.  Has to be.  Susan collins is NOT popular in her state.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC Mitch winning, I get.  Polling never really gave Amy a chance.  Jaime was different.  Something smells.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally f*ckin good news.  He takes office Nov. 30th, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC That's exactly what I thought when Lindsey won.  Something is definitely not right here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DontGetComplacent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtticusGF It's just panic and nerves.  Trying to prepare oneself in case the GOP steals it.   But the votes will favor Biden, by a long shot.

<|startoftext|>Thoughts and....uh?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MitchLandrieu I hope your state, with all it's hurricanes, has been able to get voters safely to the polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 Trump is the typical Biff.  Joe would flatten him with the word BOO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You know what, if it motivates people to go vote, so be it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craydaysinusa @MattMurph24 GOPers are election day voters.  They treat it like Superbowl Sunday.  Even though they won't give us a holiday for it.  But they will surge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 What did obama win by in 2008?  Gerrymandering in States has gotten worse so the affect of popular national vote is diminished.   But I hear you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just keeps giving more reasons to fire TRUMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this is sure to win over NYC for trump, f*ck with the ability to commute.  #TrumpTerrorists<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Magic14272090 @StephenMCarter4 @mjs_DC @MillenPolitics Texas doesn't count provisionals.  They need to be told and allowed to vote IN PERSON on Tuesday.  But what really should happen is Harris County should just count the damn votes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Thirteen out of the top 15 states found to be most dependent on the federal government voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Ten out of the 15 least dependent states voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. " 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity States that voted Democrat in 2016 generally rely less on federal funding than Republican states, according to...

<|startoftext|>@MMFlint Dude I would totally walk 500 miles to be sure I voted for Biden. I think you are totally out of touch now.  YES, there is trump love, but there is much more America love and Biden will win.  The only thing that will change that is GOP cheating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxMulder010 @johncusack No, I never said I wasn't pushing Biden.  I merely mentioned there was much work to do and I wasn't going back to more complacency.  This includes getting out the last remnants of trump enablers.  I don't mind having to spell it out for the people in the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Seriously, I just read a bunch of trumpers on facebook talking about how Jill was Beau's babysitter.  She didn't meet him until three years after the accident.

<|startoftext|>@jamisonfoser @joanmccarter Newflash:  Big Oil is already investing in and researching clean energy.  That's why they are called "Energy companies" now.  With biden in place it and subsidies they will ramp it up.  They know that oil/gas can't last forever.  It's finite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msambone @ABC7NY Yes, but then your paid amount reflects that prepay.  So his $750 federal tax is still ALL he paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizMair Even if in your wildest dreams he won this debate.  Tell me, What's his healthcare policy then?  What's his covid response going forward?  What's the plan for all the unemployed people facing eviction.  BAAAAMP.  Wrong.  He has crap and his performance here was crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkranites @Shoq Yes, he's a shyster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly And it's one of the reasons I voted for him.  YAHOOOO!  Go Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious trump only knows what hannity tells him to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom @BlueNRedState No, he said "Go ahead"  to the moderator.  BUt he slurs so bad who could tell.  and it's like him to say "Good" because he's horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden YES!  Way to go Joe.  Fossil fuels are going to run out, we need a new plan.  Even Exxon knows this.  Time to begin clean energy plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZPFleming I mean, could YOU be any more disgusted really?  It's not hard to maintain status quo when trump is firmly planted to the bottom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZPFleming Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bri4change2020 Word is it wasn't "Good" it was "go ahead" to the moderator.  Good sounds like something he wanted to say though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC This is where I'm getting that... "What Are the Rules for Trump and Biden’s Last Debate? Each candidate will be muted during his opponent’s opening answers, but after that, it may be another free-for-all."  https://t.co/uKumhBWKBX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly You are correct it's actual about 130,000 of that 220,000  https://t.co/yOhqJTndZU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany Socialized medicine?  Really?  Kinda like the UK where EVERYONE has health insurance?  Yeah, let's do that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC They can't!  I mean they could, but it was in the agreement that they can't do it after the first 2 min response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_FisherKing @MattMurph24 It's part of the agreement.  2 minute mute only.  Then they can freestyle out of control.  This was what trump wanted and biden agreed to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr What's that?  https://t.co/AcjkKeBa1Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC She has no control because that's the agreement.  She has to let them "Freestyle" after the first 2 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious  https://t.co/cFMnsoxTlp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@republiculos Agreement was only for 1st 2 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious Because the agreement for muting was ONLY the first two minutes.   This is why he agreed to it.  He knew he would run ramrod over the rest of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zac_Petkanas He wrote the next Biden ad with that one.  Can't wait to see what @ProjectLincoln  does with it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC Oh, the tweets that will follow this debate.  LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 I'm waiting for the IRS tweet about this BS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking at you  @chucktodd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews I..Don't...Care. Until you show your taxes, tell us about who you owe half a billion dollars to, how Kavanaugh's debts were paid off, your relationship with a SCOTUS son with ties to Deutsche bank, and many more corrupt dealings.  I...don't...CARE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanspicer @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden The trick is, Joe can actually probably response.  Life long practicing Catholic, you know.  A real Christian, not this "made for TV" schtick trumps got going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity No one cares so it makes sense she doesn't want to waste our time.  Now, let's talk a little about Trump's chinese bank accounts and Federal taxes.  Why is he REFUSING to show them 4 years later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn She's a plant!  Gimme a break.  Plucked from university job by trump handlers to lead us into fascism.  She's only a judge because of the stint "he" got her.  Are you complicit in this charade?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SHARRON76003070 @hoaxtrump9993 Lesson learned!  Let'e not do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've had 10 years.  They don't have a plan because they don't care about Americans and their health.  They only love their own money and power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nypost Who do you owe Half a Billion dollars to?  Where are you r taxes?  Why are your children, who couldn't pass security clearance, working for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LWarnstedt @atrupar She said like 3 sentences.  Methinks you are projecting on her.  She's saying the president of the USA should be a strong person able to handle tough questions.  And that's the truth.  If you can't handle this you cannot handle the job.  (He can't.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardTHardy Instead of helping unemployed and homeless during a pandemic they gallivant around the country on our dime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes Wow, just hit send, man.   You don't have to say squat.  I can't believe someone in your position has to be taught that.  Very foolish tweet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@evanasmith @QuinnipiacPoll @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @JohnCornyn @mjhegar Just telling the bubble on twitter to vote isn't what's going to do it.  Talk to that neighbor who leans center, encourage someone who is too discouraged to vote, drive someone who may easily give up if weather inclement or the wheel of fortune is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley How does a congressperson as old as you not understand this doesn't fall under First Amendment?  HOLY crap.  That's basic 6th grade social studies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoYouEvenLif @MeidasTouch Trumpers have yet to fully vote.  They are going to swarm the polls the last week and Election Day.  To them it's no different than a football comeback.  Make it so they can never catch up!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery That he did.  Trump destroys everything he touches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texyellowdogdem a few times.  So much so I had to finally stop Jamie's texts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo This is a man, who lost his other two children and this son's mom.  This is all he has and he loves him that's for sure.  Thank your lucky stars your family hasn't seen such trauma to be able to understand this photo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Ha, as if you can cage that power hungry maniac.  Your circus, your clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec I thought you people were all in a huff because no one talks about pedophilia and trafficking enough.  So here we are, what's the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrams80 @inetsoho @realDonaldTrump And that ain't me.  And if I *did make that much I'd be okay with helping feed, house and educated my fellow Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texyellowdogdem This one is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewdgravy Yup, they *want* end times because they think they are going somewhere good.  (Narrator:  But they are not)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz No one is buying this BS.  Okay, maybe the cult is, but Dems, Independents and ex-republicans aren't.   Your bill is for Billionaires and a blank check for Trump.  NOPE NOPE NOPE.  GO DEMS!!  GO PELOSI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC @GaryPeters Are any fighting for their political lives?  Which is the closest race?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdHull8 @AnnieGabstonH They are going to mess with it all they can to stop that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Like a true republican, money is never enough and once you "Get yours" you poop on the people from back home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald tweeted out a photos of the BLANK book of his accomplishments.  Does he think no one can zoom in?  And he's in charge of our executive branch?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcuban Now Mark?  Now, this is your flex?  Come on, man.  FOCUS.  You know damn well you don't want trump in.  Save your proselytizing for Jan 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d So, if this is public, imagine what the Russians have on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now the new TrumpCult narrative is that the FBI does indeed have Hunter's laptop, the "porn" but are going to erase everything to protect Biden.  DEAR GOD, this cult of trump is so deranged.  There's no lie they won't tell to keep their Russian conspiracies going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadhist @shannonrwatts Yeah, sorry.  This devoted practicing Catholic loves and accepts you just as God made you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steverocks35 They have to have evidence against him in this regard.  This is why he is doing all these things for the Russians and trumpco. That has to be the explanation.  Someday we'll know for certain, that's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregkellyusa @JoeBiden Actually he's got my vote for his courage, empathy, bipartisanship, kindness, aptitude, military respect, foreign policy understanding, infrastructure plans, healthcare policy, LGBTQIA compassion, racial equality, values.  I'm sorry, if forgot what was your stupid point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BOOM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone notice how much the trump boys are ramping up their bile today?  I've never seen them on twitter as much as daddy until this week.  Totally desperation and last gasps from such a criminal family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H_MitchellPhoto @gabreyman @realDonaldTrump Здравствуйте<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This IS the most horrific fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Are those 5 people lying, conspiratorial and working with Russian disinformation?  If so you are right, they shouldn't be tweeting either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You are so jealous of Hunter.  And of Joe's unconditional love of his son.  I'm sorry your didn't get any of that, but please keep it in the family.  Stop foisting your family dysfunction on the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq Like TX it's a pipe dream.  The cult is real and it's feeding on it's propaganda.  The hunter story has traction in those states because they want it to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadhist @shannonrwatts Many many Catholic families have gay and transgender children.  The times are definitely changing.  She is slow to change but She does.   The Church cannot survive if it doesn't evolve to be totally inclusive, which let's be honest is what Jesus said!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the trump Catholics will hate him for it.  But we know what they can do with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Brian, how can he do this?  Who has the interview rights?  How can he "post" it?  Is it bluster?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbouzy Lie down with dogs wake up with fleas, mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on, QUEENS!  Even Don's birth county rejects his lying cheating hateful bigoted grifting ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle And the smart people in America know that Donald and his family are owned by Russia and China.  And there is tangible proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know they have plans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love this Church Schumer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytimes What does that even mean, "I will post it"?  How does HE have the interview to post?  What a wackjob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn Pinky swear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich Let's talk about Donalds secret Chinese bank account, who put 17M in there?  It's inconceivable that any American would carry the water for this kind of potentially dirty politician.  But here ya go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They make ultra tampons now, for those ultra heavy flow days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BIdenHarris2020  Trump and his minions will not be allowed to continue ruining this country.  We stop this now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump If "Did more" means destroy the country.  Yes, I agree DJT did more of that, all of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Not for nothing, but I thought we knew that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ColorArousal @RealKHiveQueenB Truth.  At this point voting for most cultists is no different than their life altering need for weekly tailgate parties.   They have built a strong coalition of "because this is what we do" that just does without thinking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomWGiles1 @lilDesigner_EM @Shelbygirl1955 @donwinslow Let me introduce you to a man named Mitch McConnell - the admitted king of obstruction.  He brags about how much he obstructed Obama, and just last week laughed with hannity how he has packed the courts and obstructed Dem bills.  Please don't tell stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomWGiles1 @lilDesigner_EM @Shelbygirl1955 @donwinslow Have you met the man?  For decades he has been a difficult controlling troll boy.  His whole life has been built around using and abusing the NY media.  When you are a trust fund baby you can spend your time on stupid stuff like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomWGiles1 @lilDesigner_EM @Shelbygirl1955 @donwinslow What has he gotten done that he hasn't undone some other way?  Or did because he messed it up to begin with?  Or made look like he did something when he didn't - NK and Middle East?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilDesigner_EM @Shelbygirl1955 @donwinslow Anyone who thought trump would do well was going on his highly edited Hollywood persona.  Those in NYC knew what a village idiot he really is.  A con, a grifter, a joke.  He literally does not have the capacity to lead. And this was where propaganda worked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shirley_I_Jest @PeteButtigieg No, I actually think his role for Biden this particular year has been stellar.  And with that he has a good shot in the future.  Maybe we can keep the white house for decades!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@asunlovingmom @TheJaneMorales @sofiamhidalgo And shoving them back under their rocks is the whole point.  They've always been there.  They've been emboldened.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Anyone who worked at courts in NYC in the 90s knew he was nuts.  He treated it like his personal vendetta machine.  And always wanted media involved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal @AdiosMcconnell I used to be a peaceful person.  Now, the idea of kick 'em when they are down is a defensive mantra.  The damage they have wrought demands it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Spread the $$$$  Cornyn needs to GO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza You are projecting for the ignorant.  Trumps are well known in their association with NYC crime families.   It's not even a discussion to have.  Stop with the BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MiaFarrow I see it now!  All these years trump has been trying to look and be JFK and failing miserably.  I always thought he was going for Gotti.  He has no personality of his own though, that's a fact.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, and when Biden is president he'll know how to use that positive test data to slow the spread and get our economy back into recovery.  Thanks for showing us more of what you don't understand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is NOT the same as screaming "Lock him up" to a poltical opponent.  This is saying all the illegal actions in his life have caught up and have consequences.  You don't get a "Get outta jail free" card with the presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman You give me so much hope.  I have plenty of republican friends who just differed with me on policy in enough ways, but knew they were rational and intelligent people.  Like you they have left the party while it continues this way and voted #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetPea1636 Why are you all suggesting SweetPea to hire this racist woman instead of an unemployed *deserving nurse during the covid crisis?  This isn't a time for games, people are desperate for work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So trump can do all things illegal, including fraud and tax evasion but because he was ONCE a president he cannot pay the legal consequences?  I think not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews He's always jealous of Dems and *real rich people.  And it shows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@megynkelly You trying to get rehired on FOX when there's a Dem admin again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly Oh, you're one of THOSE women.  Of course you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Aced it, despite the misogyny from Pence.  But we knew you would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast @tx_nyer YES! This thrills me.  He's so unhinged it will be nothing but fodder for the next 25 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Most Likeable by white patriarchal out of touch old guys, sure.  Average American....aw hell no.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickSmithShow But trump said it would be free to everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom @bryanbehar Pence doesn't get to ask the questions either.  What a male bs move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio WTF is that visual? Anyway... Clearly the woman who is only 5 years younger than the guy who looks and acts ready for a crypt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden She was too busy fighting interruptions from the self righteous patriarchy, which you seem to be member of too, oddly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSmithShow @MHerskovitz @producersguild She's only 5 yrs younger than pence.  Stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes Chris, but a man might say that.  But women will remember.  Fuck the patriarchy and their damn crusty old misogynous white male evangelicals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outofcontroljb @ProjectLincoln I knew they should have done the earpiece check<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeRich44 It's an earpiece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FarmerGran @itsWanda Actually, he's a calculated manipulative sob.  And he's smarter than trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile They smell bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@republiculos He said it far better than that.  See if you can find it.  It was an analogy with pilots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@republiculos Soon to be Senator Kelly pointed out in his debate.  It was like the Trump administration did step one of a detailed emergency plan and stopped right there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FionaPrine and he's only 5 years older than Momala.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Trump is a liar and conman.  No way I'd believe him and inject something he hawks.  That's just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @Mike_Pence If he's the voice for the admin, you guys are SCREWED.  Say hi to Jaime for me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fantasmavoid @pinky_or_brain And I'm here for it.  Or at the VERY least control it and it's waste better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar GOD, he so fake.  Like I thought it could have worked.  THe whole "in our hearts" schtick.  But he's a caricature of a old white racist elite politician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm @jaxbeachmarsh Yep.  He plays the part very well.  If you like old white stuffy out of touch science denying evangelicals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 You can tell Kamala wants to stand!   And is physically able to.  What was Pences purpose here?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tangazo @titodinzey @TimOBrien I am not convinced they aren't going to cheat into a win.  Why is he pulling out of midwest?  Makes no sense.  Maybe the "know" they've got it in the bag?  So jaded.  Just so jaded.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KevinMKruse @JoseyRider It's so nice of Ben to give us opportunity on his twitter account to share ALL of the widely available information about Joe's policies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Thanks for giving the opportunity for Dems to share the vast array of policy issues Biden has laid out in detail.  Trumps policies - "Stay out of jail, stay alive".  https://t.co/tiV5vMKMMC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro I guess you missed the ENTIRE Town Hall in Florida last night in which Biden answered beautifully about his policies in detail.  You were too busy jerking off to Mr Gaspsalot's a contamination of my White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Had trump and gop actually led on Covid we'd be over it by now.  But as we see Pence couldn't even manage a covid outbreak in the WH.  What an inept tool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Anti_Fox @mmpadellan And what's the mean without the stray, likely lie, 11?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Anti_Fox @mmpadellan I repeat, VOTE like Biden's down by 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Anti_Fox @mmpadellan Quinnapac lying to spur voter apathy.  Not gonna work dudes.   Vote like Biden's down by 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics1com That's actually a pretty damning example of how far the republican party has fallen from reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidaxelrod @JoseyRider Let's test that upper limit, shall we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Folks, just ignore the psychopath with the cell phone.  Think of it as preparation for when he's out of office.  Just another old racist loud mouth with nothing of value to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar Let's be honest, do we WANT to see him?  I don't even want to see his tweets.  It's actually better this way.  Let's coast into Nov. 4th with a silent sedated WH resident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heard on @Thom_Hartmann show today.  You can go to  https://t.co/0nphoc0O9t, Click Volunteer and you will be given a S.

<|startoftext|>@AdrianeZane No it was Ivana<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for them.  I'd have volunteered to help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln I love your petty with trump.  Live for it some mornings.  But when Biden is president and you disagree on economic policy can we go back to being adults and work toward dialogue and compromise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln NO please don't call it out of the dungeon!!  PLEASE!!!  #WhereIsTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keysfins @kurteichenwald And I have never felt less pity for anything or anyone.  Maybe I can feel something for the child he once was, but all his adult decisions have been his own.  May he reap what he has sown.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ I will never listen to this.  I'll never listen to his voice again. He's gone to me.  Done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible town hall tonight.  Let Joe know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Absolutely.  ANd it's the reason jackass wanted out of the hospital  Controlling the narrative otherwise more people would have heard about the Town Hall and learned how incredible its going to be with Biden as president.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump How much does he hate his staff and secret service that he would do this BS?  Either he doesn't have COvid and you are all playing a game, or he does and is an even more disgusting and self centered person than realized.  And you abet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theserfstv We are the ones being manipulated.  $421M in debt, Ivanka as "consultant", SCOTUS bs...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoguePOTUSStaff This isn't any patient.  If trump is unable to perform his job  at at least 95% because of "therapeutic" side effects, fever, or other intervention, we need to know.  Our government is run by more than one person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@infobrat @KeithOlbermann @nytimes We haven't, but Myopic Media has.  Ergo, the general non-twitter population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Your heart?  Gurl, as long as dems and BiPOC were dying you were fine about lying and covering for CovidTrump.  You are just as culpable in the over 200,000 deaths as he is.  But do sleep well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Out5p0ken @grinningbamE @KellyannePolls She said they are all sick in the tiktok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious No one screws with Claudia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbump @LungMD01 Any Secret Service?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGoldberg @PeterAtlantic Is it really that hard for you?  Maybe a new line of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lark2rule  https://t.co/mkgv8zS1Zr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithOlbermann @infobrat @nytimes Gone is his $421M debt.  Gone is the anti Christmas Melania.  Gone is the Russian bounties. Gone is the disaster of a debate....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gnuseibeh @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Biden is a gentleman, and that's why we have to fumigate the WH and get him in office NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBeauloux @lacadri34 GOOD.  He should feel the fear that families have been feeling since March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated The doctor calls him first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar And trump campaign promptly trashed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatInWorldNews @Yamiche Because no other American going to a covid unit gets to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche I get all these USSR vibes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's gonna survive this and act like their messiah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjljongen He's walking so I'm going back to my theory that this is reality tv.  Did you know he owns someone $421M?  His wife hates Christmas.  And he lost the debate to Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabreyman @mrbromwich Who says she can't get reinfected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff or guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxwelltani @Rschooley OMG, the spin with these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steverocks35 Amen, I want him to see how badly he loses to Biden.  Then go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem Cause she never lies. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She does say *I*.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Texas, are you really gonna vote this guy in?  Not only does he lie, he's a doctor who doesn't know Asymptomatic from Asymptotic or Comorbities from Comorbidities.  Lazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tkhaskin @Arcticwolff @DonaldJTrumpJr You were saying....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious Dammit. I want to vote him out.  I want him to go to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff He's also a germaphobe and wimp.  He's probably having panic attacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Well she shouldn't.  Everyone else doesn't get their spouses at their bedside.  He must experience what the average american does.  Maybe then he'll understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfreewright I am so damn jaded.  I'm still skeptical of what they are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious I get the abundance of caution, but this sh*t is moving fast from "asymptomatic" to "Precaution at WR"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking Melania unleashed the wrath of some dead First Ladies when she tore up that Rose Garden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saintsbebe @LouisianaGov @RobAnderson2018 @POTUS And I definitely don't wish death on him.  A) it's bad juju.  B) I want to see him lose the election and end up  in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saintsbebe @LouisianaGov @RobAnderson2018 @POTUS Nope.  If he recovers he'll claim it was nothing and he is the best recoverer of all time.  Better than any, and the magic pill he took, sold by Jared's company is the one everyone should buy.  Narcissists don't do anything to benefit anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobCusack @Politics1com Reality TV at it's finest.   Production working hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious Exactly.  It's all "reality tv"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast @Politics1com And they want us to be sympathetic.  That would be a no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Yesterday it was "no symptoms",, then this morning mild, now we are at moderate? Hmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC @realDonaldTrump Odd how he hasn't been whining about it.  It's refreshing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Get in bed, you are delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenTDennis @nycsouthpaw So is the saying they are lying about their diagnosis?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find him NY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnyJackson4TX And yet today oddly they have "mild" symptoms.  No one believes you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei There's also the one about the boy who was watching sheep and kept crying wolf for attention until the wolf actually came and ate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw @realDonaldTrump Who does trump owe $451M?   Why does Melania hate Christmas and migrant children in cages?    Who paid off Kavanaugh's debts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress Why would you wish well the man who lied and tried to destroy you?  Who is a birther, misogynist and a racist.  He's reaping what he sowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress They wear masks and understand science, so no, not odd at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobHeilbrunn @realDonaldTrump GTFOH with this BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FosterMeshel46 @di_lynne @FLOTUS Yes! They are a hateful couple, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoguePOTUSStaff Is @SpeakerPelosi safe?  @RepAdamSchiff ?  @SenSchumer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarlOfEnough @fred_guttenberg For now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not how this works!  That's not how any of this works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlaMorgan01 @funder Over 205,000 people suffered before their death.  If he can feel at least what they felt it still wouldn't be justice.  His lies cost lives and have debilitated people for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @titodinzey So far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump @DancingMare Amen.  Preach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Resisters, continue to do whatever spiritual, humanistic, or religious things you do to keep this status quo.  We love you, Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjaninemorison Light the candles, pray the beads, dance naked.  Whatever it takes people. Code RED, CODE RED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeFor45589103 @tbluvoter @jaketapper @sarahmucha Wait, they were NEARER to the Bidens than when he was on stage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiagoldengal @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS She was not masked all the time.  God, is lying all you people do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zac_Petkanas When did we start to believe what he says?  https://t.co/lzWXwcNNSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisianaGov @RobAnderson2018 @POTUS Not until they experience what over 211,000 American's had to experience before their deaths.  All those people did not have to die, except for how he intentionally mislead and made blue state governors beg.  Well, let's see some BEGGING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish Joe had had a mask on Tuesday!  Dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HubertJ40429163 @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Well, tell that to the people who lost parents while this buttwipe was lying to the American people about the disease's severity.   He gets NO pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cameron_kasky People who have lost parents, who had to be alone at their deaths, scared and begging for supplies, are not upset with you.  They are saying a lot more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff And we aren't even sure he has it or it's a hoax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @tbluvoter Yeah, and if he got Joe sick....I can't even think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @docrocktex26 Lemme tell you.  I despise trump so much, but if he got Joe sick, there is a WHOLE nother level of anger I did not know about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smotus I don't normally, but every refresh brought something new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JPopStrikesBack @grinningbamE Hell I'm not sure it's not a hoax.  He lies about *everything*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather @gabreyman How can we ever believe this boy who cried wolf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joangreeneaz @vodaeau I'm not convinced yet.  I'll wait and see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Well, we didn't have to wait until morning. Glad we stayed up.  Now to figure out how to not look like poop in the am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how exhausted by manipulation we are by this admin.  No one is 100% sure it's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenidraRWoods_ Right, in his mind people who get it are losers and suckers.  Weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isteintraum If he's even telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldengateblond Mine too.  Such a manipulative SOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isteintraum He may not have even typed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 I'm positive I'm going to keep refreshing this page and be a freakin zombie in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How crazy is it that at this point, I'm not even sure if I believe him HERE?  I wouldn't put it passed his team.  Let's wait and see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithOlbermann He says it like he can order it to recover immediately.  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charliebdachef @TheresaLos2020 @mmpadellan Welp, I may get that wish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightImageLV @AdrienneMH2425 @JoeBiden I know this is why I won't wish anything bad on the WH.  I don't want that karma bouncing to Joe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Who do you owe $451M to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charliebdachef @TheresaLos2020 @mmpadellan I would never wish someone dead.  That is bad juju.  But a wretched cough, no taste and smell, the fear. Oh yeah, he needs to experience it for every person he let get this thing with his negligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan I can't even sleep.  Look at us! Look at the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden @gabreyman Well, I'm not resting until it's completely disassembled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump To whom does Donald owe $400M?  What do they have on him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES, we can multitask.  Who does Trump owe $400M  and what do they have on him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBegala @markos Holy crap.  It's so incredibly intentional and out in the open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HA, I couldn't have time two news bombshells to coincide so perfectly.  A covid WH and Sex Harassment job loss for this wacko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather @PemaYongchen Someone threw in more kindling too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vodaeau Turn about is fair play.  https://t.co/2SNXrvNmxz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta @chestnut_daniel Hannity told him to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabyace @megsyhoops @JayParkerW25 Well, since he governs like a racist and supports racist tactics, and has always been a racist, and needs the votes of racists.  Yup yup, you're all racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trumpanhator2 I'm actually a little concerned about his proximity to he maskless Klan at the debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i Also, with the best free medical care in the world.  We should all be a 10th as lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Trust me, I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump DUH, you tested her didn't you?  Don't you know the numbers only go up when you take tests.  First rule of Covid Club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vodaeau They are literally accounts made in the last month.  Cultists are stupid and gullible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 Wait, SHIT, so  they exposed Joe?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyAmerican1 It would be nice if he were still coughing, achy and miserable WHILE the results come in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kate10010 @yashar I quickly realized while pregnant it was better to get everyone on board so that if I did lose the baby I'd have a support system.  Otherwise, it's not "real" to anyone, it's new news and no one was invested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 Keep kicking while they are down.  Don't let up, Karma!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryTilton6 @gabreyman @spettypi I think the men (and maybe women?) wanted to hug Hope.  That I believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atmebruhh @sam_vinograd Not very.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Meh, it's just a ploy to get out of the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amBlueJay @politvidchannel I cant hear it now... She poisoned them with the Covid.  They had it from the Chinese all along.  (Seriously, I could see Pirro doing this.  Or Jones)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steverocks35 I'm not popping the champagne until Jan 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joyce_Karam @MattMurph24 Why are they doing a picture montage like she's dead.  This is a little sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@infobrat Damn, I bet she's a really peach at Easter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeauCulpepper @docrocktex26 Thank you for caring more about the country than your "team".  Because that logic is self-destructive as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garteej @RRfeaturespdx @NateSilver538 You have this recurring dream too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michelleinbklyn @pissandvinegar1 Because viral load isn't high enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03Bisola @papifatstax @RealtorCorin @mattmfm And worse than that, she's whining that "Obama did it" but doesn't realize that means she thinks it's BAD and her husband is also doing it.  Godt they are stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSheaCat @RexChapman Joined Aug 2020?  Hmmm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RexChapman Forming on the left?  Shit, I didn't get Soro's newsletter this week.  Do I have to contact Antifa headquarters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlowNYC They'll paint her as the victim she's pretending to be here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSmithShow @BillyRay5229 And so do we.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they all this gross?  Look folks, sex is GREAT, but if you have to harass to get it you are doing it all wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman A mix of adrenaline and caution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 What the hell is it with these people and flags?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@in_pubs The reaper will not wait that long to collect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rountry_alice @W7VOA @sethjlevy Wait, we still have federal laws in this country?  Nah, I think we get to ignore this one to make up for the 100s they've ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@W7VOA @K8TDidToo Would the result show that fast?  I mean, don't your antibodies have to build for 5 days?  Will you retake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@papifatstax @RealtorCorin @mattmfm I see her point.  She was saying "Gimme a fucking break" about the her perceived disparity that Obama had done the same thing.  But we know he hadn't and we know with narcissists comes this BS "I"m so persecuted" crap.  Always the victims, these trumps. Give ME a break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattmfm What an odd take for such a "Christian" family.  Talk about Gimme a Break!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Me_llamo_Catz @GrandpaKardash1 @grantstern @DanCrenshawTX Hell, it's true for NY Italians too.  I've disassociated from half my relatives and old friends.  All of a sudden they act like their shit doesn't stink. Hey, paesan, your grandmother came here on a boat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad he's on our team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey NYC, if you are in need a some cash or justice, ID this guy for money from Crimestoppers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SykesCharlie And Hope Hicks is positive for Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Is this why Wisconsin canceled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandpaKardash1 @grantstern @DanCrenshawTX This is true for immigrants in America as well.  They stand on the backs of the folks who came before them to blend in and be considered American and then poop on those who come after.  (Not all, just explaining the ones who do.  White solidarity is a powerful drug.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandpaKardash1 @grantstern @DanCrenshawTX A house slave had a better bed, working conditions and kept his family together. The field slave got a dirt floor, harsh work and his home torn apart, so the house slave will always back up the master against his counterpart when it comes to his own comfort &amp; life. People suck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shan_phil @JohnStossel Yet between us, we know 5 dead people.  And I'm guessing, none are the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shan_phil @JohnStossel Newsflash: We aren't Sweden.  AND "Sweden’s per capita death rate was 36 per 100,000, which is higher than the United States at 27"  But I'm not going to continue down this strawman path with you. Good luck to you. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, don't get so damn excited when you hear voter reg is at an all time high.  REGISTER BIDEN SUPPORTING PEOPLE and HELP THEM VOTE .  https://t.co/NGjv0eSyu8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shan_phil @JohnStossel But how does that change my point?  The reason we didn't have 2M was because of precautions taken.  250,000 is not an insignificant number of dead people as a result of the disease.  And that was with measures taken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe I'm retweeting the Mooch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shan_phil @JohnStossel Yeah, 3 here.  And 2 permanently damaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good ole days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity And you'll still screw it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shan_phil @JohnStossel How many people do you know personally who have died of Covid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @WSJ Texas ranks 47th in the nation for health care access.  This is why they are going to replace you with someone who gives a damn.  @mjhegar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Puhlease.  Watching it was bad for democracy.  Trump is bad for democracy.  Unless they muzzle him in between questions they are worthless.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrienneMH2425 @bryanbehar Someone who doesn't care about his own children.  Sociopaths have no capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious @ddale8 It's an intentional mislead.  Now viewers, who are not really into politics think that telemundo views support trump, so I guess maybe "they should too".  It's manipulative.  But I have faith that enough question this, and maybe get mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 @Darth_Spurious Telemundo must think Spanish speakers are stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VibeSoHigh @dad_darius @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper And it won't matter that he supported PB last night.  That WHY they love him.  But the truth is there are more of us than them, we just have to REGISTER AND VOTE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America, watch how this is done.  @SenSchumer, Do you denounce white supremacists groups?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTattooedProf Wrong would be 4 blondes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL...sometimes this is exactly what you need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics1com Too bad it has less electoral votes per capita than the middle states.  Stupid ass system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPM @JoseyRider OF course he did.  He also thinks he had more people at his inauguration.  We already know he's a delusional habitual liar.  Tell us something new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Says white supremacist attention hounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dailykos But how beautiful that trump got that much rope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@M1BCM @missymofo @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump And yet here you are on "twatter".  Funny how that works.  PS - Truth (and documented recording) are I guess the ultimate bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsingley @sedespres Well, we were and are yellers.  Loud blue collar NYC Italians.  But we know how to act for "company".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this only true in America?  Oh, right, it's run by crazed white supremacists and bolstered by the Russian NRA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA My life does not depend on a gun or the NRA.  You are mass murderer accomplices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaLouCole @RoLwillwin @danielsgoldman Yes, trump needs a babysitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @M1BCM You did this on purpose because you know you are going to lose if people get to vote properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1BCM @missymofo @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump The person who doesn't know how a rebroadcast of the debate calls someone else an idiot.  And things the ACTUAL footage is ultimate bias.  MMMkay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want you to notice BIDEN did not take a urine test and trump still showed up. Trump's all bark.  Stupid annoying yappy "just shut the hell up, man" bark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missymofo @M1BCM @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Trumpers are so lazy they can't even Google for something all over the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edontheweeknd @Richard25914627 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump His "wall".   I can't believe what suckers he has in his cult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Jeff, they do.  He's being painted as a victim today.  Poor poor Donald.  (I don't get it, is he the superhero they worship or a fawning baby they need to protect.  His cult is f*cked up)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Unlike you I'm not abandoning the City, because it's not in the state you want to pretend.  That said, glad as hell you left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoKnowsNews @tbluvoter @CBSNews Clearly polls are BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPicat @ArmandoNDK Yes, but she also let him get away with so much (especially the creepy stalking) and we see where that got her.  Doesn't matter Trumps group is all going to say he won tonight anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billmaher @pissandvinegar1 And one old talk show guy tweeting about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPicat @ArmandoNDK Biden's not bad, but I have the luxury of wishing some things were different because I'm not in such close proximity to that maggot in front of millions of people.  I'm the queen of wishing I had sad something when I think about it 20 minutes later. Or lying in bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Salon @JoeMyGod This is why you mention and it was all an abysmal failure, Brok-a-hantus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPicat @ArmandoNDK Tensions high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 So 20% got help and we say he "helped small business?"  Even when so much of that STILL went to major corps?  Give me a freakin break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPicat @ArmandoNDK Yes, Biden started a little wobbly, but he looks at camera, trump picks at him.  So who is the leader?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shereentrvlschp @lenapple Will he come back for the others?  I feel like he'll want to.  Trump HATES to lose.  He'll hit harder and uglier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse trump and Co. will still say he "won"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shereentrvlschp @lenapple He wants to leave that stage so badly.  Walk out.  Just like he does whenever he can't handle things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lenapple I think he's doing that job all by himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko "This is so unpresidential"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonWDC So Joe's doing well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman I think you meant if Trump remains president everything is going to get more expensive for the working folk of America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard Get a dog.  You seem lonely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this.  You want in in a criminal enterprise, you pay the price when the truth comes out and the truth always comes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 @CatheRomano Biden has two deceased children.  And if trump does I'll put money in Biden's ActBlue account.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MJDubs73 @AndrewWolfe2012 @cmclymer This is true and we should pretend every one of those early ballots are for trump, but let's be honest.  He didn't gain supporters these last four years.  He only lost them.  We win by showing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightWingWatch The rantings of a woman who has NO idea that elections are watched by both parties and there's checks and balances on ballot numbers and quantity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It doesn't matter, they are SO transparent.  I had an excoworker email me some "important news she wanted to share" with links.  It was Q crap, but she never called it that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dustinfalgout @lacadri34 @elonmusk One vote.  We know he's voting for his money.  Let's not even pretend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump So, basically he's just a Hollywood celebrity and nothing more.  This must really tweak the red hats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darth_Spurious OMG! I've done that too!  Twinsies!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Who are you kidding?  You've literally destroyed our country.  Taking away freedoms, working to take away our healthcare, running us into financial ruin, and becoming an autocratic theocracy.  Please GO AWAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's nothing by the Hollywood Celebrity they all hate.  Oh the Irony. #TrumpIsBroke #TrumpIsALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was television.  It was all a lie.  It's phony and yet 63M people thought it meant he had half a brain and put him in charge of the whole damn country.  Revoke their citizenship. Send them to Russia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BushidoBlade61 @washingtonpost BS take.  His tax work shows illegal maneuvers.  It's fraud on top of bogus elite favoring tax laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care that he "paid less", I care that he DEFRAUDED our government and illegally helped his family.  Get the damn headline right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylerthecreator  https://t.co/iMIgrZYmM9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PoppyHarlowCNN @grinningbamE @BMorgenstern45 Honestly, I respect that you want to have guests on your show, but you were not explicit.  Next time: "Release the taxes, prove this is a lie"  on auto repeat.  He kept pulling you in all sorts of directions.  (Though I did love your defense of journos)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MottsNile @Tom_Winter Where is the resisting? (I'm not being sarcastic, like I just see a man talking to the cops, they never asked him to turn around, put his hands behind his back, etc.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tom_Winter Wait, he was "following orders" and was tackled?  I thought that was only reserved for black folk.  You mean police OVERDO for everyone?  Huh.  Look at that. Maybe the problem is police attack first mentality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSanders Which ones used the tax codes, which ones used fraud mixed with tax codes.  (Hint: Trump did the latter, fraud.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ida_skibenes @jreganwilliams It's not working.  He does have rabid violent cultists behind him, but the numbers have gone DOWN not up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeedumTweetle @MaxKennerly He doesn't donate shit.  He gives with one hand and grabs 100X more with the other.  Everything he does is a self serving farce and you people fall for it every damn time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilMirfy @MaxKennerly He was a civilian on the speaking tour for his expertise and books.  Are you anti-Capitalist when it suits you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxKennerly Trump may have paid employee Ivanka Trump $500,000 in "consulting" fees.  That's fraud.  BTW, why did Jared delete all his tweets after the story broke?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katearthsis @oc515 @nytimes They can dress and election, but NOT INTIMIDATE.  That is still illegal.  But who are you going to call when the government itself wants to intimidate?  So, fight back, barge through, vote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NotMikeDitka89 @TrinityMustache Abortion rates decline under Democratic (left) administrations.  Why?  Because people are better taken care of and the need declines.  THIS is how it works.  Desperate restricted people will still have abortions if they are "illegal".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aravosis This is what's going to happen.  Because trump seems to ALWAYS get what he wants.  He has no long term strategy except self preservation.  But I hear all your points.  I've donated, I tweet, I work elections, I will vote.  Not sure what else I can do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kathryncramer4 @mamabearannie @SenMcSallyAZ @EvanAKilgore So, access to healthcare, equality, fair wages, not locking children in cages, SSI, lower abortion rates....these are all offensive to you?

<|startoftext|>TrumpCult has to lie and trend #BidentheRapist because their Rapist genocidal dementia ridden maniac leader has been exposed.  Hates military, brown people, wounded vets, evangelicals, disabled....  All the deplorables were had! #ResignNowTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the GOP watched.  They are complicit in ALL of trumps crimes.  #ResignTrumpNow and vote out EVERY opposed republican from the top down to the dog catcher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU ARE THE DAMN AUTHORITIES.  omg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duty2warn Well, she sure loves screaming death death death when it comes to brown people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Let the lie fest begin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow HE'S LYING IN HIS ANSWER!  And deflecting.  #GenocidalTrump  #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR So, this is your response to trump knowing he was KILLING Americans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @PressSec THe press can bring him DOWN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we know why Kellyanne left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what fascism and autocracy look like folks.  It's not coming....it's here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumpmeltdown is still trending because that's all it's going to be through Jan 21.  It's all he can do. Losing his shit because he's been found out. #Loser #Sucker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@janhcolt @chestnut_daniel @ImmobileNoble @DzinerChristine @LeonaLioness6 This is my policy.  You are N.O.T wasting my energy on BS when I've got truth telling and GOTV to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quiksilver67 @KamalaHarris Straws are trash clogging our oceans.  Clean needles for addicts means risk management.  Admit it, GOP hates the world and people.  Only love money and power.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnitaNelam @Kat4Obama They don't care about 200,000 dead Americans.  They forgot about Russian hitmen and they don't believe "Suckers and Losers"  But this, this makes them cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labor Day - WORKERS Day.  But not for trump who has never worked a day in his miserable grifting corrupt life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Ratliff734 We need to assign a few good (and strong stomached) individuals in the resistance, like @atrupar does, to just give us the condensed version in real time.  Literally like 10-20 people only.  Networks would have no followers.  And FOX will be left showing his insanity alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet, the trump loyalists have made him untouchable.  This is bad folks, really bad.  This election literally means everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting misuse of the collar.  Clearly to this Bishop all lives don't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMartyBy1 @mmpadellan @RealJamesWoods Zero followers...save your energy folks. This one speaks from Mid-Asia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Um, because we've learned from the Black Plague, Spanish Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola....  This is seriously the most uneducated take one could make when trying to start a conspiracy theory. "Duh, but how did they KNOOOOOWWW contagious diseases exist, huh, tell me that?!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar #Rambling  #DementiaDon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PCee52 @TanyaGhanbari This doesn't seem to be a bad trade off in my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PCee52 @GypsysGrace I don't see how a bunch of MAGAs blocking me affects anything in my life in a negative way.  Please have at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue @jojoptyoga Because someone on HGTV told them it was what would make their lives happier and fuller. (Narrator: It doesn't)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Holy Sh*t, he's absolutely pathological.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA In all honesty, the few hispanics I know who love trump are all married to whites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX Boat parades, the symbol of the "oppressed white man".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @TriciaJJones Trump.  THE sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth @oliviakrauth Old news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_TownJester A few who owned up and apologized.  They cannot wrap their little racist brains around that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @TriciaJJones Be warned, trump enthusiasm is ramping the hell up. If we don't each get 5 people to vote for Biden who would have otherwise stayed home, nothing will be different in Jan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryMariMason1 @Rich3Dawg Where'd you find the backstory?  I'd like to read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYCwondergirl @Niknea @DeanBrowningPA @realDonaldTrump And is fluent in 5 languages but apparently only speaks them in her own head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryMariMason1 @Rich3Dawg I agree that there is, but I always wonder about the one with the cops coming off the elevator.  It really looks like the guy on the wall reaches for the cop with his right hand, just before that cop reacts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKronicKat Thoughts and prayers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Since he's always been a huge supporter of our military, this take sure does fit the GOP narrative of US soldier hating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieICU @nypost @MichaelRapaport He's already set it up.  He's created so many more enemies than we had already. Plans are probably made and they are waiting on the timing.  Osama Bin Laden did not attack right when we hurt them, he served up cold. #9/11 #NeverForget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei @TheAtlantic But Dan Crenshaw has, which proves who he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SixPersistsBlue @pinky_or_brain My God, he thinks the military is like the movies.  He really does.  He thinks the hero NEVER gets shot, never gets beat up, always outruns the predator.  He's such a damn immature freak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirandadevine @realDonaldTrump God, every day trump announces how much brown people scare him.  Every damn day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If America is not a racist country, why did Rafael Edward Cruz and Nimrata Nikki Randhawa (Haley) anglo their names?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Why would anyone of character ever believe YOU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badler He reversed this yesterday, and of course acted like he was some sort of savior. Same plot different day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_daydreamer12 I pegged MS or AL.  But no...it's Texas.  Tell me again how "purple" they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump may have been slapping his face for showing up.  You know he hates having disabled persons in his parades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune I swear, I'd LOVE to see this.  But I have cousins there and they took their LI racism and just put a cowboy hat on it. Find me if it's blue after election day and I'll post a huge apology and custom gif in it's honor. Good weekend for you too. #LaborDay @Unionsrock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump NOPE. The truth is out and Biden isn't a liar like trump, so he will speak TRUTH.  And you are so full of sh*t.  Your cult may buy it, but the rest of us, esp in NYC know who trump the racist unAmerican monster is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune But you know damn well that's who Texas is helping. As they close polling and pull out mailboxes in less white areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune I just quoted the exact opposite statement from the article.  They fought expansion, which leaves the old white GOP voters getting the special treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA @texyellowdogdem Can someone explain then if the US soldiers killed by Russian bounties are suckers or losers or both?  Where do they fall in trump's classifications?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune It's self-serving. "That’s left in place automatic eligibility for voters who are 65 and older — a group of voters who are much more likely to be white and generally considered to make up part of the Texas GOP’s base."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune Did you read the article?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorilad @TexasTribune How is what TX republicans are doing a GOOD thing?  Are you proud of this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it quacks like a duck....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait for all the parades and celebration when he is reaped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Weird.  No mention of this from FOX News?  https://t.co/wnDgdhupFy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaMZeitz @JoeDeb8 It's true.  He's all in for trump.  Even over the memory of his dead child.  Re-read that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cause he's the original LOSER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @TheAtlantic You also believed he wasn't banging a porn star when you were post partum.  So, you really aren't the best judge here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MCadiz8 @Amy_Siskind Well, I don't have to forgive without repentance. Period.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therecount So jealous of the attention Biden got today.  But my dude, it's Friday night and no one cares what you are saying right now.  Go get ready for golf this weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCadiz8 @Amy_Siskind Forgiveness, at least in Christian terms requires repentance.  Their move first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>QANON is a terrorist organization.  Every QANON member looks like a White Isis terrorist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump admin HATES the military.  He's destroying it piece by piece for put*n.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlterEgon75 @emilyelarsen @redsteeze That journalists should stop being wimpy assholes protecting their jobs and should instead report FACT?  This is a probably for Biden?  Gimme a break.  They are long overdue not calling trump a fascist pig.  Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinbaragona Maybe John Kelly needs to get out of his own ass and defend his son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChapmanTracie @jcho710 Your words are the words of someone with literally not one understanding of virology. NOT ONE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind What about the Pentagon disbanding Stars &amp; Stripes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChapmanTracie @jcho710 We didn't have Covid19 in 2015. How can you even pretend that sentence is real?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brikeilarcnn @USNavyMomPA For me, this speaks worse of John Kelly, than it does Trump.  Because Kelly just took it and went on, no GOES ON, to support this maggot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Eugenics.  Can't have those "not perfect" people in sight.  #HowToNazi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cops are out of control.  Yes, we knew that, but now we see it.  You can be arrested for telling a cop he has a small dick?  Seemingly for this guy it's true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattMurph24 Matt, it's almost like the media (ALL of it) wants a Civil War.  They could end this.  Literally.

<|startoftext|>@contrastrinity @firehotrap @Bure10DFS @KristenClarkeJD No, they didn't.  They just killed a man they didn't want to bother subduing.

<|startoftext|>@Bure10DFS @firehotrap @KristenClarkeJD No, they didn't.  That's what they want you to think.   The people in the store could have been protected without killing someone.  But that doesn't fit your narrative.  Cops in other countries do it, what's wrong with our cops?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ella4the98th @Eshara_BB @Maineiacz @apoorva_nyc increase custodial workers for cleaning.  Increase tech both in hardware, and bandwidth cost (subsidize?).

<|startoftext|>@Ella4the98th @Eshara_BB @Maineiacz @apoorva_nyc I've stated it multiple times in this thread.

<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC November?  That's optomistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA And NOT having school comes with some risks for kids too.  When will we figure out a solution that leaves kids home that can be home, and provides services for those who needs service?  Take the moneh from the wall and space force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ella4the98th @Eshara_BB @Maineiacz @apoorva_nyc Food is fluff?  Special needs therapies are fluff?  Child care for working parents?  Schools provide more than academics (wrong or right) and now families are stuck. Man that prefix must come with some cushy privilege if you think its just a matter of "keeping the kids home".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eshara_BB @Ella4the98th @Maineiacz @apoorva_nyc Why don't we have  more?  Because we are cheap AF.  We could have people clamoring for the teaching profession if it actually paid.

<|startoftext|>@devzeroooo @apoorva_nyc @V2019N Yes, we do.  So we need to do it.  If not double at least increase.  We don't get to do nothing and just shove kids back into crowded classes.  We don't get to shut schools and forget the families in need of care. Find the solutions now, and not be reactionary later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devzeroooo @apoorva_nyc @V2019N We are doing that RIGHT NOW with retirees.  That's my point.  People are out of work.  Put educated, vetted YOUNGER professionals in classrooms and as online support.  See your attitude?  No wonder we can't find solutions, you are only looking for more problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devzeroooo @apoorva_nyc @V2019N Nope, if we can currently use people from the community for long term substitutes we can find ways to move the vetted educated population into classrooms and streaming classrooms.  It's not can we, it's how do we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devzeroooo @apoorva_nyc @V2019N Exactly.  Massive funding needs to be poured in.  Double hire teachers, bus drivers, custodians, keep schools open for services, supply materials/tech for home use. Government req increase available bandwidth capabilities without excessive charges....so much to try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwCongressional This is one of the creepiest sentences I've ever read about trump.  What exactly is "intensely masculine" to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devzeroooo @apoorva_nyc @V2019N Feeding kids, therapies, emotional support, child care....This shows us how much schools actually do.  Just saying "learns at home" negates how much we dump on schools and teachers with no support/funds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apoorva_nyc @letahamilton383 @V2019N Bingo.  This is not a plan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@momupdated @RealKHiveQueenB Yeah, my kids are my biggest critics.  They are undoing years of Queens racist training.  Crap, I never realized how insidious it was.  I wish just knowing would excise it, but it's so deep seeded I keep catching my own BS thought processes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKHiveQueenB As a white person I think generally yes.  We are awesome SJWs, but this feels different.  I'm still in groups discussing long term changes, supporting BLM, agreeing that statues and names need to change, telling other white folk to STHU.  Definitely different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for more people to follow @JoeBiden.  Sure we know we are voting for him and doesn't need the ego boost of followers to do the best job.  But more REAL followers for him would sure piss off trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnaLawlor14 @MoodyRob @JesseKellyDC Right, you reopened to soon because of the protests in austin which pressured your weak ass governor to move too quickly and deny mayors who wanted mask requirements.  If protests were the problem we'd be seeing this surge everywhere, like DC and NYC, but duh, we aren't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bingo.  Sounds like they don't WANT to pick the correct side, they'd just rather stay complicit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@letsbladebrah And hubris.  You opened too soon and your folks refuse to wear masks because...freedom?  From what, earth's clutches?  You are at 100K now, watch what exponential growth does.  Force your gov to change course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@letsbladebrah Cause unfortunately we are all in this together.  If you don't get your house in order it works it's way everywhere.  And we are keeping our curve down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ToniHoelting Every night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanfordGround0 Yes to all you said, except...  No, it's still a private event and she could legally be asked to leave.  The reason is stupid as shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmath119 @ManUtdNole @Xinthus @HanfordGround0 I wish that were the case.  But that's my question.  Legally, it IS a private organization and a private event.  So while I support her action, and I'm glad she showed what wimps they are.  I don't think she has a legal leg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanfordGround0 Hey, I totally agree.  It's outrageous.  But I'm asking on a legal level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanfordGround0 Is it though?  If a store can kick you out for not wearing a mask, can't a private event kick you out for your attire?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeidiNBC Omg, you are not going to die today, fool, you will first infect 20 other people.  You dying is not our concern.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bravo21Sierra @PortiaMcGonagal @Chris_Meloni “Sen Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,” stated NAACP President, {he} went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act a...that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bravo21Sierra @PortiaMcGonagal @Chris_Meloni Cause they're not facts.

<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal @Bravo21Sierra @Chris_Meloni I think you mean picked by Stephen Miller.

<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal @Bravo21Sierra @Chris_Meloni Yup, but I'm trying to do that thing as a white person where I try to help other white people understand because I've got a lot of racial skeletons in my closet that someone else helped me shovel out.  I'll try once.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Melanie05689787 @usandmann @Bigoofyikes @CNN Yes, because the militarized police are BEATING peaceful protesters.  This is what you are seeing.  Police brutality up close and you are still denying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch DONE!  That was a fantastic ad.  Keep fighting!  #UglyPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briansoloman @madcave1728 It's next level with FOX.  When Sean Hannity direct calls the WH to affect policy, that's a real problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zombie_patriot @joey_nations @BParsonPNW "Department of Safety Commissioner John Harrington said they are contact-tracing the arrested... He said some of the 40 arrests made in the Twin Cities Friday night were of people linked to white supremacist groups and organized crime."  https://t.co/II09nGCvcm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zombie_patriot @joey_nations @BParsonPNW Well, you will argue it's "not the right source", or some other bs anyway.  I know your kind.  But you did ask nicely.  Do you know how Google works?  You can find it if you want to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melanie05689787 @usandmann @Bigoofyikes @CNN Again, looters were the first nights. The protests are still going on extraordinarily peacefully.  Racists like to keep people believing it's all looting and rioting because they are afraid of the movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get it done, folks!  This is NOT the election to miss a deadline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zombie_patriot @joey_nations @BParsonPNW Uh, every night?  I guess you don't realize the protests are STILL going on.  Change the channel once and a while.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shannoncoulter Last time I went to the parade I had SUCH a great time celebrating my culture and heritage as an Italian American.  But every time Columbus came up I got a pit in my stomach.  I would be thrilled to have him disassociated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InMedioSitu @IvanOffalich @shannoncoulter THIS is a fantastic idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannoncoulter As long as it doesn't become trump circle you can name it anything you want.  Obama Circle works, but if we want to keep it Italian-American there are plenty to chose from .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@usandmann @Bigoofyikes @CNN Do you?  Militarized police have been beating peaceful protesters for weeks now and this is the best you've got?  Spare me your righteous indignation about an isolated incident.  We are talking SYSTEMIC VIOLENCE by our police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zombie_patriot @joey_nations @BParsonPNW Looting was the first nights.  Some instigated by white nationalists and anarchists. Looting is the result of assholes who can't even hear what a man who kneels is trying to say. Because, white fragility.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realdebfarmer @dad_darius Bishops are making equally strong statements as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure @mrtallerjerry Right, and when white conservatives say Defund PP, they mean destroy it.  So they hear Destroy Police.  Now that may be the ultimate plan for some, but it won't get votes for actually overhauling the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure @AOC I said the same thing myself, as a white NYer, but these suburban swing voters do unfortunately hold the power and "Defund the Police" "Abolish the police" isn't flying, until it's explained.  So we keep explaining. Reinvent Policing seems to be the pablum that keeps ears open.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly.  THIS is what we are fighting for.  REFORMS.   If they are good cops they don't indiscriminately shove old men into concussions.  So, arrest for assaultand take away his "cop" license, meaning he should never be able to "protect and serve" again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nick_Germ @GretschGirl5120 I see you are having trouble with your own argument so you take to the trump gaslighting method.

<|startoftext|>@Nick_Germ @GretschGirl5120 ?? What DO you think the issue was? It was a bakery.  A bakery that wouldn't sell a cake to a gay couple.  We call that shopping there.

<|startoftext|>@shellneal2501 @darla_dg2138 @CraigSh8 @DeAnna4Congress @realDonaldTrump Right?  Good leaders can just SAY WHAT THEY MEAN, not have every Tom, DICK, and Harry have to interpret the reinterpretations of his supposed erroneous intention.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigDSports19 @ryanstruyk @MattMurph24 I think in the end we are on the same team.  I didn't manipulate anything, I just made sure I wrote DOUBLED on the higher number, not the lower so it wouldn't look exaggerated.  Your implications are off base.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigDSports19 @ryanstruyk @MattMurph24 I intentionally rounded up so that one couldn't say I was exaggerating. Accuracy- 4780x2 =9506. 9643 x 2 is 19286   and 19286 x 2 is 41208.  Not sure how you say the accuracy is off? Yes, rate getting better, that's called flattening the curve.  Not the best time to re-open.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the pouring rain, in the middle of a pandemic, over 200,000 more people turned out to vote for Dems over GOP in a state trump "won" by 23,000 votes.  #WisconsinPrimary. #DictatorDon #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuetree @NateSilver538 Thanks for the honesty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@docrocktex26 @washingtonpost I get the sense rural Texas counties think this won't affect them, and the governor seems to think Texas will have no issue reopening.  Body count has been low, thankfully, but that seems to fuel their denial that this was ever an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @JoseyRider I believe this, but I don't see how it's possible.  Another year to 18 months?  Then what about the next pandemic? Like floods and hurricanes will they now come more often?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanG_NYC @JimGaffigan @Dhollins9 It's both.  Trump is lying about the number of tests and we need the capacity (and reagents) to process.  It's ALL on the poor planning and negligence of this WH admin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sidelifestories @RBReich Not that this is the biggest issue in light of the horrific impact is having on them, but when you say opposition I can't help but remember reading that many actually voted for trump.

<|startoftext|>@Ora93020862 @vanderpunked @Debbie56111656 @DonaldJTrumpJr Because you are pushing a bot narrative, that's why.  So if you aren't a bot, you are a cultist.  Barely a difference.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zukedrilla @ConservativeKo3 @NYDailyNews You just said you were a student who just moved here.

<|startoftext|>@NYDailyNews As a liberal I say, WTF are you doing destroying the main mode of transportation for us working folk!?  Get the hell outta my way I have a JOB I have to get to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr, @JohnCornyn, @tedcruz @SenatorCollins @SenAlexander @lisamurkowski  and the rest of you trump lackeys will go down in history as the traitors who sold the US to Russia and killed the American Experiment.  Not hyperbole, fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Azula163 @CNN I will celebrate so HARD tonight if Alexander turns around and FUs #MoscowMitchCoverUp.  What does he have to lose, he's not running again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We can keep screaming #ImpeachmentTrialSham &amp; #GOPCowards until the @DevinCow s come home, but until the 4th branch of Government, US media, decides to admit the truth and stop pussyfooting around the corruption for financial gain we are always spitting in the wind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenAlexander Yes, they do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @VABVOX @MattMurph24 Thanks, that's mostly what I was getting at, and that we can't just ignore the reality that blacks are not homogeneous. And trump recognizes now he needs their votes and will stop at no scam to manipulate.  https://t.co/K3xjZ5SI22<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @MaxxTrajan @RussKlettke @VABVOX @MattMurph24 I know, Hannity was really the last person I wanted to retweet.  I regret that.  But I am seeing things worsen.  I should realize he's being ridiculously hyperbolic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @VABVOX @MattMurph24 And we are leaving out the other part of my post...motivated racists.  If you don't think there's a ton of them hop over to Staten Island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @VABVOX @MattMurph24 No, these are friends, black LEOs, and since I follow them on facebook I see their "Friends". Sorry, I wasn't clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewart_ted @erossin48 @Lin53237785 @VABVOX @MattMurph24 Amen to that.  But two thoughts.  After 2016 I don't trust polls.  And, based on that poll I thought I would be hard pressed to find black trump supporters, yet, there here and blame dems/liberals for their woes. I'm just trying to make sense of it and not ignore that reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @VABVOX @MattMurph24 I know the numbers, that's why it shocks me when I talked to colleagues and friends of friends.  Maybe I just didn't want to know they exist.  Like Log Cabin Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxxTrajan @erossin48 @RussKlettke @VABVOX @MattMurph24 Seriously, all it takes is 6 seconds on my feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erossin48 @RussKlettke @VABVOX @MattMurph24 I honestly wish I were.  Obviously I can't speak for all but a number of Black police officers I know are voting for trump.  I follow them and they follow others who feel the same as they do, the numbers surprised me.  And they get pretty angry with people like me who are shocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VABVOX @MattMurph24 We are not going to win in a landslide.  There are very motivated racists and dissatisfied blacks out there.  They will turn out for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wardamn5 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN @CNN Another roll who doesn't understand american government.  REPUBLICANS are BLOCKING all evidence and testimony.  Dems are HAPPY for Trump to testify.  Why won't he? Because he weak and guilty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN WTH, this isn't ABOUT HIM.  It's about trump and GOP corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport The senate trial rules do not say you cannot lie through your teeth, therefore, Roberts can do nothing about it.  He's basically as someone so eloquently put it, a potted plant in the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA @RepAdamSchiff Here's the sad fact.  For your average American, that didn't make good TV.  It was slow, thought out and measured.  Nope, will not be a blip to anyone but us in the bubble. :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArmVoteDem @riotwomennn @MeetThePress @hughhewitt Then if the US is that stupid we deserve trump.  I can't imagine Bernie and any VP other than Pence, being worse than trump.  As much as I wanted Kamala to get the nom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDeLong62 @MalcolmNance @CandaceTX Okay, so what? (serious question, so what?) Either the country wants trump again or they want ANYONE ELSE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidDeLong62 @MalcolmNance @CandaceTX Hewitt isn't a Dem, of course he's not voting for a Dem in the general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejeanjeannie2 @MeetThePress @hughhewitt What if Kamala is the VP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riotwomennn @ArmVoteDem @MeetThePress @hughhewitt No I mean, let's say he swings it to Bernie by convincing other trumpies to vote for Bernie in primary.  Even though I'm NOT a fan of Bernie, I'm voting for him in the general.  I'll vote for any Dem. If all Dems did this it doesn't matter how they "swing" it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riotwomennn @ArmVoteDem @MeetThePress @hughhewitt If we vote blue no matter who, who cares who wins the primary.  Any of them can do the job 1000X better than trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nate_ready2go @tx_nyer @page88 @reallyDontTrump Okay, I hear that.  But in the long run, is it the worst thing?  Most of us will take a turnip as the Dem nominee.  It's still more capable and a hell of a lot less corrupt and inept than trump/gop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InLWithLBeingL @_SJPeace_ Um, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmNance @CandaceTX You think he'll still vote for trump?  Seriously, I'm a vote blue no matter who.  If he gets indies or ex-repubs to vote Bernie instead of stay home or vote for trump I'm all for it.  If Bernie picks Kamala for VP he's in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @BernieSanders I love sane people.  Thank you.  And Bernie isn't my first choice, but trump is the last person on earth who should be in that job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MommySherfey @KlasfeldReports @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Russian bot says what?  Listen lady, this may work on stupid trumpers, but it's not even a QUESTION that he withheld the aid. Even trump admits the aid was withheld. You have just show your raging lack of knowledge and desire to lie.  Get off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Junior High move by the current occupant in the White House.  #DementiaDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MommySherfey @KlasfeldReports @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi BUT what trump was IMPEACHED for is withholding aid from an ally while trying to get a personal favor to influence the American election, then covering it up.  FAR worse and there's so much more....stay tuned!  Pelosi will bring more charges because trump has always been a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MommySherfey @KlasfeldReports @RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi I think you meant to say Clinton cheated on his wife with a consensual adult not unlike the men accusing him (See Newt Gingrich), and tried to hide it from her.  And not unlike Donald Trump, who actually paid off a mistress.  As for trafficking:  https://t.co/MThPAlmlkR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MTF_Cadet_2 @PaperSuit @Botbash_D @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless My degree is biology/premed.  But that's not needed to grasp the concept. It's well studied/lived &amp; a norm in nonwestern cultures.  I am not into telling other people how to eat, but I find promoting "what we have always done is the only right way" as data isn't the most helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Botbash_D @PaperSuit @MTF_Cadet_2 @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless You do you man.  I mean that.  Being able to *chose* what we eat is a luxury whether it meat based or plant or anything in between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Botbash_D @PaperSuit @SadlyCatless @MTF_Cadet_2 @Monteboys @RomoMalo Weird flex, but okay.  With that thinking we should rid our guts of their bacteria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Botbash_D @PaperSuit @MTF_Cadet_2 @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless And yet meat eaters are having strokes and heart attacks left and right.  I'd say there's risk there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MTF_Cadet_2 @Botbash_D @PaperSuit @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless This is a fallacy I was lead to believe as well.  Very western industrial meat corporation thinking.   PS, I LOVE meat.  But I'm learning I don't need it to be healthy.  Quite the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Botbash_D @MTF_Cadet_2 @PaperSuit @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless Everything u are saying, I have said 2. I've been learning, I've reduced my meat consumption, I'm eating more greens, berries, beans, grains, seeds, my cholesterol numbers plummeted. I'm working on my HPB. I'm not vegan, but it's a goal.There's so much I was wrong about, like you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Botbash_D @PaperSuit @MTF_Cadet_2 @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless Such an emphatic statement.  Ignorant. But emphatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTF_Cadet_2 @PaperSuit @Botbash_D @Monteboys @RomoMalo @SadlyCatless Of course you can.  It's about the aminos.  Right combos.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have breached the threshold for impeachment.  It's not even a questions.  You used the power of the state for your own personal gain.  Game over.  GOP putting trump over country and Constitution while you dismantle NATO for Putin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He does not represent me or any military in which my family serves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics He says a lot of things that aren't true.  My guess this is just one more big lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they TRYING to be as ridiculous as possible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar Of course America, and all those above, did it.  But to pretend there is no misinformation campaign steering it off that cliff is disingenuous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@docrocktex26 And yet, here we are watching him get away with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsbfankaren @jaidamarlee Or more likely....Maybe we all should have paid some attention and stopped passing notes/texting in NY history class junior year. LOL  #regents<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Happy to have him committed where no one can bother him again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RonLPitts @LOLGOP No, it's someone who is sick of Dems who pile on other Dems just because they want to act like bullies on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karoli @joanmccarter @crooksandliars All this is is the truth finally admitted.  We all knew this whole thing was about the Aryan Con Artist's need to beat the successful black man.  In his mind trumps win was winning against Obama.  And here it is, admitted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ @JoseyRider He only knows how to operate a Con. It's his only "skill".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonLPitts @LOLGOP You had an opportunity to educate.  You used it to flatter your own ego.  You used it to act like Kellyanne .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonLPitts @LOLGOP Read my feed. Do you eat your children too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOLGOP I'm afraid to gloat.  He's still winning.  Until he's not winning, he's still winning.  Michigan Dem jumped from impeach to Censure column. That's not the direction I was expecting after all this news.  No guts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebWinkleblack @InspiringU2 It's all by design.  They are turning all the courts and justices to their ideology.  Elections have consequences.  Trump/GOP won, justice loses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZonePhysics Does anyone have sound with this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Warfighters?  ok, boomer.  In America, in this century, we call them soldiers. And we don't support war criminals as you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all part of the con.  Division is Putin's game. Kennedy is his pawn.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cmclymer @Kitten0409 Trump is building "his" army. Believe him when he shows you who he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @Politics1com You are in full blown self protection mode and nothing more.  When we get to the bottom of what you're hiding it's going to get ugly for you.

<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC @SIippery_Slope He's building HIS side of the army folks.  When Hitler took over Germany's he didn't bring in new people, he used who was there.  Think about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Could you link us to the time you said every nation would be staying completely free at Doral for G-7?  "Entire Cost"  Funny how now that you've rescinded you "say" that was your offer.  What a bunch of emolument CYA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew @JoeMyGod He offered to do it totally free for every nation?  When? What a bunch of BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jaici8 Ok, I could get a little more onboard with that.  Though I think Biden might be the better bet for Paris accord, ACA and other projects we love over trump.  Better than another Dem, maybe not, but I will only slam (or actually ignore) that phony Dem at this stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texyellowdogdem Not after they let him have 50 minutes of ramble time.  It's still his loudspeaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Above quote from:  https://t.co/p26vf7jXyc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Former Marine combat pilot Amy McGrath is running against the majority leader. She was the first female Marine Corps pilot to fly the F/A-18 on a combat mission. But she isn’t the kind of veteran Trump supports. He has nothing on her. He never had to pardon her for war crimes."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaici8 And if he just takes trump's bs then he gets grief for being too soft.  Could we stop with this dem bashing crap that feeds the russian GOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckWa74233336 @mkraju I don't even see a slip up because the whole thing is a mess.  Is it that he doesn't know the military guys name and calls him by the ISIS name?  GAG, I can't even rewatch it. He's disgusting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Actually he's self impeaching. Did you see his guilty admissions on FOX &amp; Friends this am.  OMG.  Unhinged and admitting to obstruction.  Just crazy.  You don't need the Dems help.  Sleeping giant, my ass.  Dream on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is Fiona Hill letting us know *yesterday that the BS trump is peddling on FOX *today, is Russia inspired conspiracy theory to deflect their involvement in our elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeNewsome @titodinzey Because they will muddy the waters with Russian inspired bs conspiracy theories, angry rants, attacks on military and US agencies characters.  God knows there's nothing to defend trump with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Someone should do a video of him praising a person *the best people*, then show their indictment or prison sentence, then show him now speaking about them like they are gum on his shoe...for everyone one he's done that to.

<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity HAHAHA.  So, telling. Here is where you admit you are just a talking point whore.  When the Obama card is pulled out despite never having been discussed in the entire thread.  Next up:  Hillary and Benghazi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @MattMurph24 It's accepted fact.  Not an accusation.  Russia interfered in 2016 and continues through today.  Only GOP/trump cultists believe otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aravosis Then backtracked a bit after the "I want nothing" comments.  This is why my head is spinning. Of course I want an open and shut case.  Doesn't look as simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity That's an unsubstantiated lie.  You learn well from trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity I understand you need to live in this world of cognitive dissonance.  This seems very personal to you.  Enjoy your safe space.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity I guess Ken Starr is too.  "Noting that “articles of impeachment are being drawn up if they haven’t already been drawn up” over Sondland’s testimony, Starr concluded by saying “this obviously has been one of those bombshell days.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity After Whistleblower reported him.  That is admission of guilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity Sure, bud.    https://t.co/5cByzZRlKW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Thanks.  They are doing a great job muddying the waters for the average jane.  I cannot tell where we landed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillPascrell @RepMaloney @OversightDems SO proud of you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis How legitimate is this article?  https://t.co/FmgLHAkspk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Today he said he opened Apple in Austin, though it opened in 2013.  He lies about EVERYTHING.  We know this.  He's a thug, he's a liar and he extorted Ukraine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahleal28 @aravosis @RepSeanMaloney Sure, but I'll still say my piece. It's just like "dems" to say, oh, we need to take the high road. The high road screwed the shit out of us with this vast rt wing conspiracy since the 80s. Enough of this pansy crap. And Schiff is doing a well measured job by anyone's standards.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Timing is EVERYTHING.  He said that after whistleblower turned his ass in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahleal28 @aravosis @RepSeanMaloney Badgering and screaming?  Sounds like you are talking about GymJordan and Nunes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zac_Petkanas It's edited to repeat I want nothing a few more times, but it's still creepy and unhinged as crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINALLY top news on @NBCNews    https://t.co/Y0FW2Cl1Je<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity Then clearly you just have trouble understanding the damage the truth did to trump today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahleal28 @aravosis @RepSeanMaloney SO when GOP rants and Trump screams at the TV, that's cool and leadership, but when educated Dems with actual facts hold criminals accountable it's biased and irrational.  Sure...got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @jaredbro25 @seanhannity AFTER whistleblower reported.  He knew the gig was up.  Come on, man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this answers that question. Not even a top story. And they ran with Trump claims Sondland testimony exonerates him: 'It's all over'   https://t.co/QJJekLev1g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barb6558 @kakss1_kathy @MiriamElder only its more like 19%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJResisting @1IronMan2020 @RepAdamSchiff Seemingly fine on FOX news.  They have been informed the Republicans are winning, impeachment is over and trump is proven innocent,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericsslater @armyheromom @ECMcLaughlin They are trained liars.  It's all they do.  It's how they succeed in life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cimarcos @DemFromCT Love her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how is this all playing on regular TV news?  Is it more milquetoast trump coverage, or are we finally turning a media corner?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredbro25 @WillDyer14 @seanhannity Well, when they only watch FOX they only get the force fed BS pablum.  Of course they're clueless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillDyer14 @seanhannity Republicans got their ass handed to them today by the FIRST HAND WITNESSES.  Straight up bribery directed by trump. Why do I have to do your homework for you?  Either pay attention or stop trying to play with the big kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity  https://t.co/5S2bAylxoz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@America13342254 @seanhannity ? How do you not understand the process?  What a dumb question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Except the first hand witnesses directly implicated trump in a bribery scheme.  Womp womp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse You've compromised the election and the presidency.  Why the heck would we trust an election with the corrupt GOP players in it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeffmason1 No, actually, two or three bangs.  Thanks to all three strong witnesses.  Are you too immature and superficial to be allowed to cover this event?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco I'm having no issue figuring it out.  #ImpeachTrump You have provided no exculpatory evidence.  (This has already been explained to you)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeffmason1 If by without a bang, you mean with the incredibly DAMNING testimony against trump.  The evidence is all being placed in front of us and the president is a criminal, but you find that dull.  Weird flex, but okay.<|endoftext|>

He's guilty and no amount of entertainment value is necessary for those who wish to save the democracy, not their cush jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Those gossip girls brought credible executable witness testimony.  Call them whatever you like.  Their facts are corroborated by 5-7 other witnesses, yet to testify.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnieGabstonH Nope.  Someone who supports babies in cages, killing of Kurd allies, racism and antisemitism will never be someone I'm genuinely nice too for any reason. Civil yes.  Nice, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Use the word RAPE so that the slow privileged people can understand what's actually happening.  Why the euphemisms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Because he a cis white GOP male.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nypost So, just more quid pro quo?  "The New York Times reported that in 1995 Trump agreed to give $200,000 and wanted to be named parade grand marshal in return, though it appears he never held that honor."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost Does he think he won't get the hell boo'ed out of him because they are vets?

<|startoftext|>@aravosis But GOP congresspersons can bring them into closed impeachment inquiries?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the federal level, the impeachment process is a three-step procedure.

<|startoftext|>That feeling when a team whose fans boo'ed trump to his face beats the team who beat your Yankees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJE203 @GOPLeader Wasn't that great!? She was showing how you can "pretend to ask" but it's really an ask.  Which proves that when Trump was on the WH lawn asking/ ahem "joking to"  CHINA to dig up dirt on Biden HE WAS REALLY BEING A TRAITOR.   Joking so much that China publicly denounced it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grailsnail @bridget_joy_ Best reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awelab1956 @bridget_joy_ Even Catholic parochial schools don't teach "Creationism".  That's a fundamentalist gig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bridget_joy_ Hell no.  Unless it's to teach what kind of Bullshit it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner You are SOOOO more optimistic than I.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Wow, I can't believe you even had the balls to bring this up given trumps obvious affinity for treasonous acts.  #Ukraine  #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cms0703 @seanhannity How is it 2A fantatics are this incapable of larger thought? Less guns is LESS for criminals to get.  It won't happen overnight, but it can happen.  You just don't want it to happen.  You'd rather they continue to have access for violence. Great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel Amazing isn't it?  Yet, the pessimist in me says, it's not even this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cms0703 @seanhannity Excellent point for reducing the number of guns in this country via buy backs.  Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CUsmile And the media is in league with him.  If they just told the truth and stopped "Both siding" it he'd be OUT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which sort of pisses me off because they cover for trumps BS half the time.  You could END this presidency by just reporting the truth ONLY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pattonoswalt @Chris_Meloni @NikkiGlaser Comedians either have the toughest f*kkin skin on the planet or are complete self-haters.  Maybe both?  Crazy roast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovHowardDean Do'nt you have pelosi's cell number?  Can you give her a ringy-ding-ding please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity More reason to have less guns nationwide, so they can't be brought.  Thanks for making that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Then you should be OUTRAGED at the nepotism and profiteering of the trump children (and in-laws) during their father's tenure in the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke Please keep speaking this truth!!  It's about time someone had the balls (and microphone) to do it.  Hell yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What is WRONG with @SpeakerPelosi ?  I'm starting to wonder if she's compromised as well.  IF these are reasons for impeachment, what is?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll say it again - If impeachment isn't for this, why is impeachment in the Constitution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PortiaMcGonagal Sadly i do know some black people who love that she "speaks the truth" for them.  It leaves me very confused.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's with the hand flashes too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jzikah @CktrumpF @jjwilson23 @Heathfeath45 @rwalker296 @atrupar Isn't that to sell gear?  It's not a paid participant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren The country suffers every time demented don opens his mouth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@55odogg55 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @AndyPuzder @MariaBartiromo What, his melting dementia addled mind?  This is what you are excited about.  IF you cared about him you'd want him to seek medical help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @AndyPuzder @MariaBartiromo Stop using my money to bail out your MISTAKES.  I'm not  the Daddy Fred trust fund.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader This is EXACTLY why #PutinsMitch #MoscowMitch  McConnell needs to GO.  He has blocked the country from moving forward at every turn.  @AmyMcGrathKY will do that for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @CNN This one just loves to see notifications.  It doesn't matter if they are all just calling out her obvious lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN His followers are so ignorant.  They won't look farther than his statement and think this is true.  YOU DID NOT END IT, you radically expanded and morphed it to serve a bigoted Nationalist agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More ignorance in office.  Great.  So because 99% of scientists say something is real, it's "Both sides are accurate" because 1% does not.  These appointees don't just suck at math and science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That may be the nicest thing it says at this point.  You ruined yourself with this association.  You could have gone out after 9/11 a hero. I'm sorry for how that affected you psychologically.  Someone should have sat you down and explained it was time to take up knitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His life is rife with examples.  He IS A RACIST.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DetroitSteel_ Trump has always been an upstanding New Yorker.  He's always paid fair wages to subcontractors and sometimes paid ahead of time.  Many people say this and call to thank him regularly, still, today.  #LieAboutTrumpDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NRA WOW!  This is how you follow up a mass assault on festival goers with a military style weapon.  You are sick sick people.  I will celebrate your orgs demise so hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I wish someone would compile just the tongue ties for the last month. It shows a man melting into old age and dementia.  What a scary ad that would be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle I have a lot of military family members, including my dad.  But this constant new Nationalism propaganda, that every freakin military person is come kind of Saint or god, is the biggest lie and manipulation the GOP has got.  Sick of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio You are weak.  Trump was wrong and racist and encouraged others to chant their racism.  YOU enable him, and therefore them.  Marco Rubio, which country is yours in MAGAs eyes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valancese1 @thehill wannabe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2lordhokage @thehill No he didn't.  He gleefully watched and waited until they quieted to start speaking again.  It's all there on video.  He's a liar, as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill He's always wanted to be John Gotti.  That's why he wore that coat all those years.  He thought he could be an Italian gangster.  He tried to talk like them too.

<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN Okay, tell Barr and Kellyanne that.  They defied the LAW.   And you must NOT be following the evidence in Epsteins case.  He's going down as are those who used his services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWheeler64 @Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN Yeah, nation of laws when it is convenient for them and their agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @DWheeler64 @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN The part where you said it AFTER I wrote the above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN You keep changing your parameters so I'll go back to the original question...Why are MAGAs okay with having an Alleged Child Rapist in the White House, why aren't you demanding investigation to clear or convict?  #DenialisAcceptance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMeadowlark Nah.  Maybe 200 -500 would be that stupid, but that's it.  And the fact that they think Dems aren't armed will be their undoing.  They'll have believed their own narrative to their detriment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @DWheeler64 @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN Let's just do away with courts then.  To hell with it.  Anarchy rule.  Constitution through the shredder.  It doesn't work 100% so why bother?  Trumps guilty he has admitted to assault already.  #EpsteinTrumpScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill John McCain wasn't an adultering con man traitor who lied like he breathed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN So, if convicted throw his ass in Jail. Or do you think it's okay that powerful rich men get away with rape?  Clinton, trump, I don't care.  Rapists should be in prison.  Do you think Clinton should have gotten away with it, then why do you think trump should?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN This started with me accurately referring to the ALLEGED rape by trump.  You weren't happy with that truth and made shite up about Obama.  Fact remains, Trump will eventually have to deal with the Epstein Child Trafficking scandal and this matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shteina_Gott @TheOrangeShit @RepJayapal @Ilhan @IlhanMN When you can produce an actual lawsuit NAMING him, like can be done with Trump and the rape of a 13 year old, then talk.  https://t.co/KETnqQuanm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump is master level trolling with his racism.  News and Twitter dropped #EpsteinTrumpScandal like a hot potato.   His manipulation skills are unmatched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteSouza Trump really knows how to get #EpsteinTrumpScandal off trending and out of the news!  He is a MASTER at this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics @realDonaldTrump It's also why he succeeds.  No morals means you don't walk away no matter how vile the price.  People with morals and ethics finally give up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who they?  The Dem senators say horrible things about your #Racism and you, #RacistTrump.   They are fighting to save America from YOU and your #racist ilk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Well, we know trump brands won't be there. Unless the Chinese sewed made in America labels in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PercySodor @yashar I had to stop it.  I figured I'd just trust it got worse from where I ended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Moon Oh I Love Lucy.  Isn't that the one where the immigrant husband spanked his white wife when she was bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solusnan1 Oh, I know, I know...the answer is SOROS!  Right, isn't that always the answer to this shit? #Stillwaitingformycheck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndivisibleTeam Let him try it for a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KT_So_It_Goes @Darth_Spurious I followed Salena when I thought she was like her "Friend" @ananavarro .  I dumped her ass pretty quickly because she's just a GOP sycophant.  And after this, honestly, she looks self-loathing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derek_mafs No.  Especially when the country they are from is AMERICA.  #RacistInChief doesn't seem to remember not all brown people are born elsewhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley @Ilhan @POTUS Better than that...like back when he was best friends with Jeffery Epstein?  Or better than that like when he was getting employees to mark a "C" for colored on apartment applicants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley @Ilhan @POTUS Hon, he's not better than that.  He's never been better than that. And the only reason trump would have ever acted like your friend is if he thought it benefited him.  You are no white american Hannity in his eyes.  Let it go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What, are there like 10 republicans left or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NAW, this has nothing to do with trump.  /Sarcasm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLynneNYC @Flaminglunatic1 In trumps twisted brain who knows.  Maybe he mad Epstein DIDN'T want Ivanka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastordan No, but when he's not president he'll just go back to being a ranting old coot.  Only this time with more dementia and as a has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastordan Prison will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain Humanitarian crisis created by Trump - locking people in overcrowded cages without showers and supplies when it is entirely unnecessary.  So as per chart, not more than we've ever had to deal with like he's pretending.  No contradiction in what I said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley I guess they are making a political statement? See, some words!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fortismind @mmpadellan @AOC Nooooooooo!  Send him to Florida.  Puerto Rico.  We do not want his ass anywhere near here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @AOC She's rising above.  I'll never call him that, but I'm glad a sitting member of Congress shows decorum.  Especially when the asswipe in chief never does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMuckmaker I guess what he means is he'll be yelling and throwing things from his couch? @AmyMcGrathKY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Thank you for not shying away from calling Trump what he really is!  You've never wavered from taking the gloves off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't people understand this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios No, he doesn't have an issue with white immigrants (See: Melania and his Mar a Lago staff) only POCs, so, RACIST, not nativist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain Yes, please stop bothering. We need comprehensive reform which includes getting enough people and supplies to border to properly vet and monitor those seeking asylum.  This isn't a military crisis, it's a humanitarian one, created by Trumps failure to manage the situation wisely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain Your intent was to make lessen trump's xenophobia with "whataboutism", when it wasn't equal. Let's not pretend you were doing anything less.  Besides the US government has had a immigration separation policies stretching back from before Obama was alive. Trump upped it to cruelty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1213treboR @AOC @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley As if that matters to her success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's about time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain This is what you call "getting worse"?  https://t.co/F60rtX0QFo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain Again, reading comprehension problems for you.  The only reason Obama WOULD detain is if they questioned the "claim of family".  Ergo, they vetted.  Trumps zero tolerance doesn't vet, just rips children from families and locks them in cages.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain "“Previous administrations used family detention facilities, allowing the whole family to stay together while awaiting their deportation case in immig court,or alternatives to detention, which required families to be tracked but released from custody to await their court date."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain I knew it.  You have no reading comprehension.  What we have today is a result of TRUMPS new policies.  It's not the same policy.  He took what Obama had for unaccompanied minors, and went rabid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tashcraft23 @funder So you're saying Obama was right to golf during a storm or Trump is wrong to do so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rett73 @funder There used to be a time when presidents cared about the message it sent to be so callous while those you serve as president are in potential danger.  This selfish prick has never cared for anyone in his life, so it wouldn't even cross his mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain As if you'd listen to facts.  If I told you that this is Trumps own policy, and that the Obama policy was vastly different, and explained all the ways it was, including who and why and how long, you'd still argue.  That's the M.O. for MAGA folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayflo_AmIRite @morocha44 @MABACTS @ananavarro @TheView @MeghanMcCain No, he didn't.  You are wrong.  But thanks for playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramblingrosek @ananavarro No, half the country does not. Half the country didn't vote for him, half the voters did. Only far right republicans do and they are dwindling in numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Here's the difference Ana, I still WANT to be proud, but I can't be right now, we have a corrupt potential child rapist, dismantling our national security and making a fool of us in the White House, while no congressperson stops him.

<|startoftext|>@rudepundit I know black NYPD officers who support trump.  So, there's more to it than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner They are losing enrollments, and laying off faculty, they can't have you exposing their fraud!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CitizensFedUp Bullshit.  He will.  Once he sees who the 'stupid librul" or "Woman" is who got the Dem Nom he'll run to pull for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Spare me.  Any support of DT has caused this situation.  ANY.  So that means YOU created this monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyTX @emptytunes @Stonekettle @JohnCornyn @TexasTribune Wait, what part?  That Whites in America took Texas from the Mexicans because that's a fact.  Or the part that whites have never been a minority in Texas, because they have for the reason above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Born black, got educated, is strong and secure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyTX @emptytunes @Stonekettle @JohnCornyn @TexasTribune Are you saying Tune is wrong?!  Seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @TexasTribune Bueno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmasher2 @realDonaldTrump PS:  This is not leadership.  Leadership is having a solid and reasonable plan for the first time.  Not blackmail hair brained ideas shot from the cuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or they know they can just rebroadcast any other Rally.  Blah blah, Lie, blah blah, Brag, Blah blah, Fake News.  Why pay to send people to cover stupid sheep?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 So what's your plan?  If they Left will turn out, who are conservatives looking at to beat Trump or will they hold their nose again?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity  https://t.co/qm4ILsAuso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Yes, the trump administrations new LOW.  Now he wants to "round up" more families.  Is he going to use trains to transport too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner Come on folks! What's wrong with #2.  You are the problem, America. Open your eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Yawn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On #JohnMCainDay Trump gives himself the gift of more rope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Oh that would be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetRed4 @kharyp Thank you for those details that we did not yet have from only the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucperkins @KevinMKruse Because some of us are being educated as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcarlos20200 @kharyp I don't doubt the possibility, but how do u know this? Where's the info on why he was in that position in the start of the video? I'm all 4 calling out overzealous police, but not at the expense of letting actual criminals get the bleeding heart immediate acquittal. And I'm a BH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TriciaJJones @kharyp They haven't checked him yet, how do they know he doesn't have a weapon.  I think there's more to this story.  Why are they waiting to approach him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kharyp Wait whoa whoa...how do we even know who he is or what he may have done prior to this?  I'm all for calling out excessiveness if it's indeed excessive, but we don't know what he's being accused of -  Kidnapping, Murdering a family, robbing a bank, or spitting on the sidewalk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz You tell me....Why must the GOP be such scared frightened snowflakes who must bully victims' families to feel good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, folks got conned by Trump?  #NoSurprise #DontheCon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tracy9672 @PamBaker1414 I blame the producers of the Apprentice.  They are still sitting on piles of crap that showed who he really is, while they created his fake persona for $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidbernat @OBeirnekids @JordanUhl @noreallyhowcome @ThomasJTobin1 You'd be surprised the changes that ARE happening with millennials and youth who remain Catholic.  They just don't get airtime.  But that's a good thing.  The changes are under the radar, sort of, hence why the old guard issues these ridiculous edicts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasJTobin1 I'm an active lifelong practicing Catholic and former CCD teacher.  You sir, are not going to tell me I can't love and support a persecuted group of people.  And I don't even like Pride events. Sit down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet they keep inviting him in.  They deserve his abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I get one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tracy9672 @axios Yes he does, he's bankrupting us for Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is who trump respects.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wvjoe911 @CitizensFedUp @Mediaite Too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain And you back those who back him.  Sorry, it's hard to feel sympathy when you allow this over and over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccaballhaus @glubold Maybe @MeghanMcCain will stop carrying the GOPs disgusting water.  Nahhhhhhhh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tejanarusa @LogicPolitics1 @jaketapper Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LogicPolitics1 @jaketapper Oy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LogicPolitics1 @jaketapper Newflash: beto lost texas against cruz in a tx election.  An election that saw the GOP work to disenfranchise voters. HENCE, this resignation is too late for Beto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain @amyklobuchar Your dad knew what fascism looks like.  He lived it.  How do we know that and not you?  Decide Meghan, do you want to support who your father was or who the GOP has become.  Can't have both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Too late for Beto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's clueless and those who support him are even more clueless, as if that's possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eclecticbrotha @MattMurph24 I think because some of us are like...HE's ALWAYS BEEN THIS BAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanBam7 @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump Do you understand the concept of tokens?  Anyone who thinks Ben Carson was actually hired to do anything positive with HUD is as dumb as trump is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump When he speaks like this, like a bully, it tells you what he's afraid of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good clear photo of the thief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rschooley What da f***?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did it really prohibit anything though?  To the GOP, it's just another piece of pretty paper to ignore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsAvaArmstrong How about PARENTS - what's being taught?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Obama worked on compromises with the GOP on ACA.  That's a documented fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 The mind set of opposition is the problem. I remember a time when politicians compromised and worked together to pass fair legislation. Mcconnell just blocks everything coming out of the House and these Senate jackasses get paid tons for doing basically nothing but grandstanding.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYinLA2121 I needed to hear something like this today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash PLEASE FIX OUR COUNTRY!  All the things that make us strong are being abused by this administration.  If he is allowed to do it, anyone from any party can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freespeech4evr @KenidraRWoods_ No, that's having sex with someone you are just luke warm about and try it anyway.  What she said is Coersion / manipulation / feeling left without a choice, that's rape.  Easy difference. Justify much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGuyInOKC @The_Lady_Red @CHURCHLADY320 Thank you for that clarification.  With the way things are going I thought they were moving in the opposite direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PithyJoe @_Lesley_ @RSutter @DonaldJTrumpJr You clearly don't know history either.  WE went into Afghanistan and created Bin Laden's desire for revenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WickedBev @Inkatt @TalbertSwan Actually it's the opposite of how you are reading it.  He cannot fight his own battles therefore he'll talk big and bring a weapon to a fist fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Remind me, How many deferments did you get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they not fighting for a sperm deactivating pill or patch?  Where's the legislation to require men to raise the children they father?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SssParody No apologies, they let this happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGuyInOKC @The_Lady_Red @CHURCHLADY320 And by proper direction you mean take a way a person's right to autonomy and self protection?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@purplestreak13 @shannonrwatts I should have #rhetorical. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts He's going to prison, right?  Multiple charges?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reedgomperts @TomiLahren You're right.  When will men fight for the sperm deactivating birth control pill/patch  or for reversible vasectomies until ready to support a child?  Stop telling women and do something yourselves to reduce abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@audrum1 @TomiLahren An impregnator with an option.  Hey, when you fight for the male pill and vasectomies until marriage then talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCCALLC13 @TomiLahren No, it allows men to impregnate.  Forced reversible vasectomies will end the need for abortion too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX You are kidding me, right? Maybe you should turn off FOX and see the actual freaking racism pouring out of your GOP side.  Or hell, read your own damn presidents twitter account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Presidents cannot declare war, can they?  You know, Constitutionally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priceless.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The only one who's orgasm makes a pregnancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaka_redux @BlueCentrist @armandodkos Wow. That's helpful.  Thanks for making our side look like buttheads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaka_redux @BlueCentrist @armandodkos Ok, I guess I don't see how a black woman working toward her rights along side a transperson in the military and a Dreamer working for their rights and hers is a right wing talking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos I didn't see him denigrating any issue.  It wasn't pie in the sky "don't worry about your own crap" talk.  It was "we've all got our stuff, work toward building leaders who see the broader picture and let's fight for each other's rights." Remember, I'm a likely Kamala voter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elva_morris @armandodkos I didn't read that name change in the manual.  Thanks for the update. :)  But I'm still working to understand how what Pete said was awful...I'll continue reading this thread and learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheStagmania @MattMurph24 Or the woman running can just beat Cornyn.   https://t.co/YZfUpxreZ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos I honestly trying to understand your point, not fight you.  I as a woman need gay men and immigrants to fight for freedoms because if we all work together for each other's freedoms we all win.  Can you explain what's wrong with that concept?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos I guess I don't understand why this is a bad thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos Did you listen to his speech?  His point about identity politics is to use it to fight for one another's freedoms and find commonality because while we cannot act like we know *exactly what it is to walk in someone's shoes, we know what division feels like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rschooley Just go full MTV reality show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos Funny, I just listed to his whole speech at HRC and it was wonderful.  I'm for Kamala but I thought this identity politics point was dead on.  We cannot speak for the asylum seeker, the gay woman, the transgender auto worker, we must give them a voice and not separate ourselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UppityWomanBlog They've done a bulk, but the Muslims did a whole hella persecuting too of Jews, Christians, etc.   All that back and forth BS.  I don't know why it's not talked about more?  Maybe because history wrote the Christians as superior and justified?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tweetmommybop @Stonekettle Typical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isteintraum I think what it did was show a lot of what we already knew about a lot of men.  And conversely it's showing us some awesome men who support women and want them to have a voice.  So, I say success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Bob, you are being too logical for the current state of Conservatives/GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its_GTdawg @soledadobrien Got your number now, waste of airspace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pretty smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its_GTdawg @soledadobrien You are right that almost ALL women rely on men to protect them?  Almost All.  Really. Such freakin' hubris.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is what Saddam did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UppityWomanBlog @soledadobrien And it's a false perception of "being taken care of" when your healthcare is being eroded and Title IX is being challenged and there are few positions available to you in their leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewsf27 @soledadobrien I believe the idea that they need a bullying protector is.  See the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yayacoosburr There's also a cognitive dissonance to that in this day and tech age. I do understand some of it is socioeconomic, white women falling prey to this erroneous thinking most it seems. Weak men need to perpetuate it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Chiudi la porta!  Close the door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhiteDomesticTerrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I know a lot of women who love trump because they need that kind of toxic brainless "masculinity" (used lightly) to make themselves feel protected.  It's a really sad state of affairs when women are that weak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mattforliberty @seanhannity Look at the CHART.  It's clearly a drop starting at Obama's inaguration.  Anything on trumps part of the chart is just a continuation of Obama's policies and would have taken place with a McMuffin becoming president in 2017.  Oh wait...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg Jim clearly is a lonely miserable person.

<|startoftext|>@marianp1968 @Rystefn @TheAirplaneNerd @BurleyMargaret @EstherHyphen @JimHandley21 @AdamSerwer But it's a "Spin".  It was all about slavery. They wrote it that way themselves.

<|startoftext|>@Rystefn @marianp1968 @TheAirplaneNerd @BurleyMargaret @EstherHyphen @JimHandley21 @AdamSerwer The articles of secession themselves LITERALLY say they were leaving to protect slavery.

<|startoftext|>2020 will decide if his reign of terror ends or not.  So few Americans want this kind of gridlock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert He can kiss my ass.  He's working hard to make himself completely irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Funny, because that's EXACTLY what the Mueller report says - Ten instances of obstruction.  It also says it's DOJ policy not to indict a sitting president, so it needs Congress to move ahead and impeach first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sure, no one ever went after the Clintons or the Obamas.  Absolute acceptance and camaraderie from GOP.  Um, Donny, either you are lying or your memory loss is showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Why? Why would anyone want to spend time with these grifters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Including our humility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel We can't make 2020 about anything if even the liberal media helps the republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I had NO IDEA until this that there are violent extremist Buddhists.   That just doesn't seem like it should be a thing.  My Buddhist friends put spiders outside.  SPIDERS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 I've gotten texts and tweets about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNSotu @jaketapper So when Trump says Clinton did it, it's okay then?  Which side of trumps mouth do we believe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CitizensFedUp Right. Put this laughing stock on the ballot.  It's a certain Dem pick up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AttiePDX @ek_olson @GeorgeBoes @hockeymom098 @yashar @4everNeverTrump This is such bs.  Everyone is supposed to respect culture and diversity until it's Christian culture.  Sorry, this rubs even this liberalish the wrong way. Respect people's holy days. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar What kind of SUV is that?  And why doesn't he door lock work!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Why?  Do they show something sinister?  Yeah, we know they do.  AND they show he was broke before the presidency.  It's the only reason he ran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ornery1951 @CitizensFedUp Pence has the charisma of a rotted plum.  All the fawning over trump will be used against him.  I doubt he'd get out of primary season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Yes, Hell Yes, What the Hell are they Waiting for?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemFromCT Since we've know for years he's Mr Oppositespeak, he's toast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh sweetie, you really don't understand the trouble you are in, do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xan_desanctis Uh, but the people who were murdered were spending spent today, Easter, worshiping.  Why is that so hard for you to understand?  As a Christian I totally get this sentence.  Not an ordinary day of worship, but EASTER.  #tryharder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @CNN When you get honest about the 10 instances of Trump obstruction then I'll be willing to listen to anything else you say.  OWN UP.  You have a Russian asset as GOP leader in the WH.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mishacollins @FoLARtweets Human. Remains?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antonio15ferrao @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump They dug and found TEN instances of obstruction, and lots of lying and dealings with the republicans.  So much so that the report was made for Congress to take the proper step - Impeachment.   House gets to decide.  Elections matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lots of obstruction - Ten instances.  I know you don't know how to read. T his could be your issue here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCFKA_NCSteve @onlinesavant @docrocktex26 My hope, as someone with no republican representation, is that the impeachment process itself shows what a louse this guy has been, is, and will always to be. This will hopefully put pressure on those in states that can make a difference. If not, I hope it helps him lose 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA I don't understand why it's even a question.  He's way past due on impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SHE LIED and here it is. She doubles down.  It's not a "slip".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast What did he say about Clinton's BJ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onlinesavant @docrocktex26 I do not give a crap about his popularity after impeachment.  I care about getting him OUT OF POWER.  #ImpeachTrump  #unfit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel Don't worry, I've taken it up for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel Try again to what though?  Vote or oust?  He may get 4 more years if we do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spudmonkey66 @jax_persists Bingo.  Make a HUGE spectacle of his treason, lies and obstruction.  It's all real, it just needs light of day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jax_persists @PoliticalKel How is it political suicide?  The next election is rigged in his favor already.  Purging, Judiciary, Russians.  The only thing that might save us is a huge dramatic political implosion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel So what if we try?  How much worse will we be?  If we do nothing it looks like anyone can do what he's done.  No, I say we go down fighting.  There is no real downside that may not happen without an impeachment attempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel @Adhocoutchea Lose the election?  He didn't win the first time.  And this time It's really rigged, they are purging rolls, hacking machines, loading the judiciary, how can that happen?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DorriOlds @EdKrassen Let's find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT They won't, they can't understand the language.  That's why good reporters should explain it without sensational headlines that mislead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait, then how was he "spying" on you if he did nothing?  Which is it?n  Besides, he did tell McConnell.  McConnell did nothing to stop the russians on HIS watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottinankeny It's the reagan way, the ollie north way, the republican way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity How does this report not indicate that he is the villain everyone knows him to be.  Hell, even his supporters know hes a con and a villain, they just like it that way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mohamburger Toxic masculinity "wins" again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumpcolluded #TrumpObstructed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line - 10 instances of obstruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so Congress do your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many insecure frightened men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLowry Clinton was trying to save his marriage by lying about an affair.  So....does that mean that he was right to obstruct the investigation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boxersforlife @krassenstein @codeofvets I think we have to wait for the Mueller report to come out before anyone can ask for the money from Brian.  THE REPORT IS NOT OUT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 As should any patriotic Americans.  This is a miscarriage of justice. As some said, the Barr spin is that there were 10 instances of obstruction.  TEN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Beyond sick.  Can we just have some adults running the place?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Oh, I hear you, but the truth is coming out on Potus45.  Just a matter of time.  The obstruction is thick.  Let's not forget.  No one has seen this report.  So there may be very definitive proof.  Right now, It's just Barr's untrustable words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe stop obstructing and lying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Actually, no she wasn't.  What was proven was her story didn't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesignationSix The fire was hot.  Unlike water which is wet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Felicity Huffmans crime should be punished in scale with Manaforts.  So, she should walk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Exactly.   But I know from being in Queens he's also always been tied to the mob.  First Italian, then after Gotti went to prison, Russian. Money movement will look sketchy upon inspection.  IRS says he's free to release it while under audit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words, we know more than dumbass trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenidraRWoods_ The number is not important.  Your health and the way you physically feel.  Your body looks strong, firm and healthy - don't mess with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lenieduffy So far, English, Spanish and French.  I bet he's got one more up his sleeve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I don't give a crap about Bernie, but if Trump is the only one not releasing his taxes that's my point.  Lying maggot promised them years ago.  The audit is a lie. (As is everything coming out of his deranged mouth) but I know I'm preaching to the choir here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many languages does he speak fluently?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan It was the rallying cry of the survivors of the Holocaust first!!  He sucks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightWingWatch Which service did he go to for Palm Sunday?  How about for the Sunday prior?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill OK, I can't stand him, but I understand the museum comment.  It does have a LOT of historical significance and contained many artifacts that would rival "museums".  So greater than is a kindness.  He's still an ass though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsreallybrant @AliceLongaker @Nightin66135701 @JoeMcelyea1 @Pulpbomb @MSignorile @realDonaldTrump That would be sneaked.  Like leak and leaked.  Snuck is a more modern version because stupid people couldn't remember sneaked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT You could have been a part of stopping this.  You coddled him, you helped create him.  Do something NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 No, liberals find him stupid.  Why does he want to release them in sanctuary cities?  He thinks they are dangerous. Okay, let's say they are. Is he chaining them there?  Aren't they free to go anywhere?  If they aren't dangerous, then his whole argument fails. It's just petty BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 After all of your tweets I'm finally watching.  I'm nothing but embarrassed for these dopes.  They stuff they tell cops, do they really think anyone believes their crazyass excuses?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 And trump reflects the disdain racist america had for the Obamas.   Good people, solid marriage, educated, good kids, no scandals, yet they were vilified, called apes, Michelle is constantly called a man.  Racist crap.  And trump was their answer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill Then he has no respect for the office of president and should vacate immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CortesSteve No, It just means his followers are dumber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar It's both. As a woman, I don't even feel okay hugging a friends elementary age child these days. Children need hugs.  And I hate this side hug crap, it feels more impersonal than a good eye to eye handshake.  So, that's societal norms changing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Talk to your colleagues.  We paid for the full report, let's SEE the full report.  Or at least Mueller's summaries.  Barr is tainted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump Whatever, Wendell 0410091 - yeah, you're real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump I just feel I have to do your homework for you.  Donald Trump spend those months on a personal crusade against the Central Park 5 and has yet to apologize even after they were released and exonerated. It's all documented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump Central Park Five?  His adultery?  Um, the legal system.  It's all documented, try Google.  He was also sued (and lost) for discrimination against blacks in NYC housing.  Again, documented in the legal system.  Or do Trumpers not believe in the legal system? Seems so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHoff305 @CNNPolitics @TheDemocrats Maybe you need to look up "Starr Report".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Hearing cancer?  If that's true the sound of his voice is probably enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump 30 years ago trump was accusing 5 innocent black men of the Central Park rape and cheating on his wife, and calling himself John Barron to the media so he would get "good" press - there are some facts.  Blame Reagan for screwing with fairness doctrine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Actually, the report.  The entire report is all they are asking for.  Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump Yeah, that's what a cultist would say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wendell04810091 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump Let's explain this slowly for you.  The POLL was done by FOX news, as evidenced by the fact that it says that below the poll numbers with the date of their polling. MSNBC is  REPORTING the FOX poll numbers.  See how that works?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtaylorphoto58 @gmwertz @realDonaldTrump Look right under the numbers, says it's a FOX news poll.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ACMeinde @TimPDev @AdrianNormanDC @realDonaldTrump No, insurance companies did that.  And will continue.  Matter of fact without ACA you lose the protections that say companies can't cut you in the middle of treatments.  Cancer wins with trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRynheart @LindseyGrahamSC No because he's too stupid to take the lead, but he was probably blackmailed and conned into it.  That I definitely believe because I know him, I've watched his BS since the 80s.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McAllisterDen Rightfully so, they were the words of a bigot.  PS - How the hell would one mock a heterosexual relationship and take it seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis She said on Chris Hayes she came to congress to take bold risks and knew it might mean she wouldn't be around long.  I can tell you though, I appreciate how much she has stuck her neck out for what is right.  We'll see what we can salvage to make change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle I think because people really wanted immediate results.  Like a frog march.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If someone said this about trump would the secret service do anything?  I think they would.  I think they'd see it as the direct threat that it is.  Why does he get to threaten so boldly? Especially as the perceived leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahluwal I'm sorry she was raped, but she needs counseling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@4everNeverTrump Just in this instance I'm okay with following his lead.  He seems to find physical put downs a matter of course.  He employs them regularly, so I would think it makes him feel like he's being acknowledged.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjosco @TradingEveryth1 @RealFacelessMan @AOC I'm glad you are so happy.  Why the hell do you care about NYC news then anyway? Nothing going on in that boring lame ass state to keep you occupied?   Thank you, next.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjosco @TradingEveryth1 @RealFacelessMan @AOC That's exactly the point dude.  Amazon wants to pay Texas podunk wages in an city with an extremely high COL.  And get a ton of breaks and benefits to boot.  No dice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxthegirl Don't need to, GOP policies are stupid all on their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjosco @TradingEveryth1 @RealFacelessMan @AOC Ah, Mr GOP from TX is going to tell NYers how it's done.  News for you... https://t.co/NP1gJ14WCF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjosco @TradingEveryth1 @RealFacelessMan @AOC How about we bring in business isn't trying to screw them PLUS the rest of the city or make politicians richer/more powerful.   If it was really the *smartest business decision for Amazon to be in LIC, why would they leave so easily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's shining a bright light on how the people do not have a say in our "We the People" country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpJew @AOC Clueless deplorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealFacelessMan @AOC They couldn't have afforded to live anywhere near it on Amazon's pittance pay.  People were going to be exploited, not taken care of.  Net negative.  That's the whole point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYCMayor Bill its okay.  We were giving away the bank and not going to get return.  Let's support mom and pops the way we used to.  The way it was when we had unique character.  Not chain after franchise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@henrywilburn1 @yarddog1701 @kylegriffin1 You've bought into the lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar If the media NEVER called me out on my lies I'd tell them all the time too.  Imagine if they ran his lies and bigotry as much as they ran the Dean Scream?  Trump would be hoisted out of the oval office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhealynyt So why aren't you doing anything to change this time around.  I hear the same ole BS, just new players.  And trump gets all the attention for lies without the callout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ Stop giving her attention.  God.  Once a year she trots this crap out and then I never hear her name again.  Just stop with the "outrage coverage", it's what she seeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davis1970T @ericawerner @gabrielmalor Because if trump gets even a dollar for the wall he will claim ultimate victory and NEVER SHUT UP about it.  Despite not being able to buy a galvanized screw with that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jmacdfw @JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure they'll say this is before he arrived or after he left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump How crazy that he has them convinced now they just need to "Finish the wall".  They believe ANYTHING he lies about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@henrywilburn1 @kylegriffin1 Exactly, no wall needed.  Professionals can handle their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudepundit Trump cam barely speak English, we expect him to know something else?  He HATES anything not American, why would he bother?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Maybe we are running out of people without skeletons in their closet who are willing to take these jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity This before or after the shutdown?  Clearly before the second.  American farmers going bankrupt because of tariffs...  I think they might be pulling this poll out of their arses.   https://t.co/u7t6ffa2Nm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Piscesboy69 @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change @USATODAY ANY one in law enforcement knows that giving this kind of attention creates copycats.  Is that what you want?

<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Philips did nothing of the sort. Proves you didn't watch but 10 minutes. You keep saying "brought his attorney" as if Native American's can't be attorneys. The guy with him was just part of the religious celebration they were in DC to do.  U also don't realize there were 3 groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @Karoli I watched the middle 40 minutes. I feel ya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohamedMOSalih In small doses when I don't have to actually go anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveKingIA Don't you dare speak his name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels It's been a while since I've been a kid.  But I have teens now. So don't come for me there.  Just don't. Stick to the situation in DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Of course you would be.  And you are confusing the two non white groups in this situation. Again, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels It's called ignoring the ranting people who are not doing anything to you personally, especially when you outnumber them about 30 to 1.  "Turn the other cheek" applied here, but clearly they weren't taught well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels I went to an all girls Catholic High School.  You have only convinced yourself they did nothing wrong.  This school will see repercussions of their blackface racist taunts now.  And that's good thing. They brought it on themselves.  Leaders will be fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels This was a March for LIFE.  Have you forgotten?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized somehow @Stonekettle had been muted.  It must have been a while!  I knew something was lacking in my twitterworld, now all is right again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Sorry, this one lost me. (Not sarcasm, I don't understand this response)  OH, my retweet.  Really?  Did you watch him in the video?  It's a pathetic Lord of the Flies moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels One boy?  Okay, now I KNOW you didn't watch the full hour long video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels White men carried torches and wore MAGA hats and one killed a woman by running her over.  Are you saying because that situation happened I can SUPPOSE all males in MAGA hates are dangerous racists likely to get out of control?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Whether or not it "happens", what you are doing is called supposition and making up a narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Again, you aren't dealing in any facts.  Please at least TRY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels "They probably bought them there like high schoolers do".  Sorry, I deal in facts, not supposition.  Fact is this school has a history of racism.  The leaders did not manage this situation.  They are not innocent.  Facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Now you are making up narratives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels My outrage is with the youth leaders who are clearly doing these boys a disservice.  School needs to be sanctioned by the archdiocese.  Field trips canceled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels 1) The Leaders of the Catholic school should have never let them wear those hats.  It detracts from their march. They should have NEVER let them engage the black men, but learn from Jesus to turn the other cheek.  A few shouting men v large crowd of teens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 So, Did you call them after this incident too?  https://t.co/1YvOlDhsS6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Why do you ignore the part of the video where one boy pulls off his shirt and they are all chanting and screaming like a lynch mob?  They were not  "innocently waiting for bus".  That's whitewashing at it's worst.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels Sure ya did.  The fact that you posted the misstatement above proves you didn't really watch. You are just parroting right wing talking points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtherMikey @tedlieu @CovCathColonels In light of the full video it show mob mentality and a out of control teens.  But nice try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_N_E_W_2 @kelly4webb @tedlieu @CovCathColonels You clearly aren't watching the whole video of the MAGA boys and their taunts and shirt removing prior to this face off.  They were out of control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SandraSmiles @grannyfierce @seanhannity You are correct.  Contractors and subcontractors will never see any reimbursements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f_duer @seanhannity Trump said he owns the shutdown.  He could end it at any moment. #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity I think the phrase he was looking for was indentured servants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nepotism.  It's the only reason Trump wanted to be president, for personal Trump gain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NavalInstitute Are you flipping kidding me? Proud Navy family here. Don't even think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA The one, and only, thing Trump gets right is how to manipulate the media.  He's done it his whole life - tv, movies, radio, Page 6.  He knows how to keep it out of the headlines.  (shutdown) and the media falls for it every effing time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The shut down is his way of deflecting from THIS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Dude, they had 2 years of total control.  THEY are the shutdown.  Wow, you didn't even realize this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_UnSilent_ Won't affect him at all.  Rememeber, on 9/11 he was excited his building was now the tallest. Or some bullshit like that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drivebyag @princereebus @SenTedCruz @CBP Which is a small percent of the drugs coming in a ports of entry NOT at southern border. The wall is an unwanted waste and resources can be better spent.  https://t.co/tEZdcNWwe5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @CBP  https://t.co/1YebONq6ff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @CBP You do realize this wall, even if approved today, is at LEAST a decade from starting, right? Engineering and environmental reports, acquisition of lands, lawsuits. It's bullcrap. Fix border security at ports of entry and PAY THE COAST GUARD protecting us. So sorry you barely won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/1YebONq6ff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Liar  The state reps and the people who live there absolutely reject this wall.     https://t.co/iG9NvHHYvV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SockMonkee64 @Alyssa_Milano And your lack of information is astounding.  Obama did NO SUCH THING, this policy is purely trumps.  (Or rather Millers).  But you can't even read enough to figure that out.  Education is surely in bad shape in your state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SockMonkee64 @Alyssa_Milano It's @Alyssa_Milano taking the bull by the horns and investigating and reporting for herself.

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 No one with any knowledge of Trump says he's not racist.

<|startoftext|>And to think they invited him.  People, he regrets NOTHING.  He lives in his head only in the current second and where it will get HIM in the future.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlueGhost40_ I'm not leaving, but I think you are wrong here.  I think she's finally pulling the party in the right direction.  I'm willing to give it a try. She's young, new and has been thrown in with the big dogs fast.  Scrutiny unbelievable.  Give it time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mtmbrooklyn @YadiraVargasTi1 @seanhannity The woman with zero follower.  Look at who you replied to.  Most supportive trump posts are by bots.  Especially if they have no details, just a "We love our president" BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews #BeBest ? Melania, Maybe this is what you meant by you're the most bullied person in the world? What must it be like to live with this? You can leave him, you know?  Blink twice for yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StormyDaniels #BeBest, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wvjoe911 Please please please tell me he didn't say he "wants trump to do the test himself".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no one believed him for this exact reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mightymike8661 @CNN @StCollinson That's an op-ed, poopsy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colleenclark24 @FoxNews When someone tells you who they are the first time believe them.  Why do you keep coming back?  Seriously, I'm sure you have better things to work on.  We both do. Go ahead and have the last word next if it makes you feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYCMayor @NYPDONeill @NYGovCuomo    Still waiting for this answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko I see it now!  It's like one of those online optical illusion games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends This saudia arabia?   https://t.co/dkOJJpA9ZF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colleenclark24 @FoxNews Telling you that your gaslighting (innocent ole me is just asking mean ole you) routine is obvious is not a diss. It's an observation. If you don't recognize your behavior spend some time with our Jesus in self-reflection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mightymike8661 @CNN @StCollinson Oh yea, that seems like a legit political science primary source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest He can't even write his own music.  His hits are all covers and heavily sampled tracks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer @LindseyGrahamSC Ho, boy, the showgirl really can't stand not being center stage with trump for even a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mightymike8661 @CNN @StCollinson No, not alluding. Outright saying.  And you need to do a little reading about what Nazis actually are. You've let FOX and Breitbart think for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mightymike8661 @CNN @StCollinson No, they've bred to be Aryan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aimeemb24 @armandodkos @TheWhitneyBrown So, basically they are betting on other tribes losing the right to vote, but not them?  Doesn't this sound EXACTLY like historical alliances with the white man to screw tribal enemies.  Man, they really haven't move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fawfulfan He's so pervy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No group should have this right taken away. Even the ones we loathe.  "Your" party won't always be in charge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC I'd rather die of thirst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiff This is why they want the courts.  (And are getting them.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colleenclark24 @FoxNews Sure. That's all it was. Just cause trump gaslights doesn't mean you are good at it. GTFOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colleenclark24 @FoxNews Uh, because it was in the news just yesterday since he campaigned with Beto in Texas and you were dissing the Irish name so I basically confirmed that TWO Irish guys were more fluent that #LyinTed.  Learn something before you think you are insulting someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurtlesgaloreMR Definitely still vote provisional if you can't get it fixed in time!  Then get it rectified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurtlesgaloreMR I really don't want to believe this, but they aren't making it easy.  I know so many good cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurtlesgaloreMR Is it the one with him fighting for "special privilege" for his casinos because the "Indians" don't deserve it?  That one makes me puke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei "Drinks with the village idiot"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cherokees must self loathe.  Here you have a senator fighting for their voting rights and they come out to argue with her about tribal citizenship.  Okay, if that's the way you want it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Citizenship wasn't the question, whether or not she had Native-American roots was. According to the analysis, ...“the vast majority” of Warren’s family tree is European and there is “strong evidence” she has Native-American ancestry - albeit anywhere from 1/64 to 1/1,024.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hardball @SusanPage @esglaude @SykesCharlie Unless you are including real discussion of the 25th amendment then it isn't really a discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@page88 @AdrianeZane Some people are saying that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @skizzle2k9 @FoxNews Justin it's been fun.  I'm at my stop, gotta get off.  I hope you find the Jesus you seek.  Cause I know no NT scripture that starts with "The ends justifies the means".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @skizzle2k9 @FoxNews Nope.  I've never voted for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @skizzle2k9 @FoxNews I'm totally winning. No loses for me. You keep saying weird stuff about losing.  Stop projecting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skizzle2k9 @JustinByrd22 @FoxNews He even pretended to be "John Barron" for attention.  He is so freakin insecure.  He thinks being president makes him something.  He's still a nothing.  Just a more hated nothing. I could almost feel sorry for h..nahhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @skizzle2k9 @FoxNews I'm not torn apart nor have I torn anyone apart.  But I feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, care for the sick and visit the imprisoned....  HEYYYYYY, where have I heard that before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skizzle2k9 @JustinByrd22 @FoxNews Right?  Trump is a twice divorced adulterer, porn star banger, kids with three wives, tax evader, mafia wannabe goomba and somehow that's "morality".  It is satire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @FoxNews Don't talk about yourself like that sweetie.  It's okay.  We can all do great things if we just try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @skizzle2k9 @FoxNews I vote for people who support WIC and SNAP and healthcare and PreK for all for young mothers and children so they can feel supported and opens raising their children themselves as an option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @FoxNews I haven't lost and I don't lose. You are delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @FoxNews I haven't lost yet.  Don't know what you are talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colleenclark24 @FoxNews Yes, fluently.  Thanks for pointing that out.  So does Joe Kennedy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CianciosiTina @FoxNews @tedcruz You are right-ish, Beto's family and friends just gave him a nickname for Robert when he was growing up in El Paso, TX.  He was a toddler when he got it.  Unlike Rafael Cruz, who took the nickname Ted after moving here to the US from Canada. #LyingTed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinByrd22 @FoxNews Who cares? You trumpies set the bar so low this is NOTHING.  Congrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Does Rafael Cruz even know how to speak Spanish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically admitting guilt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@norwegian76 But not mosquitos.  Why not freakin' mosquitos!!?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@POLITICBROS @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Indeed or Great Great Great Great Great.  Therefore she's telling the truth and #DonnieForgetful needs to pay up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cyclethepacwest @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump No.  Someone finally hits back and shows proof of what a lying phony he is and we're supposed to sit on it. Just no.  Every candidate he endorses owns this crap.  #DonnyForgetful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goldietaylor @DemFromCT @thedailybeast He hates Native Americans.  No, really.  Idolizes Jackson and wants to further isolate them politically and commercially.  He's jealous of their casinos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellievan65 To what end...intimidation, of course.  Shut down dialogue between those who oppose him.  Guess what, it won't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poly_cyborg @SassyKadiK @EdSkipper Nah.  They'd rather vote for a trainload of gays over a Dem.  There is something much more sinister in Lindsey's closet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What job, is the question.  Learning how to be a brutal dictator?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz F means he's for common sense legislation - Red laws for people who are deemed mentally unstable, streamlined AND MORE THOROUGH background checks. Stuff like that, which more gun owners approve of than disprove. #BetoForSenate  #USSenatorBeto<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@slimjimtx @David_Leavitt @tricia_fierro The other side of this is that as a Dem in a Dem area, I don't want to make it easy for people to come in and be spoilers.  As a Dem I want US to vote for the primary candidate WE think can win. Ya know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slimjimtx @David_Leavitt @tricia_fierro I guess what you are saying is NY adds a step to changing your party affiliation. Meaning if I want to change the following year I have to declare other opposing party.  Whereas it just sounds like you just get tethered onsite. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slimjimtx @David_Leavitt @tricia_fierro Right, you are now tethered to that party for the primary election season - no different than registering. I bet it's even public record which primary you vote in.   In the general both TX and NY votes for whoever they like.  There's really no appreciable difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @foxnewsnight  https://t.co/TE1ywxd5JP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slimjimtx @David_Leavitt @tricia_fierro Which in essence is a party affiliation. No different than registering.  Can only vote in "Your" primary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@boblew777 @PassTheSalty Exactly, I mean why was the clerk just standing there with his thumb up his ass?  And what about the person who said "Yeah!" and agreed with her?  Trust me, I WILL say something in this kind of circumstance.  Absolutely, no question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod OK, but you're still an ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THR Can they make him stop, though?  I think the rolling stones told him to quit and he did nothing, and neither did they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @realDonaldTrump So the president invites an unstable man off his bipolar meds to rant on national television in a very nonlinear and manic manner in quite a public meltdown and this is about democrats?  #RepublicanVictimhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just because YOU have no idea about something doesn't mean the rest of us didn't get it days ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 No, seriously Bob, Kayne has bipolar disorder and admitted a few months ago to getting off of his meds. He and his mental illness was exploited this week.

<|startoftext|>@fishypants__ @tamitao2 @RickSmithShow @docrocktex26 Every network needs to be purchased by people willing to let the truth be told.  Minority groups, would be best.  Right now we fight upstream when the media downplays the privilege and and real issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP If by free-styling you mean unmedicated manic rant, you'd be right.  trump exploited a man with mental illness to get his tax evasion, voter purging and kavanaugh (new) investigation out of the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which network news is reporting on this nonstop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's incentive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Oh for holy heaven, he IS a trump supporter.  WTH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq reports are fuzzy.  proceed with caution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @deneenborelli Trump defrauded the government out of $500M and you want me to react about how he manipulates and exploits an unmedicated mental illness patient?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ananavarro But trump likes them compromised to do his exact bidding.  The GOP gets their way, he gets his.  It's not about what's right anymore.  Ana, you don't belong to this party anymore.  They left you when you kept your decency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @ChuckGrassley @FBI Too bad they weren't really tasked to get to the truth but play and shell game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think a woman has to remember the date of her assault or details outside of the assault itself, read this thread.  Dare you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AishaStaggers @MKGenest Holy crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_a_charbonneau I miss having a president instead of this insane gang of chaos running the WH now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joyce_tyler @admiralmpj @soledadobrien @SenatorHeitkamp I hope you guys have called to voice your support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I'd never take that bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evan_McMullin I say this with respect, Evan, what do you do to help this cause besides tweet?  Are you calling, speaking with colleagues?  Writing op-eds.  I'd love to hear how you are leading the fight for higher standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP_Politics @texyellowdogdem What does that comment even mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Folks, Kavanaugh is the ultimate prize for the GOP putting up with trump.  It's why they have supported this incompetent dotard all along.  There was never a chance they wouldn't vote him in. He's the endgame for "the vast right wing conspiracy" we poo pooed in the 90s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gold star parents, black mothers, POWs, yeah, what's a few more hurtful comments....I mean, he's just playing.  (Says every abusers' apologist ever)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX They've already come up with a counter...."OH those are liberal churches".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @FoxNews Jay-Z and Oprah need to buy FOX.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyAnnCLE @joshtpm @TPM @Sen_JoeManchin Call, keep calling.  It's not over yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyAnnCLE @joshtpm @TPM @Sen_JoeManchin Call, call call and call again.  Every call should come with a "we are going to primary you out"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealdrix78 I thought it was hysterical.   Ignore the lonely cranky self righteous people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bIazingxmexican Means your crush doesn't deserve you.  Someone better is out there.  Don't force it. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joetelco1 @FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse No, I don't watch it.  Then again, I didn't watch the Apprentice either.  Saw enough of his bullshit growing up.  NYers weren't suckered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel Not one word on my Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX So the angry protesting crowds must come to DC.  Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, slimy bastard (and some corrupt politicians of the time) screwed us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotladywriter @shannonrwatts Why does TX get two on this committee?   WAIT, FLAKE?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohamedMOSalih Seriously just finished two bowls of rice krispies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @POTUS Come on, Ted.  This one was hand picked by Rove ages ago.  He's going to do whatever the extremists want, including making it easier for trump to get away with treason.  They don't want a good judge they want THEIR judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joetelco1 @FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse If you can't tell the difference between a late night TV comedy show by paid actors and a president of the United States, that pretty much tells you what the problem is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TriciaJJones @CitizensFedUp quit.      Dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TriciaJJones @CitizensFedUp It is, it's changing things!  Don't stop. It's just not changing it as fast as we like.  Remember this is the end result of the GOP strategy that started 40 years ago.  Kavanaugh is their end result - owning the judiciary.   We cannot quite now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jheil @matthewjdowd @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @PressSec @WhiteHouse It's only working on the people who want it to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @PressSec Good!  Because it's a fact Kavanaugh lied under oath.  (Not about assault, about when he knew about Ramirez and that he has a drinking problem.) #UnfitForOffice #Unfit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ Sing it, sister!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS Kavanaugh was not well vetted because they want him for political reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS In addition:  https://t.co/Uq8xnzVOKM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS Newsflash: It's Ford's claims are being investigated.  I guess you just proved her claims have merit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasRenaeUSA @FoxNews @GOPChairwoman I think that's what you want to see, not whats really happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @GOPChairwoman Too bad you aren't worried about protecting the people who live in American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS When it's determined it's not true then there should be legal consequences.  But given 2-10% of accusations are false, we can safely assume that someone falls in the 90-99% truth telling until an investigation determines otherwise.  During this time mocking isn't prudent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS Because common decency says you don't mock an alleged sexual assault victim.  Really, could you not figure that out yourself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evan_McMullin Too late, Evan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burghsportsfan @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS #WhyWomenDontReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dwlbok @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom @JonathanTurley @POTUS So can we assume Brett was drunk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin_B_Hayes @FoxNews @JonathanTurley @POTUS If you can't distinguish the difference between a late night TV comedy show with paid actors and the president of the US representing Americans, you are only exemplifying the greater issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC I want to see if they are republican or dem too though.  Because white dem women do not want him confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When sanity, not partisanship, prevails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoliHandGrenade @JamesCh33206474 @jonrocks69 @BetoORourke @TexasTribune Thank you for taking the frustrating time to correct a bot's bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTFaye @ihatethemedia @BetoORourke Laura Bush accidentally killed a friend in a car accident.  Sometimes bad things happen.  Lying about and covering up are the problems.  They speak to an underlying dishonesty.  #Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ihatethemedia @BetoORourke How does that even matter at this point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly cannot believe this news is shocking to some people?  NYers have been shouting this from the rooftops, open your freakin' ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien We can only hope, at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX Who you callin 'we'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Of course you don't care.  Secure men have a confidence these name callers will never have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyschwartz Yes.  He's just a means to their end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember this gem?  Women are to be controlled.  The thought process of any sexual assaulter.  https://t.co/woVv6FU6sB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisNicole20 @FoxNews From the UK.  FOX clearly thinks there's no actual news to report from the US.  Here, I'll do it for them:  https://t.co/4l2x2FT0RH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rschooley That's a @PreetBharara question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughJor67496599 @FoxNews Bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sftballwife @BettyBowers This was exactly the thought that ran through my head.  Who is seeing them act like this?  For all they know it's their daughter, sister...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews You never know with these things, could be a peach, could be a bomb.  Better be on the safe side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughJor67496599 @FoxNews Right now, until the investigation is complete she is an alleged victim.  And trump, an admitted sexual assaulter, is mocking her.  Face of GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Trump at Mississippi rally slams alleged female sexual assault victim, disrespecting 2 women in 2 days.  Face of GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump Sing it, Mayor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiancaDee3 @CitizensFedUp And his little group of turds laugh behind him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawaiiDelilah Could you at least give us good news?  Like possibly are less women actually becoming and staying republican?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ All we see is one woman in a shiny dress. Men actually think this crap works?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 And no, it's really true.  They rescinded the exception allowing same sex couples to bring their partners.  The allowance was made for those in countries who do not have marriage rights.  But pettiness and hate reign in this administration for no other purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Actually I was asking your gay republican friend. :)  I never understand gays who vote for folks who love to make them second class citizens.  I mean, they still are not protected from firing just because they are gay. Who votes for that for themselves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivavelo @dgdoggett @LaceyVoteDem @SethAbramson I wish we had more pictures from those times.  But alas, my "college gang" can piecemeal together, maybe 2 dozen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson @WillieGeist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Why is NYT reporting hundreds were moved to Texas, not 136.  Hundreds. Who are these children?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod Okay, found this:  https://t.co/llBItxDc54<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod Honest question: Can unmarried heterosexual partners get visas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Maybe Kavanaugh can learn a thing or two from Beto about how honest apologies work.   https://t.co/DpK2CUByKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GayRepublicSwag @Scgator1414 So, you're cool with this:  https://t.co/lHH3iXdxDb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Collinthegrey @ali Yes, corroboration and thorough investigation are good things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treasonstickers @InequalityIsBad @LindseyGrahamSC It's definitely not the gay thing.  Who the hell cares about that anymore?  This must be something dark and seedy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkJKremer I had to look it up: "Aggressive following is defined as indiscriminately following hundreds of accounts just to garner attention. However, following a few accounts if their accounts seem interesting is normal and is not considered aggressive. "<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ali Do you think if you just make stuff up on twitter it is magically reality?  It doesn't work that way.  That's not how any of this works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis He has been groomed his whole career for this exact thing.  Rove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh God, one of thooooose Catholics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thisismepurging @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC They need Kavanaugh for Rove's plan to be finalized.  (No not conspiracy, this is what he's worked for for 40 years)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PierresLuv @tessie711 @DaveKozlowski @FoxNews @FLOTUS Has anyone heard her use these other languages?  I mean, I can count to ten and say where's the bathroom in about 6, doesn't mean I'm fluent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBianchi1 @FoxNews @FLOTUS He called them shithole countries and she goes to talk to them about speaking nicely to others.  Yeah, that makes sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProudResister @JailTheTrumps @realDonaldTrump Or his own assault victims.  Let's not forget this is projection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Does he ever work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios The goal posts should ALWAYS be find the truth, period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesignationSix Right now adding "Catholic" to his resume when he's under investigation for sexual assault might be as stupid as comparing him to Cosby.  And I say this as a Catholic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Do you even bother to read the responses to your tweets?  Why do you keep tweeting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@docrocktex26 Not to be a spoil sport, but aren't the young republicans registering in record numbers as well.  (Please tell me why I'm wrong.  I want to be wrong)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis But, he's just saying what we were all thinking anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis No, I don't think he does.  Drinking leads to a sense of out of control.  He can't take that.  Now drugs.  That I can believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, we haven't forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, well I'm glad to see the president all sees what we see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the incels and QAnon-ers think this is what makes a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Simple:  Don't hold a woman down, cover her mouth and try to take her clothes off and no one will question your damn yearbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@todd_holloman @JohanVorster15 No, she's thinking "That'll never happen to me.  These girls bring it on themselves and then blame the poor guy."  Thus perpetuating the cycle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @POTUS #NAFTA2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannoncoulter Gee, belligerent, didn't see that coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brucekenerson1 @NateSilver538 By your own admission the answer is NO.  If he can't tell the truth about something so simple as college drinking and high school braggadocio in a yearbook without screaming, crying, lying and evading answering - then he doesn't deserve the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freemktnc @NateSilver538 So then why lie about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Dude, interview the people jamming the phone lines to tell you want a lying scum Kavanaugh is - his own college roommate.  The fact that you won't says YOU are being political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg I wondered why no one asked Kavanaugh that exact question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zac_Petkanas multiple times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellat1999 Would the 25th work for him too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't make him a martyr, just vote his arse to the curb for the rest of us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellat1999 The 13th?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews But he said he would release them after the election!  It's like...he...lied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kanyewest Dude, trump and ivanka outsource their damn products to other countries.  trump hires mostly foreigners for his US resorts.  Geezus, educate yourself before you talk more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmasher2 SCOTUS, unlike lower courts, doesn't have to recuse.  So, he won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFILE Why, it's an opinion?  If this is their opinion why delete it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer OK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gjbpb @UBAPAULCHUKWUD1 @FoxNews @foxandfriends It's a bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @foxandfriends The people whose family land you are stealing think otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod Save some time, also have them investigate who paid off Kavanaughs debts and what the Russians have on you, Lindsey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaBloom @amjoyshow This should be the top story on every news program today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proven time and time again.  #Enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance @resisterhood  https://t.co/Qp3VDryo5D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke @tedcruz - Why don't you both take a stab at responding to @DFranklinChi 's thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other crappy GOP news....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>History of concerns with his professionalism.  That should be all we need to know for a lifetime appointment.   #KavaNO #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. #KutKavanaughLoose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are we still considering him at all?  Move on to a better candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Why is #Kavanaugh even in contention with you anymore?  Negating the attempted assault he proved himself a petulant, evasive, angry, nonjudicial partisan hack at the hearing. Job interview failed. FIND A BETTER CANDIDATE for a life time appointment on SCOTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 And no, all the people who know him most certainly did not give him rave reviews! Some corroborate that he was a binge drinking ass. And a number of women who first backed him up, backed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Here's the truth. I don't care. What I do care about is that I saw a belligerent self entitled prick at that hearing. A partisan hack who was above answering questions because he knows he's not the choir boy he's pretending to be. IMO, he failed this job interview, next candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turnered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts @NRA Been listening to you people for 240 some odd years.  Sit down, already!  Let the rest of us talk for a change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill I can't believe I wasted time reading this tweet or typing this out, but if you think I'll read this ridiculous article you are nuts.  In other news, water is wet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano And he needs Kavanaugh in to get him out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnarchyLives @marcorubio @FBI Really?  Mark Judge the main witness and accomplice provided his statement under oath?  Huh, where'd you get that tidbit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddezmom @PreetBharara Aw crap.  You just reminded me the reds are still in the washer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara I'll buy a copy but it has to come with an autograph, so book lots of NYC signings. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSBUNKER @brithume Well, we already know he's lied tons, that's on record.  So really he needs to be disqualified for that alone.  Oh and his really shitty temperament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei I totally caught that!  Such a tell with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Dem and Indie women voters.  GOP women believe Kavanaugh is just one of the boys and has been so rudely treated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Their side of the story is they didn't.  That Ford asked for it not to come out.  There's no proof DiFi did leak it, but even if she did, who cares? Politically motivated timing by Dems or not, I believe Ford.  As for Booker, if he does, investigate and go after him. As with any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kristinheart64 @proftheatre @Goss30Goss @howl505 @FBI I'm hoping they just find all the other lies which tank his credibility. Nights of blackouts, women who knew he groped, men who admit they saw him or heard him act like a pig toward women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardenMel @TimothyKenison Not really.  They pretend they do, and they don't want rights for LGBT, but they would rather have a gay then a Dem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@la_wa @BravenakBlog Oh definitely, but it was all self damaging.  I never wrote things to destroy or ridicule others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyKenison I can't see why anyone would really care about something like that.  It's got to be something bad, something so immoral or unethical, to make him act this way.  Think black mirror.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until it gets to Kavanaughs kangaroo supreme court.  Which is the whole point of this bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this for real?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Actually she remembers the most important parts.  The only witness was Mark Judge.  Let's see what he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld The powerful will not only continue to do all they can do dominate women, they will punish them fiercely for their attempts at opposition.  Like any good batterer or slave master would do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canna_mr @FoxNews @SenJohnKennedy But this is also designed to protect trump from his outrageous actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texasblaze1 @shannoncoulter AND trump wants him so he can get any case against himself tossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannoncoulter Unfortunately I can name half my block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod Maybe they don't have to say that if you'd realize you people been talking for over 240 years and think you're still entitled to speak over everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandaceTX That's the one we run in all the ads to unseat him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seungminkim Anyone surprised at ALL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GideonResnick No, their minds were made up.  They want the court stacked they really don't care about any of this.  No even their own seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would he allow a defendant to speak to him like this when he's on the bench?  Smartass bastard.  THIS is the guy they want making decisions on our behalf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Who said her witness can't remember? That's the whole point, we haven't even begun to investigate this.  Look, there are plenty of better white male conservative judges they could pick than this guy.  Ditch his tarnished ass and put in someone better.  Gorsuch made it just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 There is no statute of limitation on sexual assault in Maryland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To recap: Maryland considering criminal charges, Republican Governors in 4 states, the American Bar Association, The Jesuits and Alan Dershowitz all call for postponing vote for further investigation -- and we are STILL moving forward with this guy.  #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS @IngrahamAngle A partisan hack bent on revenge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Total partisan hack.  If he gets in, we impeach and Maryland should prosecute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mediaite Where the hell have you been?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheppers68 Attention.  He's gotten more attention. Power, we'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheppers68 Not a bad take either.  But it's the way he flipped and became SUCH a water boy.  Just bizarre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are right. If it was gay, most of us already surmised as much.  So what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4YrsToday @titodinzey NO, vote his ass away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess she'd be okay if it was a black or Mexican boy too, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Good luck, we're still waiting on his taxes that he PROMISED he'd release.  Once a liar always a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenC71058214 @bahee_bahee75 @MichaelAvenatti Easy, stop the confirmation hearing and open an indepth investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesFortunate @jimsciutto I have mine.  When I moved out to college they went in a box in the basement.  Many many years later we went through those boxes.  I kept them because they are good mementos.  They, in no way, include everything I didn't in high school and wouldn't stand up in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Oh for the love of all that is holy.  Does he realize he said this out loud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro @BetoORourke I don't like this either.  But I think people are just so fed up with these men who destroy lives with their selfish decisions and then go about dining like the world owes them something.  I personally wouldn't do this, and don't condone it, but I can understand it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBowPapa @matthewjdowd @MichaelAvenatti I guess he shouldn't have brought it up if his client wasn't sure she wanted to go public.  Now it seems she doesn't want to bring the GOP crap down on her head.  Who can blame her, but this is why they win.  Intimidation works on victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @paulbkny @ChuckGrassley But they are compromised and will vote whichever way mitch tells them too.  I will be shocked beyond belief if even one republican votes against brett.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alivitali I don't believe polls anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read all of this.  There's definitely a "but" coming...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanFellini @MMFlint This is my issue.  A movie while we are in the middle of it....why do I want more?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JYSexton See, I took that to mean he moved on her like "She was the bitch (in heat)".  I felt like it was MORE bragging.  Somehow he was such a freakin stud.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chris048 @JDandTurkelton @JavierLandes @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz Can't stay on topic can you?  Too painful to face the fact that your party likes pedophiles and rapists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris048 @JDandTurkelton @JavierLandes @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz There's been nothing inconsistent.  You can't frickin read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris048 @JDandTurkelton @JavierLandes @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz Can you not read?  I said jailed and convicted.  Hard to do your damn job from there. See how blinded you are you to anything that doesn't fit your narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris048 @JDandTurkelton @JavierLandes @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz No dope, I mean it's a non issue because NO ONE thinks he should get away with it. You want to pretend Dems don't care.  Unlike you people who want to see a man who denegrates women for fun (and writes it in his year book) appointed to a position of power over women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgjgsportsfan @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz I bet his a cheap tipper anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDandTurkelton @JavierLandes @Chris048 @SmashRacismDC @tedcruz I don't think there's a Dem that doesn't think they should investigate Ellison and if necessary convict and jail him.  What's your point?  It's a non issue.  Do the right thing in both cases.  But the GOP is hellbent on ramming thru a liar and creep to a lifetime appt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jenn_budd I was one of those people AG Eric Schneiderman was trying to prove never commented on FCC for Net Neutrality yet there it was a comment from "Me" with all my info.  This comment was counter to my actual opinion.  What ever happened to that lawsuit or whatever it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianeZane @nytimes I see John Barron is back to business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyKroll What does that even mean!?  I'm so confused. Did she do video before or after removing her name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Almost everyone responding to your tweets is letting you know what a disappointment and a sell out you've become, yet you remain tone deaf on purpose.  It is completely bizarre and bordering on corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq LOL...for a split second I was like... he said what?!   But yeah, he might as well have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UppityWomanBlog Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UppityWomanBlog He won't be a serious contender, but I do love his slick lawyer moves.  It's been effective, especially for those who aren't motivated without theatrics in this reality-tv world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambalatteman @Debourke @KimStrassel None taken. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambalatteman @Debourke @KimStrassel No nooooo...those are FOX anchors, silly.  ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realrogiroman @tlrd Sounds like he's got a lot of pent up rage.  Hmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambalatteman @Debourke @KimStrassel So bizarre that we should ignore who people are because others are uncomfortable with differences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP Dude, that's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State TV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambalatteman @Debourke @KimStrassel So, it's not identity politics when its a white man?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heitmeyernancy @Debourke @KimStrassel No, he'll tilt the court to corruption.  He's so compromised and it's obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lnTransit @Debourke @KimStrassel You must not understand Communism.  Besides, that's exactly how our law and order government works - allegation to investigation.  Otherwise it is a dictatorship where people just scream "Lock them up" with no justification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lnTransit @Debourke @KimStrassel OR even better, they can open an actual investigation to deem credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Debourke @KimStrassel Gorsuch had not trouble like this.  Maybe it IS just Kavanaugh, maybe he's scum.  As a Dem, I'd happily take a look at a Conservative woman choice for SCOTUS, especially a black woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Maybe Merrick Garland should have been confirmed as he was actually liked by many bipartisan leaders in Congress.  You played the game first and now put in a player, a real player, who likes denigrating women and drinking heavily.  And you want him to be a major decision maker?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Ramirez didn't first come forward, those remembering what Kavanaugh DID were the ones who started the ball rolling.  Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @POTUS No we're not.  What lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be totally true, except for that pesky Neil Gorsuch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom Gorsuch?  Come on, man.  That's BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've said that for almost 30 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Slimeballs.  They KNEW!  Come on guys, there must be better far Conservative white men to put on SCOTUS, dump this jerk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterWaldoToo @AtticusGF Thanks. I thought maybe that's what he meant.  Michael Avanatti has been effective in terms of Cohen.  And wouldn't it help Ford if there is someone to corroborate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtticusGF Spare us Michael Avenatti's involvement or spare us Kavanaugh?  (I'm serious, I'm trying to figure out your intent.)   If BK withdraws we're spared all of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joshtpm I have high school calendars to this day, they are fairly detailed about school assignments and events, but I promise you they don't contain everything I did. I've kept them as souvenirs/diaries of my HS days  I don't think they'd stand the scrutiny of a trial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read every single one of these tweets.  This is why we fight.  This is why when men say they don't believe Ford we know they are just so clueless about reality.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Bill Cosby didn't molest me.  Should I stand behind him?  That's the stupidest crap I've heard.  These same women freak about a photo of Franken.  Stop deciding you support someone because they fit your political narrative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BridgeJody @BettyBowers @tedcruz @BetoORourke Show me where he said he was Mexican.  You are either super misinformed or blatantly lying.  I think I know which one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@riotwomennn Impeach the judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StLouPatriot @seanhannity @GreggJarrett Why is that?  Because we NEED a tap on this insane unfit president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity @GreggJarrett oh, now only republicans can make sarcastic jokes?  Or maybe mocking a disabled reporter wasn't a joke? Maybe none of what trump says was a joke is. Which way do you want it? Make up your minds hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 LOL  Yup, still waiting for Trump to show his taxes.  You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 If it works, but it doesn't.  Corps just got a HUGE tax break, repurchased their own stock, made millions for themselves and gave pennies to the people.  Churches DO do good works, but they do an awful lot of harm to, so make them self sustaining. Free market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Why the rush now?  Did you watch the #BetoCruzDebate ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @mattgaetz Very because if he doesn't laugh he'll cry.  Seriously, you're complaining about "jokes" after we have to endure "locker room tawk" and "jokes" about disabled reporters?  Spare me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Thinking about this more...he's right. There is no statute of limitations, she should file with the police now and have him arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cat81Thunder @FoxNews When all you listen to is #TrumpStateNews aka FOX, you would think that.  But out here in the real world you don't have the facts straight at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianneWolcott @ViequesBum @FoxNews Their point is, those boys didn't come out immediately and tell the police so according to trump it nullifies their claim.  Which any sane person knows is BS.  But this is trump, so sanity isn't available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is why he shouldn't be on SCOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis I knew he couldn't hold off victim blaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patterns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 So remove the tax-exemption from churches and really separate.  Then again, I don't think corporations should have gotten their tax break, so to me it's either tax all or don't tax all, but don't just tax me to pay for churches and corporations tax breaks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChuckKerber @FoxNews And Senator Collins... Maybe you don't know this because you only watch FOX as your MSM?  Just a theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Dr Ford is receiving death threats too.  It's what people think is the way to handle stuff like this.  America has lost it's collective mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Birds of a feather....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he's so great, lets see all the documents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredlholt Whoa. He needs help.  I'm not even mocking him.  It's very sad to see any human been this lost and tormented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  This I did not see coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 The Constitution also doesn't say our tax money should support these institutions either, does it?  I really don't think it's that difficult an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpukita @paulkrugman Right and I'm saying the easy answer for EITHER SIDE is an FBI investigation.  No feelings need to be involved - investigate actions, people present, reputations, high school year books, tweets....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpukita @paulkrugman Easy answer, let the FBI better vet this candidate for a life long appointment,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovHowardDean That is almost exactly something trump has said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say this as a Catholic.  I don't hear my priests say anything about politicians.  Issues, yes, but not candidates.  If they start this evangelical crap I say tax them too.  But these for profit scams....tax them to hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump How many times are you going to post this?  It's a really obvious ploy to make people think this guy cares about anyone but himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Merrick Garland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>70% no.  Gee wonder where this poll got posted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianduroche @AtticusGF I thought she knew it was her sophomore year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtticusGF I agree.  When someone attacked me in a bar, even though it was brief, a stranger and nothing more happened, I have remembered it for a quarter of a century exactly how it happened and how I felt and who I was with.  But I could only give you month and year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins @jaketapper Why the rush?  It's a lifetime appointment.  Seat has been open forever because of your party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysticMous @realAliTweets Because even among shades there is racism.  The problem isn't labels, it's hate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mpukita @maydaymindy9 I followed you because you said you were middle of the road in your bio.  I'm getting the sense that's not true by the GOP company line throughout your feed.  I was really looking forward to seeing another viewpoint, but, lockstep isn't it.  Be well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpukita @maydaymindy9 he didn't take one, and she has documentation of sharing it with a therapist years ago....so far the evidence is on her side. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpukita @maydaymindy9 Wait, he did lie. That's already been documented.  That's not my word for it, that's in the testimony.  As far as Dr Ford, No, I actually don't know he hasn't done it. Given the fact that she passed a lie detector test and.....1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Who told him to say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpukita @maydaymindy9 I prefer my judges not perjure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @KellyannePolls This is what the prospect of a lifetime appointment should bring.  Ultimate scrutiny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aravosis I want to know what he was wearing at the party?  What was he drinking?  What color was the cup?  I mean I bet she can give details because of the trauma of that night.  He's just a nutbag who thought this was his right, nary a thought again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews 2, very well, but I don't consider myself exceptionally fluent in the 2nd. I can read and hold conversation well, including slang and expressions, but in medical situations or business transactions I honestly do feel much more comfortable in English, even after all this time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ForwardMarching Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.  Me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Because trump actually is right.  The media are inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews Eventually.  People should learn and many do over time, but in the meantime communication is more important, especially in matters of government, finance and medical. The colonists spoke English, Dutch, French..and FFs did make a national language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hadleybeetee @TopRopeTravis His supporters won't. Independents will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 You'd think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I think the evidence and the lie detector speak for themselves. Whether she has an agenda or not, a potential life long appointment already tarnished with lies during testimony demands greater scrutiny.  Release all his files.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYDailyNews I'm pretty sure I was on these tracks more than once as a teen.  I was an idiot!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he will.  trump loves criminals.  He has more leverage with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSchwerin Veddy veddy intahresting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews BAH hahahahah.  See, see how it is?  This is why people feel strongly about their OWN languages.  Identity.  Why does it bother you, you're American.  And speak English.  Why would your heritage matter? You just proved my point.  Thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LACaldwellDC @OrrinHatch I guess that White House meeting was to get all the denial stories straight?  Is this where Kavanaugh says "It was just locker room tawk."?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmasher2 Well,  #BrockTurnerRapist 's dad said it was, so I guess this is what they are going with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews I understand very well.  You are a bigot. And your bio says you are Native American.  #IcallBS  Trump hates Native Americans.  Always has.  Good day to you. MUTE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews Have you ever been to Little Havana?  Heck, the state of Louisiana?  It's called heritage and nothing to be afraid of. Cher, I think our conversation is done.  Live in your little bubble, but stop forcing your ignorance on everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @katiecouric Did you forget the Palin interview!  Please, that was historic.  But yes, this really did make a difference in our health and well being.  (Well, so did revealing word salad Palin, but in a different way)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ashwathie @FoxNews Do you get out much?  Northern NY has things in French, because GASP, people speak French there, from Canada.

<|startoftext|>@Shoq It's the whole flushing out part.  I just picture hours of sitting on the toilet.  But thank you for the reassurances about the procedure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Nope nope nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq I'm due for a first.  How's the "drano" working?  I have the worst images of how bad that night is going to be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@morethanmySLE @NYCTSubway I have to be honest, I wouldn't get involved physically, but I'd be ready to get help, make a 911 call and send you supportive looks, but I'd be just as helpless against a crazy person.

<|startoftext|>@HeartTeddie @FoxNews Oh the irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DogginTrump I did read some were not here legally and feared deportartion/kids being taken, so thought it was safer to stay put.  But I'm all for not rescuing DURING a storm if you were told to leave, some times you have to make the hard calls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mpukita @WSJopinion I'm pretty sure the agenda includes reinstating many of the sane policies Obama had including protecting some items trump hasn't destroyed yet.  As well as boosting our standing on the world stage again.  The idea that there's only one job to do is pretty myopic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I totally back Laura Ingraham.  She should keep shining a light on her bigotry.  Alex Jones is not just a bigot, he's a violence inciter, liar and defamer. He GIVES UP his rights with that direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYDailyNews Says the person who can only deal with her issues drunk or high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Our goals are similar. It's the means that differ.  And I think that's the truth of the parties, the real truth.  But the leaders so bastardize everything for their gain.  Have you looked at demographics for congress.  51% are millionaries.  Who do they rep?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I never hear actual Dems in favor of illegal immigration.  That is what the right uses as their fear tactic phrasing.  What they want is fairness.  No one wants open borders.  That's as stupid as the "death panels" mantra.  But folks fall for it because it fits narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414  https://t.co/BA5F6Mk4BY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Right, rules, but also justice needs to be served.  Deporting medical doctors who have been in this country for 30 years is not justice.  However, this isn't just about old rules, now they want to make it harder for those already on the path to citizenship. I mean, come on. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Dude, the Dems can't even get people to the polls in a good year, this has always seemed like a very lame argument to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @Scaramucci About that economy.... https://t.co/Pbl8IOYd09<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 But in the meantime children are being medicated and medically treated by the government without parental consent.  They are isolated and frightened.  It's a really shitty way to "open dialogue".  Sometimes we suck at adulting in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 You and I would be willing to come to a mutually agreeable conclusion.  But the methodology and desired outcome of the trump admin is not based on cooperation or benefit to those most in need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 As some raised near gangs in NYC I get this fear.  But in this case it's also over-exaggerated for exactly his reason...fear helps trump's xenophobic policies.  It's how all authoritarians operate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 This pack that arrived are.  That was the problem, trump new the wave was on its way and set up a system to further exploit and traumatize these people to "make a point".  That's just evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 ABSOLUTELY!  And the answer is not getting crueler, but doing a better job of documenting immigration, streamlining the process, deporting actual criminals (not traffic violations 20 years later).  If I can track my amazon package from TN to my house by the hour we can do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414  https://t.co/OjNrK5B8FV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 No, seeking asylum from violence is not a crime.  These people came to the border for help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanmiTim @CharMac50 @realDonaldTrump Good for you.  How you can think a man, BHO, who is clearly light years ahead of trump in intelligence and acumen is worse is telling about your lack of understanding, not your color.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414  https://t.co/OgCsHiktyY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 "there is no law requiring that migrant children be separated from their parents if they illegally cross the border. The current practice is in place because of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which could be rescinded at any time." 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Ok, two facts here.  Yes, children in cages WRONG no matter who. But you believe a twist of the truth.  BHO policy was for unaccompanied minors, the difference is Trump has exploited a loophole &amp; is ripping kids from their actual parents for cruelty sake.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1dudette @Scgator1414 I think what's happening here is you don't understand free speech. Youtube does not have to publish his content, just like FOX doesn't have to give BLM it's own show.  But Alex does have the right to say most of what he wants (hate, no) and the government can't tell him he can't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Problem is Alex Jones hasn't been shunned.  He is followed and believed.  He still has free speech, he just has to find another private platform with which to do it. He's just a fricken psychotic whiner who doesn't understand 1A.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 What the hell is he talking about?  Water diverted to the sea?  Um, climate change is real and a major cause of the drought that fuels wildfires.  Does the conservative state of Texas get a pass because it got all the water last year?  Why do people build where it floods?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @Pnogueras @qz My sarcasm?  How the hell do you know intent? Man, you are one riled up person. Again, I was agreeing with poster and adding a comment.  You have some freakin' chip on your shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @Pnogueras @qz You are just looking for a fight. I'm agreeing with the guy.  It's smart technology.  AND people who are irresponsible should be punished to the fullest extent, b/c dead children don't seem to deter. Matter of fact, that fits with your initial statement about respect in the home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pnogueras @Wagsgrl77 @qz I like it.  And prosecute parents fully and harshly for anything their young child does with a gun.  Including killing themselves "accidentally".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz Right, intended to make it sound like "kids these days are the problem, they have no respect for adults and authority anymore".  Reread your own words. I disagreed and then you started carrying on about never having killed anyone. As if that negates the problem. Maybe it's both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, gun nuts, let that sink in.    https://t.co/GuGHYkHIrq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz When guns are around, the risk is FAR greater regardless of who you think you are as a parent/grandparent.   https://t.co/JFesL2uKoq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz You need reminding that your original post was that this was due to lack of respect for adults and authority.  Stop twisting because I provided the evidence that respect of authority has nothing to do with the increase in access to weaponry and subsequent increase in kid deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz PS - Do I have to do all of your homework for you?  Drug use was int he first article I provided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz RIGHT, and they can't be fired if there isn't easy access.  We've come full circle.  Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredibly cool.  https://t.co/dAjRW4Ka2i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz One more for good measure, from the article above.   "Pew Research data reveals that 46% of gun owners who live with children do not keep their firearms locked. Around 30% said their weapons were kept loaded at all times and stored in an easily accessible location."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz  https://t.co/tAAtnYJXpq   2/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz This is easily disproved. "And then there are gun deaths. In 2015, 143 kids between ages five and 24 died as the result of a firearm discharging accidentally. Another 2,601 kids in this age group—It’s okay if I call them kids, right?"  1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VerityPace @qz @shannonrwatts @NRA Where do I buy my T-shirt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wagsgrl77 @qz Song as old as time.  There's documentation from the 1700s about the lack of respect from the current youth.  It's the guns, it's the access, it's the modern weapon's killing potential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertSpiker2 @qz As heartless as it sounds, even if that includes people who leave their guns out for the children to kill themselves or one another.  Apparently the potential death of your children isn't enough of a deterrent for these people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan BD, I'm gonna disagree.  When a stadium is filled with bigots we need to KNOW.   This place was packed with them - that's the emphasis - stadium of bigots.  https://t.co/g9HYR7jxrq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @daveweigel Don't you have any policy to discuss?  What is this childish nonsense?  So pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmartosko @rudepundit Right, filled with bigots and sex abuse supporters.  FILLED.  Let's not minimize that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle Many photos of it full of bigots.  Let's not hide that fact with false images of empty stadiums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelsey_dallas And Christians would not have their resurrected Savior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalVenom @PressSec It was packed, this photo is being used to discredit libs.  Bigots filled that stadium<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at how much support these bigots give him.  Stop hiding behind false photos of empty stadiums because they make you feel better.  His heinous ways are supported!  https://t.co/tKah5bTrVn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@25thThe45thNOW @realDonaldTrump As a liberal, I'm saying this photo isn't accurate.  Far more bigots cheered and packed that stadium.  Look for those real photos.  We need to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snowy days do make things seem more peaceful.  I'm going to go with that today.  Christmas time, snow in the city....ahhhh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@101carrie101 @markmobility @realDonaldTrump OK, so here's a different picture that shows a much bigger crowd. Showing these empty stadiums shots are beginning to look like fake news because inevitably someone has a different angle.   Be honest...if he gets his full crowd of angry bigots , SHOW IT.  We need to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Funny, now you think this needs investigating?  Now about you investigate the trumps first since they are the ones in power.  Or is there a reason you're afraid to do that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shoq Waist IS the safe zone.  Shoulders and waist.  At this point all the extremism is let loose.  Dems are bordering on the Pence action plan of not being with a woman.  That's how we stay unequal.  Stop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis - HRC wobbled when she walked and it was on the news 24/7.  The current US leader may be stroking out - handwriting, slurred speech, the look on his dopey ass face - but my news is talking about an basic car accident in Whitestone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 As a left leaner, I'd be perfectly happy with a functioning two party system.  GOP broke years ago when Tea Party took over - then extremism flourished on both sides.

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I don't believe Benghazi was what FOX wanted it to be.  (If it were we'd be going after the Niger issue). I don't believe the "clintons murdered their opponents" crap.  If they were that powerful SHE'D be president right now.  So much contradiction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 And this is where we depart, I don't want her to go away.  I do think she is a strong force for good.

<|startoftext|>@GideonResnick Add to the investigation.  And simultaneously begin one on Moore and Trump. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis That's what I don't get the USO is full of this schtick.  I see now why Franken invited an investigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhoWolfe Yes, exactly.  Read the article, so do most gun owners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoWolfe I don't understand the problem with this photo, taken in 2013.  She's always been a gun owner, she wants stronger law enforcement and stronger background checks. Nothing incompatible there.  Most gun owners agree.  https://t.co/yy2ApjmTbR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EAMNY @shannonrwatts @InSpiteOfTrump But is it harassment when it's a part of your usual USO act and your Howard Stern act?  You can see how easily lines could get unintentionally blurred. Apology accepted. Comparing this situation to Moore's or soldier rape DIMINISHES those.  Counterproductive to the ultimate goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts I don't believe I said otherwise.  https://t.co/e00yMDkVen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts Right, and she's ALLOWED to, and allowed to chose how.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts I can't believe how much moral equivalency is given to Moore/Trump v Franken. FFS this woman used her sexuality on the USO tour, yes, she still gets to decide, but lines were blurred by her own routines.  Boorish prank, earnest apology given, yet Al is crucified, trump is elected<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I'm Christian too. But these televangelist wackos pervert the faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle Even the Catholics understand it's allegorical.  These literalists are destroying humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmoomaw Ok, so, as a reporter it's just because you don't want to be shut out.  I get that if he were in office.  I'd imagine as a private citizen you sometimes want to do things without the frenzy. Call me when trump stops shutting reporters out at Mar-a-lago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmoomaw Then, I'm not sure then what your whole point is.  You seemed to indicate it was an issue that no reporters were present, as if, this was a giant problem.  But then admit, any reporter could have gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SO glad I'm not an evangelical.  What a bunch of phony ass Christians.  https://t.co/aqBqxMv6K2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @HillaryClinton Largely historical figure, caricature.  Interesting take from a has been like yourself.  trump showed his cards, he projects, he knew there was foul play in the election.  He sucks at poker too, I bet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PuestoLoco @LeeannTweeden It's not that I don't believer her.  Perhaps Franken did do something she didn't want, but her routine with Howard Stern and in the USO is raunchy and sexually charged, so I can definitely see why what she didn't like Franken thought was just playing it up.  He apologized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneAubin @amb573 @A_Holmesian @kylegriffin1 @realDonaldTrump You're thinking cities.  Get suburban and rural and they are as trump loving red as blood hard core louie gohmert believin far right republicans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 HA...pass to me.  Sure.  CEO needs new Porsche for his kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 My insurance is not through ACA, but employer.  So, I'm not mandated to buy or pay for specifically through government (remember government doesn't have insurance policies, the INSURANCE companies have and sell the plans through ACA).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 That is an option.  Penalty isn't really that high.  I know folks who did take that option.  So far so good for them and their family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 So, all those Irish from the potato famine....they were invaders once.  They and Italians were harshly discriminated against.  Ann Coulter is an attention whore and nothing more (oooh, poetry).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Bob, who who came here in earily 1900s were "illegal" by todays standards.  My family didn't do papers. They didn't HAVE them. They did a physical on Ellis island, got off in Manhattan and started a life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 They didn't mandate payments for their plan, they said everyone had to be insured.  In essence NO different than the law that everyone has to insure to their car.    I bet you can find the numbers.  Really interesting to compare US mortality/Costs v other developed countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Sure if the criteria were "sacrifice".  I think the criteria is impact.  So from conversations of race inequality and protest to the price of pizza his actions had impact.  I can see y they made that chose. JJWATT used star power 4 other folks 2 send money.  Mattress Mac, TX only<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 That IS the point of insurance, the sick are paid for by the well.  Those without accidents pay for those who've had them.  The. Whole. Point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Exactly, so I don't get why people thing GQ mag is some kind of humanitarian peace prize thing.  It's a magazine's choice for person who greatly affected NATIONAL discourse.  Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zubrmeister @KTHopkins Flawed.  Funny, that was used as a bad thing in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Ding ding. you just hit the nail on the head in the argument for single payer.  For profit insurance will ALWAYS screw the patient if it can. I love insurance, it has saved my ass, but I know the system is super broken and overpriced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 They are prohibitive in states that did not offer subsides...like Texas.  Kentucky had a flourishing system with ACA.  Yes, people DO get refused treatments - both procedures and medications. Fact. BS on no regs. We had no regs before and you could be dropped/denied mid treatment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Article says how it's T's fault " The White House has threatened the Affordable Care Act, changed rules and shortened the window to shop for insurance to Dec.15. In response, carriers have raised premiums and exited the individual marketplace in areas that might not be profitable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 If they can't afford a plan under ACA then how were they going to afford a plan without it?  Something sounds fishy.  ACA is just private insurance with a government subsidy, it's not government insurance.  You are insured through the major insurance companies on Obamacare.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 According to the story, he picked her up around the corner from her house, not her front door.  This wasn't Brooklyn.  I'm sure parking wasn't an issue.  30 year old man, 14 year old girl.  Common, perhaps, severely dysfunctional.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Exactly.  I'm getting seasick.  The art of compromise.  This is what we should be looking for in all of our politicians.  The desire to reach out and talk and negotiate.  And negotiate means, you have to give up some of your highest bars to get close.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xdemo2016 @Nikluk @NBCNews @alivitali I think his point is, it's the guns.  Without guns less people would be killed.  Fact.  Yes, killing would continue, but not at the rates we are looking at.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Strength of laws matter:  https://t.co/wAstYFnFxA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Exactly.  Access far too easy.  We didn't have this issue in the 80s after Brady Bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Trump signed a resolution blocking an Obama-era rule that would have prevented an est 75,000 p with mental disorders from buying guns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 limit access to high powered semis and they'll be a lot less shootings too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 So, trump should stop rolling back those laws.  https://t.co/D2DuHeSzrt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 For starters GOP/trump shouldn't have rolled back restrictions on mentally ill being able to obtain weapons legally.  https://t.co/D2DuHeSzrt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@huntertolliver_ @DariusBazargan @isawfireworks @TrumpArmy57 @RushiXO @TomiLahren Says who?  The NRA.  It's not your right, that's their business strategy to sell more guns.  As more people die.  Those people had rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntertolliver_ @TrumpArmy57 @RushiXO @TomiLahren You are SO right.  Let's just get rid of all these stupid laws.  People are gonna break them anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpArmy57 @RushiXO @TomiLahren So, 45 rounds in a minute.  Why would a hunter need that unless they are really crappy hunter than likes their meat pre-tenderized.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenHowe Use something ELSE as a placeholder.  Easy peasy, Ben.  It's like they can't think through the ramifications at all!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Also have a family member who is social wkr- STD/abuse cases through PP. Samples taken there during exam, sent out to labs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 They AND others deserve it/get it. Anyone who offers the kind of comprehensive care they do should. But no, no $$ for abortions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2000Armyofone @marshallfe19 @BPPope @MrJamieMelton @USAneedsTRUMP I think what you are smelling is russian piss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel This is why I said Trump supporters.  I know many Ex-GOPers.  So they are no longer partisan.  They are voters w/o a leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Heck, the one in NYC, if I remember, even does mens health.  You are definitely misguided here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Not TRUE. Mammograms, well woman checks, pap smears, STD testing.  Prenatal checks and vitamins.  Where did you hear this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel whole time I'm reading this I'm thinking, tell it to Trump supporters.  Cause the rest of us live in reality. #notbuying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX I won't be sorry when *their* medical care is gone.   I'll put my heart back in when Trump is out of office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockyTheSquirl WHITE NATIONALISTS, people.  Stop with this stupid soft misnomer. @splcenter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, just tried to buy it.  All gone at the reasonable price.  Gougers are out hawking it now.  https://t.co/cYCVGvJxZD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 But Federal $ already don't pay for abort at PP, yet they want to defund all care via PP.  + Hyde amend restricts abort $ now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Abortion is a special situation. 'Birth control' is not. Women need hormones for a whole variety of issues, &amp; coverage denied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Honest question, which regulations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 But how obscene do those profits have to be?  Moreover, should all healthcare be a for profit industry?  Only for the wealthy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KimberlyBlunk @therealOiBeave @Rocky4President @seanhannity Wrong. You've been had. FOX loves people like u because u won't research truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe Right, I read that and thought, Jeebus, they really do 1984 the crap out of ANY information they spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmSteveHarvey Sometimes they naysay because you are making a huge traitorous mistake.  Not supporting you anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa Not with this congress.  Put efforts elsewhere.  Voting in Ds!!  Local and 2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @ToulasTake Repeat of the way they voted?  That's perhaps why women took matters into their own hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA Did he say, "period"?  If he didn't' say period, I'm not sure it's really the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @ToulasTake I trusted other minorities in this country to vote and keep him out of office. Nov.9, women took initiative from anger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @ToulasTake Oy. Regardless, it's what it IS, it's powerful, and no one who didn't get off their asses like women should complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq @ToulasTake Absolutely NOTHING stopped anyone else from organizing on Nov. 9th, satellite or otherwise. Sheer numbers important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@docrocktex26 He should have probably told you to smile too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shoq No one is keeping anyone out.  So, they should just join. What's stopping that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shoq Yes, but that didn't happen, this did, right?  Women feel especially attacked by Trump, created a drive others apparently don't have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis His second or third tweet made absolutely no sense.  The one that ended in "probably."   He was emphatic, then walked it back. Odd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why?  https://t.co/8aZ4WmmoGV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume @cb20476 No, just a married guy with a baby.  Family values party, my ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GranpaHerb @jones410 @JoyAnnReid I fantasize that he's homeless being swept off the street in front of the Bldg formerly Trump Tower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love getting @SheWhoVotes' take on this stuff.  https://t.co/qmNscZjDl6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa oh sister.  That's rough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmokay.  https://t.co/4idTtNMMsf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crey_tyler To be fair, Trump IS scary to look at.  I'd buy that one too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe You're right.  Boomers raised Millennials.  Boomers end in early 1960s.  Their kids are now young adults, aka Millennials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Sean, who is rigging it?  Republican held congress?  Majority Republican governors?  Which states are rigging?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's new hotel brand is Scion.   https://t.co/byFaUsOJkS  He's hoping Millennials don't notice and spend money on his newer hotels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tx_buyer @Scgator1414 But when the polls show Trump in the lead he praises them. As someone said, 'Heads I win, Tails it's rigged'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithOlbermann Eh just locker room tawk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa Oh brother,  This is also exactly the kind of person that would say "all black people look alike".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james_mainevent @BenHowe @derekahunter because it's info that can be found on Google?  He's mad b/c no one told him? Not classified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe Temperament is the word we are looking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albradley71 @BenHowe @derekahunter Or they show you time and time again who they are, and you believe them. 30 yrs of DT in NYC, one knows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe okay, here we disagree, this isn't "Frustrated", this is vitriol.  He couldn't even move from the podium yet to go to moderator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alivitali How about when a gentleman is being an ass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe  Oh, I know, I was responding to @derekahunter.   That was his "controlled" response.  You know gilded stuff gets thrown at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekahunter @BenHowe What's your point?  Look at his face, the seething hate, during a nationwide public forum. Imagine this in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dailykos This photo almost looks like proof that Trump really is only in it to help Clinton win. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenHowe As people like to say about him "Well, you always know what he's thinking".  Yeah, let's keep him as far from codes as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I think he's more vengeful than that.   Mostly his life will be the rest of this thought:  https://t.co/v9zYzhHlk0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414  You have to wonder what he's thinking. He changes what he's thinking regularly, then says what he thought before didn't happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThomasARoberts I think it's more a matter that Trump has no credibility in the matter. Dolan knows he's a con and a blowhard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@latimes @RockyTheSquirl What is this close BS?  Because he didn't grow horns?  What does that even mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid It's all that really matters....he doesn't believe in the American political system or government.  You don't get to run it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, and he DID in fact Fact Check!  https://t.co/R7v856eYC4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costareports Trump really likes keeping his own assult stuff in the news doesn't he?  It's like extra dose bragging.  He did it, I did it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @MeetThePress Hillary. Hasn't sexually assaulted anyone. I trust her with the codes. She's only one on ballot to beat trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @MeetThePress Have you looked at the guy lately?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @MeetThePress Said the words that came out of his mouth? He said "I just take it, I don't wait" Grab pussy/kiss. HIS WORDS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress Confessed to sexual assault on tape.  Trial for child rape set for in Dec in NYC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @MeetThePress ur initial statement was we don't want a predator in the WH.  SO, no Trump, he confessed to Sex assault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress okay, I take it back. He was fined and disbarred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress CENSURED, not censored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress Bill Clinton was censured, aquitted at impeachment trial.  Trump deserves punishment as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress I don't want to pick on ur reading skills. You said he was impeached. This proves u r wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy10013Kathy @atdor @GissiSim @MeetThePress Show me where he was impeached.  And look up censured if you don't know what it means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I just hope the damn moderators know how to not let him attack without foundation if he goes off the rails Alex Jones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atdor @Missy10013Kathy @GissiSim @MeetThePress Exactly why Bill was censured and almost impeached.  Not acceptible.  Trump unfit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Auldgrand @BraddJaffy @MeetThePress Which is it?  Do we forgive sins older than 11 years or do we never let go? Don't get to have both ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always about him....always about HIM.  https://t.co/o51i9XOwYj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!  (And I say this as a white woman)  Yes, admitting your a sexual predator is bad, very bad, but so was the rest!  https://t.co/7xtUEsTscm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkHalperin @alivitali @jaketapper Staff tweets.  They are so tone deaf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMInfidel01 @alivitali Since Trump admitted to sex assaulting women on that tape, I think should be apologizing for ACTIONS.  Esp. 2 wife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebrinaAlfonso @armandodkos I thinkt he word you are looking for is suspicious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I know I'm REALLY pissed at Billy Bush.  I always thought him sort of an immature frat boy.  He needs to go grow up a little.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jade999 @JessSaidThat @mcuban Yes and Bill Clinton was disbarred and almost impeached.  Trump deserves punishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuban  I think he's betting on Trump Broadcasing Network. All he's been doing is ginning up subscribers. He doesn't want to "work" in WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Like thunder at the public pool -- for the lifeguards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@law145 Again expressing their utter lack of understanding. Reading a book is NOT comparable to confessed sexual assault.  Not remotely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronsagers @laurenduca  He's not saying what he wishes, hes confessing what he's done/does. Takes without permission.  That's sex assault.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stuartpstevens @realDonaldTrump It did.  GOP didn't care to hear it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Foundation1029 @RoboticAdvice @IngrahamAngle Only if the locker room is full of rapists.  Admitting sexual assault isn't a typical Y topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMfreespeech @IngrahamAngle @kilmeade You mean, how he assaults women. Was nice enough to lay it all out. Listen for the sound of tictacs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Is Bill running too this year?  Awwwkwaard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Realtygirl11 Did Jon Voight used to do drugs?  He seems fried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa Tooli, we aren't going to change each others minds here. Enjoy the debate tomorrow. Civility appreciated. Ciao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @reaperrchobby You could wallpaper your whole house with her curriculum vitae, but you won't acknowledge it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity I suppose you can ask the Republican congress who left the embassy underfunded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost  Billy could use a whole lotta that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @reaperrchobby No...Republicans in congress who would not fund more security for the embassy did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AWWW I hope we still get to get a debate/implosion tomorrow.  https://t.co/Z2UrzpookU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mckaycoppins @DemFromCT Couldn't happen to a more deserving group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KickinItPerSe, @seanhannity &amp; @realDonaldTrump are normalizing #BrockTurnerRapist behaviors. Real men don't sexual asslt, and worse brag!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing  GOP is being particularly obtuse about this point.  They know it.  They just hope we don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getoffmylawn80 @SheWhoVotes Expressing a thought and brag/admitting to having sexually assaulted women like Trump did is very different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, but it does give us a preview of the losers reaction on Nov. 9th.  https://t.co/6YfMaSypBe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonvoight THey wear T-shirts with far worse.  They call for her death.  Gimme a break.  Hypocrit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonvoight They're not just WORDS, they are a confession of sexual assault. They are brags about his actions without consent. Tonedeaf, JON!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he must be held accountable. #BillyBush  https://t.co/zFKpkvnuFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa Here we completely AGREE!  But a man like Trump with no skills, no respect &amp; unable to take advice is not the guy to fix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, HRC, she deserved to have a fair shot at winning the WH, not a challenger who imploded on impact.They'll say that's how she got in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can speculate....  https://t.co/UKnno9Vyht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa @tooli65 @reaperrchobby All this "It's okay all guys do it", maybe true, but just maybe it's NOT okay?  That's the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @reaperrchobby If woman weren't corraborating his assaults I could understand your position.  It's not talk...he acts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa @tooli65 @reaperrchobby This last guy has us blocked so we can't see his stuff.  Real tough guy that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justincoleman99 @c0nvey Honey, he cheated on your by sexually assaulting woman and preying on married women who spurned him.  Get OUT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dklaidman @DemFromCT Here in lies the problem. #BrockTurner like behavior normalized by Trump.  Thanks, Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chatelainedc @SheWhoVotes I do.  They are terrible husbands and very insecure men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos @realDonaldTrump Why did I just start singing, "Don't cry for me Argentina"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @reaperrchobby Look at her tits is lewd. Self proclaimed stars admitting to just grabbing pussy uninvited is sex assault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @reaperrchobby This isn't about calling people names, this is about admitting to sexually assaulting women. #TrumpTapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost If you don't want to normalize #BrockTurnerRapist behavior, then handing HRC a landslide is the only recourse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX Wow, but that's a real intense parody.  I'm not a fan this extreme a level of deception when real issues and pathology are at stake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vexed_American @wagefreedom @ScottAdamsSays you mean the forged and proven doctored emails?  Yeah, that lasted all of 30 secs.  Trumps done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_pence Remorse?  Where the heck was that?  So, does this mean you guys are gonna stop bringing up people's 20 year old issues now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KagroX Seriously, Hillary needs to invite him to the debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BAHAHHAHA.  You are half the man DeNiro is.  @reaIDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't want a world that normalizes #BrockTurnerRapist behavior, it is imperative that you denounce Trump and deliver a HRC landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmanReagan @mcuban Because that was pipe dreams to feed the bigot base.  This was actual confession of a sexual assalt lifestyle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnstableIsotope BINGO.  Where's NBCs statement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayCostTWS Sure, if you want to take that route and dissect who Pence REALLY is himself.  That'll win those Bernie supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmartNYT @DemFromCT They did it to themselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @washingtonpost I'm sure rapists do talk like this.  Real men do not brag of grabbing women's genitals without consent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @washingtonpost Don't know women who sexually assault men.  He admit/bragged kissing and grabbing women without consent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveweigel @alexburnsNYT It is unrealistic.  He is the albatross that they cannot shake.  Did we expect anyting less from Blunt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @washingtonpost Your point?  (Because this ought to be good)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro I love your passion and clarity. You called it exactly as it was.  Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @washingtonpost um, no.  He was describing his PATTERN OF ACTIONS.  His entitlements. Confessing to sexual assaults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfKCW @GOP @MSNBC @amjoyshow I hear ya.  I do!  But if this how we bring him down and turn congress blue let's do it.  Fixes rest!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@33tuna @aravosis Someone pointed out his shoulder twitched when he had to utter the word apologize even once.  Got to rewatch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSherman I know that she can actually vote secretly as she wants, but to have to publicly disavow in red dist.  She's screwed either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samsteinhp @Mr_Electrico Poor Tiffany.  Forgotten again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos Nope.  She is knocking him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid They don't care.  They are forward and retweeting his "apology" and offering him their assurances.  It's sick and unhealthy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBMenefee @RealRonHoward HOw is that a defense of Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO @alivitali @NBCNews NO, he apologized that we found out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyTurNBC I'm surprised he didn't close with "And I ended it, PERIOD"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Really are you suprised?  Like you said, I'm surprised he didn't give a tour of something gilded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Yes, no way Billy Bush gets off the hook for this.  His turn will come. #BillyBushSexAssautEnabler<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fordm @aravosis Oh yes, my RW family is exceedingly quiet tonight on facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First they laughed when she said there was a vast right wing conspiracy, then they mocked when she said there was a basket of deplorables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCrapo Why? What will you do about it?  ANd so what if he renounces it.  Not like he's any different today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockyTheSquirl Deplorables do, so it makes Trump "relatable".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Gilman @aravosis Then you haven't done what Trump did and you'd be wise not to act like it.  He's discussing his sex assaults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaamaYehuda @retepger @JayFivekiller @ElaheIzadi And the fact that he'll give SCOTUS control to theocrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis @Jim_Gilman U grabbed a nonconsenting woman by the genitals, got any names, locations? Makes the sex assault case against u easier<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aravosis And yet they are preparing an apology video from Trump Tower?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentrb4 @AnnaKendrick47 Exactly! I understand the urgency to be outraged by Trump, but #BillyBush should not be let off hook!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastordan I already saw evangelicals saying it this afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticalKel Thankful for all of ones calling them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos One hell of an October surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JebBush You might want to think about that next time you have a family reunion with Billy around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeDimacrow Yup.  Jeb came out against Trump's predatory behavior already, no mention of Billy tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realmrmom @RockyTheSquirl @TheBrodyFile Don't you know ALL men do this.  I hear 98% of you talk like that. At least according to Trumpets<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@politicalwire @DemFromCT Exactly!  I mean my gracious, I've been screaming it since June 2015.  I'm not in the least surprised.  Not a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexburnsNYT MMMM, that 'party before country' pie must be soooo tasty right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the right framing.  https://t.co/PpjTQeYV95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@retepger @NaamaYehuda @JayFivekiller @ElaheIzadi Sure it is.   Double standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyMcMack @washingtonpost of "If" like Trumps nonapology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyAppa @tangled_12 @tooli65 @washingtonpost No, he bragged about sexually assaulting women, past tense.  Listen to it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooli65 @LucyAppa @washingtonpost  What the hell kind of men do you hang out with?  And why would that make it ok anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio And politicians who don't publicly endorse another candidate are culpable of normalizing the behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oldladynana @SamWertz @NotJackDavis @marcorubio You poor thing.  What kind of men do you know?  Trump confessed to sexual assault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis WHAT?!  Michelle couldn't even bare her freakin arms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @SpeakerRyan @Reince and Sean Hannity.  He's culpable.  No way he didnt' know about Trumps sexual predatory behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sean hannity is completely tied to this. Can't possibly not know since he's soooo close to Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity This explains why you have NO standing.  None. You are going down with him.  https://t.co/VmzP4cehp9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone heard from Cruz?  Anyone?  #TrumpSexAssaultConfession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan But Trump the confessed sexual predator gets a pass?  So you don't visit tomorrow.  You still "Support" him.  He's tied to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Billy Bush needs investigating.  Should lose job "reporting" if he sat on Trumps sexual assalt confessions...and laughed. #Billybush<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos Weak.  Nothing less than 'I support HRC as a message that sexually predatory nominees will never ben supported' expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin @SheWhoVotes He was smart, because I was looking for it to chew his ass.  Disgusting.  Should lose job.  Never watching him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaPoSean @Fahrenthold Pencing it.  It's his schtick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity  Just shut up Sean.  You are friends with a sexual predator, Trump. A married adultering sexual predator, Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaValenti @DebraMessing I cannot WAIT!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@warybear @FiveThirtyEight I think it actually came in the form of "He's not a polished politician".  Meaning, he talks shit I can't defend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiveThirtyEight And Pence seemed completely unwilling to defend or acknowledge Trump's positions.  And this is the running mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos Holy crap, Tweety said that?  How astute.  I'm surprised.  Happy, but surprised he wasn't sucking up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unsafespace_ @UltimateCaM Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickconfessore Why does it matter?  TV picked it all up fine.  HRC and Holt had no trouble hearing him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveKingIA Nice to see you without your hood.  Please go on TV and be sure to promote your white nationalism even more boldly. @JoyAnnReid  https://t.co/B3pNrexuHJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His reasoning is SO flawed!  It's straight outta Brietbart.  https://t.co/oBG1EiHelN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidCornDC If he knows more than the US Gens re: ISIS, is it because he's getting Intel from Russia?   #asktrumponequestion @JoyAnnReid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOLGOP Cruz is playing it his way.  He took his 30 pieces of silver but refuses to hang himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis  That big bad woman is so mean to little Trumpiepoo.  Oh wait, big strong PutinesqueTrump's got it!! Shit, can't keep it str8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamSeder He's a TV personality.  The only thing he DOES have going for him is his ability to "act" in a way that serves him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Straight up:  Clinton CANNOT take 2A away.  Trump CAN pick GOP hard core White Nationalist SCOTUS noms to screw with Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People, people, he doesn't even know Aleppo. I get it's a protest vote.  But what will you do when Trump picks SCOTUS noms?  https://t.co/rvF9pBZaqs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottAndersen01 @LOLGOP And do so without mention of Trumps adultering or the fact that Melania is suspiciously in hiding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbinMD, exactly.  Geez, welcome to the freakin' party @TheFix  https://t.co/fwmOLyIsxu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFix How about you talk about the exact lies Trump tells.  The work has already been done by real journos, just report it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alaskawater @bspence5 @Morning_Joe @KellyannePolls To be honest, it really doesn't sound like shes convinced herself. She done and worn out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe @KellyannePolls Right, he just simply stereotyped a black man. What other assumptions has he made about Lester? Holt should ask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneGoldmacher Cruz has nothing to show for it either.  Shows you what a loser he was, is and always will be. Trump snub was his best move<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiariGirl357 @crazysmooth @marthajfort @LOLGOP   The blame is misplaced. The end result Trump=war at home. Not trolling when factual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTVasser I think now that it's like DenaldJTrump.  Real enquirer is NatEnquirer. This makes more sense. NatEq loves them some Trumpie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marthajfort Yes.  So let's get Citizen's United out.  A Trump win does not do that.  You don't support Bernie's efforts w/o Hillary in WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazysmooth @ChiariGirl357 @marthajfort @LOLGOP Stop drinking the Koolaid.  She does not want war. You're confusing her with Bush/Cheney<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LOLGOP  Updated: Trump fiddles while DC burns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos But they can tell you the opening date of Trump International.  Now why is that?.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyschwartz sometimes I think you are the only tweeter keeping me sane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's only a "probably" if the media doesn't do it's job.  It IS a problem for Trump.  Caught red handed.  https://t.co/08FqeIOutV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattLaslo I have hope for the next generation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattMackowiak Interesting and thoughful, but my take...Financial backers forced the decision. Cruz took his 30 pieces of silver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  Have your guns ready?  To shoot, who exactly? (or is it whom?)  https://t.co/mS1XKlOCBN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 @TXIndepndnt1836 No, Cruz did it for the 30 pieces of silver.  His backers wanted him to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 I'm going to guess Former Republican Against Trump?  Is there a prize if I'm right. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact: Ted Cruz disrespects his own family.  https://t.co/aXKdRzHreu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 This is just an FYI.  We can leave this convo to rest and rip Cruz the rest of the night.   https://t.co/mGOYIBj05K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendaJeanCDN @SheWhoVotes Both the Trumps' body language says that marriage has been over a while.  Golden handcuffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Again, I think we are agreeing.  Byrd repented and lived his life to prove it.  Trump does for Trump! See Foundation scandal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill If its at the debates, maybe I will tune in afterall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheWhoVotes Hands down.  The endorser.  His wife should divorce him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 Maybe as a whole, people do that.  I believe in mercy and forgiveness when warranted -Christian response. Trump never repents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scgator1414 To own up to a mistake (Membership) and spend the rest of your life making amends...commendable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruz just proved Trump is GOP establishment boytoy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PortiaPodsnap Birtherism was started by some fired nobody.  In the end it was driven and lead by your boy Trump.  He's a racist and a liar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump But he's NOT trying to take it back. He just wants to "end" it so we'll stop pointing out his racism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is YOUR GUY GOP.  https://t.co/9nM1fpiJEz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 And like a true GOP haven't answered anything directly. Bannon's white nationalist supporters?  Avow or not? #Nostrawmen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 Those big words are called...Identifiers.  They are nouns.  Man, woman, gay straight, Christian Jew.  Used written and verbal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 HAHAHA.  Oh, now black radical leaders are your friends.  Dear gracious who can keep up.  How do you feel about BLM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 But which label?  Bigot? Birther?  Be specific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 Or perhaps growing in Queens I watched the upward mobility since the 70s? But strawmen aren't what we are discussing-Bannon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 Completely verified and you know it.Trump caters to neonazis.  Bannon is the face of this movement.  Totally avowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm @DemFromCT Yes, and those that also support him with their silence against it will be equally culpable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anamariecox - even if she didn't say it in private, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmbenson1491 That's a lie and you know it.  Yet verifiable Trump supporters condone or ignore Jew, Mexican and Black and Muslim hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bencjacobs She didn't hide it;  didn't walk back from it.  Still stands by trumps supporters are KKK/Neonazi friendly and don't disavow it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY. RT  https://t.co/RAP7DImmEU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoebeBeach @Mikel_Jollett @realDonaldTrump Half are.  Just ask the people around you at the next rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So, are you apologizing for being the leader of Birtherism and the supporters who still think Obama is foreign born?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthJerseybrk He'll buckle like an asphalt road in the sahara.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bloggi @politico She's not unsaying it. And polls show by number that altho she is trying to be gentle with the #, actually more than half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico She most certainly DID NOT. You are inept.  She continues to call out deplorable behavior.  She walked back on half, tho right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Exactly, and now that the curtain has been thrown back we can KEEP shining a light on the supporters who are infact deplorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump How about  https://t.co/YvcsUOnVv9 and Brietbart lovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos From your lips to God's (of your choice) ear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KThomasDC No she didn't.  What's your motivation for misleading like this?  Or is it just ineptitude?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP She said she regrets saying HALF, but stands by her comments that the campaign is run by and supported by racists. #InaccurateAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @aravosis What I'd like to see now -Trump disavowing or blitz on footage of Trump Supporters as they act deplorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See, she underestimated, yet walked back on "half" to be more agreeable.  https://t.co/eAqlKXjraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alivitali She underestimated according to polls, but I understand her softening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benwiele @blytham @samsteinhp  Being forced to follow AltR theocratic ideas is intolerable.  If it wasn't GOP would be all for Sharia Law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee So how do you feel about Trumps years of Birtherism and deportation plan for Mexican-American children?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can concur. But I'll be damned if the focus should be on her smile or word choice instead of who his supporters r.  https://t.co/xn4IxTYQAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro And then you are 2nd half. Maybe you should question why that other half responds to Trump and his staff of white nationalists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino @HillaryClinton Last thing we need-president whose supporters want to ban gays and deport Mexican-American children. #Deplorable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armandodkos @Jamestaranto  Last I checked WOMEN are American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He loves war.  Through all of his fake deferments...loves it!  COWARD!  https://t.co/c7izTrk4jr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahHuckabee Um, no.  Calling racists racist is called Leadership.  Something Trump will never have or understand. #BasketofDeplorables<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exhibit A  https://t.co/MTwx90weVr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferJJacobs @KatyTurNBC But the son of the nominee angrily referring to former Senator and SOS as #CrookedHillary not deplorable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blytham @samsteinhp I disagree. if people called out potential dictatorial leaders and followers more directly history might be diff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Club_Reid @Realtygirl11 @JoyAnnReid BOOM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nanbp @samsteinhp Are they saying the NEED a SAFE SPACE?!  omg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blytham @samsteinhp Calling out racists and bigots for exactly who they are is called leadership. It's about time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nanbp @samsteinhp For people who hate PC they sure demanded it when being called out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samsteinhp That wouldn't be accurate, then.  It's MORE than half.  Cue stats on birtherism and racism in Trump supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyschwartz @realDonaldTrump BURN! You just aren't as important or interesting as you think you are, Donny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikiebarb  These Trump supporters are filmed spitting on and screaming at reporters.  DEPLORABLE.<|endoftext|>
