<|startoftext|>@Oserus99 @PigPen77644901 @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump The second amendment has nothing to do with the military even on the state level. Clearly you have never used an AR15 before, and also clearly never been in a gunfight. You never know how many rounds you will need to put down a threat or how many threats there is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BiggerBoomStick @BrownellsInc Yes they do. However it isn't a 40mm grenade launcher like the military and law enforcement use, or can be purchased if you follow the process of getting a NFA item. They sell a 37mm flare launcher that mimics the 40mm but isn't a NFA item.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iowastatepatrol For those who don't want to do the math, the number of people who have died that weren't wearing a seat belt is about 87.  That's 87 people who potentially could still be here, had they taken the time to be safe. That's 87 families forever changed. #BuckleUp #clickitorticket<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Juno_and_Misty_ * you come north<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juno_and_Misty_ Shush, let us enjoy summer while we still have it. You will get your snow soon enough. Especially if come north. My area normal does not expect how many inches but feet we will  get but here recently we haven't been getting as much.Thank God -20+ and higher weather is bad enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffFavignano Classic YouTube.. They even play with notifications, so the Bell is useless some times. Granted I use the notification bell on channels I like, (like yours) but when the notifications come in late or not at all, it makes it hard to watch the content I like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldofWarships It would be @ussiowa if I could ever make it that far down the tech tree. Also maybe the USS Des Moines, if I could make it that far as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonutOperator it probably was considered "Sensitive Content" for 1. Being conservative 2. Gun related 3. Talking about a divide subject  https://t.co/wlJXVsqS53<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@policedrawings @Juno_and_Misty_ Has he never seen it before or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juno_and_Misty_ Yeah.. granted it is just one photo, but it doesn't appear to small. But like I said,  it just seems normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juno_and_Misty_ Looks normal to me..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@policedrawings Probably 7, but could be like the male and female version too. Like what they did with the British mark 4 tank.<|endoftext|>
