<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @skystephen @PimlicoPlumbers At last someone has called out people on furlough who have continued to work and claim furlough at the same time as #keyworkers have kept the country going at the same time as putting their lives on the line due to #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @GMB @MarcusRashford school dinners should be available for kids parents who are receiving working tax credits as me &amp; my wife work are son has autism and we have less household income than a family of 4 in receipt of universal credit should be free for all #FreeSchoolMeals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Why should it be down to councils to rehouse people who are asked how they would financially support themselves when being brought here from other countries from arranged marriages clearly this needs to stop 2/2 #coronavirus #COVID19 #lockdown #homeoffice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews It seems to be towns and city’s with big Asian population like here in Leicester it’s not a language barrier as they understood when the country was in total #lockdown the trouble is arranged marriages husbands wife’s kids grandparents 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine Nice to see not that people are not supporting the British travel industry so I hope the rich will have to pay more tax to pay for the money the government has had to borrow due to #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews The police should take names so if people give family love ones #COVID19  after being told that #BAME groups are more likely to died from #coronavirus then #BlackLivesMatterUK doesn’t really matter in their household or they would keep to #SocialDistancing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan The majority of these #COVIDIDIOTS are on benefits or being furloughed as #NHS and #keyworkers don’t get time to sunbathe or party in the middle of the week or night and don’t want to see #SecondWave of #COVID19 #coronavirus ☀️🏖🏝🎧🎹🎤🍺🍾🍹🦠🥴🤢🤒😷🥵☠️⚰️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @LBC They should stop their benefits or furloughed as working people were to busy working not sunbathing in the middle of the week and I bet the majority of them were out clapping for #NHS and key workers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelenMagi @bbcquestiontime @TheoPaphitis Thought that get you going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenMagi @bbcquestiontime @TheoPaphitis And the reason the job market is small is because of migrants coming here and willing to work for nothing thank god for #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jingus2002 @bbcquestiontime @TheoPaphitis You don’t need to go to uni to get a good paid job and if you show any employer that your willing to do what training needs to be done and good time keeping and not going sick you will succeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime Yeah once the summer has finished and the sunbathers will have started a #SecondWave #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #Covid19UK 🏖🥵😡🤯🤢🤮🤮😷🤒☠️💉🦠⚰️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime @GMB @SkyNews @LBC @bbcquestiontime #SocialDistancing Most of them #COVIDIDIOTS are most probably being furloughed whilst key workers go to work putting their lives on the line stop paying their wages they wouldn’t be able to sunbathe on the beach 🏖 #COVID19 #coronavirus #bbcqt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @benshephard @GMB @toryboypierce @skystephen @LBC when you in the media are interviewing #COVIDIDIOTS you should ask them if they are being furloughed to see if we need to stop paying their wages for putting the country at risk from a #SecondWave of #COVID19 #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Most of them #COVIDIDIOTS are most probably being furloughed whilst key workers go to work putting their lives on the line stop paying their wages they wouldn’t be able to sunbathe on the beach 🏖<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott I know of a lot of people on benefits or furloughed being paid by the state that have not sent their kids back to school so they don’t get #COVID__19 yet key workers don’t have no choice but to send their kids back to school as they will lose their jobs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @AndrewCastle63 No one who voted leave and betrayed by @UKLabour would vote for someone who backed remain and would not vote someone in the London bubble. midlands and the north working class have been betrayed by labour .

<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid since moving to my house 2015 and with 2020’s council tax rise it’s up £500 in 5 years with a working family income of £21000 £1600 in council tax is a lot when someone on benefits on £23000 cap can get their council tax paid Help @BorisJohnson tax cuts gone already<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @IainDale @jeremycorbyn lost the #GE2019  because the real reason ex labour voters voted for @BorisJohnson is because @UKLabour has become the migrant party.

<|startoftext|>@frank_corr We have differences but it’s time for the country to come together to make a success of brexit we brexiteers wanted to reach out to the rest of the world instead we have become the laughing stock of the world if MPs had followed their constituents wishes we wouldn’t be fighting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frank_corr No I’ve got though it big corporations and the building trade have been hit by low wages years ago you could ask for a pay rise now you be told to fuck off and for those on benefits who voted #Brexit will have to do those jobs when pay goes up or get tough and stop their benefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frank_corr There’s winners and losers am sick and tried of shit immigration when  they come here and if they have kids ARE entitled to benefits straight away so controlled immigration will bring in the good ones not the ones that drain are public services and #brexit means invest in r young<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Could do with him helping #SASBOB he would get him a place to live in a flash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The panel on #bbcsp haven't a clue about what people outside the M25 voted on #brexit most people would have voted for a hard brexit to stop free movement of people as towns &amp; city's are becoming unrecognisably &amp; public services have crumbled #SASBOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan what's happening about the campaign for #homeless #SASBOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce This is why people voted #Brexit it shows that British people go to the back of the Que. for social housing I am ashamed to be British knowing that as a kid watching the SAS storm the embassy I was so proud of our army it's a joke give him a home now #SASBOB🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
