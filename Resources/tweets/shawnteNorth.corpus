<|startoftext|>@WineLoverSF @realTuckFrumper It just bogles the mind that these crazy people-Most of the #GOP who R always quoting #Jesus- #MarcoRubio   Worship a Lying, Divorced, Racist, Adulterer, with over 200,000+ deaths on his watch &amp; counting.

<|startoftext|>On the day #PresidentElectBiden won- I saw people in multiple cities, CHEERING their Postman or Woman  Celebrating in the streets as the #USPS trucks drove by because we knew under #Trump &amp; Dejoy we almost lost the mail service- 48 More days..... #TickTock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDinD It is like the #TwilightZone #Trump #Tweeting about mail fraud #DeJoy  "Up is Down and Down is Up"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN  I love the way #VicePresidentElectHarris  speaks about #PresidentElectJoe  She has so much pride &amp; admiration for him &amp; She’s  a beautiful strong woman  she wouldn’t say it if she didn’t mean it #Congratulations #AMERICAISBACK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purify_toast17 #hilarious ... And probably true  🤗 Maybe we should just tell #Cult45  that he is still the president in #January2021  &amp; give them a reality show complete with the Oval Office as a backdrop  They will probably never know the difference - Problem solved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far- And I am thinking only Good Thoughts  They make a really Good team. They seem Step in Step with a mutual respect. Both very strong in their respective roles as #PresidentElectJoe &amp; #VicePresidentElectHarris  #jaketapper  @notcapnamerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is Good.... She is very Good- Comedy Gold @JessicaHare18      Some of the best comedy has come for the haplessness and stupidity of this administration.   Terrible, however, to come at the cost of #American lives  49 Days...... #TickTock<|endoftext|>
