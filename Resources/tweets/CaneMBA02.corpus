<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @MichelleObama Lindsey I hope you picked up some leadership pointers from her. You are so far out of your league. Enjoy the last months you have in office. You along with Trump are out of your league. #ItIsWhatItIs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Agree! Speak to your other personalities as there seems to be some confusion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump He plead guilty to lying. He is not innocent, just had the fortune to have someone that does not care for the rule of law in the White House and weak prosecutors. Can’t wait until November and you are hauled out of there. You will be known as an impeached one term President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AC360 @kaitlancollins This had to be so that they could take him to the bunker and no press could report on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AC360 don’t you think the reason they asked reporters to leave the whitehouse during the unrest would be to shuttle Trump to the bunker without anyone seeing it? @ChrisCuomo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump As you walk down a ramp feebly and drink water with two hands. You are the weak one.<|endoftext|>

It’s about time that someone stands up for truth and to the lies you post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Let’s put a leader in charge that puts lives before politics and I would agree with you. Since we are stuck with you until November, we need to look to others for guidance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes it’s something that will never be associated with the Trump name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thankfully the 10th amendment gives him that independence. You could learn a lot about true leadership from him.Due to your lack of leadership he and the other states have had to fend for themselves. Step aside and let the adults take care of this crisis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the stories where the source is you on video? Is that Fake News as well? Do your job and stop with the bs tweets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump President Obama to you. Forever Impeached President Trump. There I fixed it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Braves @NickMarkakis I think you are being hypocritical. If sign stealing was not part of the game, the catcher would just scream out to the pitcher what he wanted him to throw next. It still takes an athlete to hit that pitch. @astros were just better at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Braves @NickMarkakis "There's right ways to do it and wrong ways to do it," Markakis said. With regards to the @astros What you are saying is it’s ok unless you do it the right way? Sign stealing has been part of baseball since it began. That why you change signs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mueller is a Republican!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Chris replying to knuckleheads like this gives them a platform, legitimacy and fire for the narrow minded individuals that would entertain his garbage. The best response is no response and let the tweet die on the vine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo This Is Barrs 2 year plan to counteract the negative effect the Mueller report will cause Trumps 2020 re-election bid. They will open this investigation that will last two years and will give them ammunition to mitigate the damages the Democrats will inflict.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump “They did not die in the hurricane Mr President”  But we lived. And we remember.  By: Eleazar David Melendez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  They died in fear and confusion after being forced to go off their regular medication. They died of heat stroke.  They died of diseases of antiquity, in a crisis of neglect unworthy the greatest, wealthiest and most powerful nation in human history.  They died..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump “They did not die in the hurricane Mr President”  They died, burning up with fever, of leptospirosis from being in touch with flood waters during the effort to save their neighbors....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump “They did not die in the hurricane Mr President”  They died in the dark and the heat of unsanitary ICU units, of burns or gunshot wounds received before the hurricane that they almost certainly would have survived otherwise....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump “They did not die in the hurricane Mr President”  They died in pain, at home, of kidney failure unable to access the dialysis clinic for weeks. They died, gasping for hours near the end, when the oxygen tank they needed to breathe gave out..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop talking and act. You can protect the dreamers today by rescinding the executive order you put in place eliminating the protection to #DACA that Democrats already had in place. Stop blaming the democrats, you created the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you care so much about #DACA resind your executive order which eliminated the protection the democrats put in place. You are the problem but can also be the solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo you can’t argue with an ignorant person, they bring you down to their level and beat you with experience. This is painful to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo OMG this is painful! @donlemon owes you a steak dinner for this. His son shoplifted in China, a communist country not in a US suburb. He could have spent 10 years in a Chinese prison. Trump intervened and got him released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The PR people are homeless, no food, no water and you want them to save themselves? You are no leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t know what real leadership is. PR people are suffering and you need them to give you a gold star to boost your ego!<|endoftext|>
