<|startoftext|>@thatonequeen prayer is a way of opening our hearts to God, not as a being living in an extra-dimensional heaven, but as the wellspring of creative energy within us and the universe.

<|startoftext|>@ladya how do you feel suing a person of color after you changed your name to not be related to the south is the right thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladya @nbc literally did nothing about the name we know what A stands for.. then suing this blues singer, shows so much that you changing means nothing, when she‚Äôs a person of color! #BLM change you name to quarter after 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marina_Sirtis This is a writer from Washington post acting as if.. this is not true and many believe it to be true.. look her up.. she‚Äôs actually sued trump and won. we are sharing lies, while others stir the shit up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Keep in mind, if Kanye runs for president, it will take votes from other candidates that could lead to the change in presidency. He is friends with trump. I think this if Kanye ends up on ballot in November, it‚Äôs to counter the votes for Joe Biden. #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dnlreynolds @VH1 @RuPaulsDragRace Then instead air celebrity drag race now, and really hype a super season with 20 plus contestants.. the contestants worked hard yes, although the victims don‚Äôt have to be reminded.

<|startoftext|>@dnlreynolds @VH1 @RuPaulsDragRace I read this and totally agree.. it would be the right thing to not even air this season for it will just glamorize him.

<|startoftext|>@AHSFX Now are we gonna see a comedy or horror? What is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHSFX I described this season to a friend who not a fan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a all campy comedy about summer camp with gore.‚Äù Made no sense, changing the ahs universe.. season one had a grit that now is not there.. Ryan Murphy needs to let ‚Äúscream queens‚Äù go! #Stopkillingkajagoogoo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ahszone @AHSFX No, that‚Äôs not American, that‚Äôs space. It‚Äôs not straight horror, it‚Äôs then sci-fi. Although the show has horror themes, it‚Äôs really a story driven about characters.. so tell the story of how an alien became a killer, if they talk, then it‚Äôs Star Trek.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WillAndGrace I feel like they should know who Chris Crocker is, especially jack should have said his name. I feel like jack would be the type to follow his fans only!! I hope they know other gay personalities are. I would hate to see these gay gay gay characters generalize Rupaul drag race!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@foxandfriends @DanCrenshawTX Do you feel Davidson comparing him to a sexy porn star.. or him saying ‚ÄúI know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.‚Äù was the big problem with joke? I‚Äôd say second part as he disregards his service. How do you feel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyDeVito @Lucydevito Girl throw her from the train already and vote... And not the Pineapple Express you seem to be riding now with a doll of your mom Norman! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucienGreaves I swear I seen this in todays episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucienGreaves Have you watched American horror story this season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahsleak I thought it was good, explained few things. Although I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs going to end when ahs keeps telling the back stories... I want some bigger action sequences. I want more magic. As far as that goes it was dull!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahsleak Hope Ryan Reynolds watches tonight! It sounds like he gets around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VancityReynolds you should watch #ahs tonight! Seems like the devil has you busy In that universe or Ryan Murphy has a huge crush.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MissLeslieG Happy Birthday üéÅüéâüéàüéÇ! You are awesome queen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamwhudson @MissLeslieG @AHSFX I agree, her power even suggest this theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glutensupreme @ahsleak I read even if they watch on fx+ it is still being counted in ratings. The true issue is many are watching a live stream on net and that‚Äôs not counting. really it‚Äôs easy to find a link to watch it hours before the airing on tv.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahsleak renewed for two more seasons! I feel Ryan‚Äôs team knows that 10 seasons is it! think about this season 8 is going back to the beginning for Michaels story. It is really sort of them tying up the loose ends and closer on certain characters. To end it after the next two seasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHSFX Still deserves its own spinoff @MrRPMurphy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#IfIWonABillionDollars first get a financial advisor. This is worth when most people who win go broke. few major projects in mind to help people.

<|startoftext|>@AnimatorRobyn @ajaqueen As far as a person actions on television/media, it‚Äôs not real. Especially with a show that gets viewers through drama. I lived in LA for years and the one thing I knew were true is you can‚Äôt judge a person by what you see.. many nice people on tv were ass holes in real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnimatorRobyn @ajaqueen I see why saying, that was editing of the show. We can all be bitches that makes better tv. me and many other people to this day reference that  verse! It‚Äôs iconic.  If you start that verse in front of any drag race fan they can finish that verse. May judge it yes, they know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnimatorRobyn @ajaqueen Honestly that verse is iconic it need not be replaced.. she made clear we love her baby why she made it there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRPMurphy @MsSarahPaulson You got to get Jessica Lange back for next season as a lead! I would also love to see Naomi grossman in a major role!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naomiwgrossman You are always amazing! I loved this character! I want next season you get a bigger role, or even lead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsKathyBates @AHSApocalypse_ @MsSarahPaulson So are you!! Ms mead!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrRPMurphy @ahsleak She did a great job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe in world peace not a world in pieces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheConnersABC I‚Äôm surprised at the number of people who can‚Äôt spell her name right that want a boycott!! They must be super fans! Roseanne is how it‚Äôs spelled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealroseanne I‚Äôm glad you still with us girl! its awesome y‚Äôall love her! I do too! Really the boycott should come to the holllywood machine that makes contracts a bitch to get out of! Thinking the reason the show still exists. Roseanne herself want to save cast and crew jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatonequeen Yes it was fried yesterday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nicholasryderx1 My first thought is I‚Äôm a cowboy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerryYielding @washingtonpost 10.5 million in ratings.. they didn‚Äôt do bad! I‚Äôm just saying maybe you‚Äôre wasting your time hating.. when you could just watch old episodes of Roseanne and be loving her. They could also bring her back! Thats what I want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealroseanne No your not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephGrisham45 @Tip I‚Äôd like to see TI strip! Yas queen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRPMurphy what was the big thing that happened in episode 5 apocalypse girl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCNetwork @nbc @FOXTV @cw what about a tv show that takes different shows and crosses them over into a mash up? I‚Äôd love to see what the conners would be like living in the murder house during the apocalypse, as the last man standing knocks, ask if they seen supergirl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisvirtel Then season 2 aunt Jackie will move to murder house and find them all apart of the apocalypse. As she is now the supreme. That will have to battle mark for he‚Äôs now a warlock that could be the new supreme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheConnersABC The acting was really good! writing was good. I‚Äôm glad to see this family growing in front of us. taking Roseanne out made other characters storylines stronger. We can now see their stories. I love Roseanne, people make mistakes. I just want to see all work for the good of all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahscocaine @ahsleak Really, that was already known they were going to murder house. I guess going back to the house was something they never done. I expected a gag worthy moment like the twist in Roanoke. I wasn‚Äôt gaged with out surprise. I thought it was male supreme. You sure or opinion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THR It‚Äôs gonna be the hardest thing to let her go. It‚Äôs her show, even you say Roseanne‚Äôs neighbor. Not the conners! I think the writers didn‚Äôt need to kill her off. Just put her in prison for shop lifting at the self check!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stickn2dabasics Being a loner takes healing when your looking at people in a negative way.

<|startoftext|>@ShadyAHS Ryan knows 2 hype for ratings. I knew the whole season was the story of the apocalypse.

<|startoftext|>@ahsleak I wish Ryan would do a coven spin off. Everyone wants those characters back. I just know the story is about the apocalypse not just the cross over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr you should stop doing drag, become a real clown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbianSosa Exactly, We will get a little moment with queenie then she‚Äôll die again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbianSosa People expect those characters in every episode. Its not their story. Those characters really going to show up in bits and pieces. Ryan Murphy for years spoke of cross over in certain seasons and it would be a small moment like a bread crumb. I expect that same thing this season<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Annamaejoannexo @ahsleak Throat truth about time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Annamaejoannexo @ahsleak Great idea although kit walker is from asylum this would mean with it being in the past 1950s or 1960s their kids would be older if not middle age.

<|startoftext|>@nicholasryderx1 You nasty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahsleak Since these characters are under wraps.. who thinks this is Flora from Roanoke grown up.. then the boy is from a past show too.. I just can‚Äôt figure who yet? It would make sense this is flora.  https://t.co/olhVXBJFVQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahsleak My theory: The boy and girl in the trailer, are the new Adam and Eve. The snake in the closet. Which means this seasons about lust!  https://t.co/7oxNJCenWi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nimayniba @LisaCroft @billboard This video is not available. Even if it‚Äôs a demo, the company would have altered it.

<|startoftext|>@stickn2dabasics why you deleted that tweet? I think good head comes in all shapes and sexes..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaCroft @billboard The vocal sounds different. Do you have facts that they did not have some else sing or just you believe because your a huge fan of michael? That‚Äôs just my opinion. So peace girl! Now when I say facts I mean you have first hand knowledge and not something you read in an article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My my if Michael Jackson sang that shit! Although maybe now Tupac and him can do a duet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billboard He‚Äôs not sang certain songs in years! Hello ‚ÄúHollywood tonight‚Äù and others! The voice is different! the same happened with Tupac after his death! I never been fooled! They are using the brand name.. it‚Äôs also reputation to admit the truth!<|endoftext|>
