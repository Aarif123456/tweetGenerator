<|startoftext|>#BB21 is in the books. I still wish #BB21Nicole would have won, but kudos to #BB21Jackson for steamrolling the game.

<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Was starting to change my mind about him at one point, but taking Cliff's Hail Mary game move personally and stupidly putting it in his GBM, shows how much of a spoiled, entitled child he is.

<|startoftext|>@Bhytes1 That you brought this gag-worthy stunt outfit with you, in case you needed to pull yourself out of the hole, shows the master planning of a champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Son_of_Gods Compassion would make me lie to provide them with comfort. Because what I personally believe doesn‚Äôt matter in that instance, and a dying man doesn‚Äôt need truth. He needs comfort and compassion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MPPresent @thatonequeen It seems like these promoters have been screwing the talent for years. SMH   Some of you guys have been touring long enough to know how it all works.

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff He was singing his ass off, that‚Äôs for sure.... but the R members had no interest in hearing anything he said.

<|startoftext|>The actual @RuPaulsDragRace Hall of Fame is cute, but kind of moot, since their are SO many #DragRace queens who are world famous &amp; a great representation of the franchise.

<|startoftext|>Just wait until this precedent-setting declaration comes back to haunt u. No no, not 45.

<|startoftext|>It always tickles me when white people on TV use old slang created by POC, years after it has actually gone out of style, and they have no idea how corny they sound.

<|startoftext|>@ManInTheHoody Unfortunately, there is no answer to this, because those who feel innately entitled will never allow themselves to empathize with the oppressed. Doing so would lessen their perceived power and negate their xenophobic views.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you have never been victimized, consider yourself fortunate. If you are a survivor of sexual assault, I believe you. If you have assaulted someone, whether or not they reported it, there is a special place in hell for you. #WhyIDidntReport  #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>know that it took everything in her, or him, to even verbally express the horrors that they endured. Have some compassion for god's sake.  #whyIdidntreport #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It happens far more often than you think, and whether or not you believe it, it has happened to someone you know.  So, before you cavalierly dismiss someone's claim, and assume that "if it was really that bad they would have reported it immediately", #WhyIDidntReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>out of shame, and because they know that the reality is they will not be believed, and that more than likely, nothing will happen to their abuser. Because we live in a society where assault victims must be lying, and their assailants get a pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when they are just trying to fall asleep. It is the reason many people abuse alcohol, drugs and other substances.  Being violated is not something you just get over.  So many women, and men, and kids, don't report their assault right away (or sometimes ever) out of fear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexual assault is not a joke. No matter how long it has been, victims of sexual abuse and assault mentally relive their trauma for the rest of their lives, in unwanted flashes of memory when they least expect it, when memories are triggered by current events, and sometimes...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ICTVBigBrother Well, App#1 Sam went to Kaitlyn who failed at her chance to return.... App#2 Baleigh went to jury with it in her pocket..... App#3 Tyler had 8 weeks to use his and never needed to..... so, yeah, I‚Äôd say flop is a good word. The only thing they were useful for is causing paranoia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates @bigbrothernet @agrodner22 please tell us there is a jury battle back! #bb20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhySharksMatter @melanietbaum Well,  I‚Äôm 49 today so........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting I don‚Äôt know who will actually win, but I do know that Fessy and his jealousy (JC with the assist) royally screwed his side this week. They could have taken control of the game by convincing JC and Sam to vote with them to make a big move... Sadly, their side is just clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting I‚Äôm thinking JC somehow gets Tyler out and someone else from L6 ends up winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoyGeorge How do artists somehow become gods in our eyes? I‚Äôm sure to the artists it‚Äôs probably pretty weird at first, when just yesterday you were a guy making music, but today you are a world wide superstar. I wonder what that feels like, although I would not like to find out first-hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels You looked stunning in your reunion gown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamsterwatch When will Kaycee realize she is at the bottom of the L6 totem pole? I guess when they send her to jury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StudSlayer lol  https://t.co/2mGWnakESP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, for the jury buy back, Baleigh, Rockstar and Scottie compete against whoever goes out next. If it‚Äôs a physical/wall comp, my money is on Scottie to return. #bb20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#80smusic immediately transports me to my youth. Our music was so eclectic and inclusive.

<|startoftext|>@pboyerjr7041 lol I‚Äôm trying to hold on to this last little bit of hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misticati4 Agreed! If Scottie goes home this week I hope that‚Äôs exactly what happens lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bagehot99 If he doesn‚Äôt use it, he goes home with it in his pocket, just like Baleigh did. üòâ  It‚Äôs possible..... not probable, but possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five bucks says #BB20fessy goes to jury next week. #BB20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs hope Scottie wins POV, Tyler feels so safe that he doesn‚Äôt use the Power App, and Haleigh talks enough sense into Fessy that he back-doors Tyler. üôèüèΩ  I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask for, but if Scottie goes home on this HOH, I‚Äôm switching to rooting for Level 6. #BB20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap! Can this alliance be any dumber? Fessy just openly targeted one of the two people in the house that are actually on his side... At this point #Level6 just needs to do nothing and let the #Hive eliminate themselves. #BB20  https://t.co/l1QIfvEFH5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JOSHMBB19 No you‚Äôre not. Stop that. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock True, Tyler could definitely out talk Sam at F2. But, Paul thought he could too. I guess we shall see! (Damn, I love this game)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock I‚Äôm not sure about that, E.... Sam‚Äôs social game is still good, and the jury may not be not so kind to a Level 6 finalist, considering they suck at jury management. Tyler would fair better than Angela or Brett, but not by much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing #bb20kaycee is not realizing is that she is below #BB20Angela on the #Level6 totem pole. I guess she will know when Angela turns on her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DayDaVonne_ Thank you, @DayDaVonne_ for your first hand experience. It‚Äôs very telling that, rather than simply accept what you are saying, some folks feel the need to try to negate your truth (and make themselves feel better) by ‚Äúwhite-splaining‚Äù. Sometimes we need to just shut up &amp; listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace No complaints!  https://t.co/7IB3CDjCvF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoseOnFX Sad that getting the one thing she always wanted ended up being what put her in this position.... but, hopefully Elektra will adjust to her life as a ‚Äúfull woman‚Äù, as she put it, and come to realize that she has always been so. A vagina does not define you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels   https://t.co/2bJbhBhEGJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels The funniest part of this show is that cast members talk a lot of mess... to a camera... that is recording them... knowing that the person they are trashing, spilling tea, or lying about, will easily be able to watch the show when it airs and know the truth. #RHOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels I believe that you, @GizelleBryant and @RobynDixonRHOP had a genuine bonding moment in the suite talking about being the wives of famous husbands. Aside from that, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è things seemed kind of messy all around on that trip. But I guess production likes / encourages the drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricMcCormack @BaskinRobbins My faves were Peanut Butter&amp; Chocolate, or Jamocha Almond Fudge! Ooooh and remember when they had Pink Bubblegum?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock So far......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels Well, I only watch Potomac, so I have no idea who those other women are; therefore this poll is irrelevant. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting Sad, because I think the house/feeds were more interesting (a little drama never hurt nobody) with him in it. Let‚Äôs hope someone else‚Äôs personality comes to the forefront quickly or this season may be a snooze fest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock And she self evicted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Apparently she was trying to say that Jess said something racist about Alex. She got called out for it. Big fight. She was in DR for 3 hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock It happened last night on the feeds. They talked about it on #BBAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, if this kid tells us one more time that he has a big heart..... üôÑ #BB19 #BBJosh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Completely agree! On Day 1 u put ur fate in the hands of strangers who want u to lose? At least Cam wanted to fight. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Understood...that was kind of weird, but as far as I'm concerned, he can identify however he wants, as long as he pays well :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching last night's #Scandal I'm and in tears. Wow @shondarhimes ... you touched on everything in this episode. Bravo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrockmotivates &amp; @rockrockman got it right. Sometimes it's healthier to love certain people from afar. #thickerthanwater<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Too many news sources out there for any single news person to be held to the standard of a Walter Cronkite. #BrianWilliams @NBCNightlyNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public trust in news anchors is antiquated. #BrianWilliams @NBCNightlyNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it's just me, but I could not care less about #BrianWilliams fudging his story in an attempt to boost his own ego. It's irrelevant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmmittSmith22 I agree. One yd line... Marshawn Lynch... and a time out? The game was theirs to win. OC should have called a run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even my team..... Didn't have any money on the game.... Still salty as hell at the coaching staff of the #Seattle Seahawks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They should've kept ##bbjoey and gotten rid if Vic or Jocasta... @JoeyVanPelt1 would have made better  TV and #BB16 Live Feeds IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night's #BB16 eviction was epic for @Derrick_L13 !!!! He made a HUGE move and got no blood on his hands. THAT'S how you play BigBrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick ok now tell me who's going to win :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick You called it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a #BB16 Drinking Game: Take a shot every time someone says "under the bus" "100%" "got your back" or "Bro" on #BBLF #BBLiveFeeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB16 Fans: What's your definition of a FLOATER? One who lays low &amp; talks no game, or one who always votes with who ever is in power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie .....Or Victoria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh ......Devin? The House has spoken! #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!!! #BBFrankie #BBDerrick and #BBDonny Team America!! #BBLF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB16 Rule #1: make sure you create a character/story line to remain relevant. Camera time = notariety = increased chances of winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie The only person Devin has a crush on is Devin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BB DRINKING GAME: Every time #BBDevin mentions his daughter, everyone has to take a shot! (Live Feeders will be drunk in 10 minutes) @BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bblf Hayden is the Heavy Metal Louse!! Hysterical!! #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren I literally just busted out laughing at this tweet!! (it's funny 'cuz it's true....) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG.... Devin is an HOH? Dammit Cody!!!! And they thought LAST week was bad???? smdh #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #BBAD and Donny just pulled a @TheBiancaDelRio ..."They're just giving you more time to pack...and I'll help you." #BB16 @RuPaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskRayceen Ok. Happy Birthday to your mom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @AskRayceen Are you coming to the cookout this Saturday afternoon? Check your FB invites for the details. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interview tomorrow. After 8 yrs in this job I'd really love to transition from contractor to Fed! #fingerscrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie I had no idea who Ariana Grande was until #BB16. LOL #oldpeopleproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 2-night premier and the double HOH twist could mean a 2nd set of house guests that we haven't seen yet. Vets maybe?? Hmmmm....  #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesssss!!! #BB16 starts tonight!  Question... has anyone actually SEEN the "Air Room"? Hmmmmm.... #ExpectTheUnexpected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @NewEdition on @theviewtv and I am getting my LIFE!!!!  #relivingmyyouth #TheOriginalBoyBand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cesarmillan Our Old English Bulldog  Rahlo is sending a shout out to #juniormillan *WOOF*  http://t.co/FGbkHbEZ3S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RANDOM: I will be so glad when the phrase "Turn Up" goes out of style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Binge-watched Season 1 of @OITNB and I have to say, I'm loving it. Can't wait to start Season 2! Who is your favorite character?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Exactly. Hopefully it won't make for a snooze-fest. But, I remain hopeful! Looking for Paola to start some shit. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick seems like CBS swung the pendulum alllll the way to the other side this year. lol  Well, maybe 1 of them has a hidden mean streak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half way thru the interviews and so far I am LOVING this #BB16 cast! Looks like the producers did a good job. @CBSBigBrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellevisage Yessssss! I can totally identify! Female on the outside, Drag Queen on the inside, hunty! *snap*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking there is more to this 2 HOH twist than we think... at least I hope there is. HOH = (Survivor) Team Leader? #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren because some people are Alphas and feel the need to lead, even if there is danger involved? Or, maybe just bragging rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveMondoTrasho An island<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody else think the #BB16 house looks uncomfortable and kinda dangerous? Glad they limit the alcohol in there. lol @BigBrotherTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So mad I'm in the office today &amp;can't see @TheTalk_CBS  4the #BB16 twist announcement. Guess I'll keep watching Twitter &amp; @JokersBBUpdates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm liking the look and theme of the new #BB16 house!   Let's hope the new house guests will be likable too.   http://t.co/BdnNbyJWzQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB16 @CBSBigBrother Julie's dishing the T on @TheTalk_CBS   http://t.co/wWoJ38VRFU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BB15 So, voting "With The House" all season got rid of everyone who was interesting / entertaining and left us to watch these 5? #GTFOHWTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice for the next #BigBrother Cast: Don't just vote w/The House all the time. Go into the house w/ a set of balls... and USE THEM. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DVR'd #Survivor Blood VS. Water pre-show last night. This should be a season full of "I can NOT believe you would do that to me!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to @RuPaulsDragRace #TheLostSeason #YBW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BB15 was rigged, @CBS would never have taken out their top ratings makers (El, Am and Aa) and left these schlubs in. #SNOOZEVILLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CLEARLY the rumors about Productions rigging the game were not true, unless it's rigged for McCrae to win, then marry Amanda? LOL #BB15<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Perfect weather this morning. Cool &amp; sunny, just how I like it. :)<|endoftext|>
