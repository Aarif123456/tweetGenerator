<|startoftext|>@Arret45 @AngrierWHStaff Not even sure it’s about votes anymore. Maybe just ego, saving face, or (more likely) profiting off of the pandemic.

<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler That was my first thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff It's difficult to believe someone who consistently lies, schemes, and spins things to their own advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff Angry - any chance this is a stunt to make him a seem more human (i.e. "pray for the president's speedy recovery") and keep him from having to debate Biden again?

<|startoftext|>@Divinadecampo @THEVIVIENNEUK @Divinadecampo you were my #1 pick from the beginning, but I was so thrilled with that top 3, I would’ve been happy with any one of you winning. So, I too am happy for @THEVIVIENNEUK -she truly won me over during the last few weeks. Can’t wait to catch your US tour! #DragRaceUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Condragulations @THEVIVIENNEUK !!!! 💋👸🏼  Great job @ChipShopBird and @Divinadecampo ...Love you all to pieces! 🇬🇧❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 #DragRaceUK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DragRaceUK Episode 7: I called it!! my top three queens are THE TOP 3! @Divinadecampo absolutely smashed the makeover challenge! Brilliant! @ChipShopBird that lip synch was SO captivating! @THEVIVIENNEUK your look was so beautiful and I love how you doted over your mom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wkamaubell @CMPunk @LivingColour One of my all time favorite songs. And the first one I posted on my Facebook page when this whole shitstorm of an administration began. There is no other explanation for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wendys Number 6: spicy chicken sandwich combo, with cheese fries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NyleDiMarco @JSJdarling To me it sounds like the slow, rhythmic heartbeat of the Earth......but slower, kind of like how deep breathing feels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherylHoleQueen @bathedinpink @BluHydrangea_ @Divinadecampo I love this cast. Cattiness is cute for the camera, but the real tea is each of them loves the others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fox5DCAllison That was 20+ yrs ago.... I was working a dead end job and clubbing almost every night. This young man right here is destined for big things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So um, @katya_zamo, what is Contact all about and why do you like it so much? I’m going to see if it’s on Netflix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was so happy to see @katya_zamo giving @Divinadecampo advice on #DragRaceUK love these queens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve never been to England, but after watching so much #DragRaceUK I’m starting to sound British in my head. And apparently I think in several accents.  🇬🇧🇺🇸  @Divinadecampo @ChipShopBird @THEVIVIENNEUK @rupaul @michellevisage @dragraceukbbc  https://t.co/3oqx9ACR0U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DragRaceUK Episode 6: my 3 faves are in the top 4! Still in love with DDC. Baga is right, @Divinadecampo is the whole package. @THEVIVIENNEUK made me cry. I just want to hug her. @ChipShopBird is not a drag queen... she is a full on comedian who happens to dress like your nan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacHayes3 Wait, what in the...... oh, their last name is “Black” and they .....think they are being funny, or ironic, or......?    😐smmfh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ava @TheAcademy Hmmmm, so what happens if Great Britain, or Australia submit a film for Best Int’l Feature? 🤔 Those are international films... clearly they would be in English.....Are they also excluded? (I doubt it)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dog_feelings Yep!  https://t.co/MD88i6MLeR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funavocadofacts @radtoria The responses to this tweet have me rolling! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrSturg That was painful to read. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopeyesChicken Attempted to try this sandwich at our local @PopeyesChicken in Waldorf, MD. The line was wrapped around the building.... I kept right on driving, right down the street to @Wendys and got my regular, the spicy chicken sandwich with #CheeseFries :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei That there are no mistakes. If you accidentally put a plop of paint where you didn't plan too, turn it into a happy little tree! (works for life too)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just learned who @MNEK is via #DragRaceUK (I’m old, and American, forgive me. lol).... and his entire personality is magnetic. I am a fan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld He’s obsessed with dogs, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Tell him not to hold his breath on that one lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DragRaceUK I hope there is a makeover challenge and that @ChipShopBird names her drag daughter #CuppaTea so we can call her Cuppa for short. I mean, what’s more British than a Bagga Chips and a Cuppa Tea?  🍟 🍵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DragRaceUK Episode 5: These damn emotional queens have me crying every fucking episode! 💯😭 My top 3 are still in it to win it! @THEVIVIENNEUK you slayed that lip synch! @ChipShopBird  fantastic, all of it! @Divinadecampo &lt;———my winner.

<|startoftext|>@BridgeStateU @thebiologistisn  https://t.co/BQSubhWUmL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s totally ok to remove negativity from your life. Even if that negativity is family, friend, pastor or partner. Your well-being is more important than their hurt feelings.   It’s also ok to still love them.... from afar. #WordsOfWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_Grundie @LogoTV Just downloaded the app and watched Ep. 4! Thanks again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m fascinated with 🏉 #rugby. I have no idea what’s happening, but the players are built like tanks and they full-on tackle each other with no padding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEVIVIENNEUK On behalf of America, thank you for this. We truly needed that laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Episode 4: Most of my initial picks are still here and doing well! @THEVIVIENNEUK brilliant 45 @ChipShopBird great Maggie as well @Divinadecampo that soft heart may be your undoing. I hope you took your own advice love, and slayed the fuck out of the rest of the competition 💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizzo @ArianaGrande Done. 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could listen to the #DragRaceUK contestants speak for days...

<|startoftext|>@elizabethdawn @RuPaulsDragRace @RuPaul Sure you can....It’s on @LogoTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there another place to watch #DragRaceUK besides @LogoTV in the US? Clearly we are at least one episode behind what’s airing on the other side of the pond,  because I am seeing unintentional spoiler tweets posted by the contestants. They just aired Ep.3 tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Episode 2... @Divinadecampo baby, you are a star! #DragRaceUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Episode 2..... @ChipShopBird is fucking hilarious! Well deserved win. #muchbetta #DragRaceUK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BB21 is in the books. I still wish #BB21Nicole would have won, but kudos to #BB21Jackson for steamrolling the game.

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff I won't hold my breath. They have done ZERO up to this point, with all of the ammunition in the world. Why would now be any different? I think all of them (Ds and Rs) are just waiting it out til the election. Let's hope he doesn't start WWIII before then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Was starting to change my mind about him at one point, but taking Cliff's Hail Mary game move personally and stupidly putting it in his GBM, shows how much of a spoiled, entitled child he is. He clearly has no clue what jury management is. I hope he gets "Pauled" at finale. #BB21<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As much as I cannot stand Jackson, he is playing the f*ck out of #BB21. That move he pulled on Tommy was   true ruthless Big Brother all day long.   I am definitely #TeamNicole but if anyone but Holly wins, they deserve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenArnoldMD @TLC @ReallyBillKlein Just got a chance to watch the latest episode of @TLCLittleCouple (yes, I record it). Zoey was so great in her recital!!! And Will is such a supportive big brother. Happy Anniversary to you and @ReallyBillKlein  ...I love this family. &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick The only backdoor 🚪 she’s getting is by Jackson 🍉 in the HOH shower....🚿💦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdoreDelano Two words: Otter Box<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB21LiveFeeds Happy that she’s (hopefully) going...... but annoyed that Snackson will benefit from her leaving on his HOH, since she is 1) out of his hair and 2) is a sure vote for him in jury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coco_fresh @The_Duck_Pond Somebody roll the clip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinMcCarthyTV I saw #ITChapterTwo on Saturday and I completely agree with your review. 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astronaia That opening scene, and the brutal scenes with Bev were extremely difficult to watch. I know Stephen King uses realistic situations to invoke fear in the audience, but yeah.... it was rough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Jackson or Holly wins HOH tonight, you can write Jackson the check because the game is basically over.   Also,  I can’t stand another week of them screwing in the HOH room. Gross.🤮  #bb21<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bigbroaccess #SendIt  SAM... because before he left, he planted the seeds that ultimately became the demise of Gr8ful/Unde9able/SixShooters.... up until that point they were steamrolling the game.

<|startoftext|>HGs who have little knowledge of the game always seem to wish for a luxury comp........ when was the last time BB actually HAD a luxury comp? I remember the house filled with balloons one year and some of them winning prizes/money, but since then? #bb21<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funniest part about #BB21Jackson's plan to reveal #BB21Jack's big (fake) secret, about #BB21Christie being Jack's ex, is that #BB21Tommy will be the one person who can confirm that it's a lie... and he won't be able to without blowing up his &amp; Christie's games. 🤣 #BB21Livefeeds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio How does one take stunning world class drag illusion and make it all look like a bunch of bad #MugShots? And, more importantly, why are they ranking RuGirls? Why is that even a thing? Come on @NYMag .....you have to do better than this. #DragRace @RuPaulsDragRace<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SJI2783 @GOP Crack is whack lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Ironic that, 3/4 of the way thru the administration, you are just now celebrating ONLY the 1 millionth hat, when there are hundreds of millions of voters. That actually gives me hope that our entire country hasn’t gone completely insane.... only a million of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chumpy59386582 @desmond_amazing @OffendMyEyes @getmermaidmagic @manicpanicnyc So, you don’t know the difference between drag queens and strippers?

<|startoftext|>@RaganFox @RuPaulsDragRace @RuPaul I couldn’t agree more. The past two weeks have me questioning my loyalty to @RuPaulsDragRace ....I don’t even know if @RuPaul is in charge anymore, or if production is running everything from the control room now that it’s on VH-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon I turned 50 this year and have been going to school part-time for 5 years now. Just a year and a half more and I will finally have completed my undergraduate degree, after dropping out of college when I was 21. Do it!It’s never too late. #TheTASSELisWorthTheHASSLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done with finals. Spring semester is in the books.  Three As and a B. Not too shabby for an old broad! lol  #adultcollegestudent #theTASSELisWorthTheHASSLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OddlyYvie I love your drag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeDawsonPT Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is the elimination order (or maybe just the final 4) pre-determined at the beginning of the season? Because that's what it is starting to feel like... it's obviously not based on the current challenge or lip synch. IJS @RuPaul @RuPaulsDragRace #DragRace #thatwassomebullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NinaWest Once again.... that elimination was some bullshit. Both your lip synch and your runway look was better than Silky's this week. Love you, @NinaWest. I'm glad you represented our community so beautifully. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@price1000000 @thomasqjones @AP I agree. In certain circumstances death is the only just punishment- And the sooner the better. The only caveat, for me, is that they make 100% sure they got the right POS. Too many men exonerated by DNA technology that was not available when they were wrongly convicted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasqjones @AP So, he sat on death row for 20 years, reminded every day of the last evil, hateful thing he did while he was free.... and then they killed him?   Yep. I’m good with that.  I just wish they had dragged his ass behind a truck until he was dead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It always tickles me when white people on TV use old slang created by POC, years after it has actually gone out of style, and they have no idea how corny they sound.

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff Welcome to the White House. Cold nuggets to the left, warm salads to the right. We brought out the good silver trays and gold candelabras because you guys are the greatest, just like me. You know I am the most loved president in history. Believe me. Nobody is more loved than me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@passantino Quick! Light the 18th century candelabras! My nuggets are getting cold!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watched #ThreeIdenticalStrangers on Amazon Prime..... I am flabbergasted, but at the same time somehow not surprised that this took place. It is tragic that each of these people in the “study” had to endure this unfathomable manipulation of their personal freedom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BoyGeorge Care to adopt a 49 yr old long time fan from America? I’m an excellent cook! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff If the GOP is really sick of 45, why don’t they just cut him off at the knees and partner with Nancy &amp; Chuck to override any veto of their bill to pass the budget? That would surely cause a meltdown... maybe even a resignation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff The Q cuckoos and some ex secret service agent guy on YouTube say that Indiv 1 and Meuller are really working TOGETHER to take down the cabal/deep state. 😐 My question is, does I-1 actually believe this (and how big of a tin foil hat did he need to buy into it)?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff This is neither a lockout, nor a strike. There is no worker/management dispute.

<|startoftext|>If you have never been victimized, consider yourself fortunate. If you are a survivor of sexual assault, I believe you. If you have assaulted someone, whether or not they reported it, there is a special place in hell for you. #WhyIDidntReport  #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>know that it took everything in her, or him, to even verbally express the horrors that they endured. Have some compassion for god's sake.  #whyIdidntreport #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It happens far more often than you think, and whether or not you believe it, it has happened to someone you know.  So, before you cavalierly dismiss someone's claim, and assume that "if it was really that bad they would have reported it immediately", #WhyIDidntReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>out of shame, and because they know that the reality is they will not be believed, and that more than likely, nothing will happen to their abuser. Because we live in a society where assault victims must be lying, and their assailants get a pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when they are just trying to fall asleep. It is the reason many people abuse alcohol, drugs and other substances.  Being violated is not something you just get over.  So many women, and men, and kids, don't report their assault right away (or sometimes ever) out of fear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexual assault is not a joke. No matter how long it has been, victims of sexual abuse and assault mentally relive their trauma for the rest of their lives, in unwanted flashes of memory when they least expect it, when memories are triggered by current events, and sometimes...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Casetopia @BBGossip He will cut her if he has the chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like Kaycee might pull a Cody and stay true to her F2 deal with Tyler (Derrick), because she is a team player and a woman of her word.... but Tyler would be ruthless and cut her in a heartbeat, because he knows he beats JC in F2. #BB20 ..I hope she is ruthless. #TeamKaycee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Casetopia @BBGossip If they are smart they will. They both easily win over JC. Winning against each other is more of a toss up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhySharksMatter @melanietbaum Well,  I’m 49 today so........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting I don’t know who will actually win, but I do know that Fessy and his jealousy (JC with the assist) royally screwed his side this week. They could have taken control of the game by convincing JC and Sam to vote with them to make a big move... Sadly, their side is just clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting I’m thinking JC somehow gets Tyler out and someone else from L6 ends up winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoyGeorge How do artists somehow become gods in our eyes? I’m sure to the artists it’s probably pretty weird at first, when just yesterday you were a guy making music, but today you are a world wide superstar. I wonder what that feels like, although I would not like to find out first-hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels You looked stunning in your reunion gown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamsterwatch When will Kaycee realize she is at the bottom of the L6 totem pole? I guess when they send her to jury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StudSlayer lol  https://t.co/2mGWnakESP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, for the jury buy back, Baleigh, Rockstar and Scottie compete against whoever goes out next. If it’s a physical/wall comp, my money is on Scottie to return. #bb20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#80smusic immediately transports me to my youth. Our music was so eclectic and inclusive.

<|startoftext|>@misticati4 Agreed! If Scottie goes home this week I hope that’s exactly what happens lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bagehot99 If he doesn’t use it, he goes home with it in his pocket, just like Baleigh did. 😉  It’s possible..... not probable, but possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five bucks says #BB20fessy goes to jury next week. #BB20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s hope Scottie wins POV, Tyler feels so safe that he doesn’t use the Power App, and Haleigh talks enough sense into Fessy that he back-doors Tyler. 🙏🏽  I know it’s a lot to ask for, but if Scottie goes home on this HOH, I’m switching to rooting for Level 6. #BB20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap! Can this alliance be any dumber? Fessy just openly targeted one of the two people in the house that are actually on his side... At this point #Level6 just needs to do nothing and let the #Hive eliminate themselves. #BB20  https://t.co/l1QIfvEFH5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JOSHMBB19 No you’re not. Stop that. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock True, Tyler could definitely out talk Sam at F2. But, Paul thought he could too. I guess we shall see! (Damn, I love this game)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock I’m not sure about that, E.... Sam’s social game is still good, and the jury may not be not so kind to a Level 6 finalist, considering they suck at jury management. Tyler would fair better than Angela or Brett, but not by much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing #bb20kaycee is not realizing is that she is below #BB20Angela on the #Level6 totem pole. I guess she will know when Angela turns on her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love to root for the underdog but Rockstar just..... 😳 I can’t even..... nah, she needs to go. #bb20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my new favorite shows on @AnimalPlanet is #thezoo .... love seeing behind the scenes at the Bronx Zoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if I ever had one of these back in the 90s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monetxchange I generally don't tip on carry-out orders, but after reading these comments I will start.   This also makes me wonder if the server who brings the order out to the @UberEats driver (who is getting tipped by the customer) gets anything? If not, that should change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realvegas4sure Ummm...you guy do know that this entire show is all filmed on a CBS soundstage and not in an actual house, right? They just build sets adjacent to the HOH room for these extra comps. Same place the AppStore was.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldsDad 7-11...... I made it as far as the orientation training, where they told us what to do WHEN (not if) the store was robbed at gunpoint...... I never went back. I’ve had a whole new respect for 7-11 clerks ever since.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhySharksMatter @NOAAFisheries Poor thing. They are such beautiful animals. I have an opportunity to swim with whale sharks at Isla Mujeres in Mexico. It seems like an amazing once in a lifetime experience......but not if it could somehow harm the whale sharks. Could our presence potentially harm them?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DayDaVonne_ Thank you, @DayDaVonne_ for your first hand experience. It’s very telling that, rather than simply accept what you are saying, some folks feel the need to try to negate your truth (and make themselves feel better) by “white-splaining”. Sometimes we need to just shut up &amp; listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace No complaints!  https://t.co/7IB3CDjCvF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoseOnFX Sad that getting the one thing she always wanted ended up being what put her in this position.... but, hopefully Elektra will adjust to her life as a “full woman”, as she put it, and come to realize that she has always been so. A vagina does not define you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels   https://t.co/2bJbhBhEGJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels The funniest part of this show is that cast members talk a lot of mess... to a camera... that is recording them... knowing that the person they are trashing, spilling tea, or lying about, will easily be able to watch the show when it airs and know the truth. #RHOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels I believe that you, @GizelleBryant and @RobynDixonRHOP had a genuine bonding moment in the suite talking about being the wives of famous husbands. Aside from that, 🤷‍♀️ things seemed kind of messy all around on that trip. But I guess production likes / encourages the drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricMcCormack @BaskinRobbins My faves were Peanut Butter&amp; Chocolate, or Jamocha Almond Fudge! Ooooh and remember when they had Pink Bubblegum?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock So far......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished bingeing @13ReasonsWhy on @netflix .....sadly, this is the world that kids live in today.

<|startoftext|>@iammrssamuels Well, I only watch Potomac, so I have no idea who those other women are; therefore this poll is irrelevant. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting Sad, because I think the house/feeds were more interesting (a little drama never hurt nobody) with him in it. Let’s hope someone else’s personality comes to the forefront quickly or this season may be a snooze fest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KameronMichaels @michellevisage Ok, Is it weird for a lesbian to discover she has a crush on @KameronMichaels both in and out of drag? 😬 Asking for a friend..... #thisbitchismakingmerethinkmyentireexistance lol  https://t.co/GlFEa7Fiv9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsjackdempsey @aquariaofficial Wow! That’s talent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again I have to give a shout out to SMECO. Their response time is off the charts. They are my heroes! @somdelectric<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LANADELSLAYYY_ Damn, I was rooting for him since he is 🏳️‍🌈 family, but I’m done. I don’t do body shakers.... Shoot, I would pay big money for a body like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KameronMichaels I felt such a connection to you this season. Funny, since I liked the loud over-the-top queens in prior seasons. I think it's because I get you. I immediately loved this look... that zipper!!! #Genius  Introvert / Ambivert.... c'est moi. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasha_velour @people @RuPaulsDragRace That finale look blew everything else out of the water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexisLives Yep! I avoided all social media until I watched the finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pissed that my autocorrect still doesn’t recognize and auto populate “Condragulations” #dragrace @RuPaulsDragRace @RuPaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KameronMichaels Thank you for never giving up @KameronMichaels ... Every challenge. Every look. Every lip synch. You were a goddamn inspiration. 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monetxchange @aquariaofficial You deserve it, and so much more. 💚🛁 💛 #soakitup CONDRAGULATIONS!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KameronMichaels No, honey, you SLAYED it! 👸🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Condragulations @monetxchange ! ❤️ @RuPaulsDragRace #DragRaceFinale #MissCongeniality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Oh right.... yeah she can definitely go, but I have a feeling she won’t<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanGheesling Kaycee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock He’s making a “Swaggy’s Blog” to document his uprising and domination. (Kinda sounds like Kirk’s “Captains Log” 🤔...maybe he’s a Trekkie?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulieChen #Kaycee will be a beast once she can see what the comp is.... JC is a great personality and will be DR gold...... Baileigh and Swaggy C will have that brother/sis bond and the sibling rivalry too. Scottie may just outgame them all if he makes it to jury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, Kaycee.  A punishment already!! #BB20Premiere<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobertsMariana @thatonequeen Bob didn’t say...... ugh, never mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren It was clear that none of the girls, except Eureka, made any real connection with @KameronMichaels .... but I don’t think that’s any reason to come for her the way they did. Then again, they were around her in person, we were not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waterislifeaz @1FranciscoUgart @michelleisawolf Great idea! I will do the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyRose Same! Almost 2 years since I quit. Congrats!<|endoftext|>

I know they’re not A-listers, but dammit, they are BB royalty none the less. #cheapisnotcute<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CSDommer @AnnIamthe @desmond_amazing @prideadventure If you want to be outraged about the abuse of children, may I direct your attention to the kids currently being ripped away from their parents &amp; caged in camps by our government?

<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace Sorry not sorry to those who are salty, but @KameronMichaels lip synch was just better than @miz_cracker this week. They are both fierce.

<|startoftext|>@monetxchange Well I never even heard of this Azalea chick until she came for Ru... even then I thought she was the white girl from Australia... turns out she’s just desperation wrapped in wack lyrics &amp; less than half as many followers as you, Monet.

<|startoftext|>@YoungSheldon @LanceB_Actor @MontanaJordan7 @OfficialRaeganR @IainLoveTheatre @anniepotts @zoejperry I didn’t want to like this show, because most spin-offs are not great, and I didn’t think it could live up to #TBBT ...but from the very 1st episode this ensemble cast had me hooked. Every character is fully realized and the chemistry between them is perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slang808 @C_GraceT Can I be the one to tell him to STFU.... and go watch “Dear White People”? Pleeeeeeeease!?!? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@farrahrized I have no clue what that actually means, but here’s a (((((hug))))<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErikLaage @martianmartin26 @IngrahamAngle Yes. Because the life of an actual living, breathing child is more important than a fetus. Your point?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itshellaclassic Album...all of them! But my all time favorite cut with Cube out front is Dopeman. That’s when I first fell in love with his voice. #NWA #StraightOuttaCompton #hellaclassic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow And Big Pharma for being the supplier?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoyGeorge @Eminem That was a WEAVE?!!?? *my 80s teenage mind blown*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Fans (or “Stans” ...whatever the hell that means) should always try to keep in mind: If you are talented enough to make it ON to @RuPaulsDragRace ...you’re already a winner, baby! #dragrace #lovedragqueens #HeyPorkchop 😘 @WorldOfWonder @RuPaul #over100queens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow Parody, or true? Scary that the mind even has to wonder.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desmond_amazing I see a little @courtneyact and a little @sasha_velour  in that lewk. 🤩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thegoodcarmah Name one show on tv that has been more diverse than @RuPaulsDragRace  ...........I’ll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfWonder @sutanamrull Shangela’s finale ball gown was breathtaking! Trixie’s Mae West was great. Kennedy’s rainbow gown was festive. Bebe’s animal print was a snooze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace #AllStars3 was basically the #BigBrother of drag. The eliminated jury members deliberated, asked questions and voted. People were gagged, happy and pissed about the winner. Although it would have been more fair if the rules were mentioned from the jump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trixiemattel Condragulations! #AllStars3Finale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsSHANGELA You twirled this entire competition and will always be an All ⭐️ to me. Love you, and all your All Star sisters!  @RuPaulsDragRace #AllStars3Finale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frankie_da_pug @ObsessedLife1 @tariqnasheed OJ was found innocent too.... and he clearly did it. Your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaos_4ever @DerrickL Both very possible. Charlie could also be his oldest son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerrickL Innocent men are sitting on death row, and sometimes guilty men go free.... Having said that, Derrick, your theory of a second person being present at the crime scene seems spot on according to his “hypothetical” account of the events. #whoisCharlie #didojconfess<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BMFluellen1 @J_AlPrufrock But apparently she made the right choice after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellevisage He played a helluva game! He deserved to win, but the jury was bitter, as some juries are. I’m just glad he got America’s Favorite Player along with his $50k. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OddreyM America just told Ross what that bitter jury refused to say. He played a nearly flawless game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! The first #cbbus is in the books! Congratulations to the winner!! (I won’t spoil it for my niece) #bbceleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleMBB18 Jury knows Ross outplayed all of them and they are bitter as hell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can auto tune please go out of style now? Ugh! If you’re a rapper, just give us good lyrics and a good beat. No need 2 try 2 sing. It’s been done 2 death.

<|startoftext|>@itshellaclassic @llcoolj @mclyte @IAMQUEENLATIFAH @EricBandRakim @BustaRhymes @DJFlash4eva How the hell did I forget to mention @IAmKRSOne ! #classic #icon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itshellaclassic I could also argue for the poets, like Pac, the storytellers, like Biggie &amp;Eminem, the whole gangsta genre starting w/NWA, and the conscious rappers, like Tribe, Nas, Arrested Development, of the early 90’s. Hip hop was evolving and coming into its own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itshellaclassic @PhilosoFee_Cliq I agree. Talent has no age. Look at 2 Chainz (40) and Jay Z (48). They seem to be doing 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itshellaclassic 1. 85 - 93 classic hip hop. The rest would not exist if it weren’t for the greats who started it all, like #RunDMC @llcoolj @mclyte #PublicEnemy #epmd @IAMQUEENLATIFAH #BeastieBoys @EricBandRakim #SaltnPepa #SugarHillGang @BustaRhymes @DJFlash4eva etc... omg, I need a mix tape!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChadMichaels1 @cheyennejackson @LogoTV @AHSFX @cher @RuPaulsDragRace @WorldOfWonder I swear, unless I see them side by side, I can never tell if I'm looking at @ChadMichaels1 👑 or @cher  🎤 #unclockable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No shade, but who is this Shia Leboef? I see his name on TMZ and the news all the time, but I have no idea what he's been in. TV or movies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deevilwoman @AndyHerren Agreed, but she's a gamer, and if evicting him means getting closer to the win, I think she would cut him like a 4th string quarterback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren I'm betting Cody wins the buy back &amp; teams up w/Paul. Then Alex evicts them both. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB19 Is Christmas back from surgery yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EARTHDOGBB Yep! That's exactly what I thought when he said that... Andy!!! Although he usually stayed longer than 2 seconds. lol @AndyHerren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeless_lon He did....and candidly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeless_lon Dom interviewed Cody on her After Dark show and asked him a rack of game questions &amp; he answered them! Mark, Matt and Paul were NOT amused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With last night's show, #BB19Dominique put a humongous target on her previously pristine back. 😫 SMH Come on woman! Play smart. #BB19 #BBAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB19KEVIN And he name dropped 2 Chainz! Coolest dad ever #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @charliehidestv !! There is nothing like a dame. ❤️💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kassting But, why frogs again? No sheep costumes available? That would be more appropriate this season. 😏  https://t.co/NVDjB4B3Le<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennifersnudes @pablopelican 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick #bored ...I liked him much better last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EARTHDOGBB @hamsterwatch Same. Far more opportunity for secret middle of the night meetings under the guise of "Damn, I need a cigarette."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@postlocal Just transfer at Jiffy Lube Plaza and get off at Doritos Square!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCLaszlo @postlocal True....Then the tourists will really be lost lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orilex8 @irishfan10839 @CBSBigBrother That was unnecessary. Just because we watch the feeds doesn't mean we should intentionally spoil it for those who don't. #bekind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCLaszlo @postlocal Exactly..... now, try finding your metro stop when it keeps changing names. lol #annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@postlocal SMH...and what happens to the "XYZ" station when they go out of business, or can no longer afford the naming rights?Terrible idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellevisage Less chance of getting eaten by a shark 🦈 in the pool 🏊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasha_velour Love this. So sweet 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock How the hell do they confuse Isaiah with Elijah??? #peoplearestupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteCastle burgers.... even the frozen ones, since that's all I can get in DC.... are still yummy after all these years. 😋 #dinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brendonvbb12 @survivorcbs Also, after she has the surgery and the meds wear off she may not stay anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brendonvbb12 @survivorcbs No, but I think if Megan hadn't left, they (production) wouldn't have needed to keep Christmas around and would have pulled her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun Fact: I enjoy reading other people's tweets far more than tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasha_velour Vanya / Eureka team challenge!!!!! #RPDR10 🐶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio Three tours back to back? Hardest working 🤡 in show business!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Be careful out there, fam.  https://t.co/EYwCE0BZk8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenArnoldMD So excited to see what your family has been up to. We've missed u. #TheLittleCouple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyBillKlein Yay!!!! We have missed watching your family! &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When 2 guys are shot and killed one block from your house... it's time to move. 😳#WTF #Suitland #Popeyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Yeah, guarded from the people and the press. 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BBKevin is playing the best under-the-radar game right now. He has already Won $25k - Lied about his vote - become Dad of the house. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day maybe I'll say something interesting enough to warrant a full 100 followers.  #tisbettertofollowthanbefollowed #couldntcareless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Well hopefully you will sail across that one with ease, but if you need another distraction, feel free to ping me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@survivorcbs @jeremy2collins @YungWoo23 @CandyCrushCBS YES!!! #TEAMJEREMYandWOO #Survivor #CandyCrushCBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock You off that bridge yet, E?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock How about I just realized that they RE-USED the frog costumes!  https://t.co/1d1bUf5rbv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Well make the most of it, whatever it is, and everything will work out fine. :) (that was my Dominique the Dominator Motivational Nugget)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock So what part of NY are u moving to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock One of the all-time best catch phrases to ever come out of BB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock You are gonna walk off that bus like....  https://t.co/7pxn73cJKu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Oooh... how about her exit interview with Julie?!?!?  (trying to distract u)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock No death! You'll be fine. Hey remember when Paulie came into the house like the Alpha Male...and then cut his hair to match Paul's? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Still better than being stuck in a house with a dozen crazy people. 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently on repeat in my head. @sasha_velour  @Sia #cellophane  https://t.co/yI4zC6Odfr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheaCoulee @atlsexyslim @BLACCHYNA 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Oh no! Well, come back to DC then, man. Hell it's almost just as expensive to live here anyway. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Good luck in the Big Apple!! (you don't seem too thrilled)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who claim there is no more racism in America have never had to worry about being on the receiving end of it. "Racism Is Everywhere"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw #BeautyAndTheBeast at @ShenandoahU and it was INCREDIBLE!!!! The singing, acting, music, sets and costumes were awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissCleoBB Clip in hair extensions....smh  At least Barbie's hair is actually coming out of her head. 😐#fakebeauty #whitegirlproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock That's the dream 😁 lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moregrits 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No goodbye messages? I smell a battle back! #bb19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they save #Christmas #bb19 #BBChristmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could Cody possibly be any more monotone and robotic? #BBCody #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Cody can't deal with strong women because he's a weak man. That's why he has Jessica swinging from his **** all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Pissed That's right. I couldn't remember exactly what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that's right. Still, horsing around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't Brigette's injury from some sort of piggy back ride incident too? #bb19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Christmas hasn't been cancelled this summer 😟  #BB19 #TeamChristmas #BBChristmas  https://t.co/xHZjtZT3Fy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The HGs are dropping like flies on #bb19 !! This will forever be known as the summer of #JilliansCurse  https://t.co/X33iTGE6o8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAmazingWaad Right?!! I would not want to be OTB with her....ever. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheaCoulee @CockheartLTD Love this song! #Cocky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmurph955 @iamderrickwash @TheJayRoy @bigbrothernet Cody could have nominated someone besides Paul, so there is no logical reason for production to tell the house anything. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_AshleyDarby Definitely plan on getting over to Oz for dinner soon. We want to try all the unusual Aussie dishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBADOrwell   https://t.co/2eP30SnLiM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSBigBrother None of the above<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock I think she will outsmart them all. #teamDominique<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannelOfficial #beauty #imsojealousrightnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler   https://t.co/CNduexv3of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSiriano @samirawiley @lomorelli They look stunning 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Not sure. Guess we will see all of this on the next episode that airs. In the mean time, check out  https://t.co/pdoDnlgsUJ for feeds info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock And she self evicted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Apparently she was trying to say that Jess said something racist about Alex. She got called out for it. Big fight. She was in DR for 3 hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock It happened last night on the feeds. They talked about it on #BBAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, if this kid tells us one more time that he has a big heart..... 🙄 #BB19 #BBJosh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbrothernet Exactly what I was thinking #BB19 #BBOTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerrickL Yeah, the douche-o-meter is off the charts in the BB house this summer #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OddreyM Right! Makes me wonder what's been going on in there. Can't wait for the #feeds #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cody....What a prick. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS.  https://t.co/mA4ZJFzTeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbySidibe Oooooh! I have been dying to try that!! I bet it was fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_timc Nail... Head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren Me too! That sucked... and it's worse because he's a Superfan. I hope they make him part of a #bbswap later. #Justice4Cameron #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Completely agree! On Day 1 u put ur fate in the hands of strangers who want u to lose? At least Cam wanted to fight. #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_AlPrufrock Understood...that was kind of weird, but as far as I'm concerned, he can identify however he wants, as long as he pays well :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ramses is adorable. I hope he rides under Paul's wing for a couple of weeks.... and then stabs him in the back. 😬 #BB19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cue the #Friendship !! #BB19Premiere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heeeeeeeere we go! #BB19Premiere  #SummerHasOfficiallyBegun @CBSBigBrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSBigBrother Did you see his interview with Jeff? I think the Millennials will tire of him quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RHOP needs a longer season. I feel like we didn't see enough storylines. @Andy @Bravotv Give us more Potomac Housewives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lex_Wardle @HuffPostPol @Rosie The Cheeto dust is spreading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to see a hybrid of @CBSBigBrother and @RuPaulsDragRace ...picture it! 14 Drag Queens in the BBHouse and a Lip Synch for Your HOH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilPoundcake1 I'm debating if I'm gonna buy the feeds or just do BBAD.... guess I will check the Hamsters out first 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilPoundcake1 Do you watch the live feeds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilPoundcake1 are you ready for #BB19 tomorrow?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffWeldon21 Only for someone with common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad move Houseguests. You probably just handed Shelli $500k. #BB17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #bbshelli this is real. It's really, really real. #BB17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieChen Shellie has to go. It might be the house's only shot to evict her. Clay will be useless without her and no threat to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!! Buh-bye Shelli!  https://t.co/OsDqGAltJ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problems of this world cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to #bb17james for having the cojones to make that move! #BB17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason_BB17 I hope Clelli self implodes..... and then self-evicts. We miss u Jason. #BB17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Clay wants to give up his game and 500k for Shelli so bad, let him self-evict when she goes. He can follow her right out the door #BB17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DayDaVonne_bb17 ..... THAT is the face of karma ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shelli bawling her eyes out = KARMA for Day, Audrey, Jeff and Jason #BBLF #BB17<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching @Oprah interview @paulocoelho - author of #TheAlchemist on #SuperSoulSunday. I love this book! The truth is always simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bb16Derrick is playing a brilliant game. Week12: NEVER on the block; 3 HOH wins; manipulated nearly every vote so far #TeamPuppetMaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP #JoanRivers ...funny funny lady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really enjoying the story line and how the inhabitants of #Everealm engage the Paladins in such a realistic way @TheQuestABC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio Okie dokie. Thanks for the lightning fast response. *muah*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio kewl... just want to make sure my order didn't get lost. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BB16 Nicole meltdown in 3....2.....1...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I think they will vote out Nicole.  Without Nicole, Hayden joins the Detenator's to get rid of Donny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caleb won't nominate any #Detenators. Nicole is going up as replacement... and will probably be Juror #2 #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donny is the POV KING! #BB16 #OldManBeatdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! CLOWN SHOE!!!! #BB16 @jeffschroeder23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Either Hayden, Donny or Nicole is going to jury in less than 5 minutes #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodDayDC I would want DCs own #MeshellNdegeOcello to perform in my living room #gooddaydc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They should've kept ##bbjoey and gotten rid if Vic or Jocasta... @JoeyVanPelt1 would have made better  TV and #BB16 Live Feeds IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night's #BB16 eviction was epic for @Derrick_L13 !!!! He made a HUGE move and got no blood on his hands. THAT'S how you play BigBrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick ok now tell me who's going to win :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick You called it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a #BB16 Drinking Game: Take a shot every time someone says "under the bus" "100%" "got your back" or "Bro" on #BBLF #BBLiveFeeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB16 Fans: What's your definition of a FLOATER? One who lays low &amp; talks no game, or one who always votes with who ever is in power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie .....Or Victoria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh ......Devin? The House has spoken! #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!!!! #BBFrankie #BBDerrick and #BBDonny Team America!! #BBLF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB16 Rule #1: make sure you create a character/story line to remain relevant. Camera time = notariety = increased chances of winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie The only person Devin has a crush on is Devin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BB DRINKING GAME: Every time #BBDevin mentions his daughter, everyone has to take a shot! (Live Feeders will be drunk in 10 minutes) @BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bblf Hayden is the Heavy Metal Louse!! Hysterical!! #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren I literally just busted out laughing at this tweet!! (it's funny 'cuz it's true....) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG.... Devin is an HOH? Dammit Cody!!!! And they thought LAST week was bad???? smdh #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #BBAD and Donny just pulled a @TheBiancaDelRio ..."They're just giving you more time to pack...and I'll help you." #BB16 @RuPaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskRayceen Ok. Happy Birthday to your mom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @AskRayceen Are you coming to the cookout this Saturday afternoon? Check your FB invites for the details. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interview tomorrow. After 8 yrs in this job I'd really love to transition from contractor to Fed! #fingerscrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMikeBoogie I had no idea who Ariana Grande was until #BB16. LOL #oldpeopleproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 2-night premier and the double HOH twist could mean a 2nd set of house guests that we haven't seen yet. Vets maybe?? Hmmmm....  #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesssss!!! #BB16 starts tonight!  Question... has anyone actually SEEN the "Air Room"? Hmmmmm.... #ExpectTheUnexpected<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RANDOM: I will be so glad when the phrase "Turn Up" goes out of style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Binge-watched Season 1 of @OITNB and I have to say, I'm loving it. Can't wait to start Season 2! Who is your favorite character?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Exactly. Hopefully it won't make for a snooze-fest. But, I remain hopeful! Looking for Paola to start some shit. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick seems like CBS swung the pendulum alllll the way to the other side this year. lol  Well, maybe 1 of them has a hidden mean streak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half way thru the interviews and so far I am LOVING this #BB16 cast! Looks like the producers did a good job. @CBSBigBrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellevisage Yessssss! I can totally identify! Female on the outside, Drag Queen on the inside, hunty! *snap*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking there is more to this 2 HOH twist than we think... at least I hope there is. HOH = (Survivor) Team Leader? #BB16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren because some people are Alphas and feel the need to lead, even if there is danger involved? Or, maybe just bragging rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveMondoTrasho An island<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody else think the #BB16 house looks uncomfortable and kinda dangerous? Glad they limit the alcohol in there. lol @BigBrotherTalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So mad I'm in the office today &amp;can't see @TheTalk_CBS  4the #BB16 twist announcement. Guess I'll keep watching Twitter &amp; @JokersBBUpdates<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Congress has supposedly reached a deal. Keeping my fingers crossed that we'll be back to work tomorrow #governmentshutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 8 of the #governmentshutdown... #Congress needs to get their sh!t together and let us go back to work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DC is really going thru it... #NavyYardShooting #governmentshutdown #shotsfired at U.S. Capitol..... pray for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If u are a Contractor &amp; just got laid off due to the #governmentshutdown - file for unemployment. It never hurts to be prepared just in case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they really did it.... thanks a lot, Tea Party.... *smdh*  #shutdown2013<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USCongress How about working on passing the FY14 Budget so we can go to work on Tuesday? #FilibusterFoolishness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SenatorCruz wasted Congress' time and taxpayer money talking about an issue that has already been passed into law. Sit down and STFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The overwhelming majority of Americans elected Mr. Obama based on #Obamacare... so what are the Republicans bitching about again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet if #Congress' paychecks were dependent upon the FY14 budget being passed we wouldn't be hearing all this #NoTime4FoolishFilibusters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren Congratulations!!!  Flawless game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary to think about going to your civilian government job and being gunned down senselessly #NavyYardShooting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BB15 So, voting "With The House" all season got rid of everyone who was interesting / entertaining and left us to watch these 5? #GTFOHWTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice for the next #BigBrother Cast: Don't just vote w/The House all the time. Go into the house w/ a set of balls... and USE THEM. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DVR'd #Survivor Blood VS. Water pre-show last night. This should be a season full of "I can NOT believe you would do that to me!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to @RuPaulsDragRace #TheLostSeason #YBW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BB15 was rigged, @CBS would never have taken out their top ratings makers (El, Am and Aa) and left these schlubs in. #SNOOZEVILLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CLEARLY the rumors about Productions rigging the game were not true, unless it's rigged for McCrae to win, then marry Amanda? LOL #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initially I was kinda psyched about The Exterminators, since they were the underdogs all season. But now... ummm not so much #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect weather this morning. Cool &amp; sunny, just how I like it. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope @EvelDick is the surprise guest next week, so he can tell them what a bunch of fkn FLOATERS they really are. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zingbot_4000 wins the $500k and becomes the youngest BB winner in history! (because he is the only one who deserves it now) #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DR is making GM pack Elissa's stuff so the guys won't rummage thru it and steal her panties #BB15 #bblivefeeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Voting for the ants or roaches to win the $500k. They deserve it more than these idiots. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelEReilly they are all disgusting and we all know it Rachel, believe that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing the boys trash Elissa like this is really disgusting. (and I say boys because MEN don't act like that) #bb15 #cbsbigbrother #BBLF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McCrae has NO idea that Andy is the RAT..... smdh.... bad move McCrae... you're next #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BB15 a hot ass mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GO ELISSA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Elissa doesn't win Veto, she's gone..... smdh #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelEReilly @ElissaReillyS My prediction: El &amp; McCrae go up 1st round / El wins POV / Crae goes 2 Jury w/Amanda / Elissa wins the 2nd HOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanGheesling Come on Dan.... you have to be watching the Live Feeds, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @SkylerCooper !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McCranda will be totally blindsided tomorrow. LOL #EXTERMINATORS #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GM is HOH #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Julie should have played the CLIPS for her instead of reading the quotes so there would be no "I don't remember saying that" BS.   #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that @SarahGilbert in the audience? #BB15 #HandPicked #Staged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanGheesling you were awesome tonight. Great job! I was wishing they would drop you into the game. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieChen so eloquently ripped her a new one.lol  Thank you Julie, for saying what we've all been screaming at the screen.. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to watch the bitches CRINGE when Elissa says "Who wants to see my HOH ROOOOOOM?" #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect week for Pandora's Box?? hmmmm.... #BB15 #TeamElissa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for the sore loser to go cry behind her trash can (where she belongs)... 'cause you still can't win isht! #BB15 #TeamElissa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know @RachelEReilly is bursting with pride right now!!! #TeamElissa #BB15<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#CBS WTF is up with the #LiveFeeds that we are paying you for? #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO @ Amanda's "oh shit" face when Julie announced that a Juror would be returning to the game #BB15 #PRICELESS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ANY of those Jurors are good for Elissa's game... and bad for Amanda's. Muahahahaha #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jurors greet shocked HGs.... lol  TOO FUN-TY!!  Now let's PLAY!! #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Helen! Win this comp! #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope this Jury Comp is QUESTIONS... because Helen is not dressed for anything physical. #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO GinaMarie... Julie did NOT wish you a happy birthday! lol #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SMDH @ yet another predictable vote. Revenge for Helen!!!!  #BB15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Helen keep telling Aaryn she IS @JanellePierzina ......PUHLEEZE!!!! #BB15 #livefeeds<|endoftext|>
