<|startoftext|>@martyducati851 @drunktastic @ActingTheGoms The people who have a second house as a pension are making provision for themselves so as not to be a burden.

<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses @MaryKenny4 I had to remind my mother about St Martin's love of animals yesterday when she was complaining about the squirrel digging up the garden. She wasn't swayed: "That fella's a Protestant!" she said, citing as evidence his disappearance whenever she's attending online Mass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a fan of these cheeky birds, I would disagree with the superstition: their cheerfulness at the Crucifixion is in keeping with Christian belief in the Resurrection. And their eating habits are no worse than those of humans @BirdWatchIE @SMDPSoc   https://t.co/AUmPVM7RIk via @rte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses @MaryKenny4 Another, funny story: my granny prayed to St Martin to command the mice to leave her house (we used to hear them at night). I was a child, found the mice cute, and prayed to St Martin to let them stay. Clearly he listened to my granny as they disappeared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses @MaryKenny4 Kindness to animals is a common theme in the stories of many saints, including St Martin de Porres, St Brigid of Kildare, St Anthony of Padua, St Kevin of Glendalough and St Francis of Assissi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses @MaryKenny4 He was a physician too. My dad saw him at his bedside in hospital just before an operation. He asked the nurses who the black priest was, and they said there was no black priest. Later he told my mother and she said it was St Martin, minding him because she was praying to him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 Great article. I always buy the St Martin magazine for my mother. Good to encourage the shops to display it.

<|startoftext|>(ie, deduction of €259.22 instead of usual €59.74). She only found out when she received her payslip. On top of this, she pays USC and private health insurance, and has no prospects of boosting her income as she is 80!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHumphreysFG why are widows whose husbands paid into private pensions being penalised? My mother's tax-free allowance has been cut by €4 a week approx, cancelling out the €5 boost in the State pension. The year's PAYE was also taken out in one go, leaving her with just €19.36<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @NTBreakfast But the same people who have been whingeing about wearing a mask don't want to take a vaccine either. And they have prolonged the lockdown with their petulant, selfish tantrums in the streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @NTBreakfast It will only protect the vulnerable if enough people get the vaccine. Because some people are too vulnerable to take it (eg, autoimmune). Like the flu vaccine, it works when the healthy take it to protect the very weak. That's why I get the flu vaccine every year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @Knightsatire @CMOIreland Thanks for that explanation. I am slightly reassured (though I still have concerns). I probably will take the vaccine as I take the flu vaccine to protect other people, and have had no ill effects so far.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Knightsatire I've changed my whole life to accommodate this. Thought the virus would die out like SARS before it reached our island. But the govt kept letting it in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Knightsatire If only we had closed the airports we could have avoided this, and waited for the majority of people on mainland Europe &amp; US to take the vaccine. Ireland has thrown away the advantage of being an island. It protected us from plagues for centuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knightsatire There are questions being asked, but not answered. Also, it is apparently a live vaccine (clue: it has to be kept in deep freeze) so the recipients can infect people around them. Multigenerational households will face a dilemma.

<|startoftext|>@MarkGermaine @NoelRock @ISAGCOVID19 We'd be very foolish to suspend all sceptism. I have 2 concerns about the vaccine: 1. Will it trigger autoimmune disease and 2. Does it contain a "live" virus (in which case the person taking it will apparently be a potential superspreader for two weeks after getting the jab).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM  I have 2 concerns about the Covid vaccine: If it is a "live" vaccine there's a high risk that a vaccinated person will be very infectious to people around them. Also, whether it's "live" or "inactive", could it trigger autoimmune disease in susceptible people?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mullb I think he has come back using a new profile. Same facetious, illogical arguments. Though you can't tell the difference between these anti-maskers: they are all working off the same script. Hours of listening to Gemma / Hermann / Dr Dolly late at night melts the mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 Unfortunately people mingle in the aisles and large families sit close together, creating their own little Covid cloud. The Covid doesn't know they are related. It doesn't obey orders either. Try telling it to float up into the vaults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mullb A typing error, or possibly a Freudian slip. But they can participate. Our local priests have even arranged to give Communion at the door, and the people can watch on their phones. Though no doubt some people will insist on sitting together in cars to share phones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pubs get a lot of flak, but supermarkets are unsafe too, especially for staff and their families (they might have vulnerable people at home). I went shopping today @dunnesstores Cornelscourt and the place was jammers. No social distancing whatsoever! Masks alone are insufficient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 No wonder the supermarkets are employing mostly young workers: they are less likely to show symptoms.  But they could be vectors.  Shopping online / click and collect is safer, but unfortunately not everyone can do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 Supermarkets are dangerous for the staff who are there all day, less so for the customers who are only popping in for a few minutes.  Also, there is no singing or chanting in supermarkets. The virus spreads further the harder you exhale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 Tell that to the virus. It doesn't want to go up into the vault. If there is no wind to blow it away, it will linger close to the people where it can spread. That's all it wants to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmerHigginsTD I have a slogan for a Covid ad: "Who is your weakest link?"  Show people in different settings: family, at work, etc, and Covid graphics in a mist around the vector.

<|startoftext|>@Welltakenfree Maybe not - but exposing these people to risk of dying from covid is as bad as murder. The same excuse could be used by any murderer.  Indeed, Dr Harold Shipman used that argument. It's the favourite excuse of murderers and scumbags everywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiveActionNews If they can guarantee that the research and sequencing wasn't taken from past studies using foetal cells, this is ethically sound.

<|startoftext|>I'd add just two comments to this fact-check: Quarantine refers to a fourteen-day period, and, while it is not exactly the same as self-isolation, it traditionally has meant exactly that (the alternative being enforced isolation).  https://t.co/OvdmzwjtSa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now @RTECountryWide is segueing a piece on rural isolation and bereavement with an item about succession (sending the clear message to "get your affairs in order"). Grossly insensitive and actually very cruel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gaslighting of elderly people on RTE is off the scale.  Everything they broadcast seems to be about their mental health.

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @diarmaidm Most ironically, the Democrats are the same people who've spent the past four years publicly claiming to have won "the popular vote" despite the fact that Trump didn't even campaign in the electoral area where Hillary is supposed to have beaten him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 Mary Robinson's comment is a bit rich, coming from a woman who collaborated in keeping a woman under house arrest (Sheikha Latifa).  Her gaslighting of that unfortunate woman was shocking. #freelatifa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @craniosurgeon @MailOnline I'll hazard a few guesses: 1. They wear them under their chin (very common in all of these countries); 2. they leave their noses uncovered even when they cover their mouths; 3. they take them off to speak; 4. they wear the same mask all day, every day; 5. they touch their masks..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @DavQuinn There were mass protests on the UK's streets, large groups gathered in towns and on beaches.  Maybe they didn't intend the spread the virus, but they certainly didn't try to stop it - and the British Government was apparently impotent.  "Lockdown UK" was nothing of the sort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @DavQuinn I wouldn't describe the UK's restrictions as "lockdown"; people were encouraged to exercise in parks etc. The Italians did a full lockdown but it was ineffective because big families live in small flats. The Australians, South Koreans etc did it properly (eg, forced quarantine).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Belstaffie No doubt his victims would like to do a Lorena Bobbit on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would explain why Italy is facing another lockdown. The awful thing is, it won't be enough because lots of people live in cramped accommodation.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC @GerryBridgett I made valid arguments, and you used a sexist term to try to minimise them. I can think of an equivalent for "hysterical" when applied to a male person, but I am too civilised to use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I 've just been accused of "hysteria" by an anti-lockdown campaigner who has been whining about public health measures all over social media for months. He even called the restrictions on large gatherings "religious discrimination". I could call him hysterical if he had a womb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC @GerryBridgett Sexism. Nice.  BTW, it is not "hysterical" to advocate common sense.  Rapids testing has worked in other countries, true enough - Australia, for example - but only when combined with proper tracing, quarantining, local lockdowns, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craniosurgeon @MaryKenny4 @MailOnline Well, the anti-maskers can't use "careless" as an excuse. They openly protested, loudly, en masse.  They have blood on their hands.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@craniosurgeon @MaryKenny4 @MailOnline The priest blessing the coffins and Andrea Boccelli singing in front of the Duomo were back in March / April.

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @DavQuinn Maybe the Swedish government meant well, but they trusted people too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @DavQuinn That would be fine if they weren't trusting people on other people's behalf.

<|startoftext|>@DFallamhain @IrexitFreedom Anyone who doesn't recognise that RTE is a propaganda tool is incapable of ever thinking independently.  Pointing it out on Twitter will not change their mind. BTW, they do allow "conservatives" onto panels, and on shows such as Liveline.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Caolanmcaree Donald Trump's decision to hold a press conference in a hardware store carpark with the same name as a posh hotel was a great way to show how clueless the Democrats' lapdogs are: they kept Tweeting "Trump held it in the WRONG FOUR SEASONS"  until the penny finally dropped. #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Junobereaved @john_mcguirk This kind of person comes out of the woodwork every time there's a tragedy in the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonnLeitrim @CMOIreland Actually, yes, you're right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodrigoTernevoy @RTEFairCity @RTEOne @faircityfans It won't feel so good for poor Cristiano; evil Will is going to gaslight you and turn your friends against you... But welcome back to our screens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markmgr @john_mcguirk Yes, and some of the fake condolences on RIP are adding to the cruelty.  They are gaslighting the poor woman. Her younger son and husband won't be resting in peace unless they repented shortly after their own bullets entered their heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devinecelt @CMOIreland Nothing magic about it: people weren't in work, at school or on public transport during the tail-end of flu season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk I haven't read Brenda's entire piece, but I am glad that she wrote it. The calculated murder of Mark O'Sullivan by his own brother and father, their unspeakable cruelty to his mother, their suicide, their arrogance, their sense of entitlement - this is what evil looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk I didn't want to comment on this story because it's a topic best left to a newspaper, with comments closed.  But I was shocked to see some of the "condolences" on  https://t.co/WxGJNNhx41, mentioning the two murderers as if they were mere victims. It smacks of gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justshowup4life I was in Dunnes today and they are still selling undies, PJs, homeware and booze - but not winter coats, jumpers, trousers or shoes... I can't imagine buying smart clothes online because the fit is so important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devinecelt @CMOIreland And we haven't entered flu season yet here in Ireland; it usually arrives after Christmas.  Worst months are January and February.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devinecelt @CMOIreland Thanks to the "lockdown", the flu couldn't spread as it usually does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keithd2988 They're probably looking after themselves better to avoid having to go to hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chook411 @CMOIreland Good point actually. Though I am a cynic and am more inclined to believe the infection figures are being "cooked" to  keep the schools open at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonnLeitrim @CMOIreland Yes, I take that point, but it doesn't explain the rise in hospital admissions in recent days while the case numbers were "falling".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfitz77 @CMOIreland I get that (and thanks for reminding me), but it doesn't explain the recent rise in hospital admissions and especially ICU admissions (though those too seem to have suddenly fallen today).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiddlerlegend68 It's like an episode of Father Ted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crystal Ski are turning the Covid travel fears to their advantage - offering special "Covid Insurance" for tourists who pick up the virus on a ski trip. It would be the ultimate irony if the feckless could benefit from private insurance at a time when the conscientious couldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Ireland's Covid case numbers are going down, why are the deaths going up? Are fewer people transmitting more viral load? Or is it to do with it finally reaching the older people?  Or (call me a cynic) are the figures being cooked to keep the schools open? @CMOIreland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Refreshing to find a politician who owns her mistakes @ReginaDo Understandable reaction, though murder-suicides have been a recurring real-life nightmare in Ireland for at least 13 years (I recall covering the Monageer tragedy etc as a journalist)   https://t.co/3CVE5USD2K<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nealerichmond The plethora of murder suicides in the last 13 years needs to be addressed, but not on social media. The problem is, no one trusts the legitimate media any more.

<|startoftext|>@RomanShortall I actually know of a murder-suicide that occurred after the family in question got into a debt with these moneylenders. They used to call to the house to collect their interest. The couple had very obvious learning disabilities and were dependent on social welfare &amp; charity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanniemissy And yet baby-trafficking is regarded as respectable now, and rebranded "surrogacy".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The only person making sense on #rtept tonight is Prof Tomas Ryan. We need proper leadership instead of dithering and rolling lockdowns.  We need contact tracing and closing borders as Australia has done with its internal borders. The only viable strategy, longterm, is Zero Covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see the Garda using their legitimate powers to stop a mob of thugs endangering the health of innocent people. Bet that felt better than manning the pointless roadblocks and annoying decent people @GardaTraffic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Desdoes @AgeAction @CMOIreland @SamuelMcConkey1 You certainly expressed a view that's widespread. That's why I wasn't sure whether it was a spoof or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's what #Lockdown2  means to some people: "The #Phoenixpark / #MattDamon is within my 5k", "How to alleviate boredom", "Missing the craic".  Here's what it means to others: "Protecting vulnerable family members / community in general", "Budgeting till next PUP day", "Worry".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presume this is a spoof account. Surely no one could admit to thinking like a psychopath (cyclopath?). Though I don't doubt this mentality is prevalent among people who think of #Lockdown2 as a big holiday. @AgeAction #COVID19 @CMOIreland @SamuelMcConkey1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we stop pretending the roadblocks and 5km limit are about stopping Covid and admit that they are to enforce the Green Agenda? And the chorus of cyclists calling for a ban on cars in Phoenix Park will deprive elderly people of the pleasure of visiting @DublinZoo @GardaTraffic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FCTwenteBenson Yes, sick of him already. He has become synonymous with middle-aged mums jogging up the crowded paths of Killiney Hill with their little vectors in tow, all trying to catch Matt Damon's droplets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic Also, kids forced to sit in cars with their parents for an hour on the way to school is not only frustrating for all concerned - if there is any virus in the car, this is the way to spread it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic Can't Drew Harris see that this is seriously damaging the social contract the people have with the gardai?  It's undoing all your good work. Going for a long drive and a short walk is less likely to spread the virus than walking around our neighbourhoods all day,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael71456902 @rteliveline Well, bore off and share your rants / poetry-abuse with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conankwrites @qualann One who works for fully insured publications / broadcasters, who are fully accountable if their journalists fail in their duty, and fully answerable. Not random, untrained vloggers stealing news gathered by real journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A tragedy unfolding while our Government supports the GAA Elite and "The Youth".  The anti-maskers must bear responsibility for this too. We are not even in flu season - God help our vulnerable elderly people and angels like this nurse. joe@liveline #liveline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The awful thing about this is not that the kids will get sick (they probably won't) but they will spread this virus into the community. Even if they stay away from their grandparents and other vulnerable people, the virus will use them as stepping stones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA_Gerrard71 @last_call12 @BalbrigganGent The awful thing is, he will get away with it. Nothing will happen to him except good things - at our expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qualann Inquests should be held in camera, with bona fides journalists in attendance subject to confidentiality. I get what this family are trying to say (that courts should be transparent and that the hospital is to blame for the teenager's death) but they need to prove their allegation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife It's not just the youth either. Last night I was standing in the chipper's and an elderly man walked in without a mask, wearing a smirk. He was the type of old person who thinks: "I'm close to death - I'll bring a few people with me".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @rteliveline Thanks, Mary. Knew I had seen the whole poem somewhere, a long time ago, and didn't want to Google in case I got false info (can't trust Google). It's often quoted out of context by people advocating for more physical social interaction. To me, it speaks of solidarity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daz1985 @FraserNelson Looks like it based on Fraser's Tweet, though I hope not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson @MaryKenny4 What is the pay and is the work paid by the hour or by the work done (preferable in my case)?  Is the research journalistic (eg, interviewing, newsgathering) or online browsing?  Sorry for the questions, but I have wasted time applying for jobs which turned out to be internships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, it looks as if we are having a Green pandemic, just as we had a Green budget. Greenthink is dangerous in a pandemic. The way to beat a pandemic is: private cars (with one person in each car), spacious homes, plastic bags (for used masks), antiseptic wipes, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't had a chance to check where this windbag got this quote, but I think it's a Biblical psalm, which makes his abuse of it sacrilegious. Anyway, it underlines the need to show solidarity with each other - not by being in a mindless herd but by staying apart. @rteliveline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No reasonable person can criticise the individual gardai for just following orders - but Drew Harris should have challenged the Govt / NPHET on the ban on travel within Ireland. It makes no sense - and will destroy public confidence in the gardai @GardaReview  #TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proper contact tracing and closing borders = the only way to break the chain of transmission.  Why not deploy all those gardai to the Border, airports and ferry ports instead of internal roads? And hire freelance contact tracers to knock on doors etc #TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some common sense - but will NPHET or the Government listen? @CMOIreland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Policing by consent only works if you don't alienate the majority of the people. The pointless roadblocks are destroying trust in the gardai #TonightVMTV whereas breaking up house-parties and locking up Covidiot anti-maskers would restore trust in them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@8_bit_relic @rteliveline @MichaelMartinTD Yes, it is criminal what is happening to people living with their abusers. All the world's problems come from forced contact with other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go again: "Mental health". What about the physical and financial health of people running small businesses, their staff and their customers? What about dole traders who depend on a good economy for clients? @rteliveline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the reason people are unable to social-distance is because they were socially conditioned, through the school system and promotion of sports culture, to be in a herd. @rteliveline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree 100 per cent with those women on @rteliveline re the restrictions hitting women, elderly people and the beauty industry the hardest. Why should they be sacrificed for the GAA "elite"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CowenBarry Excellent. Now can you get them to drop the pointless road blocks? Especially cruel on a small island where everyone has family and friends all over the place. Safer to drive 200 miles for a half-hour picnic in a garden than spend a whole day mingling with neighbours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CowenBarry Please ask them to explain the point of 5km / 100km / County roadblocks when the virus is not limited to one area within Ireland. Why not take the gardai off the motorways and send them to the Border, airport, etc?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Welltakenfree The people who don't want to get Covid are still going to their GPs as far as I know. Maybe they're just avoiding certain GPs who don't take Covid seriously? I have taken my mother to the GP, hospital and dentist several times in the past two weeks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ontheditch This half-baked "plan" will prolong the situation and do more harm to small businesses (though it will boost GDP as the multinationals &amp; vultures pick the spoils, and the cull of the elderly will save on pensions +free up housing stock for the precious Youth).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ontheditch I don't think Leo gives a fiddler's about self-employed people. He has a net income the average businessman can only dream of.

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn This reminds me of a comment a juvenile mugger made as he tried to justify injuring an old woman: "She's old anyway; she'll be dead soon". The woman was 96 and never left her house again after her ordeal. She deserved better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo's tantrum underlines the fact that he is an insecure, over-privileged waste of public money. His labelling of NPHET as "public servants" is missing the point: they are doctors first, civil servants second. Dr Tony reacted as a doctor does in an emergency. #tonyholohan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we need to take Covid19 seriously; not for ourselves, but to protect the vulnerable.  Even tucked away in nursing homes, they are not safe when this virus is spreading in the community.   https://t.co/CWBRmvNH2R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCorby21 @TedLeddy @SeanMeehan12 @LeoVaradkar They were intimidating shoppers on Grafton Street, and entering shops to yell at the staff.  A large crowd, yelling "Take off your mask" in a pandemic is definitely a public order offence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SCorby21 @TedLeddy @SeanMeehan12 @LeoVaradkar This is damaging the public perception of the gardai too. We need them to help us protect our elderly and vulnerable people. Instead they are being used as roadblock stewards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCorby21 @TedLeddy @SeanMeehan12 @LeoVaradkar Public Order Offence covers this situation. The gardai in the beat know this but are not getting leadership from their Commissioner. They deserve better than Drew Harris.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mjodwyer @rte It certainly does look like their fragile egos were bruised, and they reacted viscerally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjodwyer @rte The plan seems to be to clear out some of the deadwood (old &amp; sick - people who cost the HSE a lot of money) before locking down properly to save The Youth.  Why else would they keep the schools open?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanShortall The plan is to let Nature take its course. They don't give a fiddler's about the old and vulnerable. The county driving bans are to keep everyone in petrie dishes while they gather the data and just watch the old people die.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SCorby21 @TedLeddy @SeanMeehan12 @LeoVaradkar Also, the roadblocks are a waste of Garda resources.  There should be more gardai protecting people working in shops from aggressive anti-mask yobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrishe47509994 @TedLeddy @opheliabyrne Yes, Cullinane certainly comes across as a wet-finger-to-the-wind type. At a time when strong leadership is needed, this country's main political parties are full of dithering civil servant types.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stretchza @colettebrowne As @RBoydBarrett and @SamuelMcConkey1 pointed out, this lukewarm Level Three will only postpone and possibly prolong the economic misery as well as cost the lives of the elderly.

<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne This is a war - the last thing we need is dithering or delays of any kind when the virus is spreading rapidly.  We should have crushed this virus months ago.

<|startoftext|>@Desdoes @FergalMcGoldri2 @MichealMartinTD @MlMcNamaraTD @HSELive @LeoVaradkar @IrishTimes @Independent_ie We need to focus on asymptomatic vectors: Typhoid Marys. So the old people can be free to enjoy their lives. We can't lock them up. It would be a life sentence for them if this virus outlives them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inainmanathair @RTE_PrimeTime Re care homes: in Ireland, the intention was to protect the elderly, who could not go home because the virus was in the community. Unfortunately they picked it up in hospital. Re Sweden: based on their total lack of restrictions, yes, they culled the elderly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inainmanathair @RTE_PrimeTime I disagree strongly. I personally know an elderly lady from Sweden and she has not left her home since March. It is just not safe for her. Her friends are dying like flies. Luckily she is wealthy enough to use robotics to help her with daily tasks, rather than a human carer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sully42547164 @RTE_PrimeTime Yes. That was a mistake. But they would not have been safe at home either if community nurses / their own families were visiting, because the virus was spreading in the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer @RTE_PrimeTime People with serious underlying conditions have a right to expect to live freely too. Sweden told them to go to hell, basically. At least Ireland tried to stop the community transmission of the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sully42547164 @RTE_PrimeTime No. My mother and her friends are old age pensioners and they were treated very well. There were mistakes made in nursing homes, but they were only trying to protect the vulnerable people from the virus while it was spreading rampantly in the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @JoannaTeglund Sweden did it blatantly. Culling the elderly is an practice that dates from Sweden's pagan past. The UK and other countries made mistakes, but had good intentions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnsmclean @downgerd @MaryKenny4 Sweden culled all the elderly people who weren't able to protect themselves. The rest are prisoners (possibly for the remainder of their lives as the virus may outlive them). The asymptomatic psychos who want the elderly locked up "for their own protection" are, beneath contempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sully42547164 @RTE_PrimeTime Not true at all. My mother and her friends are very much alive, thanks to all the people who took great care to stop the virus spreading. The nursing home situation was mishandled and mistakes were made (eg, not closing down early enough) but it was hardly deliberate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to hear @SamuelMcConkey1 and (earlier this week) @alankellylabour sticking up for old people. We need to crush this virus so they can enjoy their remaining years - whether it's one year or 30. #ElderLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tvcritics The Cityjet boss looks like one of the people who really does need a doctor. Not the best person to be taking health advice from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweden sacrificed their most vulnerable. Their death rate has, dropped because the virus culled the weak in the first wave. Their  remaining elderly people are likely to be prisoners for life - for the few years they have left @RTE_PrimeTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In wartime, you don't tell the people to "live with the enemy"; you crush the enemy or at least stop the invasion. This virus came in because we didn't furlough the travel industry. We sacrificed everyone else. @RTE_PrimeTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mobyrne100 @pologlacain @MaryKenny4 If by "we" you mean the Government and HSE, then it would be very disingenuous not to accept that they made mistakes. And sufficient PPE was hard to acquire. To accuse them of deliberately culling the elderly is quite a serious allegation and makes you sound bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisWickNews Everyone who knows me would say I'm a free thinker, eccentric and shameless. My unwillingness to follow the herd, take orders or conform has cost me a lot. I wear a mask because I won't risk the lives of the vulnerable by letting the virus use my body as a stepping stone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mobyrne100 @pologlacain @MaryKenny4 All the people working in nursing homes that I know did their best. The gardai also did a lot for old people. Community groups were set up too. We did our best. (Obviously I'm not speaking for the "herd immunity" psychopaths who, thankfully, are in a minority in Ireland).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pologlacain @mobyrne100 @MaryKenny4 Thank God we are not all psychopaths. While a lot of our elderly people died through mismanagement of the nursing home situation, we did at least try to protect them. And we will still try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoannaTeglund @MaryKenny4 Yes, Sweden sacrificed their most vulnerable. Basically these people were given just two choices: death or lifelong imprisonment (bearing in mind they might not have many years left).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indepdubnrth Using your logic, we should all be nudists. @irishnaturist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Steroids. They are using them on patients to kill the symptoms, but they will no doubt have long-term effects on the heart and liver etc. Best not to get the virus at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer That's awful. She should complain to her union / her local TD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer I think we need to do all these things. The mask is only a tiny part of it and only works if everyone wears one.<|endoftext|>

We all may or may not be carrying the virus. Until we have reliable tests and vaccines, we have a duty to prevent the spread, to protect the vulnerable. 4.

They are talking about people who don't use masks properly; 2. I wear a masks to prevent the spread of my own viral particles to others (it's not not about me and my discomfort)...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some homeless people avoid official soup kitchens because they don't want to engage with offialdom. Whether they are right or wrong, that is their right.   https://t.co/JYyojLqKOB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PadraigPravda @DonnaElliott198 @RTE_PrimeTime @rtenews @MiriamOCal @RobinSwannMoH @DUPleader @naomi_long @columeastwood @moneillsf No point in explaining the purpose of masks to a person who had a rat as their profile pic.

<|startoftext|>@eobraonain @jonnieonion1 @misteil @gavreilly @Tupp_Ed Irony no longer a strong point even among my fellow Irish people, I see. Of course they can track us using receipts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@risteard69 I have had the flu jab for the past four years. Never had any problems with it. Got the Swine Flu five years ago. I would not want to pass that on to a vulnerable person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PutTheShpudsOn @DonnaElliott198 @RTE_PrimeTime @rtenews @MiriamOCal @RobinSwannMoH @DUPleader @naomi_long @columeastwood @moneillsf 1. Lockdown ended. 2. NPHET were concerned that people wouldn't know how to wear the masks correctly (and they were right, as you can see).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomanShortall Publicans and restauranteurs can retaliate - by re-naming everything on the menu "Fuckoff". Including drinks @MHealyRae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wesht_Lad @Lulihar99 @RTE_PrimeTime @rtenews @MiriamOCal Both have limited effectiveness. We should wear masks as an extra precaution if we're indoors and where people might walk too close to us. Also wash hands, open the windows, don't shout, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan He is already being paraphrased and misinterpreted. He didn't say throw caution to the wind. He didn't say don't wear masks. If we are to make it safe for old people to go out, we will need to protect them - by not letting the virus use us as stepping stones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lulihar99 @RTE_PrimeTime @rtenews @MiriamOCal In fairness, I don't think he meant throw caution to the wind. If we are to make the world safe for elderly people, we will need to all wear masks and keep six feet away from each other until the virus can't find a vector.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaElliott198 @RTE_PrimeTime @rtenews @MiriamOCal @RobinSwannMoH @DUPleader @naomi_long @columeastwood @moneillsf Unfortunately, the covidiots will ruin it for us all by refusing to wear masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllyouneedisC @RTE_PrimeTime @MiriamOCal We tend to assume people need safety above all else, but I personally know some severely disabled old people, in constant pain, who would rather live on their own than be minded 24-7 in a nursing home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC What Prof Collins said reminds me of something I've heard old people in nursing homes say (before they lost all hope of ever getting out): "I want to live on my own, I don't care if it's risky."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer Also of course it may mutate so it's always best to get the most up-to-date vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer The Swine Flu and (afaik) h1n1 vaccines are included in the seasonal flu vaccine. I have got this vaccine every year since I got the actual Swine Flu. Even though I'm probably immune, I may be a vector so I get the jab to protect people who are too weak for the vaccine / allergic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers Easy fix for this: publicans should re-name everything on the menu "Fuckoff". I would happily order a Fuckoff a week if I thought the Government would give me a discount for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redzer17798556 @MHealyRae @TonightVMTV I was in McDonald's earlier this week. Some of the people left their masks off in the queue. I would have walked out only I had waited so long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redzer17798556 @MHealyRae @TonightVMTV It makes sense to take the mask off for eating at a table but put it on in the queue and the loo where people might accidentally get too close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redzer17798556 @bobfoxer @MHealyRae @TonightVMTV Military terms sound wrong outside the military. Next we'll be calling those €25 restaurant meals "scran" or "scoff".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redzer17798556 @MHealyRae @TonightVMTV Wow, who would have guessed? Duh! It still sounds disgusting and conjures up vile images.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ine16840704 @Jimcorrsays She has no children - yet she is leading a group of natalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nedberb Tempted as I am to laugh, I find this very sad. Her cult members have invested so much time and emotional energy, they are in so deep, that they're willing to get criminal records to please her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses @Jimcorrsays Her group has all the characteristics of a cult, and she uses cult tactics (long monologues broadcast at night, constant drama, manipulation of vulnerable people, etc). Not all cult leaders are charismatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely the Dublin cases are more dangerous as Dublin is more densely populated? It's harder to avoid other people here. @laoneill111 @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who coined this disgusting term "wet pubs"? It's clearly intended to conjure up images of the Wuhan Wet Market. Also sounds unappealing in general. Why not call them "traditional pubs" or "real pubs"? @MHealyRae  @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NPHET trusts schoolkids and yet doesn't trust publicans @TonightVMTV @MHealyRae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConorThomas6 @colmoregan Exactly. I reckon they want us to associate the traditional Irish or English pub with the Wuhan wet market. It's intended to evoke disgust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogartyc64 @gavreilly I won't be availing of it. Rather stick with the takeaways - and give the delivery guy a cash tip.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aciquestion The really sad thing is, she is a cult leader and her pathetic little band of intellectually challenged followers spend hours every night listening to her rants (Brainwashing 101).

<|startoftext|>@jonnieonion1 @misteil @gavreilly @Tupp_Ed I stand corrected. Good to know they won't be tracking me if I enjoy a decadent meal in the Station House or K Club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACuppaCake_ie @NeilGerardFox @NatalieORegan1 @gavreilly People on low incomes have to spend everything they get, plus interest on the loans loans they have to take out from the Credit Union etc. This cynical scheme is aimed at getting money which would otherwise not be spent in the Irish economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misteil @gavreilly @Tupp_Ed It has a location tracker which I would be against on principle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Since my meals out tend to be a weekly takeaway for myself and the mother from the chipper's @€13-20 (or Chinese @€20 when I'm feeling posh), I can look forward to a refund of €200 max if I earn enough to pay tax this year - oh, wait, do I have to spend minimum €25 per Meal?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annecarr40 @NiallMcConnell5 @gerrywebster Well, not quite a flock, and most of these people are probably just curious onlookers or infiltrators, but the leadership is very typical of cults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annecarr40 @NiallMcConnell5 @gerrywebster I'm just trying to work out who is the leader in this little trinity: Gemma, John or Rita? I have noticed this set-up in cults: two main figureheads, one silent but omnipresent person, a few henchmen (that would be Niall here and Dee) and - to borrow a word - a flock of "sheeple"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanMcCarthy997 @baby_oranges @Berlinnaeus You seem to have confused me with someone else. I may have agreed with her on something she said in the past, or criticised her ex-colleagues for publicly diagnosing her with mental health problems - but I am not, and never have been, a "fan" of her (or anyone).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMacoscair Certainly that's part of it. They are such sly, slippery creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is indeed a paradoxical link between Conservative types and campaigns to cull the elderly.

<|startoftext|>@FrankMulqueen Who came up with this disgusting term "wet pubs"? It is clearly intended to conjure up images of the Wuhan "wet market". Traditional Irish pubs are the victims of a nasty smear campaign @rteliveline @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather than expose GPs, their staff and vulnerable patients to potential vectors in the waiting rooms, why not set up mobile testing units to go to schools? @paulreiddublin @rtenews @TodaywithClaire @NewstalkFM @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DammitMarty If you look at similar groups around Europe and the US, they all use the same phrases: "Wake up Sheeple", "the Awakening", "WWGIWGA" (Quanon motto) etc. And they all call masks "muzzles" or "nappies" (which of course they would be if worn by these nutters who are full of sh*te).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DammitMarty I'm curious about the role of John Waters and his wife in all of this. They show up at the demos, and he makes a speech, but are never there when the rough stuff is happening. Who is really driving this campaign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMacoscair Agree. And the people making excuses for her on grounds of mental illness are not her friends. A friend would never publicly brand you crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annecarr40 @NiallMcConnell5 @gerrywebster How did he collect her? He told me he was unable to drive because of his serious health condition which included partial paralysis  (when I interviewed him two years ago). Did the wife drive him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer This is why it would be better to wipe out Covid-19. If people just stayed away from each other until it has no vectors, it would die like TB. Pockets of it would appear but it would effectively be eradicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer I would be wary of an untested vaccine too. The flu vaccine is updated every year but seems to be safe for the majority, so I get it - to protect people who can't get it  and are very vulnerable. I got over Swine Flu with no help but others could die of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>School principal Colm O'Rourke makes a valid point re the futility of expecting boys to keep their masks clean. So why does NPHET trust schoolkids more than publicans? @ronan_glynn @HSELive @TonightVMTV @DIGI_Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Loyzer Also, no vaccine is 100 per cent protective. It wears off after a few months. People still need to get plenty of fresh air in the winter and keep their distance from potential vectors, wash hands, etc. I don't know your grandmother's situation but I am sorry to hear she died.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Loyzer Two of my neighbours (a mother and daughter) recently got from Covid.

<|startoftext|>@conormolloy @nealmcquaid @IrishTimes There are no statistics on the accidents undoubtedly caused by staring at the speedometer, jamming on the brakes as a speed van appears on the horizon or using a speed limiter which prevents the driver accelerating to take evasive action.

<|startoftext|>@didcotresident @MaryKenny4 Or indeed the #longcovid statistics if the healthy people who recovered get chronic conditions. My ex-neighbour, now in his 30s, has been paralysed since he got a virus the age of 8 or nine. I thought about it when I heard stories of young people who now have #longcovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Griffiths_Art @MaryKenny4 Not as blatantly as the Swedes. No doubt they will finish the cull this winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone believe that the Irish Govt is banning beef? Or that we can't buy fresh food in supermarkets such as @dunnesstores ? This is what that idiot #GemmaODoherty is telling her followers. No wonder she calls masks "face nappies"; if she wore one, it would be full of sh*t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanandanto Or indeed if asymptomatic kids pass Covid-19 on to grandparents. If the grannies have not been socialising with other people, there would be a good legal case against the school @LawSocIreland @lawsocgazette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer Get the flu vaccine every year. I have done so every year since I got the Swine Flu five years ago. I still worry that I may have passed it on before I got symptoms and quarantined myself. I was very sick for a week and would not wish it on a more vulnerable person l.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conormolloy @IrishTimes Looks like they want more speed-trap cash. The old reliable piggyback. Imagine driving Dublin to Cork at 80kph or even 100kph all the way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Hand us the popcorn. This is going to be fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer I quarantined myself when I got Swine flu. Didn't know it was so serious at the time, but knew I was coming down with something. Ever since, I have got the flu vaccine every year. I would be devastated if I thought I passed it on before my symptoms appeared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Griffiths_Art @MaryKenny4 True, but Sweden actively, openly culled their elderly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@didcotresident @MaryKenny4 I don't think it was a mistake. They are going to sneer as the other countries "catch up", while Sweden saves a fortune in pensions, disability benefits and public housing. Plenty of vacant homes there now, for the healthy young families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTriagain @p02462599 @MichaelKellyIC I also worked for the Irish and UK tabloids which are more widely read than the broadsheets, and can proudly say a tabloid journalist is a real journalist. Writing for broadsheets was akin to doing a school project. Tabloid reporting requires courage, tenacity and wits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p02462599 @MichaelKellyIC I worked for many other newspapers (including the Indo, Irish Times, Irish Press, Mail, Express, Sunday Business Post, etc - my CV is on LinkedIn and I am putting together an archive of my cuttings, most of which are on microfiche at the National Library).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael71456902 @DavQuinn True. But if we copy Sweden many more will die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@efg35663548 @PGriffinFC @MaryKenny4 Wow, the mask really slips when the wilfully ignorant and selfish use disgusting terms such as "face nappy" to harangue conscientious people. If course, a mask would be a "nappy" if worn by the foul-mouthed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn You are doing a great service to Twitter users like myself who need to do a "cull": instead of relying on key phrases  ("Wake up sheeple!" "Sweden got it right" "Professor Q+++") I just have to read the comments from your followers and block them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@efg35663548 @MaryKenny4 No, they did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loyzer If they tested positive they could spread it in the community. To anyone they come in contact with. And it could reach an old person or someone with cancer. That person could get very sick. They might even die. Is that simple enough for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyclopsdan @Jimcorrsays In fairness, she was probably 20 years younger in the second photo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Sweden has no more vulnerable people left to die. They all died on the First Wave. (I'm over-simplifying here because it's clear your followers really believe you).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davecoghlan @DavQuinn We'll know about a month after the country opens up fully (pubs, schools, public transport at full capacity, remote workers back in offices, air travel back to normal, no social distancing rules, no masks etc). We have been suppressing the spread of the virus since March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC If by "fearless" you mean harassing the ex-Garda commissioner's family at home, late at night, then I suppose you are right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC I've been a journalist for twice as long as Gemma has, and find it remarkable that her entire body of work amounts to three or four stories covered in much more detail by every journalist in the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mongank @nialloloughlin I did, when she first burst onto the Internet and was savaged by former colleagues. I actually do still pity her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyclopsdan @Jimcorrsays Is she really only 52? That beef diet is not working for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dunphyshane1 Now that she has enough footage from the Emerald Isle, she can move to the USA where she can continue to spin yarns about our country. She has even claimed that the Irish Government is trying to ban us from eating beef!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael71456902 @CeliaHolmanLee @SkyNews I'd like to see the @IrishRugby ladies' reaction if models replaced them on the Irish national rugby team. No doubt the models would be just as good at rugby as the rugby players are at modelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 All the most vulnerable people in Sweden died in the First Wave of Covid-19. In effect, the Swedish government culled the elderly and the sick. This is in keeping with an ancient Pagan tradition in that country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocultado @Simy_78 @gardainfo Maybe he did. She would certainly need one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why deprive the models of work? Times are hard enough, especially for those in precarious careers. Professional models should be used to advertise sports gear for both the male and female teams. #rugby #Ireland @CeliaHolmanLee  @SkyNews   https://t.co/nCw5jjyflp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoraLeslie @RMcGreevy1301 @AlcoholIreland @FergalBowers @rtenews @NewstalkFM @IrishTimes Our local publican kept morale up during the lockdown. He even set up an coffee-and-ice-cream kiosk and tables outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoraLeslie @RMcGreevy1301 @AlcoholIreland @FergalBowers @rtenews @NewstalkFM @IrishTimes Yes. A lot of publicans look after their customers, tell them when they've had enough to drink, even drive them home. Generally the small pubs are run by decent people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tigerlil2 @BTriagain @thejournal_ie Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wakeywakies @shanebyrne101 I don't answer loaded questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE This is barbaric. If I had children I would home-school them until this crisis is over (safe vaccine). They can catch up with friends on socially distanced play dates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simy_78 I still don't think it's right to publicly ascribe mental illness to anyone, as some of her ex-colleagues have done. She is a very unpleasant individual, and a bully, but I wouldn't stoop to her level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeywakies @shanebyrne101 Isn't that what Gemma and her followers do to people? Have you seen the footage of her harassing a man in his shop in Longford? Or her friend last week heckling a priest in Ballyhaunis? And the Croke Park incident?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoraLeslie @RMcGreevy1301 @AlcoholIreland @FergalBowers @rtenews @NewstalkFM @IrishTimes They would rather turn proud, independent publicans into welfare dependents than let them make their own money.

<|startoftext|>@EamonMelia It will take a lot of persuasion to stop Big Phil hitting slurry-spreader mode. He's already tried to blame poor Donie, the hotel and the Citizens' Information for his "mistake".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simy_78 I think she's clever (if arrogant - that's her Achilles Heel) . It's the fools around her I feel sorry for (even if they are unreconstructed racists and bigots). She plays on their fears, flatters them and uses them as unpaid drones while she makes a career for herself online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland (the people, not Govt) will forgive @vonderleyen if, faced with a choice between Fitzgerald&amp;Coveney, she gives both the thumbs down. The Commission can do without a forgetful former Justice Minister and a director of a company that imports desperate low-paid fruit-pickers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonMelia It's going to be fun watching the fallout. Unless Big Phil can somehow be persuaded to keep his gob shut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks #youngoffenders for all the laughs. Will miss you rascals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simy_78 @gardainfo Call me a cynic, but I think Gemma is a tool of some anarchist group, on a mission to destroy the Conservative movement in Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will force struggling employers to let go some part-timers in order to increase the wages of others, to qualify for the the subsidy. On the plus side: more work for social welfare staff sorting out complications. Guess who's paying them? @Paschald  https://t.co/R7itz79bcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simy_78 @gardainfo Those guards can personally sue her for defamation based on her vile allegations. They can charge her under the Road Traffic Act (those banners would be a massive distraction to motorists) as well as Public Order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simy_78 Yes. He was a paragon of patience and professionalism in the circumstances. Though the gardai need to protect themselves better against the droplets spewed out of the mouths of Covidiots. N95 masks or, at the very least, strong visors. @gardainfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife I totally agree with you, Tracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normally I wouldn't be interested in celebrity gossip, but this is a shocking case of human rights abuse. No one's family should have such power over them. Her wishes should be respected. #BritneySpears  https://t.co/GebJxmmg8y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeKenn41804424 Sweden at least were up-front about their mass-cull of the elderly and sick. They got the deaths done and dusted early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeKenn41804424 Call me cynical, but it looks like a State plan to cull the elderly, using  grandkids as vectors. The kids are unlikely to get symptoms but the grannies will die - saving the Exchequer the State pension, healthcare, Living Alone Allowance, etc, and freeing up the housing stock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for the myth that kids don't get #COVID19 ... Carlow-Kilkenny creche confirms two children have Covid-19  https://t.co/JwTJwAYtgq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to stand up for our publicans all over Ireland @CorkVFI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjodwyer Yes, open the pubs so people who want to drink and socialise in a safe atmosphere can do so. Publicans are generally very responsible. They don't deserve to lose their livelihoods like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard of an incident in a secondary school yesterday where teenage girls refused to wear masks and mocked the teacher. Very stressful for the teacher, other pupils and their parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So NPHET have no plan to crush or even control the Covid crisis. They will blame publicans, revellers at house parties, people in Laois / Kildare / Offaly and that old reliable stand-by, "misinformation". @ronan_glynn is looking like Comical Ali.  https://t.co/TbJ91247LM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have NPHET figured out why there are so many outbreaks at house parties? Here's a clue: the pubs are closed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulfieldj600 The problem is, just when you find a group you agree with on one matter, you discover they have abhorrent views on another matter. So you either compromise or remain independent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife I use these pile-ons as an opportunity to weed out trolls. I also use Twitter's keyword facility to block people who use certain words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife 30 very small children would carry the same viral load as 15 medium-sized adults (assuming their lungs are half the size). Add the teacher and you have the equivalent of 25 people in a classroom. For hours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife All schools are poorly ventilated when there are at least 30 in a classroom, narrow corridors etc. Unless, they deep-clean and fog the classrooms and corridors several times a day, the virus will linger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBrickovich I'm always amazed at the arrogance of these parasites. They basically beggared (and b*ggered) the nation. We are in perpetual in debt thanks to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers @rte They should focus their minds on the crass stupidity of opening schools at a time like this. Hundreds of children from different families in enclosed spaces, spreading aerosols all day, every day! This will make the meat factories outbreaks look like the Teddy Bears' Picnic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My tip to replace #philhogan is Helen McEntee. She is an experienced negotiator, and believes in the EU (unlike Hogan whose Mercator deal was a betrayal of every farmer in Europe).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulfieldj600 Also, politics is set up to favour the ruthless and the corrupt. Decent people occasionally survive in politics but it's rare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulfieldj600 We don't. We're just too busy trying to make ends meet and raise kids / care for elderly parents etc to run for election ourselves  https://t.co/OtyHkV5vKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aerosols should be the focus of the NPHET campaign. Schools will suffer the same fate as meat factories. @ronan_glynn @President_MU  https://t.co/OtyHkV5vKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBrickovich I can thank many people for that wisdom; I have spent decades interviewing people whose lived were ruined by the policies of Bertie Ahern, Phil Hogan etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruperthewison @SamanthaELong @ravenmargo1 @RTERadio1 Are you just trying to be patronising or are you seriously dense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#philhogan caused so much sadness. His Mercator deal and "national herd expansion" scheme drove the price of beef and milk down and made farming unviable for small farmers. He sneered at people who criticised his Irish Water rip-off deal. And we will still pay his pension!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd say "Good riddance" to #philhogan but I suspect he'll pop up on a State board (Road Safety or whatnot), as an advisor to some EU think-tank or a speaker on what used to be the Rubber Chicken circuit (now the steak &amp; wine circuit). Bad cess to him anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fmcomment @MichaelKellyIC The Little People are so fussy, with their clamorous demands for silly things like ethics in politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC You are joking, right? Even Nigeria hired him to teach them, ahem, statecraft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#philhogan arrogant to the end. His interview with @rtenews last night could be summed up as: "I'm sacrificing my glorious career because the Little People are making it impossible for me to do my important work!"  https://t.co/1l94GzLKaL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRayWalsh @rtenews Yes. And this reckless disregard for @HSELive public health guidelines has filtered down. A school in Carlow had 152 in the same room today. There's a limit of 50 people in hotel function rooms &amp; large churches, so why is a school assembly room exempt from the number restriction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews Ursula Von Der Leyen surely won't fall for his charm. And he can't bully her. I predict he will be gone by the end of the week. He is not irreplaceable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruperthewison @SamanthaELong @ravenmargo1 @RTERadio1 Not all journalists. Some of us keep getting sidelined because we're not into the networking / brown-nosing culture and have no family connections in public life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SJF_Penguin @LilaGraceRose @TeamTrump Abby Johnson is an anti-mask libertarian who sneered at a woman on Twitter who was worried about her elderly mother picking up Coronavirus. "Tell her to stay at home" was her response to the woman's genuine concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilaGraceRose @TeamTrump This happens with all right-wing campaigns, I've noticed. They gain support on a pro-life platform, then turn into callous feckwits protesting against masks and banging on about "herd immunity" (ie, cull the elderly or lock them up till they die).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the future for elderly people who want to be independent. Cheaper than paying for carers too. Thank you, Japan - for respecting your senior citizens and being brilliant engineers. @AgeAction @ThirdAgeIreland @ALONE_IRELAND<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn "Whistling in the dark", I believe, is what the "no fear" brigade are doing. They are like frightened children who demand their parents tell them "There's no such thing". They're also projecting their shame because they fear they may have caused deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidQu97940570 @Brigid_Ire @DavQuinn These anti-maskers seem to lead very insular lives. Everyone I know has a friend or family member who was very sick, and some still are months later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire @DavQuinn Just heard today about the death of one man (his brother told us). Two of my neighbours also had it (mother and daughter; the elderly mum recovered quickly but the very fit 40-something daughter nearly died). Also my sister's workplace had a scare when a customer fell ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithMillsD7 Sweden has had a mass cull. Of course their death rate will go down: there are hardly any old, vulnerable people left.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeKenn41804424 @RobertChaney This what's wrong with politics in Ireland: ex-teachers and other civil service types have the time and money to run for election, while the free thinkers are too busy just trying to survive while keeping their independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhhereLIO @CGreachain4 @irishelt @NewstalkFM @laoneill111 @PatKennyNT Worse in Sweden. They just let the virus pick its victims. The old people had two choices: gamble with the Grim Reaper or stay locked up for the rest of their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGreachain4 @irishelt @NewstalkFM @laoneill111 @PatKennyNT Because all the most vulnerable ones are dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @laoneill111 @PatKennyNT Sweden culled their old people. They'll save a fortune on pensions - and as a bonus their Covid-19 death rate will be lower due to the fact that there are too few vulnerable people left.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrTomFrieden Those of us who are childless are not sacrificing out careers and social lives just so selfish working mums can abandon their children and earn big bucks. They need to stay at home too until a vaccine in found.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnaita00 Because they tend to be racists as well as covid-deniers, anti-vaxxers and nutty conspiracy theorists. Though BLM and Antifa are just as bad. My conspiracy theory is that the Hard Left are in cahoots with the Far Right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FinancialTimes As a journalist on @RTE_PrimeTime eloquently put it, Sweden front-loaded their deaths. They basically culled their old and sick, and the only people left are the strong. So of course they'll have a lower death rate from now on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nobody is "baffled" by the behaviour of the #Golfgate bigwigs. They are typical of their type: arrogant megalomaniacs who feel invincible, untouchable and unanswerable to the people whose taxes fund them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer @ronan_glynn Is it true that kids are less of a transmission risk only because they are small? So they're no risk to adults in a supermarket queue, and one tiny pair of lungs carries a tiny viral load...but where does that leave 20 kids in a classroom and a teacher squatting to talk to them?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Interesting to hear him say that children are unlikely to spread the virus.

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump And I say this as an Irish woman, living in Ireland, surrounded by Democrat supporters: I'd vote Trump if I could. He's not perfect (who is?) but he's a businessman and he gets things done. Democrats have to rely on Hollywood actors to promote them because they've nothing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Biden's campaign can be summed up as: "I'm not Trump". Pathetic. And today he was bleating the Obama mantra,  Change".

<|startoftext|>@Hogojohnnie1 @McDonaghDJ @TheBrickovich Also, my own theory is that one child spreads fewer viral particles than one adult because the kid is smaller. But 20 small kids in a classroom is roughly the size of 10 adults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UltanJohn Wearing pyjamas is extremely risky; most people die in them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hogojohnnie1 @McDonaghDJ @TheBrickovich I recently read that the reason small kids tend not to transmit the virus as effectively is due to their height. So we are safe if they stand beside us in a supermarket queue - but not if we get down on the ground to talk to them. Teachers might want to remain standing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erodoran @DamoBuckley1 As a Catholic I am offended by this sacrilege. The Church, and Christianity in general, has had enough loonies twisting the message of Jesus Christ in the past. GO'D &amp; Co are anti-Christian in their behaviour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aquinn292 @inainmanathair He might thank his followers for social-distancing at the recent Eid celebration in Croke Park, for maintaining cordial relations with leaders of other religions in Ireland - and for maintaining their dignity in the face of such bigotry from a bunch of fake "Catholics" outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope someone involved in public health strategy is watching this film on RTE right now. We are at war with #COVID19 and we need to dump the wimpy Neville Chamberlain approach - and act like Winston Churchill. @ronan_glynn  https://t.co/CEMNb192AI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnofMercy It's disconcerting. Thought we'd left racism and bigotry in the past.

God bless you too, Dawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... I wonder what Jesus would say to these people who so blatantly use his name and his holy mother's name as instruments of hatred. Such blasphemy - and such hypocrisy. May they repent soon, so God can forgive them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... gloating that they will be among the Covid19 survivors while "just two per cent" of people might die of it "because they're old / sick and would have died of something else soon enough".

<|startoftext|>What has happened to Catholics in Ireland?

<|startoftext|>@NoelRock @theddp Gardai need more powers to protect the vulnerable. Yesterday a Covidiot posted a video of himself staging an anti-mask demo on a bus. Old people are afraid to use public transport because of psychopaths like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliveblogs I am 100 per cent with you. I had Swine Flu five years ago and turned from a very fit woman into an old crock overnight. An ex-neighbour, in his 30s, got a virus aged 7 or 8 and has been paralysed ever since. He was a healthy boy until then.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RSAIreland Why the ageism? My mother is over 70 and is a better driver than most people of any age. Her car protects her from the risk of catching Covid on a bus. Why would you want to potentially expose her to the virus by forcing her to visit your office?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney What are you talking about? Who said anything about foreigners, or homes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That lady should ignore the bill for "Covid Cleaning". If the hospital sues her, they'll be shamed in court. For the record: I had a procedure recently at Blackrock Clinic and there was no such nonsense there. Just had to pay the excess for the procedure. @Niall_Boylan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews It would have been so much cheaper to furlough the travel industry for a year. Pay them double the PUP rate to not work. Then the rest of the country could ride this out until spring 2021, when hopefully a vaccine would be found.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EamonMelia To be honest, I think if you suspect you have been exposed to Covid-19, you're better off just self-isolating for 14 days.

<|startoftext|>Helping people to stay in their own countries is what we should aim for. It would make more sense not just from a humanitarian and cultural perspective, but also economically.

<|startoftext|>...

<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney To be clear: you can claim the benefit from your own (EU) country, while living in the other (EU) country, just for the first three months if you are unemployed.

<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney Yes. I found this out when I was living in Italy.

<|startoftext|>@NiallMcConnell5 Where to begin? Mainie Jellett's horses, Sir John Lavery's portraits, Jack B Yeats, Mildred Anne Butler's doves, the Connemara Girl (Yeats again I think?), Harry Clarke's stained glass, frescoes by a nun in the Dominican Chapel in Dun Laoghaire...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clankknowsbest @GardaTraffic @AXA Have to say the gardai handled it extremely well. They put my mother at ease and took it very seriously. This situation was escalating and today we could ignore it no longer. Bullies will keep pushing the boundaries until they are stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clankknowsbest @GardaTraffic @AXA It wouldn't end well if we let them continue to bully us either. The gardai had a word with them. My mother is 80 years old and not able for the stress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @KeohaneDan I know it's probably unhealthy, but I love the way people in southern Italy and Spain go for a pizza at midnight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulCroft56 @fattybumbum65 @jucas_oliveira @IrishTimes That travel Q&amp;A sounds like an advertising tactic. No doubt the answer included a recommendation. This tactic pops up a lot on local Facebook pages ("Where can I find a plumber?")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishfabian @MaryKenny4 Funny you should mention Iran, but when I, as a teenager, expressed my personal approval of the French attitude (while agreeing that it would be fair to legalise divorce) in the Irish Times newsroom, a senior reporter yelled in my face: "It's like Iran!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When I asked the white van's driver why he parked an inch from my mother's car, he responded with a question: "Are you saying I did it on purpose?" "It looks like it. Could you move back a bit?" "I did do it on purpose. I parked exactly at the boundary line!" @GardaTraffic @AXA  https://t.co/Oy7ZVyBnRF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishfabian @MaryKenny4 I didn't care about that, being Catholic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulCroft56 @jucas_oliveira @IrishTimes I can confirm that the problem and letters pages are written entirely by reporters. One of my tasks on the desk in the Irish Sunday Mirror was to write letters from outraged readers. They had to have realistic but vague bales and addresses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelatimlin @irishfabian @MaryKenny4 He might have taken out the shotgun and invoked the French defence of "Crime of Passion".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @irishfabian It's the same in Italy. I actually agree with it, but was savaged when I expressed that view as a teenage trainee in the Irish Times during the original Divorce Referendum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@treegreenwood Shocking to see crowds harassing the obviously exhausted wild bird. The golden rule when dealing with wildlife out of their zone is: keep as far away as possible and call a vet / experts such as the NPWS and KAF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treegreenwood Brown Booby should have been left in peace. At one point, the poor bird flaps its wings - a clear "go away" signal. The NPWS ranger made the best decision when he removed it from the beach and handed it over to KAF, but it should have happened sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenVeganHeart @JohnOberg Wish I hadn't seen this. It's not just the appalling cruelty - it's the way a sentient creature is treated, like a machine or indeed a milk carton. Very disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoisLent @immdaly @ronan_glynn @rtenews @GeorgeLeeRTE Well said, Lois. I am sickened at the sociopathic devaluing of human lives shown by a lot of people who claim to be Christians. A 99-year-old disabled grumpy hermit is just as entitled to live as a popular, healthy 30-year-old mother of five<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit I actually believe our government wanted to do a Sweden on this: cull the elderly to save on pensions and boost the health of the "herd". But too many good people were watching. Also, the young are getting sick now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit I live in Ireland and the healthy certainly weren't locked down here. The elderly were encouraged to "cocoon" while the younger people got time off work &amp; school, and spent their days jogging and cycling. The real victims were the old people in nursing homes, deprived of freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit Another (ex) neighbour has been paralysed since the age of 7 or 8 after he picked up a mystery virus. He's now in his 40s and has to be spoon-fed etc. Who knows what the side-effects of Covid19 could be? And there's unlikely to be a vaccine as it's a coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit I should add: I am very fit and have a healthy lifestyle, never sick (apart from that flu five years ago). I wear a mask now to protect the most vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit When my neighbour's frightened mother described her symptoms of Coronavirus, I instantly remembered the Swine Flu. The most terrifying week of my life. And I worry that I may have asymptomatically spread it before I felt symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit I really felt close to death. Looked haggard after it - I believe it made me look at least ten years older than before, and over the course of the year my neck swelled up (that was the sting on the tail and I needed a procedure to get rid of the fluid). Thank God for the vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit I had Swine Flu in Jan 2015. It lasted just a week but the symptoms were severe, including extreme fever, nausea, exhaustion, burning eyes, aches, a cough that hurt my ribs + stomach, and even partial paralysis. I isolated myself and prayed. Every year since I've got the flu jab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit Three of my neighbours have been extremely sick with Coronavirus for weeks, despite two of them not being front line workers and all three under the age of 45 and very fit. One passed it on to her elderly mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit My "fear" is for the vulnerable. My dad had pneumonia when he died (it wasn't the cause of death but a contributory factor). The only way he could have picked it up was from an asymptomatic carrier. He, my mother+I had the flu vaccine, to protect him, but it's not 100% effective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 All their most vulnerable are dead. The cull is over for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to hear the Brown Booby is "brown bread". RIP, little fellow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit Viral load is the critical thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @TimesOfDeceit Three of my neighbours have it, all in their forties, normally very fit. They're still very weak, after more than a montglh. One passed it on to her elderly mother who made a swift recovery. It seems to hit the very fit in a different way; the immune system goes into overdrive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@conboy_hopkins @erinstephanie84 @Independent_ie Thanks, Anthony. I don't follow "the journal" but I believe it repeats press statements faithfully.

<|startoftext|>@conboy_hopkins @erinstephanie84 @Independent_ie Where is his statement disassociating himself from Peter Tatchell's disgusting comments? All I've found are his expressions of outrage the matter being raised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTriagain @GabeFin What did Sinn Fein say about Tatchell? Did they issue any kind of statement distancing themselves from his views?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie Any update on the recent, similar case in Sandymount? Gardai allegedly knelt on the back of a young guy who had just come out of his workplace (a hardware shop) and happened on a fight, stopped to watch and was mistaken for one of the thugs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stillgray Quanon appears to be a Liberal Left tactic to infiltrate and discredit the Conservatives. The people who spout "Q" stuff cannot seriously believe what they are saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray It's grossly racist and sexist. It demeans and instantly discredits everyone who uses it. Also, the term "white" is racist; the only truly "white" people are vampires (or me, in the middle of winter).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jakethesnake12 @DavQuinn No, because their most vulnerable people were culled in the First Wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn All their weakest residents have already died; they have culled a lot of the elderly.  They locked up the vulnerable "for their own safety" and let the virus run through the vectors; of course, it had to reach the vulnerable at some point (young staff in nursing homes etc).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't think Michael Martin has the rat-like cunning, or the common touch, to survive this. The late Charlie Haughey had it in spades.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichieA7 @MichealMartinTD Yes. It looks like someone convinced him to use a Machiavellian tactic to destroy a rival (promote, expose, feign regret and dump).

<|startoftext|>@TrumpCsc You can get a direct debit reversed too. Well, certainly with AIB, if you can prove it was unauthorised (which it is, if you are not getting what you paid for). Another option is to get a solicitor to claim it back, plus expenses and compensation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray And yes, Eoin O'Brion should shut up about Barry Cowen too; it makes him look petty and (as you rightly point out) hypocritical. But rather than answer him with retaliatory retrospective shaming, I would ask him to stick to current matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray And I am not defending the IRA, Dessie Ellis or anyone for crimes they committed in the past; I just think it is time to leave them in the past because otherwise we will all fester in eternal bitterness. He has done time in prison. He can do no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray Whereas cruelty is just evil per se.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray You know it was more complicated than murder and cruelty. There were legitimate reasons why the IRA (and the UVF and UFF for that matter) gained support. The great diplomats Albert Reynolds, Bill Clinton, John Hume, Mo Mowlam and many others dealt with this issue for many years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blue_Poes @fintanoflaois @IrishTimesPol @greenparty_ie @rodericogorman Exactly. It almost looks as if there is a concerted effort to turn back the clock to a time when gay men were publicly despised. The Catholic Church has had the same problem and unfortunately took a long time to finally admit there were paedophiles among the clergy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fintanoflaois @IrishTimesPol @greenparty_ie @rodericogorman I am not gay (at least I don't think so) and not a parent, but I felt compelled to speak out about this too because as adults we all need to protect children. It's great that people who took part in Pride are speaking out too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray I think there needs to be some sort of amnesty for people who committed crimes years ago (with the obvious exception of paedophilia, elder abuse and cruelty to animals, all of which are unforgiveable). Let the law deal with these matters. Otherwise we will never have peace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryLea29109898 #Marchforinnocence is a great idea, Mary - if everyone who takes part can be vetted to ensure they are not saboteurs / infiltrators. Street demos and marches always have the potential to undermine their own cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DHLExpressIre Hi, the three parcels which were due to arrive today were not delivered. I was at home all day and nobody rang the doorbell! The tracking  numbers are 3530941750, 7079649975 and 1399339605<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FfrenchShane However there may never be a vaccine for coronavirus because it's not a flu, even though the symptoms are similar. It's a variation on the common headcold, but more dangerous. My neighbour nearly died of it and she is a fit woman in her early 40s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FfrenchShane Yes, then I would agree to it. I got a terrible flu in 2015 and recovered within a week, but I was worried about passing it onto other people who might not be so healthy, so I've had the flu vaccine every year since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FfrenchShane But if everyone would, for just two weeks, simply wear a mask for the brief period they spend in a shop / ordering a pint at the bar / on public transport, keep six feet away from other people, and quarantine if they have been out of the country, we would never need a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FfrenchShane Depends on too many variables to give an answer in advance (for example, whether or not the vaccine had been tested on a representative cross-section human volunteers to ethical standards). I certainly don't believe old people should be locked up so other people can "enjoy life"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiverpoolAreMa1 @PierceOCinneide @TraceyOMahony81 @MariaLaoise @greenparty_ie No, I am saying it on the basis that paedophiles who actually advocate paedophilia have infiltrated the LGBT Community.

<|startoftext|>@emilystillalive @L12345Ken @MariaLaoise @greenparty_ie There have been plenty of "straight" paedophiles too. Including married men abusing their own children. This has nothing to do with being "gay" or cross-dressing etc. The LGBT movement and the @greenparty_ie need to issue a statement distancing themselves from child abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PierceOCinneide @TraceyOMahony81 @MariaLaoise @greenparty_ie The LGBT Community also needs to distance itself from paedophiles. While it is impossible to vet every person who takes part in a Pride parade or joins a movement, they need to make it clear that they abhor child abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Agree 100 per cent. And I have been saddened to see the primitive, pagan, collectivist attitude rearing its ugly head among people who claim to be Catholics. They put the "common good" above the God-given right of every individual soul. These are the Pharisees of our time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @Elpenor_Dignam Spot on, David. Paganism values "the common good". It is a primitive herd response to the threat of the outsider. Jesus took the side of the outcasts: single women, prostitutes like Mary Magdalen, sinners, old people like Lazarus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mr__daly @leannemac4 @CMOIreland The old people in care homes were culled in Sweden and not even counted.

<|startoftext|>@mr__daly @markod1916 @CMOIreland It certainly is rampant. Plenty of crazy conspiracy theorists who are a danger to themselves and others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mother heard @Niall_Boylan  recommending holes in masks so deaf people can lip-read. Here's an idea: write notes to them or use hand gestures). Better than exposing them to coronavirus - and certainly kinder than locking up all disabled / old people "for their own protection".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland And indeed modern Sweden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland The Quanon anti-vaxx people want a world in which the old will be prisoners while the young are free to experiment with herd immunity. It is barbaric and regressive. Practically it is a cull of the elderly, just like in pagan Sweden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland BTW, your profile picture suits you. Quanon / Gemma O'Doherty cult, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland Most people realise that now. People are being more careful, wearing masks in shops and avoiding crowds. Sadly a minority could cause a second wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland ...locked up at all. Their families should have been able to care for them at home given that they were all off work school. And everyone should have stayed at home (not walking, jogging and cycling around their neighbourhoods, sharing viral particles).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannemac4 @CMOIreland You are confusing mismanagement of care homes with the failure of the "lockdown" to actually, erm, lock people up. People were walking around their own communities without masks so it was, impossible to stop asymptomatic spread of the virus. The old people should not have been...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clankknowsbest Yes, or @StephenKing could turn it into a great horror story. I read it when I was researching a piece I was writing on an invasion of creepy crawlies.

<|startoftext|>@FfrenchShane @PillowC70051877 @ghook Agreed.

<|startoftext|>@AskAIB Hi, thanks for the reply. I have a specific query: I need to stop a SEPA direct debit going through. It hasn't been taken from my account yet AFAIK (checked online last night) so I couldn't use online banking to reverse it. I want to prevent it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @Independent_ie @MaryOGrady8 I must be the only journalist in Ireland not to have any family connections in politics and media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @Independent_ie @MaryOGrady8 "Journalists" work for political parties, politicians write God newspapers (instead of being properly interviewed by real journalists, they are allowed interview themselves in opinion pieces). It's the essence of corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @Independent_ie @MaryOGrady8 The utter hypocrisy of any newspaper in Ireland even mentioning nepotism, especially regarding politics / public life, is mind-blowing, given that many dynasties span the Irish media and public life industry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie @MaryOGrady8 In fairness, it happens in every walk of life. Trades, professions, farms, the arts...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I had a doll almost identical to that when I was a little girl. I also had a gollywog!. Never crossed my mind that either doll was a different "race".

<|startoftext|>@ThePware @VodafoneIreland To be honest, I think they are just having a laugh while they can, because they'll be replaced by bits soon enough. Fair enough - except not at the expense of a customer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePware @VodafoneIreland Yes. They've been messing me around for days. You would not believe the amount of utter bullshit, passing me from Twitter to marketing, to Customer Care line, etc, contradicting themselves, nearly offering me a deal, then passing me on and cutting me off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aggressie @Xshnargloth_II @john_mcguirk The Boomers have a lot in common with Millennials: but flaky and hippyish,rainbows and unicorns etc. The Zoomers are more like Gen X: Conservative and  herdlike but paradoxically thinking they're all mavericks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aggressie @Xshnargloth_II @john_mcguirk You are Gen X, by a year. Punk, post-punk, the New Romantics, Madonna, etc would be your soundtrack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aggressie @Xshnargloth_II @john_mcguirk Boomers were born between 1945 and 1964. Gen X are 1965-80. Millennials 1980-95. I studied marketing and apparently there is good science behind these categories.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Xshnargloth_II @aggressie @john_mcguirk BTW, I do know what the demographic for the actual "Baby Boomers" is, but it seems to be increasingly applied by Gen Xers to each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xshnargloth_II @aggressie @john_mcguirk What's this "OK Boomer" business? It seems to be a term used by people aged over 45 to shame their peers. A weird kind of self-loathing ageism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 Bit rich coming from a total stranger whose identity I cannot possibly verify online, passing disparaging comments on people I actually met, legitimate technicians. And you don't seem to believe the experts who put info on those reputable websites either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 Here is another reputable source of information confirming what the technicians told me last year. 5g has been here for over a year, and I saw them installing it right outside my home, and spoke to the technicians. So did plenty of tech-savvy neighbours.  https://t.co/RWA670BR5F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 I am more inclined to believe the men installing the technology, and the people who compiled the info for the map I just posted here, than some randomer on Twitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 Virtually everyone has 4g here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's an idea for the @greenparty_ie to reduce terrible waste and reduce energy usage in manufacturing: encourage people to maintain their old computers, phones and cars. It would also keep technicians and mechanics in employment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan I agree. Censorship always has the reverse effect to its purpose, like Prohibition. Even when it's hate speech (which Fawlty Towers certainly is not) censoring speech actually empowers racists, bigots, sexists,etc; best way to take the wind out of their sails is to laugh at them.<|endoftext|>

There's no vaccine, no cure at all, for Coronavirus - and that's why we need to keep our distance from each other: stop giving it opportunities to spread, until we can vaccinate against it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertANugent1 @DavQuinn @NewstalkFM The dark skin connection could have something to do with the tendency of people from the Third World to live in cramped accommodation and work in factories / healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertANugent1 @DavQuinn @NewstalkFM Re Italy: they acted in good faith, I believe, when they told everyone to stay in their homes. This was a mistake in Italy because most people live in apartments, and large extended families tend to live together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertANugent1 @DavQuinn @NewstalkFM Sweden was a total disaster. They sacrificed their most vulnerable. Just as they did in Pagan times when the elderly would be told to jump off a cliff. It's all about saving the economy (cost of pensions will be lower in Sweden now).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @NewstalkFM It certainly looked like you were promoting it, with many suxf tweets suggesting the Swedes had the right approach, along with continuous Tweets urging the Catholic Church to open up the churches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGreachain4 @indepdubnrth But a very sick person could be incapable of giving consent. And the pressure could be psychological / gaslighting. It is very common. Look up "elder abuse".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CGreachain4 @indepdubnrth So sorry for your loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGreachain4 @indepdubnrth How can a vulnerable person give consent? They could be put under pressure (made to feel like a burden on their family etc).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyne_sheryl They are clearly referring to stupid people who wear them around your chin and then pull them up over their noses, contaminating themselves. Doctors and nurses wear them for long shifts with no problems because they don't touch the mask once it's on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus I wear it in shops because I could be an asymptomatic carrier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to listen to these scientists about the long-term risk of a half-hearted approach to tackling Coronavirus - we don't have to "live with it" (or even die with it).  https://t.co/gZbkWwFW04<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @BarackObama He needs to get off the stage. Trump did more to get the black people out of poverty than Obama ever did. Obama is just a privileged Hawaiian who preyed on the poor black community, using identity politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus I saw just one other person wearing a mask today: my neighbour, who told me she had just recovered from the Coronavirus, which she caught from her daughter. The daughter is in her early 40s, fit and slim, but nearly died of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus Look at all the idiots walking around without masks, or wearing them incorrectly, standing too close to other people, shouting (especially in mass demos), jogging, cycling (heavy breathing). We will be very lucky to wipe out the virus at this rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus Sadly there is likely to be a second wave, possibly even multiple waves. The winter will be terrible. Look at what happened in Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/UJWdAw7Dyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reckless disregard for the safety of our most vulnerable. The masks are to stop the spread by asymptomatic vectors (look up Typhoid Mary). Worst of all are the gobshites who wear masks below their noses (in some cases on their chins / around their necks), or remove &amp; replace them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indepdubnrth The care home deaths are being played down. Today there was a, funeral of a lady who "recovered" from Covid19 last month but "last week died of pneumonia". So she got pneumonia in summer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus Gandchildren would be able to text tributes which would appear on screen, people could say the eulogies from their own homes to be heard by everyone involved, they could even form a virtual choir. A moderator could mute everyone's mic when the priest is speaking etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus Yes, and most churches stream them live. What I am talking about  is an interactive version (like a web-conference) on Zoom. People can join in, instead of just watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rat traps are more humane than poison - and more effective (better to know where to find a dead rat than wait for the squeals of a dying one or try to guess the provenance of the stink and flies).   Fair play to Oliver Bond residents for taking action  https://t.co/HekOcoelW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...families and groups of friends grieve together - without spreading the virus and being responsible for even more suffering. Maybe @ChurchServiceTV or  https://t.co/vKgTRFQJGj could set it up? @rogerchilds2u @KayBurley @NewstalkFM @funeralguideUK @DublinDiocese @MichaelKellyIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...so clearly the Coronavirus is still more prevalent than the official figures suggest; so it is here to stay, and if we have 2nd or 3rd waves, we need to find creative ways to soften the impact of the restrictions. Zoom Funerals might sound weird, but they'd help large...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrible as it is to have restrictions on the number of people at funerals, would it be worth considering hosting funerals on Zoom?

<|startoftext|>@DawnofMercy It's ironic thar a lot of the people who claim to be "pro-life" won't protect the vulnerable by wearing masks.

<|startoftext|>@Maurice67474247 @LeoBisset @indepdubnrth I personally know rural families whose daughters work in hospitals and as gardai, and believe they may have spread the virus in cities - having picked it up in their own rural communities, where it was already spreading like wildfire on dairy, meat and mushroom factories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoBisset @Maurice67474247 @indepdubnrth I never said that. I said... Oh, just read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmeanb @indepdubnrth At least they corrected it this time. At least two previous cases were listed as Dublin (I heard about these from friends of the family) because they were transferred to St James's hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maurice67474247 @indepdubnrth The Glanbia milk plant where the outbreak happened is in rural Kilkenny. A local hospital worker also caught the virus and died. It is not clear whether she picked it up in the community or hospital.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indepdubnrth It's farcical at this stage. Don't understand the ban on leaving your own county - the virus seems to be coming from factories in rural Ireland, and these people end up in Dublin hospitals, where they are recorded as "Dublin cases".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TonightVMTV @Antcon7062 The problem is the km limit. It is awful for people in densely populated urban areas, who are effectively under house-arrwsr because they cannot maintain social distancing while going for a walk in their community. Easier for rural people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@feamus777 @MHealyRae @NewstalkFM @rtenews That's because RTE is full of country schoolteachers who love the Gah and got top marks in fake standardised Irishsperanto. They hate Dublin even though they live in D4. Maybe we should move RTE and Croke Park to Kerry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@terrim8 @rteliveline Yes, at the beginning, people who were living in Limerick were transferred to hospital in Dublin, where they died of the virus, then their deaths were listed as "from the East".

From where?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus @rteliveline Dublin's big hospitals certainly are (or, rather, were until recently). But where are all these sick people coming from?

<|startoftext|>@CoraSherlock @EilisOHanIon In fairness, the point is not that kids are more likely to be vectors (there have been conflicting reports, and some are influenced by vested interests - eg, employers who want mums to go back to work).

<|startoftext|>If it wasn't dangerous to drink and drive, I'd break the 5km rule to drive from Dublin, where I have been living like a hermit, to that man's pub in Tipperary and order a pint (to drink in the car). Good luck to him. PubLivesMatter @rteliveline<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlistairSmith20 @IrishTimes @MaryLouMcDonald So, to sum up: you are generalising about what your fellow Irish citizens drink, you have no evidence to back up your comment, and you want tap water to be potable.

<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of us ignore the twenty-odd weirdos who roam this Ireland brandishing Irish Tricolours (usually back-to-front).

<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk They should not have been allowed, given that the (stated) purpose of the restrictions is to stop community transmission. Locking up the old, condemning to death because they can't enjoy the sunshine, is euthanasia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryTraynor21 @CMOIreland @SamuelMcConkey1 @NewstalkFM @rtenews What we need to know is where these people picked up the virus. If most of them picked it up in densely populated areas of Dublin, Cork or Limerick, it is a damning indictment of the 5k rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryTraynor21 @CMOIreland @SamuelMcConkey1 @NewstalkFM @rtenews I ask because there's the impression Dublin has more cases. It might indeed be possibile given population density and the 5k petri-dish rule (you can't social distance in a Dublin park) but equally it may be thefact that they are citing hospital, care home and test centre cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryTraynor21 @CMOIreland @SamuelMcConkey1 @NewstalkFM @rtenews At the start, NPHET were citing cases "in the East", which turned out to mean people from all over the country in hospitals in Dublin.

<|startoftext|>@smackovsky @SkyNews Yes. I live very close to it and have not been able to go for a swim because I don't want to pick up the virus. It probably wouldn't make me sick, but I wouldn't want to be a vector. So I exercise in the gard, drive to the shops and wear a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patricia_seery @IrishCathNews That too. And we could have killed the virus if everyone had just stayed away from each other for one month. A worldwide social distancing effort would have killed it. It needs human hosts to survive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk What sickens me is the blatant ageism. Even some "pro-life" people are pushing a dystopyan policy of "lock up the sick and elderly and let the young people free". Lots of feckless Typhoid Mary types around.  https://t.co/FBUYKNFiMu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac @RTE_PrimeTime The thing is, if we all co-operated and did our utmost to keep away from each other, just for a month, the virus would have nowhere to live, and it would die. It needs human hosts. A worldwide social-distancing effort would kill it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patricia_seery @IrishCathNews Very misleading headline. Dr Holohan actually went on to warn that the virus could spike again if the restrictions were lifted too soon.

<|startoftext|>@lukeming @TodayRadioRTE The most practical solution is a Living Wage for everyone, regardless of income, so there'll be no disincentive to work, and it will stimulate the economy (the jobless will spend it all just to survive).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paulmurphy_TD Low-pay employers have been subsidised by the State for years. They employ part-timers and students because no one can live on the wage they pay for 40 hours a week - unless they get the dole to make up the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrim8 @PatKennyNT I'm only paying 1k a year on Vhi One Plan (formerly Plan B). It was a decent deal until now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrim8 The only thing Medical Card patients and public health staff should say to private health insurance clients is "Thank you".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrim8 Exactly. That sums it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicearbhaill Still don't see the point of the 5k restriction for anyone travelling by car, alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicearbhaill That's awful. All you can do to stay safe on the bus is keep your distance and wear a visor (see YouTube tutorial on how to make one from a hairband and polypocket folder).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom @beachbuminkerry And that's what we'll have, if we don't hold tight and crush this virus quickly. Impatient people are going to be responsible for 2nd and 3rd waves in winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ Also a good idea to block anyone calling themselves "Professor" (they invariably aren't) or using the letter Q in their profile (unless their name is Quinn or Quentin etc): these are the Qanon cult. Worth doing a programme on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ @bmcdublin We need to reclaim the tricolour on behalf of ordinary, middle-of-the-road, honest-to-goodness Irish people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnNorth50 Yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney Priorities, priorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beachbuminkerry We are in the middle of a fucking global pandemic that kills people. All we need to do is stay away from people for a few weeks, to kill the virus (it can't survive without human hosts). Prolonging it will kill more people and destroy the economy. End of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrim8 They may have done a deal behind our backs. Probably something to do with Communist-Care aka Slaintecare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goia_marcus @Niall_Boylan If you get enough viral load of this virus you will die 100 per cent too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @Ryanair @NewstalkFM @rtenews @CMOIreland Been there, done that (wingwalking), though I doubt Michael has the right kind of plane (a World War One Boeing Stearman bi-plane with canvas wings - ultimate way to travel!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvatarDomy Very impressed by the young lad's calm demeanour. His parents were right not to panic too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Thought it was the Teddy Bears' Picnic". That should have been the caption for this story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @PatKennyNT State Claims Agency needs to be pursued too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @PatKennyNT More than that, we should receive compensation for breach of contract, severe distress, exacerbation of illness and, in some tragic cases, death of lived ones. I predict a class action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 @PatKennyNT Vhi are offering "free" mental health counselling sessions (online, of course) to all clients. Talk about gaslighting! After they broke their contract with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ It's like there are two groups of kids all over the world: the arty ones who want to leave traces of themselves, and the little Gretas who organise beach clean-ups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyDixonDJ Sorry, no. I just noticed the painted rocks, left them there (thought some child might be working on an art project), went home and looked it up online. The local Facebook pages have comments from people who say their kids are leaving a trail all along the coast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTERadio1 @joeliveline @RadioRayRTE As a matter of curiosity: was a similar study carried out among the people of London during the Blitz? If so, what were the findings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie Thought it was yet another race-baiting media campaign until I heard the recording; she actually is a racist. Had she simply said "a man is lurking in the bushes, filming me" I would have empathised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMHaughey A class action would put manners on the private insurers. Also the State Claims Agency should bear much of the cost of all the stress, illness and indeed deaths. Vhi and Laya clients have subsidised the public health system with an unfair levy for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Controversial topic. Kids are painting the stones on Irish beaches too (eg, Bray, Killiney), but environmentalalists say it's wrong @JeremyDixonDJ  The Kindness Rocks Project – Not So Kind to the Environment? #HikeLikeAWoman  https://t.co/OxoZHTmzUi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews It would even benefit the service industry @SupermacsIRE because there's be no pressure to pay well. Low-paid workers are already subsidised by the State anyway through Family Income Supplement / part-dole, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beachbuminkerry Anyway, thanks for letting me know the @IrexitFreedom stance on this subject: won't be voting for any of your candidates as I am pro-life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beachbuminkerry Quite the opposite. I have evidence that the HSE were putting Covid19 deaths down to other causes early on (unfortunately the families wouldn't go on the record). A recent report found this was widespread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aquinn292 @Niall_Boylan Pirate radio will do a better job once the likes of Niall has lost his ad revenue (due to the coronavirus returning in multiple waves because of all the Covidiots keeping it in circulation). He used to be a decent broadcaster but now sounds like a Qanon nut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews Of course, it's also a clever way of ensuring Fine Gael stays in power. Masterpiece of political artistry - and a genuine win-win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews A bit of wisdom from Leo Varadkar at last. Maybe it's time to put in place a basic income for all, to not only provide a safety net but to stimulate the economy, including entrepreneurship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit spewing out of @Niall_Boylan (who has been replaying the same show for two months now!). "You're more likely to die in a car than with #coronavirus ". Sure we might as well sit in the blades of a combine harvester so, since the number of deaths is statistically low.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan @PhilONe00893148 Tests have shown that very few of us were exposed to it (less than 10 per cent). That includes people who would have died but for medical intervention, and people who actually did die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to flying on @Ryanair 's new fleet of single-occupancy jets. As Michael O' Leary says, "public transport" is too risky (even a short trip in a bus / taxi). @NewstalkFM @rtenews @CMOIreland #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There is definitely market for a new private health insurance company, which let's clients choose the extras instead of having them imposed on us. Sick of subsidising other people's pregnancies, addictions, mental health issues etc.Just want basic health care covered @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a plan for private health insurance clients @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should lose the levy, and get a tax refund on all our subsidies to the public hospitals, and just use our health insurance to fund private healthcare including separate hospitals! Private insurance clients are treated with contempt by the HSE spongers @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My elderly father once pointed out to Vhi that he would not be able to avail of the maternity care given the fact he was (1) 74 and (2) a man. They told him he still had to pay for them! @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTE_PrimeTime Yes. Here are two good ones I wear going into shops (one a welding mask, one a homemade cloth mask). I am tempted to draw fangs on it to scare off the space-invading Covidiots!  https://t.co/VTK4bgSAWQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 That's a new twist on the "fake gay best friend" accusation. I once had a boyfriend who believed no guy was gay; they were only pretending to be, to get close to girls (he said).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Be honest, now, who would you rather do #lockdown with Dom'n'Boris or Keir Starmer / Nicola Sturgeon? The witch-hunt is going to backfire on the morally outraged ones. Remember Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr? #DominicCummings #DominicStays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone looking for a break from all the moral outrage, finger-wagging, etc: watch Cat Hospital on @RTEOne - it will make you smile and laugh, even if you don't like cats.

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Depends on how long you want this social-distancing semi-lockdown to last: two weeks of extreme restrictions (including 2m distancing, 2 weeks quarantine for new arrivals and anyone potentially exposed to the virus, no unnecessary trips outside your home) - or years of "waves".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk It's like the ban on going outside your 5k zone: ridiculous. Also counterproductive to keep people in their densely populated neighbourhoods, where they spend the whole day mingling (as opposed to two hours in a car and two hours max on the beach).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macgabhann31 @LeoVaradkar For someone who thinks it doesn't matter, you're showing a lot of interest in it. Here's a tip: don't bother yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalMcGoldri2 @LeoVaradkar @SimonHarrisTD @DonnellyStephen @Paschald All the private insurance customers and consultants need to get together and take a class action against private hospitals +insurers for breach of contract, undue stress, etc+possibly death of relatives.

<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk @EmmaMurphy12150 @LeoVaradkar Just switched on the Nine O'clock News out of curiosity, and you actually do have a point: Dominic Cummings is one of the main stories, and Leo is not mentioned at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk @EmmaMurphy12150 @LeoVaradkar And here's one of the mass-circulation newspapers (Mirror, below). The Sun is also leading with it. And no doubt it will be discussed ad nauseum on Liveline, etc.  https://t.co/dLjarpmXZt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk @EmmaMurphy12150 @LeoVaradkar They use a crude, unreliable method (TV switched on for the Angeles, channel not changed before the news comes on).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk @EmmaMurphy12150 @LeoVaradkar In fairness, RTE have an item about it on their website now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpmasterson @DavQuinn @john_mcguirk Oops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit rich to hear Alistair "Weapons of Mass Destruction" Campbell calling Dominic Cummings "shameful".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpmasterson @DavQuinn @john_mcguirk Also, most importantly, a good father, protecting his child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpmasterson @DavQuinn @john_mcguirk How would I know?! Why don't you ask him? And I think he's cool - a straight-talking, no-bullshit, breath of fresh air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NycConnolly @john_mcguirk "The Teddybears' Picnic" should be the anthem of Fine Gael from now on. Even better than "Simple Simon Says".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpmasterson @DavQuinn @john_mcguirk He said he couldn't move. I know what that feels like, having had flu five years ago - and Covid is worse than the flu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@declanganley He is being honest and reasonable. They won't like that. Meanwhile Alistair Campbell was given free rein to spew bile on RTE this morning - imagine a turd like that calling other people "scumbags".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Desdoes @c_camley @MichaelKellyIC @SamuelMcConkey1 That's a disgraceful thing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_camley @MichaelKellyIC Mixed messages from the experts. Prof @SamuelMcConkey1 said this morning that we need to do more than "flatten the curve" (which means keeping deaths and ICU admissions to manageable numbers and risk prolonging it for 4 yrs); we need to crush it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such fuss about Dominic Cummings. Unless someone can prove he actually said he was in favour of the ridiculous driving restrictions, he has nothing to answer for. The virus cannot be caught from behind the windscreen of a car!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_camley @MichaelKellyIC It will be crushed if everyone just stays away from each other for two weeks. It only survives because people are letting it use them as vectors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac Thanks for the tip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Desdoes @Niall_Boylan They weren't locked up. They took sensible advice to stay in. But I take your point - and I blame the scumbags who refuse to social-distance, because without these vectors the virus would have vanished in two weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This explains the craziness of the Qanon people and similar types who refuse to wear masks, refuse to keep their distance, etc.  https://t.co/sOEpH09JXq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC A person who loves shopping could just as easily ask the reverse. Telling people what they "should" do makes it look like an unpleasant duty, whereas going to Mass is actually a great privilege which we must postpone until this virus has been crushed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Who is "locked down" (or indeed "locked up" as some people are, claiming)? Nearly everyone in the country is out enjoying the sun, and has been for the past two months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracking read. #lockdown #books  https://t.co/0uJK7xTmAl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clankknowsbest @Niall_Boylan I wear a mask so I won't spread the virus to others, on the off-chance I'm an asymptomatic vector. I am also avoiding people. But it's a short-term sacrifice if we all do it. People like Niall will prolong the life of the virus. It needs vectors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clankknowsbest @Niall_Boylan My mother is not even a smoker and she is turned off by this. Also the ageism, sexism and bullying tone of the comment. She wears a mask to the shops to protect others, but is afraid of aggressive people (mostly 50-60-something men for some reason) who walk too close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cosainireland @JeremyDixonDJ Radio shows losing ad revenue. Presenters will be looking for jobs in the Civil Service.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indepdubnrth Just criticise the coronavirus restrictions and call them "lockdown" and you'll be grand. Niall will love you if you tell him you don't wear a mask in the shops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andypandylathe @DavQuinn Was that really him? I saw a photo but he was wearing huge sunglasses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac And free accommodation, cars etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac They also get free doughnuts and cakes in petrol stations! I was wondering why there are never any pastries or sandwiches left when I bring my mother for lunch in our local Circle K - until I saw a sign: "Free coffee and snack [or pastry] for Frontline Workers".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianymoran @DavQuinn This time it appeared. Totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn In fairness, they give Bolsonaro very little coverage too - even less than China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgraceful #coronavirus cover-up. Though not at all surprising to anyone who has had a relative die of it in the early stages of the crisis in Ireland.  https://t.co/yQBHMLobk8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianymoran @DavQuinn The link to the above tweet keeps appearing on my timeline but, when I try to see what it is, I get the message "This tweet is unavailable".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Missed the Bolsonara item. The only explanation I can think of is RTE's US Democrats bias, which is tied in with the Irish-American community, Ryan Tub's family connections, etc. Bolsonara is more of a Trump man and would be considered alt-right. Like Duterte in the Philippines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn This reminds me of my 1st lesson in journalism school. Our lecturer asked us which story an Irish editor should put on the front page: huge earthquake in India or huge traffic jam in Dublin. We chose earthquake. Wrong answer. People prefer news closer to home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mursim99 @willieodeaLIVE In both cases, he bravely went against the tide in protecting innocent children (from the surrogacy trafficking industry and indeed murder). Those who accuse him of "populism" should remember that he stood with the minority on these issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solitaryguy72 @willieodeaLIVE Where did he say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pillar_Citizen @willieodeaLIVE Excellent idea. It would boost the economy too because people on this most basic income would spend it all. The alternative (making the poor poorer) would lead to civil unrest, crime, even war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willieodeaLIVE Employers who profited by using cheap, casual, part-time labour have been amply subsidised by the State because these poor workers had to claim benefits to make up the difference. Also, unemployed people have lost any prospect of decently paid work through no fault of their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrelandAwakes Probably the Qanon weirdo cult. They all use the same symbols and phrases, all nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see the gardai being fair, standing up for people who want to stay safe, in their cars, en route to the sea for a quick swim. Also old people who need their cars, women avoiding street harassment and families with small kids. Lots of people appreciate this @GardaTraffic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan The wording of Niall's tweet say to me that this woman looked about 36-40, and she looked at him in disgust because he wasn't wearing a mask and wasn't keeping two metres away from other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday lunch used to be a meal in the pub with my mother. Now the best I can offer her is a cappuccino and snack in a petrol station. Today, and most Sundays, all the sandwiches and pastries were gone by lunchtime so we just had Mars bars. #covid19 #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewhitmore Tekken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerrywebster @Niall_Boylan That's actually true. Though it still causes more problems than it solves. You can get nicotine safely by eating tomatoes, potatoes and red peppers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan She wore the mask to protect you. The mask does not protect the wearer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And workers in the gig economy / unemployed people will be worst hit as their prospects of ever earning a decent living have vanished. Kicking people when they're at rock bottom is not just cruel+immoral: it will create a permanent underclass and lead to civil unrest @LabourDunL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The employers complaining about part-time workers getting this payment were themselves subsidised by the State because their workers relied on dole to make up the difference @LabourDunL   https://t.co/1j7A8PbOUe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrim8 @JennieB65680068 @Dosulli11037216 And now we will be forced to rely on a public health system at a time when it is decimated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennieB65680068 @Dosulli11037216 We have subsidised the public hospitals for years through private health insurance levies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac They are probably the only people, apart from gardai and politicians, earning a decent wage since the Coronavirus emergency legislation was put in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most vulnerable frontline workers are low-paid staff in supermarkets, filling stations, buses+taxis, and of course those cocooning with elderly relatives. They won't get free food donated by charities (and would be too proud to take it anyway) but deserve thanks. #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kk14 @NewstalkFM @LeoVaradkar @BreakfastNT Looks like the people who exploited these unfortunate workers, forcing them for years to rely on the State for supplementary income, will now get paid more State support than their former slaves! Subsidised by the State while their ex-slaves sink even lower into poverty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiallMcCall2020 @AnneRabbitte @FineGael How Labour has fallen! They should be helping the people whose income was so low, and so precarious, and whose part-time employers were effectively subsidised by the State because they didn't offer their casual workers a proper job with PRSI etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbdulRahimElfat @cryptophiles @rtenews So, just because the State subsidised their greedy employers who paid them slave wages, you believe these people deserve to remain on the bottom of the heap at a time when they can't even return to their miserable, low-paid labour?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@micknugent @DavQuinn Absolutely agree that we need to protect the vulnerable, and indeed anyone they may come into contact with in the community. We can wipe out this virus if we refuse to let it use our bodies as incubators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @MaryOGrady8 What's the bigger risk? Genuine question. I reckon Mass because there would be a large crowd indoors, including elderly people and kids (hard to stop them running around), whereas the hairdressers will take just one or two people in the salon, wear masks, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Staysafe_Masks Here I am, wearing one of my welding masks, which I was hoping to save for my art projects, DIY, etc. Your ear-loop masks will be handier when the hairdressers open @Staysafe_Masks #facemaskselfie  https://t.co/sJE0hQjUV6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Niall_Boylan As for "living in fear": I find that comment particularly offensive to those of us whose fear is not for ourselves but for the community as a whole. We want to stop this virus spreading. So we won't let it use our bodies as hosts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Niall_Boylan Listened to her. Some of what she says makes commonsense, but most of it is the opinion of a typically arrogant "expert" who fails to see other people's point of view.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 Burpees in the house and a few laps of the garden is my exercise regimen at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 It probably depends on the number of fleeting encounters. From what I understand, it's the viral load you're exposed to in a two-hour period. Where I live (Dublin) it's impossible to go for a walk without bumping into joggers every three minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn They certainly need to drop the illogical driving restrictions but keep up the distancing while people are still dying of this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @TonightVMTV Actually, don't bother to reply, Mark Daly; if you look at my tweet, you'll see I didn't ask you in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @TonightVMTV So explain to us why the virus is able to pass through a car windscreen? That's my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a moral ethicist David Quinn is treading dangerously close to relativism and even Machiavellianism here. @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please ask Cillian de Gascun why community transmission is encouraged (joggers and cyclists free to breathe all over their neighbourhoods) while driving is effectively banned.

<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Niall_Boylan You may well be willing to risk catching the coronavirus - but by allowing it to potentially use your body as a host, you would be keeping it alive and possibly passing it on to others, and keeping it in circulation to infect those who could die from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually had to block a troll who refused to accept that people have the right to a quiet drink alone in a pub.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roberta86681937 @Niall_Boylan @MaryKenny4 You really have a problem with people wanting to relax alone, don't you? Exactly the kind of people we will no longer see in the pubs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roberta86681937 @Niall_Boylan @MaryKenny4 My whole point is that some people (a lot, in fact) will be more likely to go to the pubs now that the pubs will be quiet places. Just trying to give the publicans some cause for optimism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roberta86681937 @Niall_Boylan @MaryKenny4 Too much hassle and your "quiet" lunch break is ruined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roberta86681937 @Niall_Boylan @MaryKenny4 No, the loners are usually the ones who want to be alone (usually to get a quiet pint while reading the paper). . The pests, by their very nature, are sociable - so sociable that they cannot resist invading everyone's space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Niall_Boylan Or pubs with social distancing. They would get a new kind of patron: the people who normally avoid pubs because they can't relax there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DermotFoley6 @Niall_Boylan Same here. And I know a few builders who would love to sit in the pub on their own during their break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Niall_Boylan No you can't do it at home because (1) you live with other people and / or (2) you want a break from the house. Maybe your house is small, maybe you fancy a pint poured by a bartender, in a nice glass, etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn His attitude reinforces the stereotype of the arrogant, out-of-touch judge playing God with other people's lives. Fortunately most judges are conscientious and decent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Yes, but the odd trip to a pub is hardly as risky as sharing a house with small rooms, in a densely populated area. And it would be his choice to take that risk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Presume he lives in a comfortable house with a decent-sized garden and is unlikely to have to share accommodation with potential vectors, and is financially comfortable enough to live like a pampered hermit. Other old people are not so lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn No. I would rather protect myself against criminals than have to place total, blind trust in the State.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nedkelly37 @RascalWhat @andreammayne @newschambers I find it unnecessary and vulgar too. They could advertise them without explaining in graphic detail how to use them. Who is the ad targeted at? Surely not women, who already know how!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newschambers I think it's unnecessary to tell us how to use them. Whatever next: instructions on the use of bog roll?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rteliveline @joeliveline I expect to see a similar ad for loo roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rorymcevoy No, because I'm not a masochist and I don't want to risk catching the virus from all the vectors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire @morningireland Neither is the State. We are in a dog-eat-dog situation, where we have to look after ourselves, but it's not a fair fight because we are handicapped by our Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olippydoo The Magdalen mums were like the surrogates today in poor countries such as Ukraine, but with one big difference: surrogates are impregnated specifically to cater for the market for babies. These mums should sue all the countries whose governments permit this dehumanising trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olippydoo Their families dumped them in the Magdalen Homes. The State asker the nuns to take these poor girls in, but didn't give the nuns enough money to pay for their keep. So they made them work and sold their babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningireland @gailconwaymedia @CountySligoGC Not the golfers who live more than 5km away. Most unfair. They have to remain in their 5k community petri-dishes, worrying about picking up the virus from their neighbours who can indulge in less hygienic sports such as jogging and cycling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire It was like watching a car crash in slow motion - while you are a passenger. The mid-term break vectors were let loose in the community with no quarantine. Anonymous paid trolls working for Dublin Airport sneered at people who expressed concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn And more funding to enable them to provide home care for people who would rather stay at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Testing is part of the problem. We can't trust the HSE or indre the pharmaceutical firms making the test kits or the laboratories (remember Cervical Check)? Nursing homes need more funding to provide more staff, bigger bedrooms (fresh air), more private space for their inmates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire @morningireland Meanwhile the State is planning to spend our money buying private hospitals - from people who don't even have the right to sell them, given that they are funded by the consultants who rent out rooms in them, and by their patience who pay insurance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire @morningireland And now the banks are promising to give our money to "community organisations" - that money would be better spent helping small businesses stay afloat, and helping people pay their mortgages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brigid_Ire @morningireland Call me a cynic, but I believe the latter. They saw an opportunity to sell pharmaceuticals &amp; test kits, to take away the people's independence (turn the workers into communists), destroy small business people, to promote the Green agenda, and to cull the sick and elderly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case anyone asks: I have no connection to any of the people involved and have not even covered this story. I am just a freelance journalist, deeply disturbed at the drop in stadards in my profession over the past 30 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether or not the boxing promoter Daniel Kinahan is as guilty as a some gardai say, defamation is unethical and indeed immoral. Everyone is innocent until found guilty.

<|startoftext|>What medical evidence is there that the virus can be transmitted from behind a car windscreen and not from a person breathing heavily while jogging / cycling? @morningireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonahofNinevah Very appropriate that your profile picture is a monkey touching his face. Most unhygienic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahofNinevah Unfortunately where I live the cyclists go close to pedestrians. The cycle lanes are not segregated. Also, the really oafish ones won't even dismount on narrow lanes when they see pedestrians including old people and women with children. They yell abuse at women walking alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisFaulkner97 @MaryOGrady8 Paradoxically, their hero-worship of Dr Tony does not extend to respecting his advice on cocooning. My mother is getting very restless, wanting the hairdresser's to open etc!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror This must be the first ever international medical brainstorming session. Usually they discuss cases together for years, carry our studies, clinical trials, etc, before releasing any info to the general public. Now all the experts are thinking out loud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisFaulkner97 @MaryOGrady8 Sadly a lot of elderly people - including my own mother! - think Dr Tony Holohan is charming, a hero, etc. These old people will be the first to lose their lives in the 2nd Wave if ICU beds become scarce. Procrastination and a half-hearted "lockdown" may yet cost their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahofNinevah Good to see some cyclists are gentlemen. All I see are vermin on bikes, doing their utmost to keep the virus in circulation until it eventually reaches the hospitals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Also, they tend to be reserved, and would never invade your space with hugs etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn They are scrupulously hygienic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCraughwell @MaryOGrady8 And yet homeware stores cannot open. And driving a private car beyond walking distance is mysteriously banned. And cycling and jogging around your community is encouraged. Irrational.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan It would be easier to take this seriously if they banned cycling and jogging, and allowed people to drive anywhere. It's as if they think the virus can be transmitted from behind a car windscreen and not in breath. As wacky as the 5g theory.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timwhite_ie @JoeSparkes3 I am tempted not to renew my insurance but, if most people cancel, the price will rocket and then it really will be "just for the rich". Also, the public health system will collapse without the levy to prop it up, and anyone who cancelled the insurance will suffer. Dilemma!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeSparkes3 A class action against the private health insurance companies and private clinics, as well as the State (through the State Claims Agency) might put manners on them. Compensation needs to be paid for breach of contract, distress and even death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnBoDhearg @TonyTonydeboi @Liam220262 @DrOrlaConlon Also, we pay a levy on our private health insurance to subsidise the public hospitals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyTonydeboi @AnBoDhearg @Liam220262 @DrOrlaConlon What the public health advocates fail to see is that public healthcare certainly does not confer equal rights.

<|startoftext|>@EireJohnMcMahon @gemmaod1 The judge clearly had the patience of a Saint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Passed my test first time, too, in Churchtown. Nearly had a crash during the test at Dundrum crossroads, but I did the right thing (jammed on the brakes).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan I can see both sides of this argument. If I hadn't practiced on my own (back in the days when learner drivers just had to stick an L plate on the car) I would never have learned. My neighbour, a veteran driving instructor, encouraged me to drive in all conditions, so I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalOverLord66 @Niall_Boylan Sorry for your loss. It is devastating for everyone. Not much consolation, but at least he was protected from the lonely last hours of a patient with coronavirus. To die alone must be terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened in Italy before the big outbreak. If affluent Bergamo, with its top-class hospitals, couldn't cope, how will Ireland manage next winter with our health service decimated by Recession and the loss of the Vhi levy? @NewstalkFM   https://t.co/thOAYRJZ80 via @newstalkfm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AodhBC Gravediggers' Tour bus in Dublin will have to change their script. There used to be a Plague victim coughing and describing how the neighbours would nail planks to the windows &amp; doors of the homes of sick people, leaving them to die. Too similar to the nursing home situation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSMillerNYC @AbbyJohnson Yes, it's weird the way certain moronic mantras are repeated by the leaders of all these conspiracy theorist cults which have popped up lately, all claiming to be pro-life but really pro-death. My theory is they are satanists trying to discredit Christianity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbbyJohnson @valeriefinnigan Disgusting response. What you are saying is "Lock up the sick. Let them die!" Yet you call yourself pro-life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Respect to the staff at @TescoIrl #Spar and @CentraIRL too. They are so patient and polite with everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac Sadly I think some charities with well-paid CEOs are taking advantage of the Coronavirus crisis to guilt-trip people who can ill-afford to contribute time or money as they risk falling into poverty themselves. All volunteers should be replaced by decently paid staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People working in the retail industry are absolute heroes. I was impressed this week by the staff at @dunnesstores Cornelscourt, who, against the odds, made shopping a stress-free experience. Also the scrupulously hygienic delivery drivers from @SuperValuIRL and @BootsIrishJobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone else sick of seeing these ads, placed by charities whose CEOs are on obscene salaries, asking people to work for free? Now is not the time to undercut other people who need jobs: now is the time to insist that all work is decently paid for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican @banbloodsports @ESgonecrazy @rte Haha. That happened to me on Bray Seafront once after I shared my chips with the seagulls (I did it to distract them from bothering a little girl).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulbuliaBrendan @Richieslater4 @PatKennyNT The many well-heeled work-from-home parents jogging and cycling around our neighbourhoods are just as lethal. I drive to the shops rather than risk passing them in the street and potentially passing on the virus to my mother, or indeed to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulbuliaBrendan @Richieslater4 @PatKennyNT That's obviously wrong, and they should have been arrested. Hope the poor elderly couple are OK. But this behaviour is not restricted to Travellers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The gardai can also sell them to TV shows ("Cops on Camera") to raise funds for good causes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caolanmcaree Stop! The thought of it is going to give us all nightmares!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulbuliaBrendan @PatKennyNT So do "settled" people. The self-entitled ones are the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican @banbloodsports @ESgonecrazy @rte I am on the side of the buzzards in this case. Joggers and cyclists need to buzz off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite the gloomy news that the Southside and Northside People newspapers have closed, I am optimistic that they will rise again. Here are some of the first pieces I wrote for Southside as a kid on work-experience during a previous Recession. Best of luck @dublinpeople  https://t.co/yyXoXeiSM4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @CMOIreland  is looking for an expert to talk about masks, he might consider asking this New York doc who invented the ultimate garment. It would certainly spice-up trips to the shops! A Kilkenny lady I interviewed recently has a similar idea involving Penneys bras (below).  https://t.co/OOfyESMgwX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear sweet feck - do the "journalists" at @theirishtimes even read the quotes they lifted from other people's interviews? Ireland is not under "lockdown" -Matt Damon has publicly conformed what we all know: we are not locked up!  https://t.co/QQ1w1r3wbn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Every day my mother attends online Mass, and often there is a funeral in the church - no social distancing, and the people are what you would call "affluent". Unfair to single out Travellers for this type of criticism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatKennyNT @laoneill11 The sceptic in me suspects it will be about money: selling drugs and test kits. BTW, I reckon people are picking up the virus during the test. The HSE is not renowned for scrupulous attention to hygiene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Travellers are not the only people who don't do "social distancing" at funerals. Plenty of packed funerals in the past 2 months on Church Services TV. Sick of the anti-Traveller bias @PatKennyNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom @CMOIreland @SimonHarrisTD The Irish authorities' obsession with blaming cars for the transmission of the virus is as ludicrous as Gemma O'Doherty's 5g theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom @CMOIreland @SimonHarrisTD The "Stay at Home" message is essentially just a driving ban. We are forbidden to drive further than walking distance. But community transmission is actively encouraged: jogging and cycling around our own neighbourhoods are recommended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @DavQuinn @CMOIreland I reckon people pick up the virus during the test. Cross-contamination is highly likely as the testers only change apron once a day (they could accidentally touch it with their clean gloves...), test kits are stored in grubby tents and of course the tests could be contaminated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican @banbloodsports @ESgonecrazy @rte They are attacking joggers and cyclists on a country road near me. Apparently there's a nest near the road and the birds are - rightly - defending their home from those  nuisances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caolanmcaree And "manny" when they mean "many". And they pronounce foreign placenames etc atrociously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind the coronavirus and impending global Recession. This has to be one of the weirdest weeks for showbiz: first that spat between Dickie Rock and Johnny Logan. Now Bryan Adams is going... erm, batshit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hermannkelly @gemmaod1 Waters and the rest are just bit-players in Gemma's reality show. She is the Kim Kardashian of Irish vloggers (even if she does have a personality more like Kim Jong Un's).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hermannkelly @gemmaod1 Her goal is not to get elected or even to win that court case (she must have known that a Judicial Review is not used to overturn legislation passed in the Seanad); she is clearly building a profile for the US talk-tour circuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dublinvoter @MacmillanPeadar @hermannkelly @gemmaod1 In fairness, anyone who had her phone number could have sent that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryoNe56094690 Ah stop with the conspiracy theories! What we have is a po-faced bunch of civil servants who begrudge ordinary people the comfort of their cars, and gain a petty pleasure out of tormenting those of us who dare to drive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan Get a pack of disposable welding masks if you can. They have breathing valves with filters and two elastic bands to go around the head; comfortable and secure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would have guessed that so many TV presenters were living with expert hairdressers / barbers? After the coronavirus crisis is over, @RTEOne @VirginMediaNews @BBCOne @cnn abd @itvnews should do a reality show featuring these heroic hairstylists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amobeirne @gardainfo They also veer out into the middle of the road, presumably to avoid coming close to pedestrians. They should give up cycling and jogging on public streets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The biggest casualty of the Coronavirus in Ireland and the UK is the police. Stopping people in private cars (the only safe mode of transport when a virus is spreading), while allowing joggers and cyclists to breathe all over their neighbours, will lead to anarchy. @gardainfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnsopinionok I got a Leap Card a few weeks before the Lockdown. Now I won't be using it. Prefer driving anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Travellers gathered for a traditional fair are regarded as spreaders of coronavirus - yet settled people are allowed cycle and jog around their own communities, panting and puffing on everyone in their path.

<|startoftext|>@RMisanthropy I don't know why I bothered to reply to you. I don't communicate with cowards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMisanthropy Rubbish. I, and many others, make controversial comments all the time. We are not banned because we can back up what we say with actual proof (not regurgitated crap off the Internet) - and we use our own names and photos.

<|startoftext|>@PaddyOReilly4 @dar0868356308 @Niall_Boylan Also if private health insurance is destroyed there will no longer be the levy propping up the public hospitals.

<|startoftext|>@DonnellanBilly @declanganley @adrianweckler Crows and possibly seagulls or even raptors could be trained to take them down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coronabhaisab @DavQuinn Yes, they could surely sit 2 metres apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are there no details of coronavirus deaths in Ireland by county? "Cases by county" mean very little; they could be asymptomatic people who simply tested positive, there could have been more tests, the tests could have given false positives, etc. @CMOIreland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMOIreland @roinnslainte @HSELive Is it possible to catch coronavirus through the windscreen of a car? Who is more likely to spread it: people driving alone in private cars or joggers and cyclists breathing heavily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aware Is paying all your helpers something you have considered? Now is your chance. Maybe pay your CEO less and actually employ people instead of getting them to work for free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrKRedmond Next there will be a clamp-down on families taking foreign students for the winter. The Irish government is using the horrible Coronavirus virus to impose communism. @rtenews @NewstalkFM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coronabhaisab @DavQuinn Yes but the alternative is a meaningless Leaving Cert this year and very low standards to get into uni (no foreign students).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another unfortunate side-effect of the situation is the loss of respect (if any existed) for environmentalists, who now tell us the loud birdsong, which we've always heard in urban areas because the birds were competing with the noise of traffic, is now down to...erm, no traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One side-effect of the Coronavirus crisis (in Ireland and the UK at least) has been to damage public confidence in the police @UKPolice @gardainfo because they are hell-bent on preventing people using the only safe method of transport when a deadly virus is in the air: the car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrBSilvester Yes, a load of neighbours in the local nursing homes and hospitals. Can't attend their funerals or even meet their poor families to express my condolences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas27254425 @RasPuti84556755 Pearls before swine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp OK, Gemma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan @MulveyNeil They lost me at the ban on driving more than a certain distance (currently 5k). How can you spread a virus through the windscreen of a car?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@declanganley @adrianweckler You could blind the drone with a laser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_ont @declanganley @adrianweckler Best idea so far. I would also suggest adding a remote-control manure-bomb to it; once it reaches its home, deploy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @declanganley @adrianweckler I mentioned that idea and some eejit dared to suggest I wouldn't be able to hit a drone with it. Worth a try - it could become a new sport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Dun Laoghaire is dead. Owen Keegan killed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Exactly. I used to take the bus to town and gave it up because it took too long (and it wasn't safe for a woman travelling alone).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp OK Gemma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC The "Bishop" is (if I recall correctly) the former binman who ordained Sinead O'Connor and the #liveline caller is probably one of those people radio shows have on speed-dial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp She changes her perception of reality to suit her arguments. It is truly head-melting to listen to Gemma O'Doddery. Your heart would go out to the judge, having to deal with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp As usual, Gemma based her argument on her own twisted interpretation. "In public" does not mean an unlimited number of people, as the judge pointed out (see transcript as I am not going to repeat the whole conversation between Gemma and that very patient judge).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemma_ODoherty @macgabhann31 Sure you can read it on  https://t.co/twORxSqlpI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp But the judge made the point that the transcript is available. The judge gave it to O'Doddery and Waters free of charge charge (waived the fee) as they didn't trust the journalists present to report accurately. It has even been shared online on  https://t.co/twORxSqlpI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 @Softwindroses You are deluded if you believe that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 @CA_Gerrard71 If Gemma does not know that, how can she claim to be a journalist? Even student journalalists know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 @CA_Gerrard71 And Children's Court where reporters need special permission of the judge (I got permission to cover it on occasion but the rules are very strict) and any court where the judge decides it should be held in camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guessed right. The tragic Coronavirus situation is going to be used as a Trojan horse to bring about the policies of Extinction Rebellion and the Greens. In the words of a certain little drama queen: "How dare they! ?"  https://t.co/ISEE2Rvktq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Linda08009062 @KnowsGrace @essentialworkr @gemmaod1 I am always careful, and know not to put faith in anything I can't physically verify (impossible to do so online). But I have my inbuilt radar (as I am sure you do).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @essentialworkr @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 It's beyond sad, to see this kind of cultish behaviour, especially now, when vulnerable people are dying because stupid conspiracy theorists can't accept that there is a very simple, very real threat to life. They are prolonging the survival of the virus with their antics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Linda08009062 @KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 Who? I have to say Gemma is quite powerful with her words (even though she is just spouting phrases off the global Qanon script).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @essentialworkr @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 It puzzled me that their followers believed that rubbish about "secretly installing 5g" while we were all allegedly locked in our homes. Everyone is out walking, and 5g was openly installed last year. Now I understand: they're cult members - they'll believe anything she says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @essentialworkr @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 I had vaguely heard of Qanon but hadn't looked it up until now, after another person on Twitter explained  to me that this was what the Q signified in the profile names of Gemma's followers. Look at the Wikipedia entry for Qanon; it explains a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @squawkying There's a swarm of them. And Gemma's fate will probably soon be that of every Queen Bee (figuratively speaking).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Linda08009062 @KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 It explains why Gemma's rants at the Four Courts and her tirades at the gardai, etc, are so incredibly megalomaniac-sounding ("We are your masters!" "We will strip her of her pension!" "Take back our country!" "The Great Awakening"!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Linda08009062 @KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 It's the way they repeat certain phrases, the same phrases used by similar groups worldwide, each with a cult leader (usually female - a queen bee). Look at the stuff they share online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace Gemma's crowd + the Qanon people in general remind me of all cults. I was very young when I came across the CBJ crowd and just thought they were weird and wacky. The photographer working with me on the story was more experienced; he felt sad because they were wasting their lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace That cult I mentioned was called CBJ, Eternal Flame + People Unlimited. I interviewed two members in Black lion, Greystones in 1992 for the Irish Press (I have so many cuttings, it may be a while before I find it). Here's a piece I found on them online: https://t.co/cSPKlmhJsC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essentialworkr @KnowsGrace @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 Just looked up the Qanon stuff. Wow, it's weird! A lot of things they say are off that script they all seem to be using. I really hope Gemma's court case goes ahead: it will be hilarious watching a judge and teams of lawyers try to unscramble all that head-melting wackiness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 Her late husband was very level-headed, and a decent person. He gave a lot of young people a start in journalism (including me). Can't imagine he would have approved of her present-day antics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 The NUJ, like a lot of unions, is quite extreme politically (left-Liberal). She was a member apparently (as I was, though I have since lapsed and joined an older union that sticks to representing journalists).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 Re her Leftie past: another journalist told me about her Leftie rant at an NUJ meeting years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 Interesting. I had noticed that Gemma and her followers were all using the exact same terms and phrases as other conspiracy theorists (David Icke, etc) as if they were brainwashed, but I put it down to an obsessive personality type rather than paid content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFar46201087 It's a spoof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 Gemma used to be quite the Leftie, according to people who knew her. I don't think she believes a word of what she's saying; she's not as stupid as she pretends. This is about building up an audience; the more dramatic she is, the more she will earn in donations / subscriptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macgabhann31 No, just a few reports in the newspapers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 There are loads of these different "sovereignty" and "patriot" groups. They are very fragmented. In fairness, so are their opponents on the Left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @L12345Ken @joecraig79 She seems to have decided she's judge and jury. She has tried and convicted a man in the Court of Gemma. Nobody can get a fair trial in this case as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA_Gerrard71 It applies in sensitive cases if the judge decides, and always in Family Courts and the Children's Court. Journalists can attend with the judge's permission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTERadio1 @TodaySOR I have been listening to him a lot more lately because I'm at home all day. Excellent interviewer. Hope he continues to broadcast; now, more than ever, we need experienced journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Are you for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Her irresponsible documentary could ruin the case if a certain man is ever charged with the child's murder; he can claim he didn't get a fair trial. Gemma should know that if she is a journalist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken It was grossly unethical and defamatory to publish that material the way she did. And what the garda said does not constitute hard evidence of a crime by the man the Councillor allegedly referred to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Nothing I hadn't heard before in it. Plenty of journalists have covered the same story, heard the rumours but held back on publication because there wasn't enough evidence to justify the defamation risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses She doesn't care whether we in Ireland support her or not; her antics are aimed at building up an online audience in the US, which will be lucrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essentialworkr @KnowsGrace @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 Oh thanks for telling me about the Q thing. I clearly missed that reference. Hard to keep up with all their wacky ways!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 Or maybe they are all just Gemma, using loads of fake profiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @Linda08009062 @gemmaod1 What's this obsession with calling themselves "Professor"? And some of them use the letter "Q" in their profile name - what's that about? There seems to be a subculture among her followers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Based on what I have seen of her "journalism", it looks as, though she comes up with a theory and tries to find evidence to prove it. That's the opposite of journalism. Even if one of her theories hit the spot, it would be by accident rather than good practice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L12345Ken Unfortunately her crazy rantings and frail grasp of logic detracts from everything she has said. We simply cannot trust her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gemma O'Doddery is at it again, claiming the judge breached the Constitution because he didn't allow randomers into court. You have to wonder if she is the same person who uses to be a professional journalist; if so, surely she would have covered cases held in camera?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas27254425 @RasPuti84556755 I am not a medical researcher and I have no way of verifying this info is accurate - but as SARSCoV2 (better known as Covid19) is new, not even the best medical researchers in the world know enough about it to predict its behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackcoffeecup Yes. I wish my mother would stop sending me to the shops for one or two items at a time. We make a list, I shop for her maintaining hygiene &amp; social distancing etc, and go through the decontamination routine - then she sends me back two days later!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@teelingbart @MaryOGrady8 @FergalBowers @rte Presume this is how they plan to save the economy: cut the pensions bill. Please God there won't be a 2nd wave: the elderly will be sacrificed to save the youth if utilitarian triage is deployed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac @TonightVMTV And there's the answer to your question: it's about money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac @TonightVMTV Another thing: they cannot possibly claim to be accurate or even clean. The sheer numberd - of test kits required to deal with such a pandemic, such virulence, repeat tests, etc - would make it impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac @TonightVMTV Now is probably a good time to buy shares in test kits or their components, if you have money to spare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac @TonightVMTV Exactly. You could test negative and pick up the virus ten minutes later - or indeed during the test!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Magdalen Laundries of our times. This time, it's the elderly who are abandoned by society, and the nursing home staff struggling to care for vulnerable people while deprived of resources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV But I appreciate your frank replies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV That's the way soldiers think. Some of us prefer to rely on ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV Appreciate that your are answering in good faith, but you cannot vouch for all your colleagues. You may trust them but you cannot force the rest of us to. Too many people have died because of mistakes made by the HSE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV Excuse me if I don't take your word for this, because of points I have already made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV You don't, by any chance, work for the Army or HSE, do you? Oh, wait...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV I seriously doubt that they stick rigorously to this. The RTE footage showed several people moving around inside the narrow tents simultaneously, no one was swabbing tables as they passed, and it is unlikely that the interiors of the tents were disinfected after each person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackcoffeecup @AGSI_Ireland @gardainfo @antoabs Exactly. How can the gardai expect respect when they don't exercise common sense or a regard for their own safety?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV Personally I would rather spend the rest of my life as a recluse than put my trust in any of the above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV This may explain why people have no faith in the State. We comply with the restrictions because we dread the alternative: having to rely on the HSE, the Gardai and (God help us!) the Army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV Another thing: Dr Holohan said yesterday that it was possible that cross-contamination could occur in a hospital. Imagine how much more likely it is to occur in an army tent. Or indeed when contact tracers are visiting people at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pmjk1 @TonightVMTV Recent footage on RTE news would not inspire confidence; testers were walking through a tent, divided into sections with narrow entrances; leaning over tables to take their test kits, etc. Also, we cannot trust that the test kits are uncontaminated (hello, Cervical Check!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertc140171 @TonightVMTV No, I won't. And stop butting in to my conversations; it's a waste of time having to answer / block randomers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertc140171 @TonightVMTV Robert, BTW, I asked Ivan and Matt that question so they could ask the experts. I wasn't tweeting it to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertc140171 @TonightVMTV There is absolutely no way you can verify that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Motorists should be compensated for the loss of the use of the roads and the use of their cars. This ban on travelling more than 5km is ridiculous when joggers and big sweaty lumps on bikes are allowed puff and pant all over their neighbourhoods. @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private health insurance clients are surely entitled to sue for compensation for breach of contract, stress, health problems exacerbated and sadly the loss of loved ones @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any chance the gardai will spend less time on road checkpoints and more time on foot patrols? Surely it's easier to pick up the virus from joggers and cyclists than motorists? @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can we trust the accuracy of tests and the hygiene standards where the testing personnel keep their PPA? Are all tables, tents, etc, decontaminated? Are aprons changed after every patient? @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an important issue that hasn't gone away. The children of surrogacy are this century's Magdalen babies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@No_MoreBullcrap If it wasn't so serious (people dying, more at risk thanks to these fools) it would be funny. John Waters is clearly enjoying hobnobbing with the kind of people who are usually found at People Before Profit demos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace Some of the most pathetic cult members I interviewed belonged to the Bernadine cult (they were told they'd live forever if they didn't have children) and the House of Prayer.Also met a lot of domestic abuse victims who had a similar mindset.They aggressively defend their abusers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace Yes. I have interviewed people who used to be members of cults, and they all behave like Gemma's lot. They crave acceptance and a sense of purpose. She flatters them but keeps them at arm's length. Similar tactics are used by animal trainers and dominatrices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joanne__Buck @DavQuinn @john_mcguirk I had a similar story, but in reverse  (people who died of Covid19 not registered as such) but I discussed it with several editors, and they all decided we wouldn't pursue it unless the families went on the record. That's the way professional journalists handle sensitive stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMick2020 @IrishTimes Cafes are already a distant memory. I am missing the buzz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers While she was entitled to ask a question, it was clearly rhetorical; she made up her mind before she asked, and didn't accept his answer (that cross-contamination could have occurred in a hospital setting). She's pushing a conspiracy that the hospital staff murdered a teenager!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...one thing: united in a bizarre multinational, multiracial, multicultural, socio-economically diverse, simultaneous campaign to trick their fellow citizens into faking a virus so they can destroy their economies and killing 17-year-old schoolgirls. How did Gemma convince them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How stupid are the followers of Gemma O'Doherty? They seriously believe there's no Covid19 - that people all over the world are in on a huge conspiracy: doctors, nursing home staff, families, survivors...people of different cultures, religions, unconnected to each other but for..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes This used to be my social life as a teenager. Fond memories of skipping school to get the bus to town, to meet a boy in Bewley Grafton Street. And Westmoreland St Bewley's was my "office" as a young journalist - great for interviews and I'd file copy from the phone box outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @john_mcguirk Also, the Gemmabots are all ranting about Dr Holohan's refusal to discuss the case when he does not have the details and the patient was a minor. Disgusting to see a grieving family used to push these weirdos' bonkers conspiracy theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @john_mcguirk She heckled Dr Tony Holohan because she didn't like his answer that it was, possible that a patient could pick up this highly virulent virus in hospital due to cross-contamination) because it didn't fit her bizarre theory (that the virus doesn't exist and the girl was murdered).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@newman1166 @Elleneff @Alan__Shatter Yes, though I had misgivings about Gemma's pro-life stance when she was running for President (she said she would have to sign the Repeal legislation if the people voted for it - kinda defeats the purpose of having a President).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FiDoyle_71 @Gallantsweeney @Alan__Shatter Unfortunately it will have no effect on them at all, whatever we do or do not do in Ireland. They are playing to a wider gallery - in the US. We are at best the chorus or the background scenery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elleneff @Alan__Shatter Everyone is asking. The clue is on her website. It's aimed at the American market. Multiply her 30 followers here by about a million and it's easy to see how she makes a living from donations. Also she will be paid to speak at events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan__Shatter Absolutely. They are showing shocking ignorance of the facts in general; there isn't even a "lockdown" in place and we are actually encouraged to exercise in the fresh air. Also grossly insensitive to people who lost loved ones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @SaturdayRTE Absolutely heartbreaking for families and close friends who live far apart. And it adds insult to injury when they see neighbours cycling past their house with their kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @SaturdayRTE It's a driving ban and plan to destroy small businesses. While I disagree with those two loons who keep changing their theory every day + using counterproductive tactics, I am wondering why, if it's so deadly, are jogging and cycling not banned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @SaturdayRTE What makes zero sense is the ban on travelling more than a certain number of kilometres - while at the same time allowing jogging and cycling in neighbourhoods. The Govt is active promoting community transmission but separating us from family in other parts of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshocds @Irishprolifer If only we had an island on which those brave priests and anyone else willing to catch Covid19 could stay, where they would not put other vulnerable people at risk of catching the virus. Looking at the footage from Italian hospitals, it is many times worse than leprosy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFFanning @TesstessToron @IrishTimes This is scandal on a monumental scale. The Irish government and health service will go down in history as a paradigm of incompetence, and some will reasonably reach the conclusion that they culled these vulnerable people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpbyrne The Irish govt lost public support for the restrictions last night when Leo Varadkar endorsed community transmission within walking distance while banning private car journeys. People who have family in different parts of the country will not comply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeromeOConnor1 @Roberta86681937 @Niall_Boylan They should use disposable welding masks.

<|startoftext|>@Eoin_Dineen @JoeMFurlong @gbollardphoto @newschambers That would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Ireland is headed for the mother and father of Wave Two #coronavirus . Worse than Bergamo.

<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Madness. Why is it OK to jog and cycle around one's neighbourhood and yet forbidden to drive 100 km to meet grandchildren you haven't seen for more than a month? It's not #lockdown and it's not about saving lives: it's a Greta Thunberg law.<|endoftext|>

Survival of the fittest happens without doctors. Civilisation is about protecting the vulnerable. That's why we have medicine and laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickhussey40 @Ronanequinlan @conormlally Over 70s are only advised not to go out - but some people are calling for them to be locked up forever "for their protection".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFaddy @macfionnlaig @indepdubnrth Imprisoning vulnerable people while feckless idiots spread the virus is madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macfionnlaig @TFaddy @indepdubnrth Quarantine for a short period until there is no community transmission, and continue to quarantine all new arrivals. As New Zealand has done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFaddy @macfionnlaig @indepdubnrth The message it sends out to the elderly people is: "Go away and die, out of sight and out of mind, and don't be bothering the young and fit people!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SorchaMcNally1 @indepdubnrth It does not reassure me at all. I still remember the stories about Cervical Check and MRSA in hospitals, so I don't trust the HSE at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFaddy @macfionnlaig @indepdubnrth Even more ironically, the same people usually claim to be pro-life:  what they are advocating is abortion for the old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TFaddy @macfionnlaig @indepdubnrth I have noticed that lots of people who claim to care about vulnerable people want to lock them (and their carers) away forever, rather than undergo a brief quarantine (literally, 14 days) to rid the island of Covid19, and quarantine for all new arrivals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indepdubnrth I am concerned that people might also pick up the virus during the test / contact tracing. How can we trust HSE workers and Army cadets to observe hygiene? Recent item on RTE showed them storing PPE in a tent; is the tent disinfected after each visitor?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinO04745454 Far more practical to just quarantine the whole country's population until the virus is gone, and continue to enforce quarantine on all new arrivals. Two weeks of strict quarantine that's all it would take.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinO04745454 It would work if they were very spacious (viral load is a danger in confined spaces) and if the staff were willing to totally abandon the outside world, and all human physical relationships, like enclosed orders of nuns.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @morningireland Next up: Bring Back Bubonic Plague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @morningireland Don't be giving people ideas, David. Gemma O'Doherty and her bunch of fruitcake will start a campaign to share the measles. Herd immunity and all that... (God be with the days when my cousin and I drew spots on our faces in the hope of skipping school).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChickenpoxAware Shh! Gemma O'Doherty and her posse of halfwits will launch a High Court action and a Bitchute campaign: "Save the Pox! Freedom to Pox!" with a "donate" button where you can send samples of your pox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Lockdow28159138 I have heard about her paranoia from other people who initially helped her (well, they let her pick their brains, copy their speeches and mix the ideas with various loopy theories from David Icke etc). Sadly this vexatious + spurious High Court case could go either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 I am wary of conspiracy theories, but I do think that the pharmaceutical industry will use this situation, and the Govt will do a deal with them in return for jobs etc. Especially in a recession. Which we could avoid if people just exercised self-discipline to kill off the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helper2 @AM_McSorley Of course they do. The lockdown is costing them patient fees. Are they sponsored by a pharmaceutical company by any chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 The irony of these people claiming to be pro-life while promoting a Typhoid Mary reaction to the virus, prolonging the lockdown, making the case for the Govt to impose vaccination and destroying the health service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantheinternet0 @Lockdow28159138 You probably weren't the right sort. She prefers useful idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MihaiVioreanu Could there be a case for a class action against the State and private health insurers for reckless endangerment and breach of contract to doctors and their patients? Rebates won't cut it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lockdow28159138 Hard to know. She must have some hidden power. Or he is just very vulnerable at the moment (he was quite ill, and was the victim of a sustained hate campaign by former colleagues). Her other followers are the textbook definition of incels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to believe this is the same John Waters who wrote "Give Us Back the Bad Roads". I interviewed him last August for Culture Wars magazine and he was lucid and engaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoreenBQuinn He found a bunch of incels and assorted misfits, looking for validation. He is too good for them. Pearls before swine. I hope his wife talks sense into him. He has been unwell and suffered stress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorMcDowell @PatKennyNT Missed the talk, but would like to make the point that cocooning just the elderly people is in effect a cull, because they come into regular close contact with carers, nurses, docs, etc - and we can't cocoon them all while letting the young vectors run free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorMcDowell @PatKennyNT *4km-diameter petri-dishes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorMcDowell @PatKennyNT Please make the case for banning cyclists and joggers, and letting people drive in their own cars to their own holiday homes. These 4am-diameter petri-dishes are just building a market for the pharmaceutical industry and culling the elderly. We need to kill the virus, not people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wcpretorius Yes. The Afrkaaners have been in Africa longer than most American families have been in America.They are just as African as Donald Trump is American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johndodwyer @amdowdican Will they indeed? Probably not. And it won't burn out if people persist on keeping it alive. The real carnage will be next winter, if a 2nd wave of coronavirus coincides with the flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican And they don't have to "demonise" those reckless idiots. Anyone with a conscience already regards them as vermin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Whether they do or not, that doesn't give Gemma O'Doddery and her sidekick an excuse to spread the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican The problem is Gemma O'Doddery is exacerbating an already dire situation. She and John Waterw cannot be that stupid. So we can only assume that they are corrupt. Either working for Big Pharma or making a living out of politics / American talk circuit. I reckon the latter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican That horse has bolted. Now we havd 3 choices: stay away from each other for a few weeks, let the virus cull the elderly through the inevitable route (carers cannot all cocoon with them) - or wait for a vaccine. I would rather endure temporary self-isolation than pay Big Pharma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 @BrookBayPirate I blame Greta Thunberg for turning young people into fogies and portraying older people as reckless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet Gemma O'Doddery's followers are able to travel by train from Galway to Dublin and back again. Why are @GardaTraffic and @IrishRail allowing this? https://t.co/6oF6E9WThh via @DonegalDaily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Plenty of people will want to attend his funeral - to check he's really dead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayar1947 @afneil Thought he fed him to the dogs - or was that just one of his generals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross5944 @afneil Do you mean the brother and uncle he had bumped off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@27khv @CllrKRedmond @Carlow_GAA That would have been hellish for some of us, who hate sports and team activities. One of the good things about lockdown is the legitimate excuse to be a recluse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@27khv Add to that no Internet, no central heating, no hot water, no Mummy taxi, and, of course, no Netflix. No chill at all. I would love to seen these pampered brats stuck in an air-raid shelter, eating mouldy spam, trying to tune into Radio One and only hearing Lord Haw Haw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@27khv @CllrKRedmond True, but I think the pampered Coronabrats and Covidiots would have an even harder time with no Netflix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Ironically, the coronavirus is likely to be the only thing Gemma and her mob could ever spread. Look at them: the word "incel" was invented just for people like them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican By encouraging people to keep the virus alive. It cannot spread if we stay apart. Healthy people without symptoms are vectors. It cannot survive more than three days without host bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockofLifeNI Add to that a picture of a person dying of coronavirus. A horrible death. Covid19 is abortion for old people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithMillsD7 @GardaTraffic Unless there is some secret deal with the pharmaceutical industry to keep the coronavirus alive long enough to justify selling a vaccine and test kits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrKRedmond "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" These people would not have lasted a minute in World War Two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Gemma and her band of fuckwits are prolonging the part-lockdown (and potentially causing a total lockdown next winter as the 2nd wave of the virus will then coincide with flu). Health services will be overwhelmed. They have a bloody nerve to call themselves pro-life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geniusguy10 @MulveyNeil @Niall_Boylan @leinsterwhite Hope so. Though I see plenty of covidiots around when I drive to the shops for my mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donscot23 @leezo_buya You seem to be obsessed with Catholics. Here's an idea: don't donate to the church. Simple. Now, since mute is not working...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Big Pharma will make a killing (literally) thanks to Covidiots keeping Coronavirus alive by letting it use their bodies as vectors. That explains why Gemma O'Doddery wasn't arrested, and why there is still no property lockdown, no quarantine for people arriving in Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie Cyclists are a high risk for everyone (including themselves) right now. You can almost see the clouds of coronavirus around them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donscot23 @leezo_buya And...mute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donscot23 @leezo_buya Evidence that atheists don't amass wealth and are not sanctimonious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could this be explained by the fact that children tend not to pass infections on to their mothers (Nature's way of ensuring a sick child always has Mum)? Could children still pass it on to others - could, Mum be the vector?  https://t.co/9kmpXsyuOY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leezo_buya @donscot23 Or even atheists. Never any mention of them at all in these rants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Global coronavirus death toll could be 60% higher than reported | Free to read  https://t.co/fU8IIEJkYw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror That's a really constructive idea. Along with remote working (for those jobs where it's feasible), it could save the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 My mother would agree with that. Had to stop her bolting out of the house yesterday to confront a jogger for putting "old people" at risk of catching the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar The Irish version of Karen is Gemma. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unbeatabletweet @yashar She probably won't die, she'll just be a vector. Someone vulnerable will die because their carer picked up the virus from something Karen touched, or passed too close to her in the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelly1Christy Exactly. And since visitors were banned more than two weeks ago, these, unfortunate people would have caught the virus from care home staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MulveyNeil @Niall_Boylan @leinsterwhite What is wrong with these people? Are they staggeringly, mind-blowingly stupid, or just psychopaths?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidjthunder @Niall_Boylan New Zealand seems to have beaten it. Unfortunately Ireland is owned by Big Pharma so our government would rather let the virus spread (in a controlled manner) and use it as an excuse to test vaccines, and sell test kits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth Sweden is culling the old and sick. Neighbouring Norway and Denmark imposed stricter rules and have a massively lower transmission rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelly1Christy Because of the government's dithering (half-hearted lockdown, letting people walk around their communities and even allowing jogging &amp; cycling) Covid19 has spread. It is now probably latent in many people, moving between asymptomatic vectors, and will resurface next winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelly1Christy It could indeed,though it only lasts 3 days outside the body. It needs a host. We could have beaten it if we had quarantined everyone arriving on the island and imposed a 14-day total lockdown at the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... taking hold, and we could then have dealt with any case that arose through latent community transmission (i.e., asymptomatic and passed on through several asymptomatic vectors until they reached someone who showed symptoms).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pharmaceuticals will benefit from the Irish and UK govts' decision to let Covid19 onto these islands. Quarantining arrivals +full lockdown for 14 days would have stopped it...  https://t.co/BMR0LLKQGK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Presume all the vulnerable people have died now. How sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers Why even bother banning long drives to the countryside if people are allowed jog and cycle around their neighbourhoods? The French have banned cycling, and only allow jogging in restricted hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...What, indeed, does it matter if most of the people spend many years on the dole, lose their homes, possibly even starve to death, because you were unwilling to spend a few weeks in your back garden / on your balcony / doing Joe Wicks exercises in your living room...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... and there are not too many people younger than yourself? What does it feel like to not give a damn about the old and vulnerable, to not care if they die in terrible pain and misery, drowning in their own phlegm, so you can go to work / school?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does it feel like to go for a jog, to ride a bicycle, to have a picnic on the beach, to attend a protest, to yell in the street - knowing that it may not cost your life because you are young and likely to be saved if you end up competing for a ventilator with an old person..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichealMartinTD Apart from being commonsense, it's just one example of things we should all have been doing from the beginning (along with quarantining all arrivals on this island, banning cycling &amp; jogging +allowing people to travel in cars only).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eltorosfo @LungAssociation Don't know if this sheds any light on the issue, but when I lived in Italy and worked in Milan, I used to go to the top of the highest skyscraper (La Torre Velasqua) most days to look out over the city, and the smog was visible above the horizon, lit by the sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoileainCuan @AllPassingThing @EmmaHEyre @eyrebrushed It would take more than a smile to lift that mug.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wise words from a wise man on #COVID19  https://t.co/iQLoGuUiTT via @wordpressdotcom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear me, Gemma O'Doddery is jumping on the #CancelTheContract bandwagon now, after leading a mob of morons in an act that will extend the lockdown. Honestly you could not make this up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hubiegallagher Presently our levy subsidises all the public beds for people who are too selfish and feckless to pay €20-25 a week to look after their health and would rather spend it on bloody booze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hubiegallagher Another point: private health insurance is cheaper than night in the pub or a Netflix subscription. But it really will be expensive if most people cancel their insurance. And the public hospitals will suffer as they won't be subsidised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hubiegallagher @SimonHarrisTD Agree. And private health insurance is the only protection the truly vulnerable have against ageism and (most ironically) ableism in medicine. A Communist-style utilitarian triage system favours Nature and discriminates against the old - it defeats the whole point of medicine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M58193735 @ShallowfordGone Whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisme48352507 @immdaly God give me patience - in the absence of which, there is always the Block button.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @cpbyrne Well they have changed their tune. Initially they were not counting them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @cpbyrne Once they've cut the pensions and disability bill by culling the old+sick, they'lll have a young, fit workforce - and no one to sell to: the rest of the world will be in recession. They'll choke on their greed. Regressive pagans, sacrificing the vulnerable on the altar of Nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @cpbyrne They are not counting deaths in care homes. This is a cull of the elderly and sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShallowfordGone Of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly  https://t.co/frTedbBwC0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShallowfordGone Exactly. Not to mention old folk using their Doro phones. And people who - shock, horror - don't carry their phones everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly Can't see why driving is curtailed when the authorities allow jogging &amp; cycling. Community transmission is clearly happening within these overlapping 3am-diameter petri-dishes @CMOIreland and dare we mention the Four Courts, the Curragh, Rathkeale, Dublin Airports, Keelings...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithMillsD7 We need to bring in conscription for the self-entitled little brats. Make them join the army or work in care homes like the Italians did up to 30 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly It would be the moral thing to do. And the right thing economically had we done it in the beginning. A half-hearted response has only prolonged the survival of the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly  https://t.co/frTedbBwC0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should have had #LockdownIreland to beat #COVID19 @CMOIreland  New Zealand seeing the benefits of strict #lockdown  https://t.co/frTedbBwC0 via @rte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly They said Apple devices. Not many people can afford an ipod. So it's the rich people who don't give a feck about the vulnerable. Or possibly the rich ipod users want to cull the elderly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly Well there is the small matter of a global pandemic so I think it's justified. But it would be simpler - and more effective - to impose total lockdown, and quarantine for new arrivals, until all traces of the virus are gone from this island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage @Roberta86681937 Not many doctors consider sepsis (they can't think of everything, in fairness).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Statisticians might conclude from this that Apple users are more likely to to be Covidiots. Or people who don't use Apple devices are either more compliant or more secretive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage @Roberta86681937 Call your doctor. I am just guessing and hopefully wrong, but you could have sepsis. It's fatal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @DECWARDO77 @Gabriel20374016 @gemmaod1 Let them fester. They are imploding in plain sight. Most of them are her imaginary friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carrdonnrboyle @Niall_Boylan Because Dublin is full of culchies. No room for any more asylum seekers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD Ban cycling and jogging if you want to stop the spread. It makes no sense to ban people driving in their private cars to the shops. We cannot walk down our street because the whole neighbourhood is full of covidiots exercising their little vectors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @DECWARDO77 @Gabriel20374016 @gemmaod1 Those words about starting a "citizens' army", logging names on a blacklist and stripping people of their pensions - absolutely sociopathic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @DECWARDO77 @Gabriel20374016 @gemmaod1 They all seem to follow a template. They say exactly the same things.

<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @DECWARDO77 @Gabriel20374016 @gemmaod1 I initially overlooked her weirdness and thought of her as a breath of fresh air in Irish politics.

<|startoftext|>@KnowsGrace @DECWARDO77 @Gabriel20374016 @gemmaod1 My mother was just saying something similar yesterday: "Imagine her sharing a cell with the Scissors Sisters?" Amazing what a few weeks of cocooning and non-stop watching of the Murder Channel can do to our elders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage My mother has turned into Dr Tony's biggest fan. It is funny the way she tunes in every evening. She has even taken to defending him whenever I say anything critical about him. I think he needs to stop pussyfooting around and impose a total lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamlovell4 Ironically, sinister literally means "of the Left".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk Why do people have to wait to be told what to do? Have they no common sense? I have been using disposable welding masks to go to the shops (and not touching them until I clean my hands).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartDuncan10 So, blame the idiots like the rabble in that video - and their leaders who are manipulating them to gain clicks and power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartDuncan10 I agree lockdown can do a lot of damage if it is prolonged - but the reason it's lasting so long is people keeping the virus alive. If they just stayed in at the beginning, it would not have spread so widely. There is no vaccine (yet) as there is for other viral infections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesuispaddy Same here. My mother and I gave John Waters our No1 votes. I supported his stance on abortion. Interviewed him for Culture Wars mag. Thought he cared about the rights of the most vulnerable, but now he's throwing the under a bus to boost Gemma's power-lust.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BartDuncan10 The same argument could be given for banishing all laws, all rules, all structures.

<|startoftext|>@Softwindroses Yes. At any age, it is a tragedy and a horrible, cruel death. My heart goes out to her and her family. Maybe if this sad news reaches the young Covidiots, they will practice social distancing for selfish reasons. They certainly don't care about old people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DunneDec @FergalBowers Well if you haven't taken any risk since the test, and you feel sick within 14 days, you'll know where you got it. And your family can cite the RTE report when they're suing the HSE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DunneDec @FergalBowers You didn't see the army tent because they didn't test you in the tent. The staff who tested you would however have been inside the tent putting on masks and aprons etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DunneDec @FergalBowers @rtenews The tests may indeed have been be negative - but you may have picked up the virus during the test. And you won't know unless you go for a test every 2 weeks...putting yourself at risk of contamination every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DunneDec @FergalBowers @rtenews No, it was an up-to-date report showing the screening procedures in place for #COVID19ireland - including Army personnel on standby. It is on RTE Player if you want to watch it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DunneDec @FergalBowers The tents they showed on @rtenews last week were enclosed, with narrow openings between sections of the tent.

<|startoftext|>@Bronagh20643421 @thedameedna1 @colum_kenneally @gemmaod1 @SimonHarrisTD @HSELive @CMOIreland The only reason the flu has disappeared is because flu season is winter; we are now in springtime. The Covid19 seems to be able to thrive even in warm weather.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads As usual, the charity industry will try to guilt-trip people into donating online, at a time when most people are very vulnerable financially. So it's good to know that the priests are able to get the same basic income in this emergency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads I mentioned the priests because there was a piece in The Tablet, which was repeated in other newspapers and websites, claiming that the priests weren't able to get the payment. There were calls for people to donate online to their parishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads From what I understand, it would have to have dropped significantly. Though people can always repay it if they do happen to get some income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelong25500334 @paddylepage It's pointless repeating myself - so I won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is important @MichaelKellyIC as priests and parishioners have been misled by articles in various publications. Please let them know they can apply for the Covid19 payment even if they are still ministering, if their income has dropped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please correct the record @The_Tablet @CatholicIreland and all the newspapers who reported this without checking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelong25500334 @paddylepage No, just a brief lockdown - to save us having a prolonged, half-lockdown which would do more damage. We need to give the virus nowhere to go; then it will die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Minister has explained that the priests are entitled to apply for Covid19 payment even if they are still saying Mass etc, as long as they can show that their income has dropped (no basket collections etc). Happy to correct the record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the US Democrats are the worst vultures, taking advantage of a pandemic to score cheap political points at a time when we all need to focus on action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddycosgrave The single-tier health system, combined with a utilitarian triage system, discriminates against the elderly, the sick and indeed anyone who is a burden / less useful to the State. Private health insurance protected them because they had some value as paying customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carrowranger @Dawson40M @FergalBowers My point is, we do not know whether it is happening (on this scale or indeed any scale: even if one person dies in such abject misery due to neglect, it is an atrocity).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VvmZachary @Paschald I would not take the risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VvmZachary @ATorygirl @Antipolluters Oh, thanks for letting me know. Anyway my mother got it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...to blame just China; we need to focus now on the fact that we are all potential vectors. We are all vermin. It is the Human Flu. We need to stop letting it use our bodies as hosts. @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...pointless calling it the "Chinese" virus (apart from the fact that the quaint policy of naming a virus after its country of origin died out 100 years ago;it wasn't appropriate for the Spanish flu either because a pandemic is just that: worldwide). And it's counterproductive...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I have no faith in testing - anywhere. Human error is also the reason #coronavirus was unleashed. Vultures may take advantage of it - but vectors are, the cause of this pandemic. That's why it's...  https://t.co/Ln6lvdnGtS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads The thing is, it could be anywhere. Remember Lees Cross?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thomas_360_ @Paschald "Are we there, yet? Are we there yet?" Someone needs to explain to the kids that the pandemic does not respond to pester power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be happening in Ireland too. Or indeed any country. We probably won't know until it's too late. We need whistle-blowers to speak out now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dawson40M @Carrowranger @FergalBowers In fairness, we need whistle-blowers willing to speak on the record. As a journalist myself, I often get harrowing stories but newspapers won't publish them with anonymous sources these days (used to be able to keep names confidential).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @Paschald We should also get a rebate on motor tax, NCT (those of us who paid already) and a per centage of the Driver's Licence fee. And compensation from health insurers for breach of contract (refund not good enough ; insurance was nullified).  https://t.co/5qXXzxSf01<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NationalPartyIE Also, loads of free fruit in the hedgerows if we wait till late summer / autumn. Elderberries are very versatile in recipes for everything from ice cream to champagne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NationalPartyIE Now is the time to grow our own food, in polytunnels or even window boxes. Strawberries can be grown in a barrel or a hanging  compost bag. We don't need #Keelings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malcolmbyrne Who does #Keelings belong to? Surely not the Keelings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Antipolluters So ten per cent were perfectly healthy before this awful virus infected them. And the rest, already vulnerable, lost their slim chance of survival because selfish people spread the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATorygirl @Antipolluters Pneumonia jab would be mire useful. Thank God I reminded my mother to get her pneumonia jab topped up last autumn. It lasts for 7 years I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexitjoker Great idea, though make sure to have security on it and watch the data allowance. I have given my mother my secure broadband dongle to watch Mass look at the news, etc. For the first time ever, I have gone over my GB limit. Vodafone were very good about it.<|endoftext|>

It did not spread accidentally (like the Spanish Flu etc) : thanks to modern communications, we could have stopped it spreading. It is a World Virus (aka Pandemic) because stupid people let it spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@London19721 @DVATW Here's the point (in case it's still or crystal-clear): the Coronavirus should have remained in China, and died in China. It should never have spread beyond Wuhan. Initially it was the Wuhan Flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@London19721 @DVATW It's the Whole World's virus now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Revlos100 @DVATW But now it's worldwide - it's the Everywhere Virus, thanks to all the feckless psychopaths spreading it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fred85202610 @DVATW Ha, please don't insult all the Chinese people by mentioning them in the same breath as that loathsome hugger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarredBastard Sadly people are staying away from hospitals because they're afraid to catch the Coronavirus. The sooner we kill it off (by denying it the opportunity to use our bodies as hosts) the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW We it's a worldwide virus now. Because idiots keep spreading it. No longer a "China Virus" but a "New York virus" etc. Rip those poor people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW BTW, Coronavirus, flu and the common cold are still spreading here (in Ireland), just not as virulently as they would have had we not imposed a partial lockdown. Unfortunately the lockdown is prolonged because some idiots insist on congregating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW What is "China Virus"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW Your comment does not make sense. What do you mean by "Pick a side"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They both need a smack. That'll give them a reason to cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This needs to be dealt with @SageAdvocacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom @hermannkelly It's the main story in all the mainstream newspapers today. Whatever about politicians, journalists are reporting this (covering two aspects of it: public health and low wages).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage I strongly dislike a lot of what they stand for, but the lockdown is necessary. I don't think they went far enough; there should be complete lockdown until the virus has no human host. At the moment it is spreading in communities because people are not staying in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BG1954 @RTENewsNow Good piece by @FergalBowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage Strangers trying to hug me would creep me out even more. It has happened in the past (and they have learned a very painful lesson).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk That makes me want to puke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage If a stranger (perfect or otherwise) gave me a hug they'd get a knee in the wotsits. One of the few things I am enjoying about #lockdown is the social distancing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 @rte More than that: health insurance firms #vhi #laya #irishlife etc are legally liable to pay compensation because they broke a contract and their clients deprived of a vital service they expected to have for the rest of their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @duzBme @Patlyndo That's the really scary bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shevaunne Yes. Vulture funds and carpet baggers waiting for the recession to kick in, so no one can afford to buy anything; prices will drop as desperate home-owners are forced to sell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNICK2007 @NoelPender @IAMMGraham Exactly. This half-lockdown is prolonging it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One reason for having private health insurance was to avoid the need for the State to know your health details. Now everyone is vulnerable: the sick because they're a "burden", the fit because their organs are a valuable asset, and everyone will be used for clinical trials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This needs to be challenged before we have full-on Communism: homes seized, bank accounts seized, health insurance annulled, even our organs removed and "donated" to worthier people - oh, wait... @lawsocgazette @RonanMullen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...not just private health insurance clients, but anyone who owns anything. Once a precedent is set allowing the State to seize any private asset, whether health insurance or hospitals, the State can seize private property. Expect a knock on the door: "We're taking your house!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Replying to @duzBme @Patlyndo and 8 others (including one called, bizarrely, "Only for the Tape")  Why don't you just read what I wrote? It's not rocket science, is it?

<|startoftext|>@sparpm @Paschald "Only" 400 very painful deaths, drowning in their own phlegm. God help this country: psychopaths amongst us.

<|startoftext|>@duzBme @Patlyndo @colettebrowne @HSELive @rtenews @paddycosgrave @TodaySOR @williamhboney1 @mir_ocall @ronan_glynn But common sense will give you the answer to your question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duzBme @Patlyndo @colettebrowne @HSELive @rtenews @paddycosgrave @TodaySOR @williamhboney1 @mir_ocall @ronan_glynn I can't because I am not an expert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longfordmac Conspiracy theories will go unchallenged because it will be impossible to prove or disprove anything. I reckon it's all a cover for organ-trafficking; it fits the recent decision to introduce opt-out organ "donation".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever the origin of Covid19 and regardless of the reasons it was allowed to spread (negligence / open borders / the "green agenda" re depopulation, etc), the effect is going to a mass cull of the poor, sick and old. The world will be economically rich, spiritually poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duzBme @Patlyndo @colettebrowne @HSELive @rtenews @paddycosgrave @TodaySOR @williamhboney1 @mir_ocall Common sense would tell you that it's never "safe" to be in the presence of people infected with any kind of virus - let alone a brand-new pandemic which has killed tens of thousands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAMMGraham Lockdown should eliminate the virus - it won't survive if it cannot find a human host - but unfortunately it is only a part-lockdown. People are still walking around their 4km petrie-dishes. A proper lockdown is needed until the virus has nowhere to go and dies out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stats for Rep of Ireland and the UK in recent days suggest that deaths of old people in nursing homes rose 50 per cent, regardless of cause. How much of this is Covid19? We'll never know for sure. No doubt there will be inquests.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sparpm @Paschald The State will save a fortune on pensions and disability benefits now that loads of old and sick people have been culled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan They should modify the restrictions to allow people to travel anywhere as long as they do so in private cars (and still maintain social distancing, hygiene, etc) - but ban the walkabouts, jogging and cycling around neighbourhoods.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichieA7 @gardainfo That too. But my neighbour's concern is that this group of people could have told others (their family / in laws / random friends) that she is a vulnerable elderly person. She is now worried about being targeted for burglaries in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllPassingThing @irishexaminer @IrishTimes Yes indeed, imagine journalists teing the boss: "Sorry, havrn9got the time to work for you - I'm going to spend my days investigating stories and publishing them on Twitter, for free! But hey - keep paying me for not working!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Refunds are not good enough. They should also pay compensation for breach of contract.

<|startoftext|>@RichieA7 @gardainfo Another woman told me her elderly parents in London are plagued by volunteers ringing their doorbell and dropping leaflets in. It seems the whole neighbourhood knows they are old and vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexitjoker @gardainfo Even if the volunteers are harmless and well-meaning, she finds it very intrusive. She's also concerned their families and friends might not be vetted. She would rather let her own family do the food deliveries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Desdoes @RTEOne @VirginMediaNews My mother only watches them while she's waiting for the news. After that, she switches over to the Murder Channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An elderly neighbour was horrified to get a call from "Community Call" volunteers - somebody gave them her number. She's concerned that random strangers know she is "vulnerable". Are these volunteers and all their contacts vetted? @gardainfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To help cocooned elderly people cope, could @RTEOne and @VirginMediaNews show something more interesting than shows about home-decorating and cooking? Maybe old episodes of #FairCity /older soaps? (And a few action / Hammer House of Horror films for my Mam who loves them)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddycosgrave I got a story about this two weeks ago and tried to get it into papers. Editors wouldn't publish it because the family wanted to keep their name out of it. Journalism uses to be about telling the truth &amp; keeping sources confidential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Driving to the shops to stock up on groceries for elderly people is a nightmare because #COVIDIOTS are blocking cars - walking, cycling and even scootering in the middle of suburban streets! They need to park their hatred of drivers now - in a global emergency! @gardainfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cooper_m It's the young / middle-aged vectors who should be cocooned. They are obnoxious - eg, jogging on footpaths, walking with their kids in the middle of residential roads to block cars, so people can't drive to the shops to pick up groceries for elderly parents, etc. #COVID19Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jlamber55605930 What do you think about the policy of letting the under-70s wander around their communities? Surely this is prolonging the survival of the virus? Why wasn't there a total lockdown and quarantine for anyone arriving on the island of Ireland?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonReilly_com I honestly haven't got the time to reply to every individual query on a topic that is just one of many I have covered.

<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 I think a healthy scepticism - without undue anxiety - is the best approach to anything involving new technology. Any (alleged) health effects will take decades to materialise, and experts are only as good as the information they have (and their sources of funding).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray Like the journalists at our own Dept of Health press conferences, they are being polite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 I think the default policy should be to err on the side of caution. Better the divil you know. But, yes, I can see both sides of the argument in each case (nuclear power and 5g).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonReilly_com No attempt at objectivity or fairness, no proper journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonReilly_com I should add: the selection of quotes on the website may indeed be accurate, but the headline and the way this essay is put together, the whole tone of it, just comes across as loony. It's like those lefty pamphlets we used to see on lampposts in the 80s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonReilly_com Honestly, I think it is counterproductive. It destroys any chance of a reasonable, dispassionate public debate on the topic. Anyone who raises legitimate concerns is tarred with the same brush as the loony tinfoil hat brigade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonReilly_com Here we go again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport Whatever we may think of her tactics, she is legitimately doing what is commonly known as "citizen journalism".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport She is now. Look at what she has been doing for the last two years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my unbiased view (I genuinely don't hold strong views on 5g and am curious about it, as I am about most things).  https://t.co/Y26tqbgqRC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wacky conspiracy theorists have shut down legitimate debate on 5g, by tarnishing all critics with the "tinfoil hat" tag. In this month's issue of Culture Wars magazine, I covered the topic as part of a piece on Irish politics (written before the Coronavirus lockdown).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport I will pin it to my Twitter page rather than reply to every individual who asks (I blame the loopy conspiracy theorists for polluting the conversation on this topic to such an extent that the kneejerk reaction is to dismiss every legitimate concern).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport Concerns have been expressed by a large group of scientists, inadequate responses have been given to reporters (including I) who questiontioned various experts, and a widely cited "independent" study is nothing of the sort.If I find the time, I will post a link to a recent piece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoreenBQuinn Great. Good idea to make it audio only: I am fed up with all the videos on various websites - so time-consuming. I am more of a reader and writer, and listener.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoreenBQuinn Yes. My full name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomClonan The emergency legislation imposed on the health system to deal with the Covid19 emergency will pave the way for Slaintecare - making it impossible for VHI etc to operate as they have done. Private health insurance will soon be elitist, only for the super-rich. Grossly unethical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomClonan Cheap private health insurance was the only protection the vulnerable had against ageist / ableist triage. Insurance firms want their customers to live; the State wants to save money on pensions / disability benefits and resources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomClonan This is the utilitarian model of triage practised under Communist regimes. The direct opposite to the civilised medical ethical system promoted by Christians (and, no doubt, Muslims and Jews) where the strong protect the vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoreenBQuinn Yes, and the smug under-40s will find themselves on the expendable list sooner than they think if they are unemployed. The Covid19 payments won't last forever and cuts will be needed. I'll have a look at Coffin Dodger. I'm on Bitchute too (using my own name).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomdoorley @squawkying @DublinAirport Unfortunately citizen "journalists" such as Gemma, with their ridiculous claims, are undermining legitimate concern re the longterm health effects of 5g and valid attempts to hold Dublin Airport and the Govt accountable.<|endoftext|>

Beware of specialists: they get too cosy with their sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky When I started in journalism, PR people were treated as the enemy, and experts were interviewed and questioned rigorously about their vested interests. Now the experts are allowed write their own article - basically interview themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky We can't trust citizen journalists or indeed the mainstream media. And I say this as a veteran professional mainstream journalist. I never forgot my training and one thing I learned was to question everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Also, a lot of citizen journalists think research is googling or sharing info passed on to them by far-right / far-left agitators who are using them to make money (clickbait on websites / political careers / charity gigs / subscriptions).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Unfortunately, a lot of citizen journalists are likely to do more harm than good. They have no idea of defamation laws (some think they do but they are still using the word "libel" - an outdated term which, along with slander, has been replaced by the blanket term "defamation").<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@altforire @MaryThorn85 We could be forgiven for thinking the State was trying to cull the elderly. They're exposed to the #coronavirus in care homes and left to die of pneumonia.

<|startoftext|>@NoEatBat @Dungeon_Rooney Come to think of it, there should be a charity set up for everyone who is losing work: plumbers, electricians, mechanics, waiters, hairdressers, beauticians... The cut-and-paste data-entry clerks at The Journal are hardly providing a service as important asany of these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoEatBat @Dungeon_Rooney I might be inspired by them to set up a similar charity fund for real journalists who are losing work because there are no longer any vacancies in the mainstream media for good freelance work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @AXA @aaroadwatch @CarbuyerUK @TopGearEditor @RichardHammond @JeremyClarkson @Niall_Boylan @rtenews @TonightVMTV @IvanYatesNT They may be forced to if people decide it would be more economical to walk everywhere.

<|startoftext|>@VoiceofCal "Good guys" who kill the poor, the sick, the elderly and health are workers first? Who destroy small businesses, make paupers out of hardworking people, turn us all into potential bio-weapons and deny the dying the comfort of their loved ones and even a dignified fun era?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@understandirony @smackovsky @last_call12 @aoife_eefa @BirdWatchIE @miguelmyriad We have tree Robins who seem to be a family. One of these guys thought my mother and I were in "their" garden recently and jumped at us as we crossed the lawn, flapping his little wings furiously. I had just put some food out for him (crunchy mealworms I bought in Woodies).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdWatchIE @aoife_eefa @miguelmyriad Magpies are in a building frenzy in our garden, ripping twigs off trees and digging up all my herbs, then dancing up the trees as they try to hang onto their building materials.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@understandirony @smackovsky @last_call12 @aoife_eefa @BirdWatchIE @miguelmyriad All the birds in our garden are territorial, aggressive little feckers - including blackbird. It's like gangland every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers If the makers can guarantee that it has not been tested on aborted foetuses or any by-products of abortion, this is great news. Otherwise, not: no one with a conscience wants to survive through cannibalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC And there were the rest of us, thinking it was a number to call in case we needed to protect our elderly parents from a deadly pandemic virus, death by drowning in one's own mucus, lonely death, removal in a biohazard bag, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOSullivanIR @Jesuispaddy @colettebrowne I have noticed that people who complain about "The Meeja" for "not reporting" things always refuse to back up their stories when a journalist actually bothers to respond to their rants. Waste of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOSullivanIR @Jesuispaddy @colettebrowne Hardly in the same category as a big expose, is it - as you have basically said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOSullivanIR @Jesuispaddy @colettebrowne No, it's her job to contact a journalist if she has a story. You don't seriously expect journalists to cold-call random nurses asking them to turn whistle-blower? That would be grossly unethical (and borderline criminal harassment).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOSullivanIR @Jesuispaddy @colettebrowne Well there's your answer. Stop blaming the journalists for not reporting stories they can't prove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne You know what really is putting lives at risk? 4km-diameter petrie-dishes we're all allowed walk around in. People with gardens don't need to clog up the footpaths every day. Trips to the shops are essential (until we have more delivery vans) but exercise can be done at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne People who buy two loaves of bread are accused of "stockpiling" but if they shop twice in the one week they're attacked too. (BTW I am avoiding the shops as much as possible and would live off garden veg and tinned food if I didn't have to shop for my elderly mother).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOSullivanIR @medazamedia @colettebrowne Will your nurse friend speak to a journalist on the record? That's unfortunately the only way a journalist will be able to cover the story (unless we wait for an Inquiry...).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesuispaddy @MarkOSullivanIR @colettebrowne Anyway, ask your nurse friend to DM me (or any other journalist) if she wants to talk and is willing to have her name published. Otherwise, we can't help you - and it's not our fault: blame the nervous lawyers who are not properly trained in defamation law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesuispaddy @MarkOSullivanIR @colettebrowne If she will talk to a journalist - on the record - she'll get plenty of publicity. We all get stories like this, then the person asks us to "keep my name out of it". Evidence shared in confidence with the editor used to be enough, but newspapers are now run by timid lawyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomScharfNcl I suspect a lot of the virtue-signalling, volunteering, donating food and #Airbnb homes to the heroes etc, is at least partly an attempt to gain some advantage in the new Communist Utilitarian Triage system: maybe docs will save a benefactor before a miser (or indeed pauper).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomScharfNcl The only way elderly people were able to protect themselves from ageism in the triage system was to have private health insurance. Now that has been replaced by Communist utilitarian ethics (survival of the most useful to the State).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christineh5559 Airports too.

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Total lockdown (until the virus has nowhere to go) would be better. This business of letting people ramble around a 4km-diameter petrie dish is just prolonging the life of the virus. It helps no one (except people who have shares in testing kits).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@and_tumble @rocheburn @MaryoNe56094690 Unfortunately can't check this out due to lockdown, so I only have online resources (in this case a report in LifeSite News, which tends to use 2nd-hand info).

<|startoftext|>Life is too short to waste arguing with #COVIDIOTS (or idiots of any category). Anyone who says #COVID19 is a hoax, or who advocates "here immunity", or who doesn't care about the risk of passing it to elderly / sick people, or who blames it on 5g... Will be blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelipeMurrelli @DeborahCurran I think we are talking at cross purposes here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christendom_IE @Niall_Boylan I sincerely hope it's not true. I read it in a publication called Life Site News today. They seem to get most of their info second-hand and use pieces written by unpaid contributors. Similar to Gript only published in America.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan The big worry for me is that the vaccine could have been tested on aborted foetuses. I cannot in conscience turn myself into the equivalent of a cannibal - even to save my own life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rocheburn @MaryoNe56094690 I would rather self-isolate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Stick a wig to it and it'll look like a beard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForGodAndKing @KeithMillsD7 It's the opposite here in Ireland. I have evidence of at least one Covid19 death not registered as Covid19 (the family don't want to go public), and anecdotal evidence of many others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seansnooze @Niall_Boylan What makes you think they would socialise in the middle of nowhere if they wouldn't socialise in Dublin? From what they said, it is clear they go to these remote places to relax in peace, not to mingle with the locals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are any of the people in Tipperary, Kildare, Limerick, Meath and neighbouring counties blaming the horse-trainers for spreading #COVID19 - or just visitors Dublin? (Personally I would blame both groups)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@griptmedia I hate sport and group activities. Always did. This crisis is uniting all the introverts in a weird way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seansnooze @Niall_Boylan The essential workers, unfortunately, are spreading the virus to nursing homes and accommodation. If everyone just worked close to home (ess8or not) there'd be less of the virus spreading in the first place - and less demand for health care workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seansnooze @Niall_Boylan Some of these people are retired couples who spend the summer in their holiday homes. They are safer cocooning there instead of overpopulated housing estates in Dublin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FabioCossu2 @offendedbyme @irishpatriot201 Lire apparently. Don't expect me to give you names and addresses of the people doing it; even if I knew, I wouldn't rat on them. The old lire are being used as vouchers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@altforire @Petra_C @morningireland Yes. There was a good item about it on @morningireland this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@careyjonny2 @ReginaDo Yes. Doesn't mean it would not work. The problem with the experiment is that (I think) they chose volunteers. Chances of dossiers rather than entrepreneurs applying for it would have been higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectricIreland OK, thanks for your response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Banning Dubs from going to holiday homes is fine - but what about country people in Dublin to work? Will they be told to go home too? @Niall_Boylan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Some experts claim too much ferritin makes people susceptible. Men (and women past menopause) generally have more of it. This may also explain why Africans are not as affected (anaemia).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shevaunne @FergalBowers @morningireland I still would not trust a random caller. I would want to hear it from my GP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmVR46 @BibiBaskin I wear a mask and gloves, and wait in the car until there's no one on the path.

<|startoftext|>@SrTz7Yo3O6SqGpq @NewstalkFM If you want to be a successful (State-funded) "artist" in Ireland, you need to attack the Catholic Church and promote the rainbow agenda (LGBT-alphabetti spaghetti, drag queen storytime, anything-but-Catholic multiculturalism, echo-fascism).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bapajo3 @ReginaDo It would depend on the genuinely poor spending all their income (as they already do) and others spending / investing. It's not perfect but the present system actively discouragesthe investment of money and time in viable careers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers @morningireland Any legitimate message should tell you to contact your GP, surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningireland @aoifehegs Good interview just now. It is now very clear why elderly people are not showing up in the ICU figures. The State doesn't care about them. We now have a utilitarian triage system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Celtic_Films @NewstalkFM Yes, and it's always "art" - they wouldn't happen to patronise other businesses. Can't see them giving a grant to plumbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bapajo3 @ReginaDo Plus it would free up social welfare staff to deal with other payments above the basic (lone parents, sick people, exceptional need, etc).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bapajo3 @ReginaDo Well, some of it could come from money saved on bureaucracy. Staff are overworked just dealing with all the queries, changes in people's circumstances, means testing, etc, at the best of times. Also you'd save on legal fees for prosecuting people who claim and work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The simplest solution, and the least costly in terms of bureaucracy, would be for every country to give its citizens a living wage - forever, and regardless of earnings. It would stimulate the economy and be a safety net. #COVID19 @ReginaDo   https://t.co/zjVQqevD2t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibiBaskin As an introvert and an older woman, I understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibiBaskin Forgot about Come Dine. It is better than most foodie shows because it's more about the people. The only soaps I watch are Fair City and Eastenders, but my friend watches all of them; she is totally enjoying lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibiBaskin Are you ever going to return to TV work, Bibi? We need your vibrant presence on a morning show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmVR46 @BibiBaskin Same here. I am bomb-proof in an emergency but this #COVID19 is an invisible killer that wants to turn us all into weapons! I would never forgive myself if my mother picked up this virus, yet she keeps sending me to the shops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibiBaskin I love the (semi) isolation and an self-employed but unfortunately paid work has ground to a halt because most people will only meet in person - in an office! Ridiculous. I hope offices become a thing of the past after all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibiBaskin No sport on the TV is a bonus (can't stand it). Though there are still too many boring shows about home-decor, cookery, "celebs" etc. RTE should re-run old epidodes of Fair City and old soaps (Riordans, Glenroe).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arts Council got €1m last week from Minister Josepha Madigan. They're also heavily subsidised through grants. Net contribution to economy is a huge minus. Why don't they get sponsorship / make "art" that people want to buy? Other self-employed people get nothing. @NewstalkFM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Business idea for anyone who has access to a 3d printer: celebrity masks to wear to the shops. Preferably easy to wash with soap and water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nkulu_sync *hang onto*  their dignity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nkulu_sync There is definitely a market for masks that look like faces or even beards. Just so people can hand into their dignity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nkulu_sync You need to keep it on until you wash your hands. If you remove it, you'll contaminate the mask (and your face, and possibly your hair and add anything the mask touches in your car).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @jerosullivanRK @radiokerrynews Not going to happen; Drew Harris says they have to stay in their holiday homes if they are there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElectricIreland To clarify, we are fully aware that it is a marketing technique designed to "soften" people up for a future price-hike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectricIreland I know. My mother also knows - but it just caused her to worry that a price-hike might be on the way because your literature mentioned this "average" which is so much higher than her annual bill. I get that it's a marketing letter - just not a very nice one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redneek24 @ElectricIreland No, it's not - and I didn't say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colin_mcfarlane @ozm A lot of what passes for formal education is just designed to provide more jobs for teachers. That's why there's so much group work and the need to physically be in a building at set times. Groupwork should be a separate subject (and optional for courses where it's unnecessary).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads @ElectricIreland No, it's just a promo letter. But the wording is a marketing gimmick to convince people their bill is lower than average. Very low (and old) trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like Mardi Gras for birds today. Whistling &amp; screeching, literally dancing up the trees as they carry twigs to their nests, and engaging in the most romantic courtship rituals - including a (literally) thieving magpie using my freshly planted beans as love tokens. @BirdWatchIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azure_octopus @ozm Possibly, but it is unfair to introverts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>gasping for air. Think about the doctors and nurses who put their own lives at risk trying to save them. And if you said "Sure those people who died  were old", shame on you - you absolute psychopath. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an idea for the #COVIDIOTS who are planning to stay in holiday homes or going for unnecessary trips to parks and beaches etc, or who flew home and failed to self-quarantine: keep an eye of the death notices in the coming weeks,  and think about those people who died alone,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But this kind of cynical, gaslighting marketing tactic is especially low at this time, and especially when the targets include elderly people who are feeling very vulnerable at present. @Niall_Boylan @rteliveline @AgeAction @ALONE_IRELAND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is annoying at the best of times, for anyone (who honestly gives a flying f*ck what other people pay? They could have a large family / huge house etc and use more electricity).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @ElectricIreland intimidating cocooned elderly people? My mother has just received a letter informing her that the "average" annual bill is €993.45. She immediately thought "nearly a grand!" Will they please just send her the actual bill and not mention "average" bills?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_ThePatriot And the vectors can walk, cycle and even jog around their own communities. And they can volunteer to "help" (spread the virus to) cocooned elderly people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamlovell4 I sincerely hope the scum get Covid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 @TonightVMTV It's on this video (with my comments).  https://t.co/SyaieTRo4C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar But vectors are still allowed walk freely around their own communities and volunteer to "help" cocooned elderly people? Ireland is now full of interlocking 4km-diameter petrie-dishes. Full lockdown (or car travel only) would be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodMornWD @TonightVMTV The clip is on this along with my comments  https://t.co/SyaieTRo4C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodMornWD @TonightVMTV Dr Chris Luke went further than this. He said ER docs should prioritise the "young and productive".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTE_PrimeTime @SimonHarrisTD @MiriamOCal The garda need to clear the joggers and kids on scooters off the footpaths. Also scum gathering in parks and walking around their 4km-diameter petri-dishe neighbourhoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 @TonightVMTV Yes. That graph reveals the stark, dystopian truth. What a horrible, psychopathic health system we have. Also listen to Dr Chris Luke's vile comments on RTE Weekend On One (2.5 weeks ago; I played them on my YouTube vlog).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodMornWD @TonightVMTV And the only way an old person could avoid being discriminated against like this was to have private health insurance; as a paying customer, your life was valuable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodMornWD @TonightVMTV Horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodMornWD @TonightVMTV Sadly true. And even the elders who are "cocooned" will be endangered thanks to "Community On Call" (encouraging young volunteers to visit them - they will take the virus from the community straight into the homes of the most vulnerable).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rare to see articulate guests (Sam McConkey and Michael O'Keefe) who actually have something to add to a debate on @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it wasn't for the loss of income / prospects to earn (same thing if you're self-employed) and inability to claim either dole or Covid19 payment (not unemployed but not earning at present) I'd enjoy #lockdown because it's great to take a break from people @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ozm Online education should be an option for everyone. Plenty of introverts are underachievers because they hate group projects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public money wasted on "arse &amp; culcher" and sports should be diverted to fund the health system. Josepha Madigan gave €1 million of public money to "artists" last week and sports injuries are clogging up A&amp;Es. @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skearon And compensation for breaking a contract. Some people paid insurance (and levies for the public sponges) for decades. Others took out insurance in the expectation that they'd be insured for decades ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dublin_Daithi Even if VHI, Laya etc refund it, they'll owe a lot more in compensation to customers who paid it for years in the expectation that they were going to be covered for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm concerned that a single-tier health system will enable the triage system to discriminate against elderly people who have contributed to the public health system their whole lives through levy on VHI @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reverleo1 @DLooby1977 Sick of the ageism. Elderly people are being written off as if their lives are not important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taoiseach_x Well, missing school won't do any harm to their standard of education; they couldn't possibly be less literate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneBeattyNews At this stage the only way to keep the Covidiots in is to impose total lockdown. At present the country is full of interlocking petri-dishes, each one 4km in diameter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Banking fees were taken from my @AskAIB account even though it was above the threshold (may not be by the end of the month but surely they can't take fees pre-emptively!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byrne_padraig @DLooby1977 @Wexford_People Rip. Thought lovely Wexford might escape this. My mother is from the town and remembers the Cadogan name, though she didn't know this lady. Our hearts go out to her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macgabhann31 Both, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @rtenews This will have repercussions for the #MeToo movement and Ireland's Redress system. Hopefully we'll return to the "guilty until proven innocent" model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @rtenews Cardinal Pell can sue RTE and the original source of the report for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @rtenews Does RTE employ any actual journalists at all? All their reports are press statements or items taken from other stations. Even the Covid19 reports are just statements. Whenever an RTE reporter asks questions, they accept the first answer they get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiaRogue2 I indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_F_Kelleher @gardainfo They can use Public Order legislation - as I already pointed out. These Covidiots are well within the criteria for prosecution on Public Order grounds, disturbing the peace, threatening and abusive behaviour, etc. People are brought before district judges every week for less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelipeMurrelli @KieranAH @MillieByrne12 The ignorance of these people is staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @gardainfo I went to the shops for my mother yesterday and had to stay in my car until the footpath was clear (joggers, kids on scooters, etc).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @gardainfo Lucky you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryTraynor21 Just attention, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @gardainfo And another two words to the #COVIDIOTS - the first one beginning with F.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @gardainfo At the risk of stirring up another hornet's nest of #COVIDIOTS I will just say two words: Social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macgabhann31 Yes. And in fairness I'm not the only person they're pestering with their nutty theories. They are trawling Twitter and Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiaRogue2 That's what I'm trying to do, but they keep popping up. It's like Whack-A-Mole. (Whack-a-Wacko)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryTraynor21 It's getting tedious. It was entertaining at first but they all sound the same. I think it's just one person under different names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phylmurphy Sorry if I sounded flippant. Poor little kids. And this will go on longer because of all the idiots gathering in parks and jogging on footpaths etc. We may never be free of this awful virus at this rate, unless the Gardai get tough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don't the @gardainfo charge the #COVIDIOTS with Public Order offences? Arrest all the gobshites who are gathering in parks, on beaches, and up Killiney Hill. And object to bail on the grounds that they are a threat to public safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phylmurphy Skype? Zoom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loonies working overtime. They sit up all night discussing me with their imaginary friends - on Twitter. I woke up to find hundreds of notifications from random Twits who are clearly obsessed with me, and very unhappy I refuse to take them seriously. Get a life, creeps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville Get a life and stop wasting your time copying fake stories off silly amateur websites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville Ah, I think I see where you are going with this: the rows of coffins in the churches shown on TV. Those were the coffins used for transporting bodies to the crematorium. The Italians respect the dignity of the deceased even in such difficult circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville BTW, I think it is a bit insensitive to be constantly repeating these grisly details. The families are grieving. Bad enough that they were deprived of the chance to be with their loved ones as they were dying, but it is heartbreaking to not even have a proper funeral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville Yes. I think everyone knows that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying for @BorisJohnson and his loved ones. Can't imagine what they're going through now. We all owe it to Boris and others in ICUs around the world to #StayHome as, much as possible, to wipe this vile #COVID19 off the face of earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville They are actually damaging the valid case against 5g. It is apparently dangerous (I wrote about this in this month's Culture Wars magazine and quoted scientific papers, interviewed people, etc). But it is not going to fry us all instantly, and it's nothing to do with covid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanyKeville Even faked the many pages of death notices in Italian newspapers, and hired actors to impersonate the families and undertakers, priests, doctors, nurses... Absolutely mindblowing to see the mental gymnastics of these conspiracy crackpots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobinMairead @DrOKennedy That system would destroy the GP-patient relationship. Or even the GP-HSE relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lamboz84 I used to call the obelisk that too. When I was a little girl I genuinely believed a real witch lived there. We used to walk around it clockwise 100 times to "break the spell and shame the devil".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macgabhann31 Unfortunately I have been reading it for the past week. These crackpots are all over Twitter. I try to keep an open mind but their theories are so implausible as to insult the intelligence of a gnat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KieranAH @MillieByrne12 @FelipeMurrelli Seriously, life is too short for this rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DANGlobalSafety Thanks. Actually when you read the document it makes, it clear that they can be adapted (with very strict conditions of course). Good to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever wondered why nutters posting #covid19 crackpot theories generally use fake names and photos? I reckon there is only a few of them, and when you block them they pop up again with a different name. At least, I hope I'm right; otherwise they're more plentiful than I thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGfree I don't know what that is supposed to prove. Wasted a few seconds of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TritonDivingIrl @macgabhann31 Could scuba equipment be used to help people with #covid19 breathe? Random idea but worth a shot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darcy_IB Even if he didn't have kids - even if he was a grumpy hermit - no one should be wishing he was dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChitkwesuManetu Social-distancing ducks! Wow, they are usually such gregarious, boisterous birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazgallin Another "professor".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillieByrne12 @FelipeMurrelli No flu has ever killed so many. There are many strains of flu and even collectively they don't have such a devastating effect all over the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillieByrne12 Just read what I wrote, then read what the loonies are using as "evidence". End of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 OK, so you are just some twisted troll getting your kicks out of making up conspiracy theories around the very real grief of real families. Blocking you. Life is too short to communicate with nutjobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazgallin No, it's up to you to prove what your are saying. Do your own research (hint: research does not mean Googling).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 Who are you, anyway? Why don't you use your real name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 Obvs the "scenes from TV shows" are used to simulate what happenee in these tragic cases. You hardly expect the media to show actual people dying on TV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 I also strongly doubt you are who you say you are. Certainly not a professor, judging by the standard of literacy in your Twitter profile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 That could be just some random prankster on Twitter. Have you verified whose behind that Twitter account?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazgallin Where are these families? If they will go on record, newspapers will definitely publish their story because the newspapers are very cosy with the HSE - who want to show they are "flattening the curve" . I've heard the direct opposite but that doesn't fit the official narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazgallin @TonightVMTV @IvanYatesNT @ClaireByrneLive @ALONE_IRELAND @Valacox @AgeAction It is used by the Government here in Ireland. Grossly patronising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazgallin @TonightVMTV @IvanYatesNT @ClaireByrneLive @ALONE_IRELAND @Valacox @AgeAction Unfortunately it is the official word used for their new situation. My mother hates it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillieByrne12 @FelipeMurrelli None of these diseases seems to have killed as many people as Covid19. It has killed a lot of people for one virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda777xxx3 So there is one hoax which wasn't checked out because newspapers no longer do the usual checks (ring the undertaker etc)? What about the tens of thousands of other deaths? I personally know some of the relatives in Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lamboz84 I live not too far from that area and have heard of people who live further away going there for a walk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadey68 @FergalBowers BTW, Sharon, your Twitter profile name says it all. We truly do live in a land of gobshites - they are on Twitter and Facebook every night, reciting David Icke's entire back-catalogue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadey68 @FergalBowers I don't know any corrupt Gardai, only decent ones trying to save lives in an emergency. They absolutely should ask people where they are going in this case. Anyone who refuses to answer either has something to hide or is just being obnoxious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelly_justkel @jamesdeens And surely the mainstream media were actually claiming those were the actual patients? It would be unthinkable, and borderline psychopathic, to show dying people on TV when their families might be watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelly_justkel @jamesdeens Well, they could hardly use footage of the real patients. It would be a gross breach of patient confidentiality and basic decency. But such an obvious, rational explanation would not occur to loony conspiracy theorists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Thought you were casting doubt. I know people like that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockdown will be extended because idiots are rambling around their villages. The 2km petrie dishes are clearly intended to spread the virus to cocooned elderly people through volunteers etc. @TonightVMTV @IvanYatesNT @ClaireByrneLive @ALONE_IRELAND @Valacox @AgeAction #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question for the conspiracy theorists who are claiming that the corpses of #covid19 patients shown on TV are actually shop mannequins: where are the people whose funerals were held? Shouldn't someone tell their families they're still alive &amp; they only cremated a dummy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/40UsIbUkty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogabhan @fionamflanagan1 Tonnes of info online (including my article in this month's Culture Wars, for which I interviewed actual experts). These amateur "citizen journalists" are doing a lot of damage to the case against 5g with their bonkers claims based on watching too many David Icke videos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Don't know why you find it funny. These Council houses, maisonettes and apartments are literally within a five-min walk of the pedestrian entrance off Killiney Hill Road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amomcnally What bugs me about these people is that the still read the loathsome newspapers, copy the info (gathered over weeks, sometimes years), post it online - then, from the comfort of their homes, armed with nothing better than WiFi, accuse the journalists of "not doing their job".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife Even if she is immune, she could be a vector. We don't know enough about this virus yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Have to laugh at all the snobs pretending to live near it. My own neighbourhood is by no means posh, and there are plenty of low socio-economic housing estates within a five-minute walk of the hill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Yes, and the foliage is so dense, it's difficult to go up the hill without using the paths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blahmushyblah @alan_caulfield Yes. I wrote about it for the local paper. Management booted me out for interviewing the disgruntled locals in the lounge. It was turned into flats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wickedfairysad @blahmushyblah @alan_caulfield It was lovely to sit in the lounge looking at Dalkey Island. Always a nice place to meet up. My mother's friend used to go to line-dancing classes there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic My mother is using this as an excuse to guilt-trip me into going to the shops for random stuff (a head of cabbage, a sack of potatoes). . "Go to the shops for me or I'll just ask those nice guards!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gardainfo Amazing how densely populated all our wildernesses are. Huge crowds of ignorant louts, all driving the 2km distance to their "local" park, all with little Covid19-festering vectors in tow. None of them having a garden in which to get some fresh air!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Funnily enough, I actually do live within 2km of Killiney Hill (less as the crow flies) - but I am avoiding the place because it is now a festering petrie-dish of Covid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faircityfans Best way to keep filming Fair City is to do another hostage storyline. Ciaran could come back and, this time, lock everyone up in individual sheds? Maybe borrow Marty and Claire's shed? Or let young Ellie hold another one of her watch parties? @martymorrissey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads @FergalBowers Yet they can go for a jog in the park, or up (crowded) Killiney Hill where the chance of bumping into hundreds of neighbours is many times more likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky Not any more! The whole of Ireland lives there now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smackovsky They are self-loathing nihilist at heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dalkey and Killiney must be the biggest neighbourhood in the country - Twitter is full of people all over the Dublin suburbs and beyond, boasting that it's within 2km of the home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blahmushyblah @alan_caulfield Dalkey Island Hotel closed in 1990.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers Mixed messages from the (acting) government: forbidding long drives while turning villages into petrie-dishes. Surely a person driving alone in a car is less likely to spread the virus than an entire neighbourhood mingling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reverleo1 God help him if that is true (which I doubt). He will pick up the virus if he is there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some real wackos on Twitter tonight. Just came across a load of them claiming the poor dying #covid19 patients in Italy are mannequins. What is wrong with these people?

<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese The reckless fools to whom I am referring are people - including some priests - who are gambling with God-given, precious lives. Their own and others'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese It is anti-Christian to casually throw away your life (please don't insult the great martyrs by equating their noble sacrifice with the arrogance of a reckless fool) and to endanger the lives of others - by spreading a deadly, highly virulent disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panzermatt @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese Respect to you for that. And I can see your comment was made with good intentions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panzermatt @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese Their vocation to pick up a deadly virus and spread it in the community, where it will kill many vulnerable people? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanKelly33 @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese Beside the point. Young people get the virus too and, while only a few get really ill with it, the young people are vectors. Until this virus has died out, we all need to keep away from other people as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panzermatt @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese What's this? Bully My  https://t.co/oiu7PWysmB?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petra_C @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese My mother and were horrified to see a packed funeral in our church this week (we attended Mass online). They went very close to the priests, who were put in an awful position, especially as they have an over-70 colleague at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese Admirable as that elderly priest was, the unfortunate effect of his action is to reinforce the anti-Christian idea that some lives are worth less than others, that the young and strong should take priority over the weak and old. That's the stark utilitarian ethics of Communismm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads @fionamflanagan1 @aquinn292 Yeah - far out, man!

<|startoftext|>@AodhBC There is an actual weapon called the Peacemaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @aquinn292 I am getting a bizarre mental picture of the moments before the Big Switch-On: loads of loonies running around, wearing actual tinfoil hats, shrieking "We're all gonna fry!" Like a Monty Python sketch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @aquinn292 I doubt they will literally fry four million people on the spot.

<|startoftext|>*test* kits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wise of @alankellylabour not to let the Irish Labour Party be used as a mudguard for the bigger parties. Even before #covid19 burst onto the scene, we were heading for those "interesting times", as I explain in this piece (written shortly after the general election).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just want to say thanks to @VodafoneIreland for sorting this out. My mother is keeping you all in her prayers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aquinn292 @fionamflanagan1 My point is that it is not some big secret, and the Coronavirus was not unleashed on the whole fecking world to cover it up. Ridiculous theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aquinn292 @fionamflanagan1 Well, the effects on health won't be seen for years. It is horrible that this is been forced on us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sign of the shed - because it's in @rte, isn't it, @MartyMorrisey? Love the picnic table. See inside: Marty Morrissey's beautiful Clare home  https://t.co/9kuLtjpNkM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogabhan @fionamflanagan1 People are well aware of the horror stories about 5g. They still choose to ignore the risk. Linking it with the #covid19 virus only gives these people an excuse to laugh at anyone who objects to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogabhan @fionamflanagan1 This is damaging the genuine case against 5g.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 This has to be one of the more tenuous conspiracy theories. #5g was widely publicised and the infrastructure installed in plain sight, outside virtually every house in the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misteil @DavQuinn @DublinDiocese Excellent idea. Doctors in Italy has to stand back and use their phones to help these people record messages for their loved ones. Heartbreaking but necessary to prevent more deaths. And it's in keeping with Christianity, given that suicide is a sin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 I am no fan of 5g but it was rolled out long before the Covid19 outbreak and the cables, boxes etc were installed in full view of residents everywhere. Also it was heavily advertised (eg, last year's ad on TV re Arranmor Island off Donegal) and most people are asking for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 On every street. The technicians installed them outside virtually every house in the suburbs of Dublin and (AFAIK) every other suburb in the country last summer. I remember it well because one of the lads helped me fix the roof of my car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VodafoneIreland Thanks Baher. I have sent you a DM.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeTalksBack @rtenews @AgeAction @Valacox @TonightVMTV @ALONE_IRELAND Exactly. When I mentioned the comments made by an Irish doctor re triage to an Italian friend of mine (who is a doctor), he immediately said it sounded like the Nazis would have said.

<|startoftext|>@MaryThorn85 @rtenews @AgeAction @Valacox @TonightVMTV @ALONE_IRELAND I did a vlog on Covid19 and triage on YouTube and Bitchute. In it, I played a clip from RTE radio that will chill anyone with a conscience. Absolutely loathsome comments by an Irish doctor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG, just saw the volunteers on @rtenews and they were NOT sticking to the social distancing rules!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks like this Govt and its (un) Civil Service is trying to cull the elderly.

<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @Deborah89010925 @RTEOne Ah no; he's a married man. Though nothing would surprise us now. Hope he's not going to do a Paul Schofield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalOverLord66 @RTEOne QUESTION for the ladies here: if you were going to be in isolation with someone, in a shed, would you pick Marty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sooty_sous @MetalOverLord66 @RTEOne Maybe it's the vacant #FairCity set? It looks like the shed where psycho Ciaran locked up Katy for a year! @faircityfans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sooty_sous @RTEOne Amazing. Our shed is full of old bikes, a lawnmower, rusty tools and a colony of spiders. And very noisy thanks to magpies running across the roof and a cheeky squirrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deborah89010925 @RTEOne Yes. Exactly the same! Maybe it's one of those virtual backgrounds you can use on Zoom. Though, if so, you'd think they'd go for something more photogenic - like Bryan Dobson's posh dining room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney Apparently he is here to make a film. If he's in a hotel with no grounds to walk in, surely the film company can provide him with a treadmill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @DavQuinn Those who actually stayed there were fine. They appeared on various TV programmes, Skyping from their apartments. The ones who left probably picked up the virus at the airports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @RTEOne Something like that, probably. Maybe they get the shed on expenses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 Maybe it makes them even weaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 My point exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 The other substance is used in anti-malaria drugs so probably not the best as it has terrible side-effects - though if you had to make a snap-decision in an emergency you would of course agree to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 Depends on whether the "immunomodulators" modulate the immune system to boost or decrease immunity, or indeed to modify it in some way that does not boost or lower it. It really means nothing unless you give details.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 Anti-inflammatory drugs were mentioned on a radio news item this morning. Possibly containing the ingredients you mentioned, though they did say "new" so maybe they meant they had found some new substance / chemical make-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorkCoypu @OpinionLine96 @Niall_Boylan Shh - she doesn't want anyone to know her age! Complaining about the word "cocooning" too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 Waste of resources which should be put into ventilators and anti-inflammatories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorkCoypu @OpinionLine96 My Mam is enjoying "cocooning" too. She has me as her live-in helper, ordering stuff online. Also keeping in touch with her friends by phone, attending online Mass and ringing up radio shows including her favourite - @Niall_Boylan - this is her birthday too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cncpinky @TodaySOR Swine Flu can include diarrhoea and projectile vomiting too. Starts with nausea, followed by raging fever, exhaustion, then a terrible cough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cncpinky @TodaySOR If it is any help, the Swine Flu symptoms are identical to Covid19. Though obvs there is a vaccine now for Swine Flu and it doesn't seem to last as long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balancetothe4z @danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 And there is no benefit of a negative result - quite the opposite if it gives a false sense of security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OCathin @RTEOne Poor @rtenews presenters, reduced to living in sheds! Not even a kitchen table to work from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie @John_F_Kelleher Maybe this will free up staff to save lives instead of doing pointless research. People who test negative could pick up the virus moments later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Easy: Wuhan has a lot of foreigners from the West - who would be less scrupulous about hygiene than the Chinese. Ignorant people whose first reaction was to leave before the Lockdown. They go home and spread the viris to their own communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute tool! Surely Hollywood star #mattdamon has a decent-sized garden to do his exercise in. Leave the public spaces for people living in flats to go for a walk - the last thing they need is heavy-breathing joggers passing them on the narrow footpaths.  https://t.co/ZRoHm4p32a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 *moments*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielmgmoylan @Glenn2487 It's a gross waste of resources in an emergency. Tests cannot be accurate enough with such a new virus, and anyone who tests negative could pick up the virus moment's later - possibly even during testing as the HSE is not renowned for hygiene or care. #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgeAction @ALONE_IRELAND @Valacox @ThirdAgeIreland @RonanMullen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re clinical trials for #COVID19ireland treatment, including experimental drugs: rather than waste time asking for consent from sick people / their families (who might refuse for any reason), we need a national survey NOW, so people can give consent while they are able. #COVIDー19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re clinical trials: family GP should be asked, not next-of-kin who might  tell hospital to withhold treatment. Elderly people are particularly at risk of this if they have heirs.

<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray @DavQuinn No. I got this confirmed by an official source (who unfortunately wants not to be ID'd in the paper). Also others confirmed it incl family members. The man picked it up in hospital. Family is in isolation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Yes. I have a story, with evidence which would stand up in court, about a man whose death was not recorded as Covid19.

<|startoftext|>@francismccloy We can trace the outbreak of #COVID19ireland back to 21st-23rd Feb when the vectors returned from the mid-term break.

<|startoftext|>@Fionn_Una @griptmedia @MasseyN9 Here's an idea: start your own media. I am serious. The "media" no longer exists as a serious business, journalists have been replaced by data-entry clerks who cut+paste stuff off Twitter and quote press releases, and even the analysis columnists are people with vested interests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fionn_Una @griptmedia @MasseyN9 It would be irresponsible of the media to minimise the huge difference between common flu and a brand-new, many-times-more-contagious, more physically destructive virus. But there should certainly be more coverage if 5g etc (I have pitched articles about these issues in vain).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @DavQuinn And I am determined not to pick up or spread this virus. I had Swine flu once and it was exactly the way people describe Covid19, but not as long-lasting (just a week - Hell Week).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @DavQuinn The fact that this man's death was not reported as a coronavirusdeath is very disturbing. I wonder how many deaths from this there actually are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackcoffeecup I feel bad about the fact that I contacted the man's daughter. The papers wanted the family to go on the record. But there was no need: it's not about this unfortunate family: it's about the HSE, doing what they did in the Cervical Check saga: cover-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackcoffeecup I have enough evidence for it to stand up in court if need be.

<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 The State's totalitarian motives are transparent now: it's not about halting the spread of the virus, it's not about arresting people who are reckless with the lives of the most vulnerable; it's about controlling innocent citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 And at the same time the State is letting people fly into the country and leave the airport without any quarantine in place. Best practice is to follow the example of the experts - the real experts in South Korea, Singapore and of course Wuhan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@angelo_bottone @AltPost Not surprised. #DublinAirport didn't even stop the flights when it was clear that the virus could have been prevented from spreading. They are still "just following orders".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DVATW Or indeed the #Irish Famine. I am Irish and have no problem whatsoever with people using that term. And none of the Chinese people I know object to this virus being called the Wuhan Flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More obstinate arrogance from #DublinAirport on the very real threat from #Coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DublinAirport @rtenews @VirginMediaNews @hpscireland @WHO @ECDC_EU And to reiterate my point: you should use common sense - and a sense of human decency, both ofv which our Government lacks. You are "just following orders" - but you shouldn't, if it costs human lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC @rte It's perfect. My mother will be delighted because it gives her just enough time to watch Mass online in St Anne's Church Shankill at 10 and then switch on the telly. I find it comforting too. Thanks @rte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an idea @declanganley - business opportunity and protest in one. I have friends who fly out of small airfields. They can make this happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to boycott @DublinAirport. Who can trust them when they reply to legitimate concerns with such arrogance and gross idiocy? Support small airfields. Set up groups to fund them. #Coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryBaggins @DublinAirport @rtenews @VirginMediaNews @hpscireland @WHO @ECDC_EU Look at the moronic reply I got from Dublin Airport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DublinAirport @rtenews @VirginMediaNews @hpscireland @WHO @ECDC_EU I did not say "screen passengers". Screening is unreliable (remember Cervical Check?). The only failsafe measure is quarantine. Listen to the experts in Singapore, South Korea and Japan - not the idiots advising the Irish government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DublinAirport @rtenews @VirginMediaNews @hpscireland @WHO @ECDC_EU Experts disagree. Intelligent, conscientious leaders use common sense. #DublinAirport should have taken the opportunity to save lives. Stop the flights.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good to see. #Coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews had an item just now about people dancing, doing aerobics and swinging their arms around in the middle of a narrow alleyway between little terraced houses.

<|startoftext|>@careyjonny2 @lidl_ireland Unfortunately yes. I am trying to keep her in but she is used to her daily routine: Mass, coffee with friends (not possible at the moment thanks to #Coronavirus risk) and a browse around the shops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gombeenisland @Astraea1974 It was cringeworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the strangest effects of #Coronavirus is the way it affects introverts. I was just counting my blessings, thinking of all the people I no longer have to interact with, and feeling self-sufficient. Than last night I dreamt I was snogging a hunky guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage @NewstalkFM @Niall_Boylan @rtenews @Independent_ie Yes, and will probably be sent to hospital - where they'll definitely pick it up, along with other diseases. And be a guinea-pig for drug trials.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @ForGodAndKing Leo's gaslighting and mindfuckery are appalling.

<|startoftext|>@MarkCork50 @Eadaoin_T Ah now, that's too close to reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eadaoin_T They said on radio that the food comp refused to accept payment. Anyone who thinks doctors and nurses need charity right now is deluded. They won't be unemployed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulusTrivinium @realDaveReilly @MaryThorn85 And stay in touch with people. Watch each other's backs. If anyone is taken to hospital, share location and details of next of kin / friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can choose to see #Coronavirus as an invisible wolf, running wild in our midst, able to devour any of us at any moment - or as evil itself, which can be defeated by goodness, by love and respect for each other, by the Christian ethics which prioritise the vulnerable. #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulusTrivinium @realDaveReilly @MaryThorn85 This is a puzzle we may be able to solve if we keep sharing information like this. We are still able to use our brains, unlike the fools who trust the vested interests who control the health services and governments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalachySteenson @TonightVMTV @frjoemcdonald They are protecting the most vulnerable by avoiding catching the virus, so it won't spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDaveReilly @MaryThorn85 Also I had a pain in my stomach from coughing, and a headache.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernardPG @EamonMelia When I was studying journalism in Rathmines College of Commerce, our lecturers told us to challenge and question authority. Government approval was regarded the kiss of death for a journalist's career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spare a thought for kids. Just a month ago they were proud members of Greta's Army, feared and loved. Now they're vermin. Adults squirm as they pass. There should be a horror movie about this: "The Vectors".  https://t.co/7ofyrAJms9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDaveReilly @MaryThorn85 I had all these symptoms five years ago. Later I found out it was Swine Flu. It came suddenly (nausea, projectile vomiting, diarrhoea, fever) vanished after 2 days, skipped a day, then came back for 2-3days, with exhaustion &amp; a dry cough so strong I thought my ribs would crack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It brings back memories of the St Patrick's Day parades in small Irish towns in the 80s: a procession of tractors, trucks and bin lorries.

<|startoftext|>@DrFrancisYoung Definitely. Hermits have more fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Testing for #COVID19 is pointless, unless everyone is quarantined. Moments after the test, a person could catch the virus - so the result is irrelevant!

<|startoftext|>@drwaheeduddin @seaplaneguy @WHO @UN I reckon #ExtinctionRebellion is part of the same agenda; it's founders are bankers and it's followers include speculators. Ditto immigration. Once the economy of the developed world is destroyed, they will make a fortune buying stocks cheaply. Like just after World War 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrFrancisYoung It's harder than ever to be a hermit (virtual or otherwise) with all the online clamour. The best tip is to log off, switch off the telly and phone, go for a walk (alone) and just enjoy the birdsong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we know the #COVID19ireland tests are accurate? Anyone remember Cervical Check? #Coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Or, I should say, Mwa-ha-haaa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican Ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskAIB Thanks, and AIB staff are always very helpful to the elderly, but my point is that a transaction could be made without the elderly person's knowledge. Can the bank please monitor all / random online accounts opened by people over the age of 70, just in case?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dungeon_Rooney @bankofireland @AskAIB @UlsterBank @VodafoneIreland @gardainfo In fairness, it would be impractical to phone every person every time they make a transaction. And the bank staff look after old people very well. But this is an unprecedented situation for vulnerable people, especially as they can't get out to go to the bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican BTW, I'm not saying that I don't believe it. But it just happens to be the plot of a Stephen King novel (Dr Sleep - great read).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TCM39599285 You can hear him actually saying it here (link attached to my LinkedIn comment). Sorry if my earlier reply came across as rude.  https://t.co/1FYIrLUfwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can be proud of our @gardainfo and @defenceforces - they give priority to the most vulnerable. Sadly, the medical profession no longer does.  https://t.co/1FYIrLUfwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knockcrock Sure some doctors don't care about the vulnerable. It's all about the "young and productive".  https://t.co/1FYIrLUfwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyne_sheryl Meanwhile, in #Ireland :  https://t.co/1FYIrLUfwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/1FYIrLUfwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People have asked me for the link to Dr Chris Luke's abhorrent comment in which he talks about prioritising the "young+productive" over the elderly. Here's the clip (listen to 0.14.50 - 0.17.04, comment is at 0.16.33).  https://t.co/OSmH4IEffI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the banks have fairly robust security in place, there needs to be more security at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With elderly people using online banking for the first time due to #Coronavirus can @bankofireland @AskAIB @UlsterBank @VodafoneIreland please put extra security in place before authorising transactions (call the person, talk to them - not a family member / friend). @gardainfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This explains the #prolife #Catholic perspective on #Coronavirus. In a nutshell: the most vulnerable are our priority. How should healthcare be distributed when hospitals are overwhelmed? -  https://t.co/9F4eyhTB8i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican It's quite plausible - but still it's wrong to make or repeat allegations without proof. It makes people distrust everything you say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican But how do you know? Maybe they got facwlifts. Or maybe they have good genes. Lots of people look younger than they are. My granny and aunt died in their late eighties, were not health-conscious and yet had no wrinkles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilgunnGerry @thejournal_ie @LeoVaradkar Some doctors are spending way too much time playing at being politicians, journalists and Twitter virtue-signallers / mutual virtual-masturbators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilgunnGerry @thejournal_ie Quick, tell Doctors @LeoVaradkar James Reilly and all the twits who spend the day congratulating each other on social media for their great jobs doing triage to get back to bloody work!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted You disgust me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rowanwcroft @JenniferMaguire It's the "unity" but that bothers me. They will use this to bring in Communism. Already, doctors are talking about triage to prioritise "young, productive people".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithMillsD7 Because it would harm innocent people including the brave Chinese citizens who tried to warn us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted And you call yourself a Christian. Jesus said Satan is the Prince of this world. Judaeo-Christian ethics are diametrically opposed to the "Natural Order".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted I would hope doctors would not make judgements like that. If they did, old people (anyobe above childbearing age) would be better off staying well clear of doctors. In fact, that's what my mother is saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican It's all over that image. What is "adrenochrome" (it sounds like a pseudoscientific word cobbled together from "adrenaline" and "chromatic" /"chromosomes" /"chronology").<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican The specific, outrageous allegations about these people using a treatment made by torturing children!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoOptOut How do you know that? I lived there for three years and have friends living there; from what I can see, it is a more civilised country with better living conditions than here. They do have a large elderly population but that is because people live longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VodafoneIreland Hi Jane, just sent you a DM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted Every life is equally precious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoOptOut They are communicating online and by phone. I know some of them personally (I used to live in Italy). Including one doctor I know there. They are telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VodafoneIreland is the one gigabyte limit on the dongle monthly? I ask because we have used 0.5 GB so far in the past few days. I gave my dongle to my elderly mother so she can watch Mass online. She'd be devastated if it got cut off, and I can't afford to pay more at the moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuffyEddie @SHughes_95 @DrHilaryJones They are paying for public beds. If they pull out of subsidising public hospitals the public health system will collapse. And the ordinary m, decent people who pay private insurance (20 a month - a fiver a week ) won't be able to afford it+ only the very rich willhave healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoOptOut So all those death notices in the Italian papers are fake? All the grieving families are actors?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted I have zero respect for the ones who say some lives are more valuable than others. Dr Harold Shipman went to prison but these people get to play God every day. Arrogant and psychopathic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted People are afraid to say anything to upset doctors and nurses in case they find themselves at their mercy. But being nice to them won't save your granny when the person on the next trolley is a 27-year-old mum of five who has a good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone was on radio saying he has set up a charity to supply free pizza to A+E staff. The fast food companies should spend the money on keeping their staff in jobs. The docs and nurses can afford to pay for their own food! #Coronavirusireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuffyEddie @SHughes_95 @DrHilaryJones But their clients subsidise the public beds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads @ClaireByrneLive She was wearing a full face of slap, had blow dried her hair and didn't even have the decency to cough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDisquieted Yes. It is unconscionable for doctors to play God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASE What they call "fact-checking" is just reverse data-entry. It is certainly not journalism, which involves years of building up a repository of sources, real investigation, and a long apprenticeship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This in stark contrast to statements by other doctors - including Chris Luke in Cork, Ireland - who said they would use triage to prioritise the "young productive people". Good to know some docs still believe that every life is equally precious. #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEvertBopp It's about money. Someone is making a fortune from testing kits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chewingonawasp @DrTobyGilbert @susmitchellSBP @HSELive @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney @LeoVaradkar @RTE_PrimeTime @Niall_Boylan And this attitude is destroying the trust old people had in the medical profession.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC Is it wrong to actually be grateful for this opportunity to avoid physical human contact? If it wasn't for the worry of vulnerable people getting sick, I would be, right now, living the dream: an introvert's paradise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan I would also be concerned that sick old people will be afraid to contact their GP now. Bad enough that the hospitals stinking cesspools of MRSA and lack of dignity - now it looks like it's pointless going there unless you're a 30-something mother of three with a good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan It is galling to think that every effort will be made to serve feckless morons who went to Cheltenham or held Coronavirus parties, while vulnerable, decent old people will be left to die. This is destroying people's trust in doctors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan The late Dr Harold Shipman would approve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely idea from @lidl_ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalCelt Yes put the ICA or the Men's Sheds in charge of the country. Better still, let Anna Mae McHugh of the @NPAIE run it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalCelt I should add (before she kills me) that she doesn't actually have a hearing aid, claims to have "perfect hearing!" and is fiercely resistent to any suggestion that she get a hearing test. She just wants one for "people who won't speak up on the Internet".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TV_Fauteuil @SimonHarrisTD It is so silly in the 21st century that people feel the need to spend precious time commuting when they could stay in touch with Skype, Zoho, LinkedIn, Facebook or indeed Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalCelt Older folk are the new nerds. I set up a livestream for my mother three days ago and already she's suggesting improvements; after I suggested getting an amp, she came up with the genius idea of attaching a hearing aid to the laptop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalCelt Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyronefield2 @Linda36758099 If it's any consolation, I read that too much immunity can actually trigger an extreme autoimmune reaction. There apparently needs to be a delicate balance. But all we can do is keep contact to a minimum, eat well and get rest, exercise etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@witchtwo @RobSimm80059648 @Linda36758099 @YorkshireLady3 You are on the mend if you are well enough to go on Twitter. Thanks for sharing your story - it will reassure a lot of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobSimm80059648 @witchtwo @Linda36758099 @YorkshireLady3 The symptoms sound like Swine Flu, which I once had for a week. Very severe case of it, thought I was going to burn up, also exhausted, and the cough was painful and reverberated all over my body. Plus diarrhoea, nausea, and (showstopper!) projectile vomiting. I isolated myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, we might have to explain to some elders that these tablets are not medication.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_real_DV @JewhadiTM @thehill Call me a cynic, but I am wondering if they know it will be affordable because there will be so many deaths. But in principle it's an excellent idea, both from a humanitarian and economic perspective.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CounsellorNLond @DrTobyGilbert Apparently he doesn't. They're afraid of being triaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemWrite The young can rely on triage in the emergency departments; the old will be left to die. That is the evil, psychopathic truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any chance @LeoVaradkar @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney and that fuckwit Chief Medical Officer will be triaged to the crematorium for having failed to take action to stop #coronavirus entering Ireland? We should have closed all ports a month ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTobyGilbert @susmitchellSBP @HSELive @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney @LeoVaradkar @RTE_PrimeTime @Niall_Boylan I hope you are at the wrong end of a triage decision yourself. Judging by your profile pic, you won't compete favourably against a 30-something mother of three.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTobyGilbert @susmitchellSBP @HSELive @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney @LeoVaradkar @RTE_PrimeTime @Niall_Boylan Here's an unpalatable fact for you: this has destroyed what little faith the people had in the medical profession.

<|startoftext|>@zohocares Hi, I sent you a private message. All OK, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all the advice on how to protect yourself from #coronavirus, no one seems to have mentioned this, so here goes: when you're washing your hands, wash the tap handle too so you won't re-infect yourself turning it off. Also wipe the door handle with an antiseptic wipe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Irish people are too gregarious. The Hse are even talking about setting up isolation centres in hotels (which will be the kiss of death for the hotel industry) where people will "isolate" - in groups! We should be self-isolating - alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfJohnCrown Shame on them. They should be quarantined in a big warehouse. Heartless fuckers will instead bring it home to infect the elderly and weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRBourne They could also be lying. A miraculously swift recovery from a deadly virus could do wonders for a politician's or celebrity's macho image.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What happens if you catch the new coronavirus?  https://t.co/ngzkGWLvnq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hapennyplace @DrUmarAlQadri They are at least preparing to stay indoors for a long time. Surely it's better than shopping every day and spreading the virus? Having said that, I haven't stockpiled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriotsIrish Prayers and thoughts with you. Would you mind sharing your location (nearest town) so people can avoid the area if practical?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@an_taibhse32 @PatriotsIrish Ha, you sound like some of the news editors I used to work for in my tabloid career. Not a bad idea, though - if he's up to it. He will be exhausted if it's anything like flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan On the other hand, the panic-buyers will (hopefully) stay indoors for a month once they've stocked up, instead of making daily trips to the shops, where they could spread the virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To show solidarity and cover the cost of social welfare for all the people who will lose work / be unable to find work as a result of #coronavirus, all elected representatives in every Parliament in the world should reduce salaries to minimum wage. @Niall_Boylan @TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michellecorry @FlangeFlanders @TCM39599285 @darascallyy I am sharing this now. What a horrible person - whoever they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellecorry @FlangeFlanders @TCM39599285 @darascallyy I understand. These bastards know  we all have vulnerable family members and friends, who might find themselves at their mercy. People are living in fear of upsetting the doctors they should be able to trust. Thank God my mother and I have a good and kind GP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan__Shatter But we have Comical Ali speaking for the HSE andSimple Simon running the health service. And a doctors talking on radio about triaging the elderly. Seriously, my 79-year-old mother is so angry, they had better keep these idiots in isolation for their own protection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellecorry @FlangeFlanders @TCM39599285 @darascallyy Like I said, I can't be sure it's the man. But anyone who knows for sure, and can stand over it if he sues: go ahead and share. We need to know who to avoid if we find ourselves in hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bejebus @olivercallan That's because the Chief Medical Officer is a comedian too: Dr Tony "Comical Ali" Holohan. And our Health Minister is Simple Simon. God help us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immdaly @olivercallan I think Oliver Callan is a comedian. But this time he's not funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellecorry @FlangeFlanders @TCM39599285 @darascallyy The only reason I won't post the name is that you can't be sure of anyone's identity on social media. It could be somebody pretending to be him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michellecorry @FlangeFlanders @TCM39599285 @darascallyy I will post his name if I can be sure of it. He is a dangerous psychopath if he has an attitude like that when lives are at stake. And he works in a hospital!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jonathankeane31 If anyone has to die from the Coronavirus, I hope it's the callous fuckers who use triage to prioritise the youth at the expense of the elderly. I would step over 100 of these psychopaths to save one old person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_Chemlinked @qualann @MaryLouMcDonald @LeoVaradkar Also this triage thing Dr Chris Luke mentioned on RTE radio has the elderly very frightened. My mother is nearly 80 and her life is just as important as anyone else's (more, as far as I am concerned). If she gets ill, the HSE will let her die before a strong young person!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MEneaney @rtenews Advice to elderly / low-paid / unemployed / chronically ill: Don't tell the HSE if you feel sick. At best,  they'll let you die. You would have a better chance of survival at home than on a trolley in a filthy hospital surrounded by psychopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichieA7 @gliondarcroi I was away on a work trip when I fell ill. Had to drive more than 150 miles home in snow and hailstorm, then quarantined myself. It knocked the stuffing out of me. Never felt so sick, even though I didn't get pneumonia. The fever was like being burned alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyne_sheryl @AnPostRS @AgeAction @IrexitFreedom @NationalPartyIE I set it up for my mother to receive her pension straight into her bank account, so she wouldn't be followed by muggers coming out of the post office, and also for convenience, to pay bills etc. But a lot of old people get it in cash and have to stand in a queue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichieA7 @gliondarcroi I had Swine Flu and it was horrific. Felt like my body was being torn apart with the coughs and pain. So weak I couldn't lift my head off the pillow or drink. Also nausea, diarrhoea and - bonus - projectile vomiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can @AnPostRS please arrange for all pension &amp; social welfare payments to be made direct to bank accounts / post accounts?

<|startoftext|>@sawallnews @declanganley The vultures will move in when the price of everything drops, due to job losses and free houses passed on to the youth by dead grandparents. This happens in wars too. One of the oldest tricks in economics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maccadoo8 @declanganley Yet I saw people walking around a supermarket today, bare hands touching everything(including faces). A few staff, my mother, myself and an Indian lady with a little girl were the only people wearing gloves (disposable ones). Also drove past a packed pub (carpark jam-packed).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@declanganley To add insult to injury, an ad for the HSE pops up on Twitter whenever you search #coronavirusireland or #COVID19+Ireland. Waste of public money. Nobody with a brain gives a flying fuck what Dr Tony "Comical Ali" or Simple Simon says.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uptheDubs10 Probably all contaminated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJKelly20 We don't know his name. He's the idiot who came home from an affected area - and went straight to work in a hospital! Rumours that it's Limerick hospital. All we know for sure is that we have idiots in charge of our country and our health service!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who has been physically close to anyone who arrived in the country in recent days, or has a, family member who did: please share your name and location. The stupid HSE won't tell us who or even where to avoid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous advice from the HSE,to call them if we get #coronavirus, so they can take us to hospital - where, on top of being extremely uncomfortable and possibly dying at the hands of some Dr Death like the guy in "the West", we might pass on the virus to very vulnerable people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WealthyB Thank you for showing leadership and concern for your fellow citizens. We have no Government and our health service is run by idiots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Richarddiskin1 @Hustler_Futbol So is Ireland now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetbfitzgeral Yes, we have Leo the Clown and Simple Simon in charge, with Comical Ali Holohan as mouthpiece. God help us!

<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @Kevmurphi BTW, I'min Donegal. Even people here are worried because everyone has a friend or friend-of-friend who has been in Dublin recently. When they heard "East of the Country" they were worried about Carlow and Wicklow. At least this narrows it down to a building in Dublin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @Kevmurphi Tell the virus. It might listen to you. I am just hoping people who are in close contact with anyone in the area had the decency to self-isolate for two weeks. For the sake of other people if not themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who has recently been physically close to anyone from the northside of Dublin needs to know this is the "East of the Country"  to which the @HSELive is referring. It's also important for people from Wexford, Louth, Kilkenny, Carlow, etc, to know this so they won't panic.  https://t.co/3KZwxmp0wT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @Kevmurphi Quick, tell the virus it's a different school!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hightowerIE @NeilODonnell00 Absolutely. There are people on here who think the virus knows the difference between the names of the primary and secondary schools on the same campus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow! A lady with a functioning brain talking on @rteliveline expressing genuine concerns about @HSELive 's ridiculous advice on #Corona - and the interviewer is patronising her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads And Corona has been circulating in China for quite a while. The schools must have been delighted to get the cheap deals to the North of Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads Most likely the travel trade copped on that Italy would be hit by any virus coming from China because there are always lots of people flying between the two countries, due to the textile trade (China supplies Italy's fashion industry). And Milan Fashion Week was last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, the #Irish #travel industry would have known #Italy would be affected, as the trade links with #China are strong (textiles) and there is a lot of travel between the two countries. It wouldn't take a genius to work that out even if you weren't selling air tickets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a conspiracy theory: Did the #Irish travel industry know #Corona was in the North of #Italy before it made the news? Because it is amazing that so many Irish schools got cheap deals to send kids there for the mid-term break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/glszWozCdl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews The first rule of #journalism is not to rely on vested interests for info and do your own research before approaching them.

<|startoftext|>@MailOnline With even survivors of #Corona  expected to have long-term organ damage (according to National Geographic and other readily accessible reliable sources), organ-harvesting will be big business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very good reason the healthy should avoid wearing a Fitbit. You could be targeted by organ-hunters!  https://t.co/wl4hWvyc63 via @MailOnline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads @HSELive @gardainfo And the @HSELive hardly thinks the public will harass the carriers of the virus. Everyone will keep well clear of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads The patronising sheer arrogance of Simple Simon and the @HSELive to hide lifesaving info from the press. Journalists respect blackouts in sensitive cases as the @gardainfo can confirm. But the press has to act in the the public interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gougle_lads Kids are super-carriers. The under-9s don't show symptoms even if they test postive. This looks increasingly like a virus deliberately developed to wipe out the adults apart from a few elite government officials and doctors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @NationalPartyIE @IrexitFreedom The Hard Left coupled with a self-serving Establishment is the greatest threat to stability. The far right at least has a moral compass and is naturally Conservative - which is a lot safer than nihilistic Communists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FelipeMurrelli @Independent_ie You have every opportunity to 1. complain about a newspaper, 2. not buy a newspaper. A child has no opportunity to avoid relentless propaganda in school. And I have not seen a single example of teachers being taken to task about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelipeMurrelli @Independent_ie It is ironic that the very people constantly haranguing "The Meeja" get info from the same media. They watch RTE, read the newspapers, come across a story, and express outrage that it's "not reported" @Niall_Boylan @TheSun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelipeMurrelli @Independent_ie But you could ask those questions of any profession. Teachers are spouting propaganda and failing to speak out too, yet their isn't the same massive public outcry. Teachers have more influence than journalists and, unlike newspapers, school cannot be ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWTSIRL @judgejulesoffic The really disturbing thing is, this might not have been an idle threat. A priest in France was beheaded (Fr Georges Hamill) and Catholic / Christian people are being persecuted all over the world to varying degrees from bigotry to actual murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @DWTSIRL @judgejulesoffic Yes. Even though he is up against fabulous dancers (Sinead in particular) he has earned his place because he's entertaining. I haven't voted for any of them yet and am now very conflicted - I might vote for them all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael11346840 @knockcrock I know. And there are unethical people in every profession. Politics probably has a greater proportion of them. Most doctors are against abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdowdican We can expect more immigrants from the low-skilled end now as the UK is screening them out with a points system. They can evade screening by getting Irish citizenship because the screening doesn't apply to Irish people. We are the backdoor to the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck to wonderful Fr Ray on @DWTSIRL - he is a Ray of sunshine (as @judgejulesoffic might say). Hope the dangerous nutter who threatened him is arrested.  https://t.co/ZKhJDFNZ1k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosecomment @NationalPartyIE Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knockcrock I honestly believe the best way to stop the slaughter of the most vulnerable is for doctors to simply refuse to do abortions. We don't need to wait for a pro-life political party to gain power: it's the doctors  we need to defend the vulnerable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rosdub And the Left don't believe in inheritance anyway. They believe in poverty for all. Which is marginally worse than the unequal society we have now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosdub I can't stand FFG either. It's a case of bad and worse. BTW referring to an old woman's life saving as "her grandchildren's inheritance" betrays an appallingly cruel attitude towards the people who built this country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC To be honest, I am surprised at Gemma, because she worked in newspapers (well, one newspaper) when they had ethics;  there is always an unwritten rule that journalism and advertising are kept separate.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC As for the advertisement for Medicins Sans Frontiers: I think the  Irish Catholic should seize this opportunity to interview them about the policy of providing abortions. And put the Catholic position in the piece. You have the platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC ...she makes a lot of good points. It's just her approach that's letting her down. She assumes she knows best how to campaign. She cost John Waters a lot of votes (and I know this from just listening to people without canvassing them).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC She's calling other people hypocrites despite the fact she said she'd sign abortion into law if she became president - and later backtracked. She lectures followers for campaigning online instead of canvassing (I believe online is more effective; canvassing backfires). However...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC Racism is indeed immoral. So why is our own Government colluding in  it? We are victims of racism in our own country. I wrote about this in this month's edition of Culture Wars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolute state of Irish "journalism" today. Young people sit in offices in Dublin, trawling social media for stories, which they then try to debunk - using social media!

<|startoftext|>@thatguypob @JohnChr43781274 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charles12577567 And it was not an easy interview. Colette Fitzpatrick gave him a right grilling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwalsh27 Also, the party is imploding like sharks in a feeding frenzy: Kate O'Connell public-shaming announcement about the children's hospital, the other woman calling Leo autistic, and Old Baldy anointing Paschal Donohoe (who, to be fair, would make a good leader).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyvoce I recently tried to tell a bunch of teenagers what it was like before mobile phones existed - the hunt for a phone booth that wasn't vandalised, dropping coins into the phone, etc. They were in shock. They actually said: "Couldn't you just Skype?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youlikeitdark @VirginMediaNews @rtenews And she's not just a news reader. Definitely has a  journalist's instinct and reflexes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@newschambers @VirginMediaNews @VirginMedia_One This series of interviews was rivetting. To paraphrase Julien Benson: "Box Office!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charles12577567 Nope. He was too calm and focussed. Maybe Terry Prone gave him an intensive course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwalsh27 Yes. Though it is a bit too late for Fine Gael now - people who used to vote for them are sickened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desertdwellers @FelipeMurrelli @Valacox @MaryKenny4 @prolifecampaign That is heartbreaking. I thought people in Africahad more respect for their elders, but apparently in Africa, instead of diagnosing an old lady with "dementia", they call her a witch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has Leo Varadkar been replaced? Bodysnatchers? He was very articulate, personable and on the ball again this evening (interview on TV3). And played a blinder in the Leaders' Debate earlier this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcy_sargument @allovernow2010 @Gregory4Destiny @NewstalkFM @IrexitFreedom Typical diversion tactics. Spoken like a true Shinner. Off you pop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcy_sargument @Gregory4Destiny @NewstalkFM Keep telling yourself that. He was until recently a member of the Murder Party. Look up Sinn Féin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeyontD @VestIreland They are shills. Like Aontu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allovernow2010 @Gregory4Destiny @darcy_sargument @NewstalkFM @IrexitFreedom I don't trust either of those parties. But I trust the Left even less than the Right. And you are the twat for trusting the Toibin dynasty and helping them gain new seats, the right to TDs' pensions. At least if the same FG TDs win, they will still only get the same pensions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuairc One last response from me to you (pearls before swine): Aontu is composed of former members of the Murder Party. Now take your armalites and your ballot boxes, and fuck off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuairc You clearly have learning disabilities as well as bad manners. Read my comments if you like - or don't. I don't want to waste time engaging with you. Life is too short!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something similar happens to old people in Ireland. As soon as they become vulnerable, they're cast out of the community and incarcerated in care homes - for the rest of their lives! @Valacox @MaryKenny4 @prolifecampaign  https://t.co/Ivn1bjnaSs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuairc I know this. I have pointed it out - on other threads on Twitter. This time I am warning about an imminent threat: Sinn Féin and Aontu. Some people are still fooled by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelong25500334 I would suggest giving @VeronaMurphyInd a vote in Wexford. She has experience of dealing with the migrant invasion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuairc Aontu are at the same game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gregory4Destiny @darcy_sargument @NewstalkFM @IrexitFreedom I feel dirty just thinking about it, but sometimes you have to listen to Machiavelli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daire_tully @NewstalkFM And because you are so desperate for power that you are willing to go into govt, arrogantly and disingenuously promising the voters you will try to convert the larger party to the pro-life cause, we don't trust you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daire_tully @NewstalkFM If you go into govt you will at best be used as a mudguard, just like Labour with Fianna Fail. Labour never recovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly If people vote for a dead candidate and add more preferences, will the vote be regarded as "spoilt" - and the transfers discarded? @TonightVMTV @NewstalkFM #elections2020 @mattiemcgrathtd @fiannafailparty @FineGael @LabourTipperary @IrexitFreedom @NationalPartyIE @prolifecampaign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly If polling could be delayed due to the death of a candidate, it would set a precedent for delaying it for every voter who dies after receiving their polling card. #elections2020 @TonightVMTV @rtenews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gregory4Destiny @darcy_sargument @NewstalkFM Anyone voting for minorities should add a few Establishment candidates, if only to keep your ballot paper in circulation. FF etc will want every last transfer and will have people watching. If you just vote for a minority candidate, your paper could disappear into the bin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gregory4Destiny @darcy_sargument @NewstalkFM I am voting for John Waters and the @IrexitFreedom Irish Freedom Party's Con Og O'Laoghaire. And, because I am also a pragmatist, I am giving the rest of my votes to Fianna Fail, Labour and Fine Gael - to keep the Hard Left and Greens out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NationalPartyIE @irishenergyblog @JamesReynoldsNP  https://t.co/7tWu3fS7yb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcy_sargument @NewstalkFM He is wise not to enter a popularity contest at this early stage. But let's hope that, when the Irish people get motivated enough to vote for patriots, it won't be too late to reclaim our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan @realDonaldTrump It's not the White House she wants - it's the White Coats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@murrirl @NewstalkFM Stupid people who don't read history books (or get their education off Google) can't be helped. They don't even know how to educate themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMcGreevy1301 Because care homes are big business and it's easier to cut corners in them than in the community. Also lots of politicians have shares in them. And the inmates die quicker (from depression). It's all about the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck to Valerie Cox in her fight for the rights of elderly people to receive proper care in their own homes. I used to work with Valerie on the Bray People and North Wicklow Times, and can confirm that she is a genuinely good person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@murrirl @NewstalkFM He said a lot in that @NewstalkFM interview this morning. Well worth listening to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilODonnell00 @NewstalkFM This is a very Irish thing: if a person makes a good point, some heckler diverts attention away from it by attacking them. We were not discussing the faults of Michael McDowell or Alan Shatter; we were discussing their warning about Sinn Féin. Get it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilODonnell00 @NewstalkFM Missing the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilODonnell00 @NewstalkFM But too late to warn about any of his mistakes now. My point is that he is warning what will happen in the near-future. But since you mention his period as Minister: he deported a lot of migrants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sinixstar @SallyAlbright @TweetyDevy @DiamondHunter80 I believe the coin-rounding thing is a form of gaslighting, devised to drive old people crazy so they can be packed off to care homes. We need to encourage people to stay mentally sharp. Demand your one cent back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM  https://t.co/7tWu3fS7yb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Sinn Féin and their spin-off are not patriots. Real patriots want to free Ireland from the oppression of the EU, the US Democrats and their globalist masters. The @NationalPartyIE and @IrexitFreedom are real patriots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailCeleb @MailOnline Legend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @devinecelt Someone quick - call the White Coats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ire_eireann @Heritage_IRL How dare they indeed. I wrote about this audacity in the current issue of Culture Wars mag.  https://t.co/7tWu3fS7yb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Also good to hear Alan Shatter during the week, warning about what would happen if Sinn Féin gained control of the country. Dangerous people. They are currently cultivating a homely image and flattering the uneducated, naive and immature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosaleenMaguir1 @doctors4lifeire @prolifecampaign Dream on. A minority will never outvote a majority who bayed like hounds for blood. The only way to stop abortion is for doctors to refuse to kill. Aontu just want power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to hear Michael McDowell on @NewstalkFM warning about the culture in Sinn Féin. Their spin-off party, Aontu, are equally slippery. They are even willing to compromise their "pro-life" stance by entering govt with a party who will outvote them. They want power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frjohnhollowell Looks like Nancy Pelosi is losing her marbles. If @realDonaldTrump ripped up another politician's speech on live TV, the Democrats would be sending for the men in the white coats to haul him off to the loony bin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gymgirl086 @tvcritics @EOBroin Sinn Féin Nua sold out years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesuispaddy @RTE_PrimeTime Ha. I answered your previous tweet before I read this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elderlemon53 It has happened in Central London too (Hyde Park).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesuispaddy @RTE_PrimeTime Greens of all parties shouldn't be littering. It's also a security issue; burglars know there's no one home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much as I dislike the present Government's, I am impressed by Leo Varadkar tonight, and Michael Martin. They came across as honest and likeable. Mary Lou appeared evasive and lairy. #Elections2020 @RTE_PrimeTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Win tickets to see #IREvWAL in the Guinness Six Nations this weekend. Let us know who you think will win the game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any of these combinations would be terrible, but #SinnFéin would be the Black'n'Tans of our time: a rabble, with a background in violence, used by the EU Establishment to bully the people of Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be a mistake for Fianna Fail (or indeed Fine Gael) to use the Greens in Government. The Greens can't be neutralised because their followers are fanatics. But Sinn Féin, Aontu, Social Dems, People Before Profit, etc, can be used as mudguards (remember FiannaFail-Labour).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This includes my piece on the anti- Irish political culture in #Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Party political broadcasts are supposed to be allocated time in proportion to the size of the party's representation in the Dail. So why does the Green Party get half an hour? "Eco Eye" is a party political broadcast for the Green Party every week of the year! #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Fianna Fail form a government with Sinn Féin, they will use them as a mudguard - like they did with Labour (Mary Lou will be the new Joan Burton). So Sinn Féin are no threat. Michael Martin needs to focus now on castrating the Greens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Greenroomwex @faircityfans Fiona was ridiculous, grovelling like that - totally out of character. Her line should have been: "Paul, you make my skin crawl; only wanted you for your money!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @FineGael They want to lose. They are throwing the election so they can enjoy their pensions while a new, younger crowd gain the right to future pensions. That's how the system works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pada1r @CiaranMacP @TobinMairead @patrickvkelly @Toibin1 @MeathRight2Life @AontuIE We don't need the laws to change - all we need is doctors to refuse to kill babies. If at some time in the future we get a majority pro-life government, we can of course change the laws. But we can't with a minority. Collaborating with a pro-abortion govt won't change that fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanHowlin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CiaranMacP @TobinMairead @patrickvkelly @Toibin1 @MeathRight2Life @AontuIE It should never have been put to a vote. No one has the right to vote to remove the right to life of others. Next we can expect communities to vote to kill unpopular people, the disabled, the elderly, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimiStrauss Careful now. Any mention of monkeys will trigger the Megbots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anything more ludicrous than #slaintecare ? Replacing the two-tier health system with a HSE funded entirely through tax would mean even more cutbacks. Private health insurance subsidises public hospitals. What next? Abolish income tax and let PRSI fund all the social welfare?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just don't let those corrupt fuckers go off to the Cayman Islands with their pensions, don't let a new shower gain the right to future Dail pensions - and don't let our country turn into a brutal Communist regime under the Hard Left + Greens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriots and pro-lifers don't need to be in Government to achieve our aims. We can win what we want through civil actions (eg, doctors refusing to perform abortions, homeless people squatting in public buildings). @prolifecampaign @NationalPartyIE @IrexitFreedom @Niall_Boylan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FineGael Just imagine the shock on the faces of our Fine Gael scumbags if they win - despite their best efforts to lose!

<|startoftext|>Mechanics and tradesmen in general who can't be expected to go to work on the bloody bus, delivery drivers, travelling sales reps - the list is endless: people who will lose their jobs if the Greens are let drag us back to the 19th century #TonightVMTV #elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is going to pay for Slaintecare? Surely not the people who paid for their own health insurance as well asPRSI for many years? #TonightVMTV #elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like Dracula the Greens always get in because some corrupt fucker opens the window. #TonightVMTV #elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't want Green? You'll get Green whether you want them or not; all the main parties will mate with these political sluts who don't even have to win #elections2020 to be in power #TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnieD06230396 I am not going to pay to read it on the off-chance they have included that figure. Nor am I going to trawl the CSO figures myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetbfitzgeral Yes, I am sure Meghan and Harry are part of some cunning plot to save the Royal family's reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetbfitzgeral Neither do I. But the people who can't afford to live in their own native city do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need to put the #Eastenders scriptwriters onto the job: they'd lock the whole lot of them (including Meghan's dad) together in a shed until they got all the fighting out of their system.

<|startoftext|>@paddytmurray We need to rid the Dail of Sinn Féin, PbP Social Democrats and other Hard Left parties. They will not be happy until everyone is poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @PKBitchGirl @niamh7777 @SimonHarrisTD There is a huge industry built around labelling kids autistic, and supplying special teachers, grants, etc. Yet kids whose needs require no expense (eg, introverts who can study at home) are denied such advantages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @PKBitchGirl @niamh7777 @SimonHarrisTD But every human being has some disadvantage. Some children find it difficult to get up early in the morning - yet schools don't cater for these night owls. Loners are forced to work in groups and do team sports. The one-size-fits-all system crushes these kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hokeisit @HMcEntee @FineGael So angry to think of all those innocent little American and Irish babies butchered, and their remains desecrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @PKBitchGirl @niamh7777 @SimonHarrisTD Another so-called autistic person of my acquaintance is the teenage daughter of a friend. This gentle, thoughtful, artistic, introverted kid has been given a label for life. It is a form of gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogabhan We are probably already a minority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrVBMK @GilgunnGerry It will probably take at least a generation to rebuild the country. But we can do it. The imminent collapse (or slow puncture) of the EU will help drain the sewer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommetcalfe637 @PKBitchGirl @niamh7777 @SimonHarrisTD Exactly. One of the "autistic" people I know is sick of being labelled. She deeply resents the diagnosis which she didn't ask for. It is so patronising. Parents should refuse to let the Disability Industry use their children as pawns in their grubby jobs club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IUAofficial Also, remote learning would free up accommodation in cities for low-paid workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IUAofficial Remote learning. That would save on overheads and student accommodation - and encourage students to think independently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is the Great Replacement - huge majority of Docklands tenants coming from abroad to work in tech or finance and have average salary of €127,000  https://t.co/n3brvFbpdo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fintancox It does however fit in with her party's mindset on abortion: during the Referendum they used the disgusting term "foetal abnormality" to justify killing babies. They would bump off all the non-conformists (of all ages) if they could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@last_call12 Earlier this evening on Prime time a school principal in Co Roscommon said "46-50 per cent" of the children in her school were foreigners who could not speak English!<|endoftext|>
