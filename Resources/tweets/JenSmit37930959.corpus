<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer You are such a liar Chuck! I don’t understand how your consciousness lets you sleep at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisson_jane @JoeBiden Literate! 😂😂😂 You are kidding, right! If you believe he writes these tweets you are delusional. He doesn’t even know where he is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Too late! FU! #NotMyPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneBlahBlah @adamski76322625 @justsitbackando @DanielCTuttle @JoeBiden As I said - IMMEDIATELY!  https://t.co/p55AGf4wGJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @SenWarren How about those that were responsible and don’t have a student debt? And who is going to pay for it? More taxes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneBlahBlah @adamski76322625 @justsitbackando @DanielCTuttle @JoeBiden Jane - you are sick in your head, seek help immediately!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Are you kidding? Maybe you can ask Hunter to chip in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Jeffrey - I suggest you get a mental health counselor yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Random_Dandom @GavinNewsom President Biden? 😂😂😂 Slow your roll...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom You do realize there are conservatives living in California. I thought Democrats called for unity? Or was that relevant only for couple days after election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexdatig @TheLeoTerrell Omg, Garcetti? We are screwed.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Without evidence? How about all the dead people voting for Biden? A peaceful transition? How about Obama and Biden spying on Trump campaign and authorizing Russia hoax?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger 71 million of us are rejecting sleepy, old, creepy and corrupt Joe. That’s a pretty long list. Are you just following orders from China? That’s what they do in socialism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @OANN Yes, please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Great one Laura! Loved it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich @FoxNews Sorry, no more Fox for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BretBaier @marthamaccallum @FoxNews No more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKingCNN And just like that nobody worries about COVID-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris Did she sleep with you too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom ‘... and to everyone who helped to steal the votes.’ I fixed it for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom California today  https://t.co/YwsKzAsuqG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden ‘Whether I stole your votes or not’...there I fixed it for you. #NotMyPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews ‘Whether I stole your votes or not’....there I fixed it for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Socialism.... here we come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhm7kcn @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris Hell no! Never! #RecallGavinNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff You have balls to talk about lying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yeah, right! You didn’t even know you were running for president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@people Seriously, how is this a news? What a joke! Unfollowing @people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You already have treated us as enemies. Nice try Biden campaign, now you are trying to be nice? You are just a corrupt politician and a hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Look who is talking about corruption? #BidenCrimeFamiily #WhereIsHunter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yes it is! #Trump2020LandslideVictory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Vote #Trump2020LandslideVictory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @SnoopDogg Why Snoop Dogg? Are you paying him in marijuana? Good luck with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YahooNews Really Yahoo? Researchers? How many cases and deaths did they estimate from the protests? What a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden He did not quit on us, look who is talking?  A person who sold out America for personal gain. #BidenFamilyCorruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitchyTeam Does their analyst like to masturbate on conference calls too? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amuse @TuckerCarlson Wow, that reeks of pure desperation! When you show us Jared’s crack pipe and sex tapes than you’ll have my attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markknoller What’s wrong with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom 👍 #Trump 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Reminder: You are just a governor, worry about California matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden “Standing up to the abuse of power”? That takes some serious balls to write that. Maybe you should come out of your basement and read the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TorontoStar “His country need him?” Please! How can you even publish this? He should be brought up on criminal sexual assault charges. Where is the Me Too movement now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT 😂😂😂 The best joke I’ve heard today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corrupt Biden #JoeBidenUkraineScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewCMcCarthy @RichLowry You are wrong and out of touch with reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill WHO CARES? Why is this even a news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp Are you admitting she didn’t do great? Otherwise, you wouldn’t have to talk about “mansplaining”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro 😂 They really are out of touch with reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris Mike won, the fly came in second, Kamala came in a distant third.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_terrence Neither<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom No, she didn’t. Watch the full clip. Better yet focus on not turning my power off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrIbram You are sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Yes, finally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BestBuy Wrong advertisement Best Buy! Nobody is watching NFL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Let me repeat:  You are corrupt and need to resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris Too bad we didn’t have have Obama - Biden in the White House for 8 years, they could have done something about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Too bad we didn’t have Obama - Biden in the White House for 8 years, they could have done something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Perhaps if you and Obama actually did something in those 8 years we wouldn’t be in the situation we are in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisbritt01 Poor taste. Not funny! What a terrible character you are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden It’s worthless to list the number of Covid cases by country without listing the country’s population. If you were smart enough you would know that but this suits better your political ad. You probably don’t even understand this now in your current health situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Are you insane? You are out of touch with reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Open the state!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes “Peaceful marches”? You are not journalists, you are a joke! No wonder nobody is reading your paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Just you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden ‘Light,' 'hope,' 'love' — with little or no policy specifics. If you and Obama were not ale to fix all these terrible systemic racism problems America apparently has, what makes you believe you could do any better as a president? Sorry Joe, 47 years was enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @BarackObama Registered and voting! Trump2020!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris It’s too bad Barack Obama wasn’t President for 8 years because he might have been able to fix all these terrible systemic racism problems America apparently has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 It’s sick and sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 Stick to music and stay out of politics. Nobody cares what you think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris You call this leadership? It’s dictatorship! God, help us please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Distance learning is a joke. Reopen the schools and stop playing political games. Or better yet, resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Omg, you call yourself a writer? You hit a very low point. No wonder nobody reads Washington Post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdMarkey What is that going to accomplish? And who is going to pay for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Yes! Thank you for all you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden #Trump2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Stop feeding us crap! There is more to the story! The system is not broken. Releasing criminals to commit more crimes is broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews This is not true. I have family in Europe and their cases are spiking up... And I don’t know what 50% you are talking about, it’s certainly not a case in CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBabylonBee 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Crazy! There goes their tourism, conventions, ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom ... and the teen had other health conditions. How many teens in California? 1 out of how many? Not that we want to lose anyone but every year there are a lot of people dying from regular flu who have other health conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze I thought Stace was saying in 1 of the tweets “It's really not that difficult to avoid being an asshole.” It must apply to everyone except Stace 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Individuals? You mean females? You are pushing this political correctness too far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChloeEudalyPDX So if the federal building gets destroyed, is the City of Portland going to pay federal government for it? And what “harm’s way” are you talking about? You just said these are “peaceful protesters”! You are incapable to hold any gov. office position and must resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChloeEudalyPDX Peaceful protesters? You are either high or a lunatic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @GOP Vote you out of office!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Your change of “tone” over a few months does not change the facts of the last 40+ years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer FU Chuck! How come DEMOCRATS didn’t give $25 million for food assistance to hungry kids instead the Kennedy Center? And how about the $25M pay raise the Congress gave themselves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jessica19560453 @1776Stonewall @KCAntiCom Jessica- you are sick! Seek help! This is what’s wrong with America. Wishing death on people who have a different opinion? What happened to the First Amendment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @DHSgov “Trump &amp; his stormtroopers”? Aren’t you part of the government? Is that how you refer to and disrespect federal agents? And you refer to rioters as protesters? You are what’s wrong with America and a total disgrace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearUKnow 😂That just made my day 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Chuck - more money will keep students and teachers safe? You are a lunatic. And who is going to pay for it? Businesses are not allowed to open... maybe time to defund the senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Where were you during riots? Nobody seemed to care then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPMartinelli27 @GavinNewsom What you don’t understand is that is someone’s business. What’s next? Going to the grocery store and take what you want without paying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickperoni @GavinNewsom You are a moron or a government employee who is still getting paid. If you don’t remember we already shut down for 6 weeks in March and April. So what will be different this time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentedNotBroken @ChrisCMecteau @w_terrence And this POS! Mayor of LA  https://t.co/8In3A2y1am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktumulty Maybe you, the nutty left-wing reporter, should also tell that to the nutty left-wing rioters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom With defunding police initiatives and releasing 8,000 convicts, we will soon have bigger problems than Covid19. Please resign, you are ruining the state!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden We deserve to know what your son is hiding in his tax returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jezebelmary @MayorOfLA @GavinNewsom You are being sarcastic, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA @GavinNewsom This is out-of-control abuse of power and control by our mayors and our state governor. Maybe we should start calling the celebrations the 4th of July protests than it’s ok. You are a joke! Enough is enough, nobody is listening to you anymore. #RecallGavinNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Shut the hell up Chuck! Did China pay you to write this tweet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACLU This is crazy but nothing surprises me anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly That’s insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chican3ry @PriyamvadaGopal You people are sick in your head, seek help immediately! I can’t believe @Cambridge_Uni employs people like this. Never EVER would I send my child there. If you are so unhappy @PriyamvadaGopal then move back to India!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertrarce @RealSaavedra 😂😂😂 We need more tweets like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom DAILY REMINDER: RESIGN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Adam - look who is talking about justice? Why don’t you tell us about your corruption for the past 3.5 years of Russia Hoax? You should resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Time to get out of your basement and do something instead of your staff writing tweets. I wonder if you even understand them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sure he isn’t the only person who has been falsely labeled as a covid mortality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Sick people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer What are you afraid of? I think your time is up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Henson You are sick! What a terrible thing to say. I can’t believe @FoodNetwork tolerates assholes like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 It just shows the hypocrisy of the Left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMiniAOC 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii @AOC Great idea, I totally agree! This just showed AOC’s immaturity and “true” leadership but there is not enough Zoomers voters to keep her in the office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler Thank you for all you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krlduke @JackPosobiec Soyattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC You “lead” by example! It just shows your immaturity, you are not fit for the office. There is not enough Zoomers voters to keep you in the office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Hopefully first and last term!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kittypurrzog @redsteeze This is a perfect example of why losing Democrats are pushing for mail in voting. They know they can’t win with #SleepyJoe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RazSimone Summer of love @MayorJenny? Big street party? It sounds you have blood on your hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom You want see this report in MSM  https://t.co/pRKa482zzz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Reminder - nobody is listening to you anymore!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @allencathedral You are so fake Chuck! Where was your interest in this in the past 60 years? You’ll just do whatever is politically expedient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff I have never heard of Juneteenth until now. A national holiday? Nobody though of this to be important during the Obama presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom But rioters are exempt? FU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Nobody is listening to you anymore, you are so corrupt. Stop playing politics or resign! Are you going to have people arrested? Good thing we have zero bail. We are going backwards in CA and the rest of America is watching. Your vision of presidency is getting slimmer every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden We need a president who can lead instead of hiding in a basement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom You didn’t seem to tweet this during the riots! Then be quiet now, you are corrupt and nobody is listening to you anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Going to REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT: Resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden What were you doing in your last 40+ years in politics? You missed your chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Are you still talking about Global Pandemic? You hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 It is interesting that nobody found these statues racist during the 8 years of Obama presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is interesting that nobody found these statues racist during the 8 years of Obama presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayInslee @JoeBiden  https://t.co/p5hmwileGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayInslee @JoeBiden I’ll be happy to vote you both out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Yes, we want bold action - resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer You must act! Start with resigning! Nobody cared about Covid-19 during riots. Then shut the f.... up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Wait, did we take a break with Covid-19 health crisis for 2 weeks? Oh, it didn’t fit your agenda during riots? Enough is enough you corrupt puppet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Are you nervous Chuck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Omg Chuck, is that your priority? Are you freaking kidding me? How come you didn’t do it during Obama’s 8 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Today would be a great day for you to resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorJenny @realDonaldTrump Omg lady, you are a lunatic and out of touch with reality. Resign!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorJenny @SeattlePD @carmenbest Hundreds of years of immense grief of our Black community? Then how come Obama didn’t help make it an anti-racist society? He must not have been a real leader..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovInslee @MayorJenny Resign! You are corrupt and out of touch with reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress @TuckerCarlson I enjoy watching @TuckerCarlson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You had 44 years to do something to live up to that promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Everyone? Then why are protestors against the lockdowns being arrested? The hypocrisy of this is astounding..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress Maybe she needs to move then..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open California @GavinNewsom or resign! This is allowed but people can’t go to church, go to work and open their small businesses, the kids can’t play sport,....#RecallNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Really Chuck? Senate Democratic Conspiracy Caucus didn’t mind squandering millions of dollars in the last 3 years on the Russia hoax! You are corrupt and disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Who would want to become a police officer now? You have to be crazy! Eliminate the unions who make it impossible to fire people like Derek Chauvin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC What a circus! Disgusting! Didn’t we have a black president for 8 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFitton You are doing an outstanding job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Your corrupt D club! Sickening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi We call on you and your nephew to immediately reopen California!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff All Lives Matter! You are so corrupt! So is Covid19 over? Are we now not worried about killing people by going to protests without masks and social distancing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theblaze Good luck with that! I hope they get nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Broncos Against. Screw you @NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 He is a lunatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN @MplsWard3 “Reimagine public safety”? You have no idea what you are talking about. Resign! You are worthless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealErinCruz Is this the end of Covid19?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Omg, you can’t make this stuff up. Really? Elmo is going to fix it. You are a joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden It happened during your 8 years in the office. How come you didn’t do anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Joe - I think you forgot you were a VP to Obama. You had your chance for 8 years, why are we in this situation then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Joe - didn’t you already have a chance for 44 years? Including 8 years as VP to Obama? People don’t trust you anymore, these are just lies to get more votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @GuysontheGrid All Lives Matter! Stop dividing us even more! Now go back to work and open up California!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You’ve had 44 years. That’s enough. Hopefully your last 150 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Open up California! People can protest but can’t go to work! You are either incompetent or corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenSiebelNewsom @GavinNewsom What data do you use to make these statements? Can you share them with us? I’m a working mom, working with data and that is absolutely not true...Now open up California so working moms can get back to work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods @RealSaavedra Omg, the world has gone crazy! I can’t believe this woman is complaining about people cleaning up the mess. Insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO You are so good Candace, you have my respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff You lied to us for 3 years! You have guts to talk to American people about lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden What can you offer? Hiding in the basement is not leadership. You had a chance in the last 44 years in the office. That was long enough corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Why don’t you spend time focusing on your state and NYC? You are a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Chuck - what have you done? You are a pretty failed politician since you were not able to help end racism in your 20+ years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Are you saying protesting is ok in CA? Suddenly, you are not worried about Covid? Then open up CA! Enough is enough! Or resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff It’s you who should shut up. You didn’t talk about one nation for 3 years during Russia hoax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 @realDonaldTrump Stay out of politics Taylor! Nobody cares what you think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Look who is talking? You spread lies about Russia and impeachment for 3 years! I can’t believe you have guts ro write tweets about lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Resign! You are corrupt and a liar. You’ve done nothing for the American people. #TermLimits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Look who is talking? What did Democrats spend time on the last 3 years? The non-sense Russia hoax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr If $75 billion is for the testing and contact tracing then what else is included in the $3 trillion Heroes Act? What are you hiding in there? Time to resign! You are too corrupt and out of touch with reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBabylonBee 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii A part of it sounds good and will work but how is it going to work with politicians?  Twitter is going to loose part of its purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Open up California!   https://t.co/qmGKcXoxC9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff You have balls to talk about “political manipulation”!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Open up CA! Time for stage 3! Maybe if you didn’t waste our tax dollars on illegals, alcohol &amp; drugs for homeless and opened up CA, we would be in a much better financial situation. There are governors who don’t need the bailout. It just shows your incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff I don’t believe anything you say. We now know that whatever you say, the truth is the opposite..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Democrats were on a wild goose chase for 3 years. Are you surprised? Or are you scared?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer And Democrats are introducing legislation to condemn the terms ‘China Virus’ and ‘Wuhan Virus’. That is really important right now and helps fight the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that Chuck Schumer, or 1 of the few Democrats I’m following, is always on top of my tweets? If this is not pushing their agenda and influencing election I don’t know what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheView @SenSchumer Hey Chuck! Maybe you should give up your income while we shelter in place. It’s not just the desire. And no, Heroes Act is not going to solve it for most Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Chuck - would you explain to us what you are busy with? We don’t hear much from you except complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika To kill free speech?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Enough is enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAgovernor Most Americans here in CA didn’t get a penny but now our tax dollars are going to illegals. No wonder state is broke and asking for federal bailout. This will not fly with the rest of America should Gavin ever (God forbid) want to run for a president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer No, we don’t Chuck. Most American people didn’t get a penny and I’m pretty confident the new bill won’t help us either. Only with higher taxes in the future. #OpenCalifornia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff @GOPLeader Most American people don’t see the need either. Most of us didn’t get a penny and I’m pretty confident the new bill won’t help us either. Only with higher taxes in the future. #openupCA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom How long is your phase 2 going to last? Another 2 months? Open California NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Americans or illegals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer More money for illegals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Look who is talking about dishonesty and hypocrisy!<|endoftext|>
