<|startoftext|>@Cassie_esd Last but not least I urge you to watch all his video This guy doesn’t like Trump either!

<|startoftext|>@Cassie_esd They will continue to try to get him out of office because he’s done more in 4years for America then all politicians combined.  https://t.co/I9KlwszceL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cassie_esd Imagine America changing like Venezuela or the Middle East it’s already happening. These riots are not manufactured who’s paying these people?

<|startoftext|>@Cassie_esd Ignored, our countries infrastructure collapsing, homeless on the streets, taxes and medical cost increased again while both political party’s financially benefited while we Americans worked harder to get by.

<|startoftext|>@Cassie_esd Prior to his election all the celebrities and media loved him Listen I don’t always care for his demeanor but what I do care about is the future of our country.

<|startoftext|>@RobertCaresToo Listening to talk radio.

The next lib conspiracy  theory 🤣 #MAGA 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
