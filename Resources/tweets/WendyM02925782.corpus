<|startoftext|>@eegieweegie @travisakers @MalcolmNance Instead of the WALL STREET JOURNAL writing about Dr.Jill Biden’s credential... write about the  Cyber Security Threat , no doubt,Trump had a hand in for Putin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goshorn_s @travisakers You guess correctly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndersonJmes @donwinslow Putin is pissing in every American’s face and not even calling it rain... he’s just that bold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SleihySusan @musecian @mdtoorder @donwinslow Trump and his followers in the Senate are all traitors and should be removed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotkissJuicy @donwinslow I agree!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thewickedwitch1 @bgmacneill @elvislver56 @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @GOPLeader So, so glad I’m not the only one who think Trump was the one who is responsible! He will do anything now that he’s been rejected by the SCOTUS... the one he believed would be his savior!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewPlewe @donwinslow This is exactly why we cannot wait until January 20, to get this traitor out of the WH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sabergermd @donwinslow Exactly.... WTF should they be first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnny_doe2010 @sabergermd @sooze555 @donwinslow So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Not so sure Trump didn’t have his hands in the cookie jar in an attempt to change the conversation about another defeat by the SCOTUS! It’s not over yet as he says... Russia dictates to him every step of the way..Perhaps,it’s not D. Trump Republicans fear , but Vladimir Putin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli A bunch of fools... Trump is not worth the salt that goes in his bread! You really think he gives a shit about y’all getting stabbed ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Trump doesn’t give a shit about the country..it’s all about him .. since he’s said from one..if he loses,the election was rigged maybe they should recount states he won.. his actions will cause more ppl to lose lives, based on more lies..thousands have already unnecessarily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/OLL49tGCVs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StompTheGOP They should be worried that their king Trump, who  probably never graduated high school jealously  is a bitch.. he’s jealous of the Biden’s and Obama!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @Karidunn17 It doesn’t matter if Biden’s pick is Black or White..if they’re competent..be thankful!... a hell of a difference from Trump’s pickks...he didn’t give a damn  if they knew what the hell they were doing or not..he only cared about loyalty and them helping him to get rich!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @Karidunn17 WTF is wrong with who Biden has nominated? Most of Trump’s nominees were corrupt, paid for a seat, had no experience &amp; were not patriotic..he picked only ppl who pledged allegiance to him,a traitor &amp; a mob boss..as a Democrat,I say.. STFU and let Biden pick who he feels is fit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickOceanMusic @YahooNews You SOB!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bblock29 They had enough sense to know why he put them there... his only intention was to USE them! Trump it’s time you realize.. you’re not a smart guy! The ppl you put on the SCOTUS have a law degree  and will not jeopardize their license for a person with a fifth grader’s brain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shearm @IslandGirlPRV Putin has given Trump poor advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahLongwell25 @IslandGirlPRV They deserve to be embarrassed and  thrown out of Congress!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahLongwell25 @IslandGirlPRV Hallelujah.. AMEN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriBerman Why aren’t they questioning the votes of Lindsay Graham, Mitch McConnell, and all the other SOB’S,that won?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriBerman Do they think they can just throw out the votes of ppl because they didn’t vote for Trump, WTF? Trump lost,Trump lies..WTF does he think he is? He already said if he loses, they cheated! So you’re saying my vote doesn’t count,because I didn’t vote for the MF? I’m outraged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlowNYC @jimmykimmel Why didn’t he save Herman Cain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nutrimedpro Trump should not still be acting president..since he’s attempting to overturn an election  that was won fair and square...Biden needs to argue before the SCOTUS to have Trump removed on the basis that he is a danger to society!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust Of course they are... that’s the way they feel about Kamala should she become president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AssusReamus WTF NOT? He’s breaking the law!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidCornDC This shit is unreal! That SOB really believes he’s a king...Putin really made a lasting impression on him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriBerman @IslandGirlPRV They’re all racist and have been getting away with lynching, shooting unarmed black folks, and discrimination forever..Many Republicans, like Grassley, Mitch Bitch McConnell, et al  are still living in the Jim Crow days... Jim Crow is still alive and well....call a spade a spade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadieMaeTN @StompTheGOP Only in America.... someone under investigation filing a frivolous lawsuit?... his ass ought to be locked up ASAP! Trump is breaking the law everyday and nothing is being done about it! Just imagine if this was Obama!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verbalrugby Can’t be fast enough! They need time to fumigate it though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATrumpest This SOB is strung out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLastGayNerve2 @mmpadellan Face it ppl..anyone who follows Trump can’t be very smart.. it’s like the blind leading the blind!

<|startoftext|>@handsomeandpaid @BarbaraHendle @mmpadellan I love it! This MF seems to be untouchable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenda78330649 @mmpadellan Are ppl really as stupid to believe anything Trump says? He wants to remain in power after thousands of ppl died needlessly on his watch when he knew and stated that the virus was deadly... WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Even a racist and a dummy should be able to see that those two, Loeffler and Perdue, don’t give a damn about the ppl... all they want are their votes do they can get richer and more powerful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moguldom Trump never had any words of sympathy for his buddy, Herman Cain! I pity the fools who follow this fool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moguldom No sympathy here, BRO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu I feel like we’re going to be in the wilderness for 40 more days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind Do the dummies wanting to overturn the election know that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i Now Trump wants to join lawsuits to overturn Joe Biden’s win in Swing States with his lies about voter fraud...what kind of country has this become?... he always joked about being in power forever, like Putin...apparently, he’s attempting to do just that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Public_Citizen @liberalgoddess Trump should be ashamed to talk about overturning an election when he’s been nothing but a total failure in every way..thousands are dead from a Virus he fail to alert the public about and he wants credit for a vaccine?His friend Herman Cain died from the Virus and no sympathy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@banditelli @NewYorkStateAG @Facebook Hope Donald Trump is your number one target, though!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@No1Hollyfreedom @KarenBovaird Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden under investigation? Hunter Biden did not run for president and won! Who’s going to investigate Ivanka, Jared and Trump’s boys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 @Popandy209 The MF LOST!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colby767 @normative The only way to stop Trump is to remove him from office NOW! He’s dangerous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimeToSayGood15 @senatemajldr Also a recount of Lindsay Graham, Cornyn and Moscow Mitch’s!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/l2cA0s3bh7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kandid61Kandi @bluestein @malinablue @ossoff @ReverendWarnock What are these rich folks doing to help the little man..Loeffler is worth 800 million..Perdue is also wealthy...Trump paid only  750.00 in taxes..I owe the IRS every year and it’s more than 750.00... WTF? I have nothing against the wealthy as long as they pay their fair share!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @KLoeffler Of course she thinks so...rich, privileged white girl thinks she’s got the shit in the bag..the only way they win is to cheat... money can buy votes,but can’t buy love!Trump keeps talking about the election was rigged.. if so,how did all the other POS like Lindsay win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluestein @KLoeffler @Perduesenate Overturn an election?.. we know you racist folks don’t value Black folks, and you’ve done everything in your power to suppress the votes, but let me tell all you Hypocrites &amp; Heathens.... GOD IS IN CHARGE and HE HASN’T FAILED US YET!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluestein @KLoeffler @Perduesenate When will these SOB’S go the hell away? Trump lost! Accept it and move the fuck on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgiaDemocrat Loeffler,her husband,and Perdue,are rich..the richer,more greedy they become...Anyone as rich as these ppl are  cannot in any stretch of the imagination relate to the struggles of average ppl that are trying hard just to exist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spygarner WOW! How many more patriots do we have to lose because Trump the spreader continues destroying  lives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton of Texas needs a pardon... you’ll get your pardon for trying to appeal to the SCOTUS on Trump’s behalf, but that’s all you’ll get,crook!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emeraald13 @RepKatiePorter And South Carolina with 6 faced Sweet Lindsay Graham! Trump has the goods on all the punk Republicans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResisterDude @NancyCuene @RepKatiePorter Mitch McConnell continues to rake in the big bucks..his wife Chao..Secretary of Transportation is doing likewise..her father owns a shipping business..it’s no wonder why she got her position..drugs discovered being transported on her daddy’s ship but no arrest made... go figure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anyonewantchips Now it’s beginning to make sense why Jim Jordan is kissing Trump’s ass... he’s probably going to need a pardon just in case, he’s sued by the athletes he ignored about the sexual abuse that happened on his watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Hell fucking NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarthlyJay Three corrupt SOB’S!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peaceandteachin @shossy2 Damn right... sue his lying ass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redpainter1 They have all committed crimes together... that’s what makes them fear Trump... they know he’s vindictive  and has loose lips....therefore,the pot can’t call the kettle black!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mocraig13 AMEN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 In Trump’s world, the law means nothing! How in the hell did this man ever get in the WH? Maybe that was fraudulent! If he got away with it once, perhaps he believes he can do again!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar Trump. You will not be given credit for the COVID vaccine... the only thing you’ll be given credit for are the millions of lives lost to the virus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin He doesn’t... he hides in the closet at night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp It would be laughable, if not so sad! Trump’s Dream has come true... he has convinced all the dummies, and in their blurred vision and poisoned minds..He is  king!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder No.....our worse enemy...Damn them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covie_93 EGO for one... in addition, he’s fighting to stay out of jail.. for Trump to commit more crimes everyday....attempting to get officials to falsify election results,  is probably nothing compared to the things we DON’T know yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@747flyboytim @44mmvvpp Trump is committing crimes every day... he is still attempting to have state officials to falsify election results... WTF?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rayofliteindark When did he ever work..... period?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandacarpenter Like all the other assholes.... they do as they choose and get away with it!  They’re the first to holler fraud... makes one wonder who the real cheaters are... Lindsay Graham said he was going to win and he did... Perdue knows something we don’t.... to skip a debate, WTF?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill Goddamit man.... you lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Do you really think Trump cares about anything but lying to stay in power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss Trump... you should have  enough of getting an ass whooping! ....Attempting to smear Joe Biden and his son, quid pro quo in Ukraine, was the reason you’ll always be an impeached president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn BEOTCH PLEASE! I take it you know something 80 million ppl don’t....He WILL be sworn in !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i So did Moscow Mitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Now that’s where you’ll sure to find Fraud.. like Georgia,purging AA from the voting rolls!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder Apparently, she doesn’t care if Trump knows she has said that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covie_93 I could be wrong, but I sincerely believe more Republicans are glad to see that MF go as much as Democrats! He’s been nothing but an incompetent, corrupt, bully, a traitor and lastly, a racist POS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher The Impossible Dream!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smc429 Of course... they have something to hide!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylaInTheBurgh I think Sally Yates would be a great choice! I’m just glad to get rid of the entire lawless Trump Administration!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylaInTheBurgh I think Joe Biden is doing a great job of selecting ppl  he believes will serve him well! I don’t give a damn if they’re black or white.. I’m sick of ppl saying who he should have as attorney general... they need to STFU...You can’t please everybody! He knows what he’s doing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Trump..most people lie, deny, get defeated and eventually come to terms with losing ..it’s been proven, Republicans and Democrats really do hate you....I must say... you’re relentless ...accept the fact that you’re never going to be acting president, now or ever again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost How many times do you have to lose dummy to learn how to spell and read the words?....YOU LOST!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher I think Kellyanne jumped ship a long time ago..I think she was the whistleblower in the WH!

<|startoftext|>@NotSoProudYank @maddow @OMGno2trump The ppl supporting Trump must really love gangster movies... Donald Trump made them real life and  it appears that ppl who have a tendency to break laws... love it...  they love his way of being lawless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albert97164279 @maddow A pardon should not be given to ppl who knowingly break the law..a pardon should be reserved for ppl wrongfully imprisoned...Trump’s family knew daddy had pardoning  power&amp; therefore,committed crimes to benefit themselves at the expense of taxpayers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lysastrata Watching Rachel Maddow tonight, gives me hope that Trump may be out before January 20, 2021..Lamar Alexander,was sworn in days before time to prevent another crook, Gov Blanton, who pardoned murderers and was paid to pardon more ..in addition, the crook served time in prison!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NEpats86 Hopefully, he’ll be in jail!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hugolowell @DemNevada Now that is a goddamn threat!

<|startoftext|>@MsButterflyyy @AviFlyGirl Wish I could afford to send a copy to every goddamn Republican in the Senate...it would be a waste of time to send it to Trump and all his ass kissers ..Trump can’t read! In addition,he’s incapable of accepting facts... he’d call it Fake News!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @tedcruz Ted Cruz is not really, truly an American...  he should used his Canadian Citizenship! He’s never acted like he had the Americans interest at heart! To allow Trump to bash his wife and accuse his father of murder, shows you the punk he really is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Ted Cruz.. you should use you Canadian citizenship... you’re not wanted here!... reason you’re still here is because they don’t want your ass in Canada either!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CongressmanRaja @yasminv @MSNBC Trump is distracting everyone with this fraud shit to cover up records of wrongdoing ... he’s hiding many things he doesn’t want Biden and Kamala to find....Trump is never to be trusted, period!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeliMels99 He’ll pay for it come January 20,2021... everyone knows he’s guilty of crimes, but waiting patiently until he commits more and more  crimes ..he won’t be running for president in 2024... he’ll be running from justice! He’s depending on Putin to  shield him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bblock29 I say chopping off the head of the snake any day is more important..Biden can always use Executive Action!

<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Hey Trump..keep on golfing until January 20,2021,then no one can complain about you riding around in your golf cart,wasting taxpayers money!Can’t think of one goddamn accomplishment you’ve made while in office over three years,other than make the rich richer, and emboldened Putin<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hansonji @KylaInTheBurgh I blocked Trump three years ago on twitter..I’m eager to follow him now,so he can now catch my drift..he’s always been a sore loser..that’s not fake..he’s always been, but now he’s over exaggerating...he wants to appear demented because he now realize the inevitable...jail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hansonji @KylaInTheBurgh Trump knows he lost.. I reiterate, he’s FAKING... and that’s not FAKE NEWS that he’s wanted in NY... Leticia James and Cyrus Vance can’t hold their peace! That will be the Peaceful Transition!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnPri39464902 @kaitlancollins Don’t worry he’ll get that and more when he’s locked up!... I think he’ll need  more than a towel... perhaps Bill Barr will come to the rescue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabyrinthWeaver @kaitlancollins If he comes... perhaps Leticia James and Cyrus Vance would be a beautiful sight!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shossy2 @tribelaw Why shouldn’t he?

<|startoftext|>@Patta47cake @politico I  had a few white friends, M &amp; F before Trump became president..they slowly disappeared! ..this is no lie..just heard from two after Trump was defeated!One came  by often, when in town..ate,slept in my home,whenever in town..One guy use to call at least twice weekly..WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patta47cake @politico The only reason Trump is so popular among the White race is because of his blatant racism.. he says what many dared to say before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denisemlowe6 @politico Historically, a felon could not  run for POTUS,but then again,Republicans have always done WTF they’ve wanted to as long as they were not a POC! They’re never held accountable..No way in hell could Obama have done the shit Trump did before being elected ,during, and after losing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CinnamonGurl73 @politico How dumb can these MF’S be?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rob_AirOne @lachlan The only point Roger Stone  makes is that he reminds you of the  prehistoric, scissor tooth shark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @GOPLeader @senatemajldr WTF does what goes on in our elections have to do with you? Oh, I forgot you helped the dummy we got stuck with for four years  in 2016! Apparently, your help didn’t work this time! I wonder if written ballots had anything to do with it..you couldn’t hack voting machines!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StompTheGOP I really find it hard to believe that there are that many stupid ppl in the US! The Red States should have been recounted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeBMacdonald WTF? Trump hasn’t been up to the task for four years.... then of course,  none of his  ppl have been... Giuliani is just one of his ignorant clowns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew Can you think of anyone that was in Trump’s circle ,who was an honest broker?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YourDadLikedIt With a Biden/ Harris victory, you’re going to be fine now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danielsgoldman @jcmarycal Trump was everything but a president! He only cared about himself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @jcmarycal @GSAEmily They should all be arrested... tampering with an election is no different from tampering with the mail... Trump has done both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lysastrata Trump..Anyone with  a brain did not vote for you...we wanted a leader that’s not a traitor,one who’s not a crook and knows what the fuck they’re doing..you have caused this country a lot of grief and pain, made us the laughing stock of the world..it’s time to take a  final bow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momof4boysss @Loaner777 Why aren’t Republicans recounting Red States?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manatee911 @JournalistJG @GOP Trump lost!...I’m getting pissed the fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manatee911 @JournalistJG @GOP If Obama pulled this kind of shit Trump is doing..Mitch McConnell would actually give birth to a baby...a third recount in Georgia... WTF? ..those damn machines are rigged...Brian Kemp, a crook, won by throwing out ballots..Pompeo wasn’t joking about Trump having a 2nd term!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manatee911 @JournalistJG @GOP Don’t know which is worse... Trump or Covid... the way I see it, I’d rather have Covid... at least we have HOPE there’s a vaccine... with Trump there is no cure! We will all eventually die..all but the rich!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janelle57790747 @LardFDorkness2 @JournalistJG @sooze555 Only Romney voted to impeach the MF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JournalistJG The Good Lord stepped in and saved us....God is in Control... His Will Be Done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JournalistJG You’re absolutely right! The MF thinks he’s entitled to be there for life like his dictator friend, Putin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeliMels99 I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CongressmanRaja Add that to the many crimes he faces when he’s dragged out of office!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jo_G640518_ I’m sorry for your mother and feel your pain.... however, there are  80 million ppl  who voted for Biden that obviously did not share her belief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelindaSGable @Numbers28 Unbelievable! Donald Trump asking that the election be thrown to him?  All the king’s men, all  the King’s horses, all the dictators,71 million racist,  did not ,cannot, and will not,  make your ass president  of these United States four more years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK F that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephRosenstein @JoeBiden Mika , please follow your husband Joe’s lead and stop referring to the asshole in the WH as PRESIDENT... he’s no longer president, never was and never will be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent He’s definitely embarrassed! He’s intentionally staying away from the press ,but constantly stealing money from his supporters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i Cute? Don’t know about CUTE... big they’d be a perfect size match!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mocraig13 Time for a recount in Kentucky and South Carolina !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StompTheGOP I have a good idea!... every time Trump demands a recount... he should lose a state he supposedly won!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ DeSantis doesn’t count in that equation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adgs8 Because 71 million or more racist Americans voted for the MF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin I’d love to be there to witness history in the making!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogertansey I imagine she’ll be somebody’s Beotch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Hell No!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaJPeltier @joncoopertweets Trump won’t allow Biden to information because he’s hiding something he doesn’t want him to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherylKoehn @FredTJoseph @RexChapman I can’t understand why they’re even having a conversation about overturning an election, not certifying votes..I’m getting pissed the fuck off! For Trump to even go that route, he knows something we don’t...Pompeo &amp; others say Trump will have a second term...WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDonovan1969 @FredTJoseph Hey, Hey, Hey! I second that and you know what time it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trumpnomore77 @FredTJoseph For that reason alone, Trump is going to Utilize the courts because he knows how they operate when it comes to the rights of a black man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carly__bird @FredTJoseph As long as there’s a Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell,Lind Graham and ppl like them...nothing changes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind They know it! That’s why he won’t concede... Trump knows he’s going to the big house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LovelyDayz2015 @irisdement @FredTJoseph @AyannaPressley And Trump-attempting to steal a goddamn election, by throwing out the votes of POC... WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph Yes... Probably Trump and Republicans paid his goddamn bail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryPotterMAGE He know his ass is grass once he’s out of office.... we already know who Trump is ,but we’ll get to see what a big crook he is! Release your goddamn taxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grobbnz @debilu2 Funny how Trump is so set on overturning election, recount after recount, but he hasn’t even released his goddamn taxes !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Trump you and Republicans always attempted to suppress Black voters...closing all goddamn voting precincts, also destroying mailboxes... if that’s not voting fraud... what is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid I don’t know HTF Republicans think that black folks cheated when they control everything damn thing..if any cheating was done,it was done by Trump who sabotaged the whole goddamn postal system..why is it nobody has mentioned that? I don’t trust those damn voting machines either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReportsDaNews @Johanvanderslam Stinking BULLSHIT!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jilevin Hey Rudy... Voter Fraud? Thank God..You’re no longer mayor... there’s NO fraud and NO more Stop &amp; Frisk of Blacks in NY, like under your leadership!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA There is no fix.... you can’t fix Stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Quid Pro Quo is Trump’s claim to fame..He’s not conceding or transitioning power until he gets Biden to promise he won’t go to prison..trust me..Trump knows he fucking lost and there is no damn judge in the world that’s going to overturn the election..he’s looking for a pardon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmckenz44559503 They’re all stupid ! They’ve followed him for four years... why stop now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Hopefully, they didn’t contract the virus.... ppl that enter don’t come out whole...there should be a sign that reads .....We don’t believe in wearing mask, therefore,enter at your own risk.. you may depart  with an infection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp @realDonaldTrump I never believed he had the virus! Trump tried everything he could to stay in office... that was done to get sympathy and to further prove what he said that it would go away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel You lost you ignorant fool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet Further Divide the racist from the anti- racist !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu Trump is obviously avoiding prosecution for his criminal acts..had he been a real president,he wouldn’t have to worry about being re-elected ! He’s incompetent,a traitor,a lying crook,who really believes he’s what the country wanted because of all the racist rhetoric  he spewed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliVelshi Why won’t this man give it up? You lost!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TxHillCountry6 @AliVelshi “It is what it is”  yet he thinks he deserves 4 more years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocDavePerez @AliVelshi And to think the incompetent POS is still trying to get re-elected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mocraig13 This would not have been permitted by Obama !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsteadWesley @Amy_Siskind If anything is named after Trump.... it should be called “TRUMP’S COVID” that has killed over 245 million ppl! That would  be the perfect recognition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsteadWesley @Amy_Siskind It appears  more  Republicans in Trump’s  Cabinet are being stricken with the deadly, evil  virus .... I wonder why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsteadWesley @Amy_Siskind Shame on you, Uncle Ben and you were supposedly a doctor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw Not surprised!...he has to reap what he sowed! He defrauded the Medicare System of 300 million dollars and also  in favor of taking ppl’s Healthcare away..What goes around, comes back around...I’d be a hypocrite, if I said I’m sorry, knowing he’s a die heart racist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whateva691 @kaitlancollins In other words, she’s a paid liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoweVT2 @mmpadellan What he’s saying is... I’m a proud Trump supporter, but not a proud American! I had to abide by the law or be held accountable! Not willing to put any stars on his crown... he knew what Trump expected of him..I would have been proud of him, had he told Trump to Kiss his Ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WFPBfoodie @mmpadellan @GaSecofState @realDonaldTrump How can this man be proud of someone who is telling the country to kiss his ass if he doesn’t get what he wants? He’s saying “F”DEMOCRACY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreScoCou @mmpadellan Unbelievable how anyone can be proud of a rapist, racist, corrupt, incompetent, three wives, a traitor to his country, kiss up to dictators, responsible for the deaths of over 200,000 deaths,destroying our democracy,pardon felons... to be continued !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grantstern @GeraldoRivera Rivera.. in your  ass kissing dreams!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju Since Trump wants to continue his bullshit... Democrats must recount all the red states that voted for Trump... especially SC and Texas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA Trump is a bold SOB... he just won’t go quietly into the night.... he’s accustom to pissing in everyone’s face and calling it rain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Does Trump really believe he can overturn the election to favor himself?.. if so,he really believes he is a dictator!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanPuterbaugh @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Trump says he has the best words...LMFAO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolynFahm @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @kalebrakelby I sincerely hope Trump can see your tweet because he only has a five word vocabulary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaladrielsIre @BrianKarem I like BEER and I love to CURSE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lawrence He said what we’ve always known!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_tracytracy That’s because there was an incompetent, self serving POS in the WH... it didn’t have to get this bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueMassa256 We rise up and demand it by peaceful protesting... it’s time Trump vacate the premises ASAP... he’s a menace to society!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidaxelrod @RudyGiuliani The Hunchback of Notre Dame is definitely demented!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Took a shuttle to the airport... The driver pissed me off saying it was the Democrats fault we’re in this predicament, having to wear mask... had intentions of giving him a nice tip after handling my luggage.. after his comment,I decided he wouldn’t get shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLK2001 Wear a damn mask and stop being a goddamn spreader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @BillKristol Nothing will happen until we get the monster Don out of the WH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costareports @cali_toad The only doubt he’s casting is with  the racist asses  like himself...everyone else knows who won fair and square. ..they  know they’re the ones who cheat... That’s the only way the’ve ever  won.... it’s their MO!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IslandGirlPRV @marcorubio Children learn what they live.. although Rubio’s parents fled Cuba under Castro.. they were still shell shocked when they came to America...so much so,they left a lasting impression on LITTLE MARCO...reason he’s so fearful of Trump!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jilevin If any of those 12 million voted for Trump.... all I have to say is ....I pity the fools!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @DemNevada Why are ppl that supposedly care about this country allowing this corruption, lies, &amp; crooks to continue using our taxpayer dollars to keep PAYING the SS to keep TRUMP in the WH,when he’s sabotaging the newly elected President?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharitieHartsig @RudyGiuliani Giuliani was both...he’s never  impressed me to be anything other than a wannabe mobster! The only thing mobs are good at is bullying and taking what they want,even if means putting one to sleep!

<|startoftext|>@ChattJazz @MarciaCaro2 @playtwo @glennkirschner2 @B52Malmet @CheriJacobus Ppl are dying, crying for help,and nurses and doctors pleading and the party of Trump is ignoring their pleas... it’s obvious  they don’t give two shits about the ppl.. it’s apparent, it’s all about power and money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @45_nerd Let’s recount Texas, South Carolina and all states Trump won!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @45_nerd Trust me folks... Trump is planning to do something awful to stay in power.... Many Republicans believe Trump will have a second term... highly suspicious! Be careful Biden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @45_nerd This may sound preposterous, but the reason Trump won’t concede the election  or certify the votes..perhaps they’re planning on something happening to Biden like they attempted to kidnap the Governor of Michigan to possibly kill her..I put nothing past Trump &amp; the Party of Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cooperhefner @Numbers28 They had no problem installing Federal judges, lifetime appointments .. one of which ,a state bar said was unqualified!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Up4Yes @essenviews I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essenviews Hell No!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essenviews Trumpet needs to give an account of all his crimes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lynne22052094 @Rosie_wearamask This needs to be investigated immediately! Lindsay Graham representing the ppl of SC? It’s time you the ppl of SC rise up and push this crook out of the Senate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewDay @MaddowBlog @JodiDoering All I have to say is... Trump should be tried for treason and murder....Republicans who are complicit should receive the same punishment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BermudaScotsman Trump would not be able to do what he does if other Republicans were  patriotic and truly cared about the country....like Trump, they have no place  in America!  Trump this is America  and not the dictatorship you so desperately want!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@proudbluetexan @TheBadNewsB @kylegriffin1 There’ll be no one to pardon him when Biden takes over! In 60 days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBadNewsB @kylegriffin1 Lindsay got too big for his britches ... sounds like Trump put too much sugar in his tank!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaScottlo @kylegriffin1 Of course, he is telling the truth! He and his wife getting death threats... WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moreskyplease @kylegriffin1 That’s the problem... Republicans think their shit don’t stink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moreskyplease @kylegriffin1 A real prosecutor that’s not bought and sold by the Republicans! No difference in telling someone to throw someone off a cliff or telling someone to rob a bank and expecting a cut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moreskyplease @kylegriffin1 Someone who’s not corrupt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moreskyplease @kylegriffin1 Someone who obeys the law and someone who knows when a crime was committed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@american2084 @kylegriffin1 You damn right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KKnappAK @Sensei415 @kylegriffin1 As Democrats.... we should  chip in to call for a recount in SC , Kentucky, and all red states Trump won!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sensei415 @kylegriffin1 He knows what Brian Kemp did in Georgia! He tossed out ballots as Secretary of Elections in Georgia! Reason he’s now the Governor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poet_economist @kylegriffin1 @LindseyGrahamSC There is no difference in what Lindsay Graham did than telling someone to break the law and to go rob a bank!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeekNReilly @kylegriffin1 I guarantee if Democrats would have all red states recounted... Republicans would STFU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabyrinthWeaver @kylegriffin1 That SOB has no business being a SENATOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doug_wk @kylegriffin1 @JamieOCitizen RECOUNT SOUTH CAROLINA and all RED STATES TRUMP WON!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 He needs to be trusted Ed in a court of law and face jail time... hopefully, after Trump leaves and cannot pardon him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamilSmith @CathyGTexas @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsay Graham. ... should be charged and jailed! What he did was criminal! Why would he be concerned enough to call Georgia ‘s Secretary of State  asking him to break the law! He has no business being a Senator!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonWaxman @AmyEGardner He figures Trump will pardon him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @PsychicHealerC Trump has done nothing but sow seeds of hate and division throughout his presidency... the weak minded ppl bought into it...now that his reign of terror is finally over, he’s like a cornered animal and will do anything to break free from what he faces...jail time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neodocjdg @SueFulton12 Maybe they didn’t! Once a liar,a traitor,a thief..nothing would surprise me if those ballots weren’t tampered with!

<|startoftext|>@neodocjdg @SueFulton12 Maybe those millions of votes Trump received were actually  meant for Biden instead! Cannot believe anyone in their right mind could vote for Trump,a corrupt traitor! Republicans accusing Democrats of cheating? BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anyonewantchips Trump wouldn’t even speak about Putin putting bounties on our soldiers, but all of a sudden ,he’s so concerned about Iran and pulling out our soldiers  from  Afghanistan?

<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci @MomsAlways @LindseyGrahamSC It’s too late for him to stop..that’s how he was re-elected...they’re all kissing Trump’s ass because he schooled them on how to cheat and win...

<|startoftext|>@AmyLance10 He’s sabotaging Biden because he’s a jealous, vindictive,sore loser and cannot believe all his cheating did not pan out ... in addition, he’s running from justice! In restrospect, Hillary was the true winner in 2016!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan What I don’t understand is if the police, which was more than one,saw this black man as such a threat..why wasn’t he subdued before he got to his vehicle?To shoot this man in the back seven times,with his children in the vehicle is unconscionable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila I’m sick of this shit!

<|startoftext|>@scientificrealm @TinaKendrick01 @realDonaldTrump I’m  curious as to why Trump doesn’t wear a mask even though the virus is spreading... in addition, curious  to know if Putin wears  a mask.... highly suspicious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasafine @KathyKittyQueen Yeah. .. now is the time to TRADE the MF to the RUSSIANS..Perhaps he discovered his roots are really Russian!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWTrollPatrol @CookieD426 @realDonaldTrump @Eleven_Films AWESOME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marciasmilack @rmccown I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitchmgmbos @NatashaBertrand Of course he knew... he’s indebted to Putin ... not surprised, he didn’t comprehend though...but someone read it and explained it ..this is a very serious matter....if he didn’t know, he has no business representing the US....And he’s filing a lawsuit about Mail-in Voting... WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolsstudio1 @NatashaBertrand Unbelievable..Trump files a lawsuit to prevent Mail-In Voting,when he,himself and many Republicans voted by mail..nothing is too low for this man to do to stay in power..he won’t confront Putin on paying a bounty to murder US soldiers.. Why? Obvious, Putin helped him get elected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatashaBertrand Pompous Pompeo is just as corrupt and a liar like Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu Trump is a LYING TRAITOR ... What the hell does he  care about our soldiers?... he used Bone Spurs as an excuse not to serve... to allow this SOB to continue destroying our country...the entire Republican Parry needs to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper BULLSHIT....Don’t believe the HYPE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu HELL TO THE NO! Lying is who he is.... not a Truth Bone in his oversized body!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu Now is the time for the SCOTUS to rule on Don the Con’s taxes... We probably  still won’t be able to see what Putin paid him to be silent about paying bounties to kill US troops... I’m sure he was paid in cash like the Taliban !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan How about the fact you ignored being told about a sexual assault?Was that fake news also?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/1JoSlHcgKd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder Imagine Obama having knowledge of Putin paying the Taliban to kill American soldiers?The audacity of Trump accusing Obama of not being an American! Trump is not an American.... he is a  traitor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveSchmidtSES @DaviMarvelous Why do these ppl keep lying to protect these traitors? Trump and Pence tell enough lies of their own...so it’s not necessary  to defend the indefensible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZekeJMiller @PressSec Shut your mouth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamiJ8796 Of course, they would deny... that’s the one thing Putin has learned from Trump... deny,deny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZekeJMiller @PressSec Trump and Pence have the prints of your lips on both their asses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel I suspect if and when his neice’s book comes out... only then will he drop out... maybe she’ll reveal that he raped her! Why else would he be so upset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sruddystar He must be a KKK judge.... they wear black robes now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Unfortunately,he lived a full life... not soon enough... the children he murdered, never had a chance to  live a full life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@american2084 @EricSchmittNYT @charlie_savage @mschwirtz Sad to think this president is actually working for and with  Putin against US Soldiers ... My husband,my Dad, my uncles, cousins, were soldiers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Does any fool actually believe Putin would admit paying a bounty to the Taliban to kill US Soldiers? If so, I pity the fool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder Yeah... stay your unmasked ass in Florida!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillWineBanks Any and everything Trump does is illegal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder Are you kidding ? If Michael Flynn gets off for putting the country at risk... what makes you think Trump and Barr are going to hold those idiots accountable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin A LIE is nothing for these Heathen, Republican, MF’S to tell! If they’ve allowed an incompetent, dumb, president to remain in office, while thousands more continue  to die needlessly from a virus he knew about long before it took so many lives..they are complicit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennresists3 This is outrageous that this incompetent,traitorous President knew that Putin was paying the Taliban to kill our US Soldiers and he did absolutely nothing is despicable! Any Republican who knew also deserve a place next to Trump, in jail or Hell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NefertitiVerita @pigpensd8682 @ewong @charlie_savage @EricSchmittNYT @mschwirtz That BEOTCH needs to resign!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mkraju Louie, Louie, Louie has dementia! There are those that are quiet... he’s extremely combative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika Trust me... he’s not trying to lose... he’s trying to make everyone believe he has dementia, so he doesn’t have to go to the big house when he becomes an ordinary citizen... kinda believe, he’s going to have to serve some time in a jail cell!Barr needs to have a cell next to his!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RagsII Like the desert would be awesome... being that he needs two hands to hold a glass of water...the desert wouldn’t be a good place since he won’t be able to find water in a desert unless he reads up on how to find it before wandering off... from what I’m hearing... he doesn’t read!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Does that mean Trump will be stepping down? He’s definitely not qualified for the job of POTUS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @SenatorCollins She’s such a damn hypocrite... like all the other Republicans who voted not to convict Trump have blood on their hands! Resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelkissObadia @victorkhoshoob Tim Scott... I’m not surprised at the other Republicans, but you? Do you truly believe they like you any better?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cesar_O_Castro @Yamiche @PeterAlexander At first I thought it was just a Black thing with Trump insults to reporters, but after insulting Peter Alexander,he’s really just a nasty, ignorant, unfit, disrespectful,POS, who has no business holding the office or being referred to as PRESIDENT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila Rand Paul tested positive for the Coronavirus?.... uh oh... his neighbor is responsible for him having an underlying condition and he opposed the Coronavirus relief bill? Holy Crap!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildPalmsLtd Who’s to say Russia and NK are not responsible for this pandemic? Have they been affected? If so,what’s their death toll! Putin is too quiet for comfort! I can remember when NK was shooting off missiles near China and bragging about they could reach the US!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy1 Trump is trying hard not to have an election... if this Coronavirus continues, there won’t be an election.. that’s exactly what his scheme was all about..knowing he doesn’t stand a chance in hell of getting re-elected,he will try every trick there is..bring everything to a halt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyblueblood Rick Scott? Please! He’s down with DJT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden I’m never taking a vaccine for the Coronavirus ... I’m reminded of the Tuskegee  experiment where men and women, soldiers, prisoners,mental patients, were used as guinea pigs... The US government injected   them with the syphillis vaccine intentionally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 Haven’t heard a word from Putin...whats he up to now that he has caused pandemonium around the world?Interfering in our election wasn’t going to work this time,so he needed something bigger..attack other countries with this virus to distract attention away from the Russians!<|endoftext|>

Just saying..Burr and others are profiting because they had first hand knowledge it existed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PoliticusSarah It appears Trump is deliberately stonewalling... he wants this Virus to continue to reassure his re-election. By shutting everything down...no 2020 election and he remains in office!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Karoli @ResisterSis20 @JoeBiden Listening to Cumo gives me comfort and I feel safer... he should definitely run for President! Matter of fact... Trump needs to resign now and let Cuomo or Joe Biden take over! Trump is worse than the Virus!<|endoftext|>
