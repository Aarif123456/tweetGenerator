<|startoftext|>@KWCosby @PerneythePoet I generally agree, however, the knife was already in our back 9 inches when Trump arrived. Now Trump and the Dems are arguing whose hand will push the knife in even further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor He said what he said, so sorry, not sorry, you can't nor make me overlook what he posted.  Also, if you have an issue with .@DillardVicki take it to her. And just so we are clear on this also, I support Vicki and enjoy her perspective on many issues.  https://t.co/OQR0mO1E1Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor Understand you are not the boss of me. I will agree &amp; disagree with whom I choose. #Reparations has no place for word games nor cult of personality to be blindly followed.  https://t.co/Og2VYwqheD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor With the real danger of $5 Kneegros like $5 Indians taking our resources, there is no space for folks playing tongue in cheek games. Also, Darity, not you, must then explain he was joking about a serious matter, perpetually with claiming expertise &amp; wants to be taken seriously.  https://t.co/2Q4ikngvup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor Again your argument is with Darity, not me.  https://t.co/JUxRueZS3c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor I disagree with Darity's premise and posit that She Could Not, plain &amp; simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor So you disagree with Darity deeming Dolezal eligible or not? There seems to be some double-think and or doublespeak going on.  https://t.co/l1HoHPSM6y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dishoughn @RealMoor Why bring Kamala up? Because under Darity Kamala and other $5 Kneegros like Dolezal would be eligible, with which I beg to differ.  I stand for #ADOS #Reparations for #FBA only.  So bases for your misinformation &amp; confusion lay with Darity, not me. üëáüèæ  https://t.co/iH2GCkeMhq<|endoftext|>
