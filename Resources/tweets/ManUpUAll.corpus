<|startoftext|>@BlacknessIn I thought the points in the article ranged from immaterial to dangerous, like making the building locatable.    I could be wrong, but that empty bookcase tells me that that condo may just be a place that they own, and allow folks like her to stay in while they are on the J.O.B.<|endoftext|>
