<|startoftext|>@Jlw77 It genuinely pisses me off 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reddancer68 Definitely! I feel so bad for her. He’s been so selfish. He’s basically used her as a cover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reddancer68 It’s actually infuriating! Is she just supposed to nod and smile and say he’s been so brave 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone saying how brave #phillipscholfield is. What about his poor bloody wife?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s massively pissed me off. Such a fix #Hunted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I persevered and watched the final episode of #CleaningUp 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to watch season 5 of #SchittsCreek now 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop @LynneCooper3 I know thought it was going to be a good watch. Still waiting for her to become a millionaire 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop @LynneCooper3 It’s rubbish but we’ve got to watch the last one now to see if anything good actually happens 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ColdFeet breaking hearts again 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely sobbed at #coldfeet tonight 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EB_emilybarnett 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx We came close to that tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you send your kid to bed and tell him to count to 500, and he’s still going at 387 😂😂🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jlw77 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have I only just discovered #SchittsCreek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop We’ve managed to watch 3 and then watched some modern family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #YouOnNetflix 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Year’s Eve and having to watch the World Cup a summer of love 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surviving today on three hours sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynneSmethurst @AlexandraSax92 You have to watch it. We watched three series in a week 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris has been and done most of the Christmas food shop with no prompting #husbandgoals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I ever in my life have another dog I’m going to teach it to wipes its paws 🐾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop #blamebrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop Freddie wants another police set to add to the collection. There are 3 that we are watching on eBay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stalking Lego sets on eBay because your child wants a discontinued set. It’s not a problem though because Santa is magic 🙈 #christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop AlwAys the little things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far too involved in #imacelebrity2018 fuming that James and Nick didn’t get their care packages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just introduced the boys to star girl Friday on the school run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harry Redknapp talking about how much he loves his wife 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop @LynneCooper3 I can’t wait 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this and so accurate 😂😂  https://t.co/efrppXJ4HY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop Oh god will it make me cry like toy story 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is definitely not working out as planned 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first 3 rounds of HIIT in months. My fitness is finally coming back 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop 😱 hope it was nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help It probably does but seeing how quick they deal with customers I wouldn’t be convinced they’d deposit it very quickly. I would use the machines but you can’t use them for larger amounts or sometimes they are not even working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADCmanchester You just have to wait a week to see your money 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADCmanchester Customer service has just tweeted me and told me that we can do bank related things at the post office!  Well isn’t that the banks job???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help We run a business in the local area. We often get paid by cash and receive cheques for commission. We need the money in our account to maintain the cash flow for our business. We can’t wait for extra days for the post office to process the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help Open some branches? Or at least have the ones that are still open, open every day. My local branch is Buxton. Closes on a Wednesday, doesn’t open until 10am. I decided to go later to miss the morning rush. Still in a queue of 19 people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADCmanchester They’ve closed most local branches and then the one in Buxton is closed on a Wednesday and doesn’t open until 10 on the other days! Queues out of the door 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little bit of my soul gets destroyed every time I visit a NatWest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheApprentice is the most annoying programme to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx It’s been sunny here today 💁🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @RedMessy watching @GNev2 watching old #mufc footage. #sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The slow mo shots inboxing make me feel 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you finally reach the end of the NatWest queue but then all the staff disappear 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JA_Autos 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JA_Autos Haha 33 going on 70 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell possessed me to put a woolly jumper on this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jlw77 I need twenty pairs to rotate! Definitely a trainers girl 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should probably throw these out  https://t.co/v0PyjAAeKX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Luke Shaw is ok. That was a nasty fall 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Addicted to watching Mrs Hinch stories on instagram 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#safe on #Netflix is well worth a watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco I will look forward to seeing a giant crisp one day 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco where are my crisps? My husbands expecting to share these 🤔  https://t.co/YqQfCZprDM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kids f-in arguing already! #fml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can no longer afford for it to be the #schoolholidays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The summer holidays are making me fatter than ever before. Fast day tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The absolute thrill from winning the weather gamble. No rain and my washing is dry. Growing old disgracefully 😏🙈😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The emoji film. What a load of 💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another woman on #CoronationStreet falsely accused of a crime 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone on holiday apart from me 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally lost all control of my kids. What is bedtime???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx I wouldn’t dare. It’s ok quick we’ll probably lose it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx  https://t.co/moZ5zem9xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx No it’s got a big tank. Got to feed it live locusts and worms 😷 I’ll send you a photo when we go. Would rather be on holiday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only slightly bitter that my neighbours have gone to Tenerife for 16 nights. We have however, been left with their lizard to feed. #summerholidays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop Traumatic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spend hours trying to get the kids to bed. Then I spend hours watching old video footage of them 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why oh why did I decide to catch up on #Corrie 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I go and undercoat Freddie’s skirting boards?? Saturday night, all the glamour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it’s not the kids crying it’s the bloody dog barking 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Letting Joey nap in the car has proved to be punishment for us all now 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The a6 adding to the Monday struggle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do sundays go by so fast 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is going to be loooooooonnnnnnnggggggggg 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insomnia just had to strike when the children are sleeping soundly 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day of school, but I’ve still had to shout “get dressed” approx 3427 times 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop Busy month 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lottery dreams shattered again. Damn you #Friday13th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s it mid week drinking and eating giant bags of crisps is over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can’t cope with this government. Jokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jlw77 Horrors 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can’t both children be good at the same time 😫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jlw77 It’s some kind of dental care kit thing. I’ve chucked the bits away but can’t get the bloody thing off the wall 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst thing about moving house is when you inherit 💩 like this, which seems to be superglued to the bloody wall 😫  https://t.co/5EMUUfOMd1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missedApage They sat still for the duration. I can’t see them requesting it again though to be fair. You should watch it just for the 💩ness of it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missedApage Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Unless you can happily mind your own business while they watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccoopertroop They sat and watched it. I went for a shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuacooperx Set in America but everyone has English accents. Not even lip synced 🙈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help As I stated previously the post office is useful if I want to receive my money days later than the bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help It's not the branches fault. It's the lack of branches available. Lots of people having to use fewer branches as they are no longer open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help Unfortunately not all transactions can be done online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help I don't wish to lay the money into my post office as the service isn't as quick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help It's just very frustrating that my closer branch is now a 12 mile drive away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help Pay some cash in. I couldn't do it at the machine as it was a larger sum of money. It has been done now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Close all the local #NatWest banks on a Wednesday and staff Wilmslow with 3 people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LynneCooper3 yeah we knew it was coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynneCooper3 he seems ok. Only a few spots at the moment. Might be worse 2mrw. He's just gone to work with chris while I do the school run<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Beyond tired but staying up to make the most of the quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being stuck indoors with an ill child and a crazy one all day has been absolutely horrific. Quarantine sucks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too tired to get up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should probably get up and prepare for the school run<|endoftext|>
