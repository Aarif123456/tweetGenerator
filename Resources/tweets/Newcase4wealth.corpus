<|startoftext|>Please all men of goodwill should prevail on these youths destroying and looting to stop it. They are seriously playing into the hands of enemies of our progress.  These youths need to understand that a destructive means can never bring about a constructive end.   #EndSARS  https://t.co/gMzd5ZUzJU<|endoftext|>
