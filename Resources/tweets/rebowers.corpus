<|startoftext|>I can say one positive thing...... chartreuse is a great color. #RNC2020  (but a red belt and red shoes???? @tomandlorenzo)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be grossly hilarious if it were not actually nutter butter crazy talk......in front of 1000+ with only a few masks in view..... #RNC2020 At least her makeup really holds up well to the DC humidity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is a masterpiece in my opinion. As someone who has watched horror films since I was seven (great parenting!) #Midsommar is on my list of the Top 20 best and I am so glad I did not read anything about it before watching. Did you see it @chrisburlingame???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ONLY critiques are: the props used in place of the deceased were a bit hokey. And, the method the daughter used for her demise should have been work-shopped more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Midsommar is one of the best movies experiences I have had in a very very long time. The cinematography is perfect and the soundtrack causes so much anxiety that every minute has the viewer hanging on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seeing dudes shoot up down the block from a Second Avenue luxury hotel is one way to start the day. #Seattle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogueFreakJr @kcmetrobus No idea what you mean. I was a passenger in a car watching the bus weave in and out of traffic basically doing whatever it wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it was a "terminal" bus per lighted sign. The bus moved from right to middle to left lanes on a whim for 10+ blocks. In the picture I took, it was taking up parts of two lanes. Finally, it pulled over into a left parking space near 6th and Virgina.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>By 11:30am June 6th, 2002, I dialed a number and had to tell his mother Robbin was dead. I will never forget it. The pain and acceptance all at once. He made a choice and I will always take comfort that the #King is now forever pain free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spoke to Robbin the night before he died. He was out of the hospital but still very sick but wanted a chance to live on his own again. People found him, or he found them of course, and gave him the thing(s) he craved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We met when he was very sick. At that time, he was a kind and gentle giant who still harbored a deep dark side. We came to understand each other and remained friends until the day he died. He treated me like he had known me forever. His smile could still light up a room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when #King lost everything and was bedridden in a hospital, due to HIV and osteomyelitis, people sought him out and fed his addictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robbin was kicked out of the band he helped found, due to his poor behavior and drug abuse, but still remained famous enough to be surrounded by "yes" people.<|endoftext|>
