<|startoftext|>Words to make her say; you said " leave me and the plants die"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to hear of Gerrard Houllier's death. The first manager I looked up to in football. Plus a very nice man. RIP #RIPGERARD 😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano this is better than Arsenal TV. Lost his head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano Can you imagine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano Has to play up to the camera doesn't he 🤣 fuming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Yeah exactly, I don't think any manager would do well with them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Especially when you consider they gave xhaka the armband. They have a few decent players. But the majority of that squad Is nowhere near good enough to get anywhere near the top four.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano @AFTVMedia It never lets you down when they are shite does it. I can just imagine it as well, absolutely raging back at home. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 just in case I never say 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you read, you'll judge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano @AFTVMedia They're gonna be absolutely fuming aren't they 🤣 prime time telly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The beat of our hearts is louder than words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ They have nothing about them, they're midfield is so easy to get past. Once that's done you've got David Luis and Rob holding. 😬🤣 They had the bounce under arteta, but they're going nowhere. I agree with you. They've gotta be careful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ I just said the same thing to my mate. They've gotta be so careful they don't get dragged in, as they'll be shot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Xhaka is brain-dead. Why would you do that when you're in a yellow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootballJOE Doing my head in!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Angela Merkel &gt; Bojo. He's out his depth. She knows what she's doing no matter what, that's the difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillReilly1 @SkySports Wherever it is. It's annoying 😭😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danielcolluney_ Annoying much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCTamE It's driving me mad😬😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biffocollins Tell me about it, 😬 getting on my nerves!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anybody else hear a slightly annoying hum in the background during this game or is it just me?! #ARSBUR #pl #annoyong #hummmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Looking forward to it already 🤣😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood You know when you click on a video and you forget about the adverts and spice girls are playing? Confusion set in before I realised it wasn't your music 🤣 great video beard. Mmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louanndavies Yes! Me too. Probably the best song from that show.  Though I must admit. The On The Turning Away solo hit me differently when I learned it on guitar, I wish I alive to see it. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hehe 🤗😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louanndavies I love that song so much ❤️. Very underappreciated. The delicate sound of thunder remix they have done is spectacular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no sensation to compare with this Suspended animation, a state of bliss ❤️ #learningtofly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Fury batters him, no question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be wonderful if one day my family decided that it would be good to support me.  And if that's going to be too much to ask, then I'd rather they stayed well out of the way. A long fucking way away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a save! 😳😱 #pl #crytot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't not love Roy Keane. It's impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accountfm @sjmcmxci Ah alright then since you asked nicely 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ As good as jesus is. He isn't gonna bag goals like aguero, they miss his instinct, but they didn't even try to really get in United face. They were both just happy throwing jabs. Was pretty awful to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Was thinking the same thing mate, nothing about it to get the fans off their seats. Both seemed to just settle for the draw from the start. Can't see either of them pushing for the title playing like that 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was a pretty shite derby #ManchesterDerby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ City not half the team they were 2 years ago. Never seen such a laboured derby. Awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dream of you in colours that don't exist .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoleArbour Ah how to be an out of touch weasel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_brookes @bbcburnsy @HullCity Mate, all you do is criticise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 @SCOUSE_DA_ @AkinwaleArobie3 I was pleasantly surprised at the end 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to queue outside just so I could get my perscription. In the pissing down rain. Nice. Fuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I feel for you! I went out this morning a bacon's sandwich, now I just feel bad about it haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. Better get my arse up and got to the chemist to get my prescription. Cannot be arsed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll He knows your hiding spots. 😬 Change change change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Hide them haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Get a joke one that electrocutes him when he tries to light it 😉 that will put him off stealing them, hehe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daniluo at least you're not alone bro 🤣👍😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you find somebody who makes you laugh like nobody else has ever made you laugh, keep hold of them 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryFcbsam @StanCollymore I think it's a tricky subject. Some connotation such as the ba ba black sheep are inherently racist, white boards are called white boards because they're white. The issue is how easily offended people are these days because the internet gives them a voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were the moon. I'd be cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanReports End of an era for us Hull folk 😔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel sorry for people who don't appreciate just how good Alan Partridge is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just my fav bit of Partridge  YOU CANT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchdog13 It's like watching this guy  https://t.co/j0btEvbe8c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 Yeah I understand that, stay safe. I'm sure you'll get it soon :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull It's a skill been able to do all that at once , I would go check him out if he came here haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 Yeah they'll be up the top, but people like me, 27 with MS won't be high on the list I guarantee it, though I'm not really that fussed, are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 I expect you to learn this by 2022 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull The more I see him do of these the better they get<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gone from sleeping until 8pklm to falling asleep before 8pm and I'm not sure which I prefer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler I'm pretty sure thata Jen's Lehmann David 🤣🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 I know you love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 From what I say they're aiming to vaccine those above 65 first. With or without health care, then those younger with serious health conditions etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 Reakeade? Weight!! Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 I hope you do! It's a big reakeade of the shoulders. As far as I can tell in the UK I will be in the sixth category below 65 with underlying health conditions, the issue is how many vaccines the countries actually have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 Nope, I don't think we're high on the list, especially at a younger age, you'll be lucky to get it by march I reckon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it wrong of me to fancy the pants off Claire Foy in The Crown? Even though she plays the queen 🤔😬🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It ain't in their hearts their bad, they'd stick by you if they could, but that's just bullshit baby, people just ain't no good. 😩❤️💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What ye reckon? @danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cash converters there, trying to rip me off 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 😏  https://t.co/AXm8nfvaK9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. After buying my Jaguar 6 years ago and loving it beyond measure, it's time to sell her, as my strat now holds my heart. Sad, but I don't use her anymore. I would rather have the money , am I wrong? 😭🤔😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 Oliver Giroud, well underappreciated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it so much ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ He can literally so anything, tackle, pass, shoot. I rate him a lot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bawkaldo @LFC @fcmidtjylland If this isn't a joke, I'm embarrassed for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ It was funny when Van Dijk got injured and people said Liverpool Would suffer, yet completely forgot we had a Cm that could play CB just as well if not better than anyone else in the prem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_pinkfloyd Now you need the solo! God I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore World's gone fucking mad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm not sure there's a better solo than the Delicate sound of thunder version of On The Turning Away. Fucking spectacular<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bea91135931 @pdbsba @piersmorgan Herd immunity by use of a vaccine to protect people as opposed to herd immunity where the virus works it's way through the population and kills thousands upon thousands? No comparison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWindass10 @bignorms Worldie?! It was more than that Deano, you made dreams come true. 😁 Lovely tree btw. Did you do that? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdbsba @piersmorgan The vaccine is aimed at reducing the severity of the infection and to immune people from it, as it is rolled out and more and more people get it. The less people will be exposed to it enough that it may kill them, means life will go back to normal. It won't go away now, ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgad Legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rip John. 💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS The quality filter in settings might make a difference if you have it ticked. Other than that I'm not sure you can remove them all as it's people you follow or in your circle. It does make your timeline rather shite 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nocontextfm1 I almost feel like this could be the beginning of a song... 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@louanndavies I don't bat an eye lid to what he says, I appreciate him for the music he has created and the impact it had on my life, that's as far as my view goes really, but yes, they were special and extremely influential to the music of today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me, shore by Fleet Foxes is so so good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeRob66 In the showers lad 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyShnark Still illegal here in UK , which baffles me considering how many people I know smoke it. The benefits of making it legal seems too much for the government. Why can't I just go get it from a shop? Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Close your eyes and dream of England 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I try to wake early, but I fail miserably 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelthomasw2 @beardmeatsfood Right I'm from Hull and I need to know where I can get one of these bad boys 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBrockelbank @TheRobinsfromOz Perhaps. But it didn't reduce that quick during the first wave, when we lockdown, it took months. Which is why I was confused. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBrockelbank @TheRobinsfromOz I agree the lockdown works 100% and was needed to slow the spread. It just seems the rate has fallen so dramatically that its a little bit suspect. To me, anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chocolate spread and chopped banana on toast is the ultimate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWindass10 How can you not love it?! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not impressed by the fact I wasnt involved in the Thundersnow. 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Multi car mayhem @danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRobinsfromOz @CBrockelbank Of course, no doubting. However, to me it doesn't make sense to half that quick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBrockelbank How the hell does the rate half in a week?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you don't forget today for the rest of your life<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HumbersideSport @officialgtfc @IanOllie7 Number 5 ) you should sign me because I'm really good, speak to my agent. AKA my dad. Love it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWhittlesElbow Something tells me the original R rate wasn't as bad as they said. Nowhere has seen that level of reduction in cases, it's halved in two weeks. Doesn't make sense to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don't they do cereal flavoured chocolate milk?! That's what I want to know<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_jamesbfc @mizzlewizzle3 This is the thing. Where he crashed you wouldn't normally see a crash, but the fact he hit it head on and walked away is unbelievable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_jamesbfc @mizzlewizzle3 I think it's designed to do that. There is no way a formula one chassis breaks in half without it been designed like that for major crashes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry but Tom Eaves is dreadful #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @bbcburnsy He's been good today Coyle. He was brought in as first choice as well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yup! Even when my body tells me to sleep my brain just laughs at the like hahahaha. No  😖 I'm not a big lover of dried mango but I do love mango flavoured yoghurt. I'm weird 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Hey, it's what I'm good at! 😁 I wish I could sleep like a normal person 😭 people don't believe me when I say I have insomnia because I sleep so much 🤣 what' snacks you got? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Omg I had three hours sleep on Friday night and still didn't get to sleep until 4M. The insomnia is a bastard. I hate it. Napping and snacking are good days though right 😁 and a little bit of the good stuff x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaOwens_CB I'm so sorry Liv. No woman deserves this, but justice will come to him the horrible bastard. Stay strong and you'll get through it and come out the other side.

<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 Tbf marseille have set a new record for most consecutive defeats in a row in the champions league. 13. 🤮🤔😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant! One of the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natttyynatnat No need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomsportsjourno Me too buddy. Stay strong, always light at the end of the tunnel. You'll get through it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Well he won't because God doesn't exist buddy 🤣 shoot me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Xmas present sorted for yours truly #BEARDARMY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITFCphonein @BradleyDenton7 @TigerTubePlayer I am surprised at how poor it seems to be, we've beaten teams at a canter without getting out of first gear especially last night. You'd think there would be a bit more in this division tbh, but still early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITFCphonein @BradleyDenton7 @TigerTubePlayer If beating another top six club 3-0 in their own back yard and we were average is anything to go by, this league is pretty shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Plies84968470 Are these the "magic" kind or am I just a bit dumb 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker @QualityStreetUK 1) strawberry  2) orange 3) purple one  4) green one  Caramel swirl &amp; toffee finger can go in the bin for me! 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to live your life, live it like this 8 year old 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣 I literally remember being like this when I was little. The little street cleaners we had in the city centre used to scare me shitless 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerTubePlayer @JWhittlesElbow So that's two managers in two games who have been beaten at home convincingly yet both home sides were dominant? OKAY MATE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 That's how shite the rest of the squad is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWhittlesElbow The standard is such a drastic drop it's untrue. Either that or were just a very good team in an average league. But winning 3-0 away from home against a team in the top six is mind bending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWhittlesElbow League one just isn't very good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we're beating a side who's at the top end of the league 3-0 away from home. This league isn't very good #hcafc #leagueone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Oh okay.  Seems to be working so 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Is he injured ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Does it seem strange to you now we seem to be a lot more structured with Ingram in goal? When long was starting we looked all over the shop, I may be wrong but a good back five gives you a good basis to go forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@55dgwjh @peter_levy @Hudsonweather Certainly will be still in tier 3 when it ends. But the rate is going down so I don't think it will be like that for a long time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull I'm actually in shock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valgreen660 Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The boys are back in the barracks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never ever tell me dogs aren't the best thing to exist, because to me they are everything you need in a pal. I love them behind words, every single one of them I ever meet ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DylanReports Hey, what else can I do when I cant sleep? It's a great watch, especially the Amtrak ones! Keep them coming :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ilovepapercraft Fools!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovepapercraft You'd hope so yeah, I can't fathom why you wouldn't take it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovepapercraft Old people and those with health conditions will be first, then it'll filter down and kids will be last, I reckon. Though I think they'll vaccinate in schools , the vaccine will work and it'll go back to normal I reckon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovepapercraft If there's mass vaccination, absolutely. If not, no chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 there is no way this is real, and if it is, partridge would be proud 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBruce84 Good luck Alex, all the best. City hero along with your dad 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They cut half the solo out of comfortably numb in this delicate sound of thunder on sky and I'm fuming. Who cuts that fucking solo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Wait. How have I only just noticed the intro gas gone? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BOOBBBYYYYY 😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTHonesty @LFC @LCFC Man city fan commenting this. Fucking embarrassment mate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickCavebot I knew before I met her that I would lose her ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FelixaRose @piersmorgan Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Yet he's still not the worst president of the last ten years 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The birds fly a lot better than we do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is tiring always stretching out for something that's just out of reach But I'll get it. After all, what I want isn't as easy as all that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qikipedia Not worth it really let's be honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I regret having a frappacino at 8pm cause I am wide awake at 4.30am and not even remotely tired with the prospect of babysitting pretty much all afternoon tomorrow COFFEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 I was surprised they killed the girl off so soon tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 Loved that bit! But part of me felt like how I feel when I watch Bond, as bad it gets you know theyre not going to kill them off YET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 I really liked the twist where he turns the blokes onto the Italian guy because they paid them more. That was cool. The Mafia confused me a bit as I wasn't sure why they were there at first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 Yeah added a bit of a turn to it didn't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 I couldn't get into it at first but I kept on and ended up loving it. Picks up when alfie comes on the scene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 I was actually gutted when I finished season 5. But I can't go back and watch it as I think it'll take the edge off ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 No fighting.   No fucking fighting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KYL3JNS My mum mentioned that about ten minutes ago. Didn't it bite him or something? The thing is the producers are never going to put them in absolute danger. Most snakes will have had venom removed and rats will be Domestic rats. It's funny 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ITS A RAT. FUCK ME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KYL3JNS Paul Burrell was the best one that's been 🤣 I just don't get how they can be so fearful. As if it's going to hurt them. It's a TV show made for entertainment, nothing else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These celebrities are such drama queens. As if they're going to put things in the holes that's going to hurt them. Crack on with it stop Been a melt #ImACeleb #wuzz #nowt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thevenividi1993 Dug me out the shit quite a few times them pizzas 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spraggy @MarleCordeiro Wow 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP It's getting more and more embarrassing by the minute isn't it. Just a massive parody 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_pinkfloyd It doesn't look right when Dave plays a Tele. 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@APartridgeQOTD Candle in the wind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton The amount of mistakes 😱 looked good at first but lost their heads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awful #hullfc too many mistakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good try that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck was Griffin doing then? #hullfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM That's anticipation and positioning I think but I'm not sure. Maybe change the system? They are very late goals as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM It must be concentration if it's not been picked up, what kind of goals are they? Open play or set peices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM Only thing I can think of is to play narrow to restrict the space tbh. Concentration and positioning are big factors late on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM Narrower should sort that, and maybe putting your winger as a defensive Winger so there's another man in the right to defend when they're on that side. The other thing is. Has one of them got bad positioning stats?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbmusicandbooks How much are they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM Normally if I'm winning late on I bring on a centre back who's tall and play narrow forcing them to go out wide, useful if they're wingers aren't any good. Defensive and shorter passing to keep hold of the ball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the sax comes in 😱😱😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 0.43 seconds mate, absolute peak 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbmusicandbooks How could you not absolutely love vinyl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsBoxing Fair play 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think I'm spending Xmas on my own in my flat, you're fucking wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mssocietyuk I hope so!! For the first time since diagnosis I showed no change after years of capaxone. So I can quite believe it could be true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life is a short, warm moment. Death is a long cold rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS You're never too old to start :) it's very rewarding and my favourite hobby hehe good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS When I started out. I practised the same song over and over again to get used to the chords. It can be tricky when you're staying out. But you've got to stick with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS Practice EM and A, Get used to the muscle memory, then start with another like a D or a G. Eventually you'll just do it without thinking about it. It's a good feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS Always tomorrow ;) it's something you've really got to learn and put your heart into. like driving a car. 🤗  I've been playing 11 years and you never ever stop learning. DO IT!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS My pride and joy hehe. I have a couple of others, but that's my go to at the minute 🤤😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't eat properly for a few days and I never thought anything of it. But I was sleeping 12 hours and very lathargic and felt a bit shit. So today I decided to have some chips and beans ( nostalgia NOM ) And honestly I can't believe how much better I feel 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchdog13 Best prospect England have got in my opinion. His awareness of space and his ability on the turn is frightening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phil Foden &gt; Jack Grealish. That's the tweet. He's a very special player #england<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevebi27465893 @GMB @piersmorgan All you have to is scroll through his profile to realise he isn't quite in the EDL but sure would like to be 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 " if Danny Jubb was a sheep, what kind of Sheep would he be? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyle Walkers distribution is superb #england #walker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOW IS PICKFORD NUMBER ONE?! #henderson #rubbish #overrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 It's only because we're playing Iceland that it looks like it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 I agree. You've got enough cover at the back with three to not need two sitting in front of you. When the wing backs push on, there's not enough in front to aim for because there's five sitting behind you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helsmels44 @dvnam @Jaynesharp Wensleydale and cranberry 😱🤤🤤 oh my<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 Yup. He's too concerned about how he can fit the players into a system instead of choosing a system thats best for the team as a whole. Should have stayed 352. Said England should be using that for the last few years because if depth at wing back/full back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 Southgate needs to go. He's way too bothered about pleasing everybody in the squad rather than playing to our strengths. That semi final was a joke and it's been downhill since then. I've not seen one decent performance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen him at Fulham @danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrel_100 @milesSI Yup. The notes never made sense. They used to say it would be delivered on time and then we would get a phone call saying it was nowhere to be seen, yet Yodels system said it was delivered. You couldn't make it up 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrel_100 @milesSI Yeah Yodel are awful. I used to work for a company that used them to deliver their stock. Safe to say it was shocking how many times they were late or got lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS This is my happy place at the moment 🤣 #isolationguitarstation  https://t.co/pLWKaFHigA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@welch__em @makkydoll Yes!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night I fell asleep about 5am. Woke up at half past 12. Fell back to sleep untill 14.30. next thing I know Its 17.30 and I'm only just waking up. Even worse is the fact I could have slept more. I hate it. I hate it a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koffeelover41 @welch__em Urgh I go in interviews and as soon as I answer their questions I forget what the actual question was 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll do what I can to be a confident wreck Can't feel this way forever, I mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 Why would you say no to something that could possibly save your life? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT Says the American 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Tbf. WPSIATWIN and AM and definitely maybe and what's the story morning glory defined a generation when it came out. The other two I agree, but not those two ha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Here here! Superb player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 @Tom_Eaves_ Tom eaves there literally falling into the goal 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS A2.  As said in my other tweet I never paid attention to it until my diagnosis, but from being little I didn't like big crowds and especially loud noises and it's gradually got a little worse but I'm better at managing it now #chatms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS A1 ) yes, although I never realised this for many years and I actually realise now I have been the same since I was young, I get very overwhelmed by big crowds and noise, like partys or even meetings at work #chatms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBletcher @maximopark The undercurrents is an absolute joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes my bedroom door slams shut and sometimes it slowly closes gently   There's a metaphor in there somewhere 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_tweedy I've been there buddy, it's not great. But I also know that people like yourselves put out a good message and I'm all for that! And I feel as somebody who also has a disability that you should know we are all with you. And yup, solidarity needed most these days :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 the confusion ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_tweedy hey man, love your photo. A big kick to the face for those who don't believe we can be. I have MS and the hardest thing is making yourself feel good enough to do what you did when you know what the reaction ( even if they don't say ) will be. Keep going bud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the cat goes:  NICE NIIICCEEEE VERY NICCEEE IND... WTF 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarleCordeiro @spraggy Spraggy there, totally oblivious. Adding to the suspense in this story! 🤔😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Im disabled techniqually and yes, you're right, we can do this sort of stuff too!! 😱🤔😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_tweedy I've never heard anyone say it. But you damn right know they're thinking it. 😖<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 It's a really stupid niave tactic he's gone for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 Not going to get anything from this if it doesn't change. They look all over the place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me we are shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hillster68 @beardmeatsfood I was trying so hard to avoid it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Well 🤔🤣 was you not little surprised at the subdued reaction that ( let's be honest ( we were expecting? 🤣 No offence Mrs Beard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go again with the talksport bullshit. Have a winger who hasn't won anything or a winger who has record goals and assists and has won the prem with ease 🤨🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood " you okay? Ahhhaaaahhhaaa"  Made me chuckle. if even she did cheat, at least she tried 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs Why shouldn't you like her? Doesn't matter what sexual orientation you are. You like what you like, that's fine with me :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs You said you wasn't as pretty as her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs I didn't mean it in any other way than to just say you're just as beautiful as them. That's all I meant. It wasn't meant in any other way so I'm sorry you took it like that but it wasn't meant in that way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs I didn't mean for you to take it the way you did. I was basically saying that you are just as beautiful as them and you should be proud of it. Your MS is part of you and you tackle it amazingly. I was merely pointing out that you're just as beautiful if not more,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seen this?! @danilio95 that's mental<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews RIP Ray. One of the very best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Growing up, I was always aware of Ray Clemence. When I was practising to be a goalkeeper because I liked it, I always used to be want to be as good as Ray. The fact he didn't get as many England call ups was a real shame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs Doesn't mean they're more pretty because they're white B. there are many really pretty black women and Indian women etc etc :) haha. That's confidence for ye 🤣 I wish I was like that ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @AblueUs TIRED!  OMG, tell me about it. I slept 11.5 hours last night. Good luck getting to sleep at a reasonable time, me HA<|endoftext|>

However, trying to make a point about it not being racist and that white people ALSO MATTER is missing the point and because you're so hushed in your little box thinking you're cool, you don't see it, it's racist and so are you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore No no, racism exists everywhere no matter the colour. However. My point is that in the case of the George Floyd murder it was racism, and a lot of the time a white man killing a Blackman usually involves some for of racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Oh you have been busy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore When did I ever say it was one way? What you talking about you wet wipe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore I never said that, but in the George Floyd case, it was racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Obviously you've missed the point of the fact a white man kept his knee on a black mans neck for 12 minutes even when the suspect and passers by were pleading with him to get off? 🤔 If that doesn't sound like racism I don't know what does. But I know you won't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViscountLe8ton @Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Anybody who saw the George Floyd thing knows it was racism. But show that to these clowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore I'll put it another way.   You see a copper who pulls you over and hes carrying a gun in his pocket  Who's more scared? A black man who saw George Floyd murdered by a white cop or a white man who knows he will be alright at the hands of a fellow white man?   🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViscountLe8ton @Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Well he is, but his profile doesn't really come up. I reckon he's been banned. Should be alright though, he isn't racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Even though your point is ludicrous?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViscountLe8ton @Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire He's still on mine 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore At least we agree on something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Again. Missing the point  But okay, if you think it wasn't out of racism. I guess he just did it for the banter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @kevpt9ds @StanCollymore And that's 100% wrong What's your point?   Dya reckon she's gonna start putting whites into slavery and make them sit away from her on a bus? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Missing the point but okay bud. Ignorance is an absolute bliss for you it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @kevpt9ds @StanCollymore So criminals deserve to suffocate at the hands of a police officer he thought was supposed to protect him like everybody else? Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore If it's not racist. Why did the BLM form? Why did people riot? Why did people protest? Why did sports start taking the knee? Why did the street get renamed " black lives matter plaza" 🤔 I suppose you think slavery isn't racist and the Holocaust wasn't real as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @kevpt9ds @StanCollymore Some did, and admittedly if you look at London people used it as an excuse to get out and protest, but the vast majority of people, including white people, know what's morally right and wrong in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViscountLe8ton @Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire DUHHHH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @DarrenMartin5 @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire The proud black men are probably joining the BLM protest you know, because they're black and think they deserve better? 🤔  There's a reason why Biden is now president and not Trump pal. Everybody knows a racist when they see one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore So why did millions of people take to the streets if it was just a murder? How many murders happen in the USA. there's a reason it was front page all over the world. Because it was racism in plain sight 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @DarrenMartin5 @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire No, whether your happy or not. There's one thing been proud to be British and white, there's another thing saying your proud to be British and white and black people such as the BLM movement do not matter anymore just because you're sick of it. That's where the racism comes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Which would be taken into account during the investigation, but likelyhood is he would be done for racial aggregation or something along those lines due to the fact he has killed a black man because he's a drug dealer. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @kevpt9ds @StanCollymore It's never been WLM. People like you make it into WLM because you don't like the fact the attention isn't on you and your white mates But go on, tell me you've got black friends so you can't be racist 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore No of course it doesn't mate. Slavery was just a bit of a laugh as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @DarrenMartin5 @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Your answer says it all mate 😭 why does it matter even youre both proud to be British 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Shouldn't be killing at all But if it's out of hatred. You bet the white person is going after them because they're black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore What else was it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenMartin5 @Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Nail. Head. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire What are you talking about? You're missing the whole point of what BLM is mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire But what they're asking for is fair treatment and respect. I don't think that should be too much too ask.the BLM has changed a lot of things and it will continue to do so.Everybody matters mate, everybody is and should be allowed to live how they like, no matter what their colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire No but that's my point, they do matter. Nobody said they mattered less, BUT after what white people subjected black people too, surely black people have the right to voice they dissaprove and want things to change? Nobody is asking everybody to sudden worship blacks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore With a knee on his neck then yup. It's probably racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore White man kills black man for no other reason than to show who's in control, when he could have easily taken his knee off his neck and he would have lived? You don't treat people like that, especially as a copper.   Well if the Chinese person was laid on the ground for 12 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Clearly, white people somewhere will be subjected to some form of racism. But white people haven't gone through what the black population has. It's about time people realised that every single person who walks the planet is exactly the same, no matter the colour of their skin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire As am I because it shouldn't exist, racism and slavery is archaic. Yes it still goes on, but compared to what it was like, after a black president I wouldn't honestly think people would still intend to be racist without an ounce of realisation of what they are actually saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @theonejoeyd @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Just think about it Pete. I'm not saying youre racist. You're more ignorant than anything. But my point has and always has been that until people realise the mechanisms behind the racism, you're never gonna change your view. As much as I try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Trust me, it was out of racism because he was black so " must have done something wrong". That's America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theonejoeyd @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore @alexb__96 @IsItYorkshire Me? Which one ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevpt9ds @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore What do you think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 @HullCity If there's free pizza I am absolutely all for a good cup run 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wardolly @Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Boring init<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 Got a little peckish that lad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore To say white people have been subjected to slavery just shows how ignorant you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore It's not been thick skinned mate. It's called been a white supremacist but you crack on with your rhetoric that I bet 99% of the whole population disagrees with. The biggest issue in America and other enthically diverse countries is racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 @HullCity Well I agree on Eaves. Donkey in a sleeping bag 😭 but I won't judge then in the papa John's trophy haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore You mean the hundreds of years before that with Wilberforce and Martin Luther king? 🤔 The George floyd thing made people take notice. And it also showed us who the real issue is. People have had enough of it. And dare I say, had enough of people like you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 @HullCity We havent made a bad start. But you're playing a team in the division below who will fight to make a point. We don't really have anything to lose or gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Neither am I buddy. But open your eyes, how many times a day do you get subjected to racism from black police officers or black people in general? Because I bet it's a damn load less than black people just because of the colour of their skin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore The BLM movement was because of treatment of black people in America ( George floyd, breonna Taylor. Slavery, cop brutality. Tell me, in your own words a time in which white slavery had become the norm though society?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore What better way to show you matter than to create a racist white society at the expense of black people and make them serve you as a slave. Don't be so ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore White folk didn't go found with WLM banners. They just turned black people into slaves instead. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore No because that clearly isn't the issue and if you've missed the whole point of the black lives matter protest then I suggest you give it a read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKirby1974 @HullCity Bit much Jon in a cup game, I'm not gonna lie 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petewsidebradly @StanCollymore Of course. That's why there was massive riots in America when a black man was killed by a white police officer. Nothing happened after that 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 OH MY GOD 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 no need for that mate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The amount of people celebrating Trump been fucked off is amazing. People don't realise how bad he turned America. #biden #trump #USElection2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lauraJW09 @valgreen660 Sorry but, who else?  https://t.co/VdiOEE4fhO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypratt The worst thing is how many republicans believe it because of Trump. That's scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Yis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think America is divided because of trump, you'd be absolutely spot on #USAelection2020 #trump #horrorshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull I honestly thought that said Bielsa at the bottom. I was about to flip 😂 if it's anything like Birra Moretti then that is a right treat haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull What's the bottle? 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood I am raging. Beginning of November? Not having that. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least spell it right you fucking goon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liv_Boeree @SamHarrisOrg It just feels like America are putting their party allegiance over basic human rights and principles. Pray to god Biden wins<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danilio95 He's gotta go away to Arizona and get something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samjane6766 Rule of six doesn't apply to reindeer surely 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL God he was so sure as. Dearing be won. Pahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Next year will be massive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Also. Why do these republicans keep trying to spin it on Biden if they were confident of winning. They'd have no reason to. Just reeks of them shitting themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I can't see it being favourable for conservatives. But it depends how far behind labour actually are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Got to get worse before it gets better 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I don't think I've seen a party get so many things badly wrong and still be in the best position possible because of lack of decent trustworthy opposition, they've been a shambles since they were elected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Majority of people**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I agree. Especially when the minority of people didn't really understand what they were actually voting for. Vast majority of people I'm sure expected an easy ride. But as you say, that comes with the lack of real leadership and lack of social awareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Spot on,giving the public the vote on Europe was absolute suicide in my opinion. And I also reckon if you say you can't vote on the base of immigration, we wouldn't have left. Johnson doesn't come across as somebody who knows what to do when the chips are down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I guess it's their own fault if they don't vote and they don't win. Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Yup because the party associates with its leader. Same with Jeremy Corbyn. On paper his policies suited the majority. But people didn't like him so he didn't win. If they don't like you they won't vote for you. I think the north is a major player in the next election now for us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I said on a post on Facebook how America has a population of 400+m but record voting is 160m. That's less than half the population. Seems a small sample to win from in my opinion , but again, same as here ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Agreed, it seems a much more fair representation of the actual system to make sure people actually vote. When many won't because they don't see it would make a difference. FPTP would change that. Could change America tbh as you say look at Latino vote In florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Hense why even though the likelihood of the court case to favour trump isn't that great in reality, it also shows that he will do anything to win. Because in his mind that's for the best for America when everybody else knows otherwise ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL You know, it's funny because I always felt that was how America was. Very loyal no matter what as you say Stockholm syndrome. I think it's one of the reasons why American politics is so unlawful. Because you only have two, no real opposition from anywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL It baffles me the results are this close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Winning Arizona is a big deal for Biden I think, for them to go blue could domino to other states in a similar position next time around. Though what do I know 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL That's the one thing Trump's campaign has built on is the voice of hope, even when what he says is bullshit they still buy it because they're still chasing the dream America sold them. I refuse to believe a majority of people in America want trump for another four years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Exactly. That's the whole point  They would rather vote for somebody like trump no matter how appalling he gets compared to Biden just because he's blue. Same in UK really north/south thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL How bad can it get it if trump wins? Very. It's political suicide if he wins. They'll be on their knees. It's unreal what's going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL It's pathetic to see members of authority in America act like that, it's unbelievable to even accuse it let alone threaten legal action. It's only gonna make them look ever worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Why waste good time Fighting the people you like Who will fall defending your name. One of my absolute favourite songs ever. ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Banterbussy @talkSPORT @CalvinBook Unless of course fans pay to watch a game which provides the club with a regular income to prop up the fact they are unsustainable without it.

<|startoftext|>@HullCity Fair enough 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting shit from people when you're not well when you have a chronic illness not only makes you feel like a let down but also it triggers a sense of worthlesness that you're not the same as a normal person.

<|startoftext|>@BeaMcCx @liamgallagher No problem at all sir. I hope you're well. I understand that, I've been there with certain celebrities and music influences. Mothers are complicated, but the be all and end all is that they may seem horrible. But they only have your best interests at heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end of the day. You can fall out and bicker and squabble and argue and disagree and be stubborn and act like it's nothing but trust me, cherish your mum. You only get one ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeaMcCx @liamgallagher She's still your mum. They may be harsh and horrible. I know!, But you only get one. Cherish her while you can. You don't need a celebrity to vindicate anything. Life's too short to fall out with the most important woman in your life 🙂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Yey 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milesSI It's a credit to you and your team that so many people have fallen in love with the game. The hours of entertainment to cure the boredom, to me, is worth every penny I have ever spent on FM. Glad it's still toppling records<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Tehe. Secret 😂😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shark_Sports_ @bbcburnsy @HumbersideSport @HullCity Too young and naive last season along with too many players who didn't want to play for us. The recruitment I think has been good this season<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 The biggest issue last season was too many young players who didn't understand the season and too many players who didn't want to be here. fruits of labour with new signings proving true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Keep it up boyos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I had some friends go and it looks beautiful doesn't it. I would love to. But I don't have a passport ☹️😂 funnily enough you can get a ferry from where I live straight to Amsterdam. Dutch dash! And it's pretty cheap 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll IF EVER 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Well if you do come to the UK you must let me know. I'll bring the supplies 😂😁 I've never been to Amsterdam. I've heard it's pretty good and the weed is good 😂 places like Croatia and Czech Republic are nice and pretty cheap :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I often stay up quite late because I can't sleep. Especially when I don't have any therepeutic substances to knock me out 😂 I ask for late shifts so I can sleep till whenever I want ha. The walk was just because I was bored of been stuck in bed. What time did you wake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Even though I'm yawning my head off 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I was like that this morning 😖 I just stayed in bed and listened to a podcast. I didn't sleep but it refreshed me. But I will say. I ended up going out for a walk a little later on and that woke me up a bit. It's now 1am here and im not that tired 😖😭😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leedeetee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Okay, what about all the shit I'm getting off Leeds fans because I said they won't get top half? You are absolutely bob on what should be a realistic target. First season after 16 years away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deleted his tweet. Changed his twitter bio 😂 Lettuce  https://t.co/E4mZzBlLlc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen Will do 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen I guarantee you sheff United will struggle this season. Wolves had the budget, manager and infrastructure to have a good go at it. Just because Leeds sign one 30m striker. It doesn't guarantee survival. That's wreckless thinking that in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen It's called football mate where else is it gonna go? You're just going round in circles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yes. As did everyone. No team gets promoted and you think they'll do well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameshoggarth @north_ferribyfc @FerribyShop @hgsportswear Sexy shirt tbf 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Pretty sure this is the man city game where the ball hit the attackers arm first. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen It came off Jesus arm first 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Did you see where his fucking arm was 😂 he was landing a plane. If that's against a team you're playing you're 100% saying that's a penalty. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen 😂 okay mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen I'm pretty sure I said more astute teams and didn't reference Liverpool as an astute team 😂🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen His arm was in no mans land. Watch premier League defenders. Their arms are always tucked in. Have a look at Jeff Hendrick for Newcastle. Hits his arm but wasn't a penalty because his arm was down by his side 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen The handball was handball clear as day. His arm was in no mans land  Have a look at Jeff Hendrick for Newcastle. 👍 Who Liverpool? Or Leeds? Because neither of them were any good defending 😂 you're off your box you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Literally conceded two stone wall penalties. Didn't mark VVD for the corner. Lost Salah a number of times in the final third so he could turn and run at your back line 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Astute."Having or showing an ability to accurately assess situations or people and turn this to one's advantage" no team did that on Saturday and they were both awful at the back. But other teams will be much much better And that's where you'll struggle if you're defence is poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenaw85 @CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen I haven't disliked them as much since they beat Watford that time and we went up 😂 Cheers Steve,  appreciate the genuine want for a conversation on this unlike others. We need rid of our owners more than anything ha most Leeds fans don't consider us a rival at all haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen I expect sheff United go struggle this year yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen If you can teach players to work together as a unit and as a collective you have a much better chance than a team who don't know what they're doing. No matter what your capability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen No I laughed because the question was completely out of context according to the topic we were talking about and also I knew what you would have done consequently. Keep up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenaw85 @CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen Don't get me wrong mate, I'm from Hull. So a lot of people here consider Leeds a " rival". I don't really and I'll be fair enough to say that if I'm wrong I'll hold my hands up. But I agree. The media bigging Leeds up is dangerous, happened with Fulham spending £100m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen You literally commented on MY comment you Lettuce 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen Of course you did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen A question which has fuck all to do with the topic in question While were at it, what's your shoe size? 👍😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenaw85 @CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen And that's exactly my point mate spot on 👍 That should be the aim. But some Leeds fans and certainly the media have lavished the whole top ten thing. Survival is absolutely the number one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen As will I mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen You can't compare an FA cup tie against arsenal to playing week in week out in the prem mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I never said Leeds would get relegated. But I don't think they'll get anywhere near a top half. That's all I've said and people are rattled. I don't think youll go down. I just don't think you'll get as high as what I've seen people suggest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Oh I will do don't worry 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I agree. But they didn't spend 16 years away from the big time. And how many teams have done that over the past 30 years in the prem? Not many. Sheff United will struggle this year. Wolves have invested wisely with a good set up and a good manager, you've signed two players<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Not from what I've seen splattered all over twitter mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adie_shad @OharePeter @themichaelowen No, but as I also said. Liverpool were just as bad at the back as Leeds were. But Liverpool can afford to do that.  teams who are solid at the back won't give you them opportunities like Liverpool did, Liverpool did because they got cocky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And yes I think there are at least ten teams in the prem who will pick you off because of your naivity to think it will be a walk in the park. You're just asking for trouble if you're setting the bar too high<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I never said Leeds would be relegated. I think there are teams worse than them  I just think after 16 years away and signing two players expecting a top ten finish is ludicrous. But I could be wrong. People are getting rattled by my opinion , normal really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Come off it Paul. Managers are always trying to find new ways to win. Guardiola for example brought a style no one had seen before. Difference been is he won the league with a shit load of money. Leeds just come up from the championship. Doesn't matter what happened last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Trust me. Bottom 10 in the premier League is a whole lot different to the top ten of the championship. You were playing Derby now you're playing Everton. It doesn't compare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Of course it does. You're saying that because you walked the championship you'll have a good season in the prem but it doesn't work like that, no matter what team you have in the championship, it's a whole new level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen 😂 here We go 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Going into the premier League thinking just because it worked in the championship it'll work in the prem. By that logic every promoted team should get a champions league spot. But it doesn't work like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Because the prem and the championship. And I can't stress this enough. Are completely and utterly a different kettle of fish. You're Millwall and then Manchester city. It doesn't compare whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ric68114765 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yes but only because they spent 16 years away from the big time. Nobody would bat an eye lid to Leeds mid table championship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nofacekillahh @OharePeter @themichaelowen And therefor, to me. Making two signings and expecting top ten because you walked the championship is ridiculous. That's all I said yet people are getting triggered. I don't think Leeds will get relegated but I don't think they'll get anywhere near top half<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nofacekillahh @OharePeter @themichaelowen Liverpool were not astute against leeds. They were as bad at defending as Leeds were. What I mean is, teams that have a good solid back line who are regimented and know their roles will restrict Leeds. Which means they'll rely heavily on keeping the ball out the net.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ric68114765 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And that's all I've said mate, it's predominantly the media, but thats dangerous because it gets over hyped and then the bandwagon gets full. Survive and go from there. I just don't think Leeds will get near the top ten. That's all I said. Triggered a few people haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen Premier League and championship is a whole new ball game. That's all I'm saying. Thinking just because you walked the championship you'll walk the premier League is suicidal. Look at Fulham spending £100m and still got relegated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hello_Parma @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yes but again. Doesn't matter who the players are. Players know how to stand together in a line or when to break that line etc etc. Leeds looked all over the shop. But so did Liverpool. I know that Leeds defense was makeshift. But still got to learn how to defend in the prem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMCoaching17 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Did you see your back four majority of the game? It was all over the shop. As was Liverpool's. Defending like that every week for both teams will get you in trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adie_shad @OharePeter @themichaelowen I am aware. But playing the top teams and the bottom teams with a dodgy back four will always end up the same way. It will get better, but my whole point is expecting a top ten finish is ludicrous, I don't think Leeds will go down may I add. Never said that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen But they surprised everyone at how well they did, but any money they didn't set a target that high. Set the target as survival, anything else is a bonus and you go from there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheadleWhite @OharePeter @themichaelowen I am aware. And as I said if they improve in that department they should be okay. But expecting a good top half season is ludicrous. Yet everybody seems to object to the fact I think it's daft to be promoted, sign two players and think top ten. I know sheff United did,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OooahhBerardi @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yup. One game. Because that's the game I watched. Defensively both teams were woeful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny73868987 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Everybody is better than Norwich because they didn't sign anybody. They walked the championship and didn't sign anyone and got rinsed every week. You can't go in to the prem thinking it's easy and top ten is realistic when you've just been promoted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ric68114765 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yup I said that on a separate tweet last night. I never said they played bad or I thought they would get relegated. But watching them against Liverpool the back four was all over the shop but as you say as time goes on that will change. I still think wanting top 10 is crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkNChancee @OharePeter @themichaelowen 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 can't believe we don't feature 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood @BurgerKingUK The blinds shut. I'm confused. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Because you've signed two players currently and you looked leaky at the back. Said it before that will get better as time goes on. But you're not getting top half in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen It's a long long story 😂 I don't have the space to explain haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Right yeah because that's going to happen 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyRLUFC @OharePeter @themichaelowen Time will tell buddy. But I stand by what I said. For now 😂  Saying that I bet my mate £10 Norwich would stay up. Probably win the fucking league 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyRLUFC @OharePeter @themichaelowen It was like a game of FIFA 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyRLUFC @OharePeter @themichaelowen Absolutely agree, pushed in at the deep end etc etc. I don't think you'll go down I think there's worse teams in the division this year. Just not top half. Not from what I saw. But as I said it's hard to judge on one game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Spot on. That's exactly what they should be aiming for. I don't think you'll go down. I think west brom, villa, West ham and maybe Fulham will be worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyRLUFC @OharePeter @themichaelowen It will get better as they gel and players come back from injury etc etc. But the defensive shape was a bit AWOL to me. As was Liverpool's. But it's hard to judge after one game. I just think top ten is a ridiculous dream at the minute for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen as I pointed out earlier I don't actually think you will get relegated I think there's worse teams in the prem this year. I just don't think saying top ten is a reasonable expectation after 16 years away from the prem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyRLUFC @OharePeter @themichaelowen Tbf. They were both bad as each other. But Leeds looked all over the place at the back simply because of where they trying to play it out from. I haven't said Leeds will get relegated. I said top ten is a ridiculous dream. My opinion on that showing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I don't think Leeds will go down might I add. I think there's teams a lot worse. I just don't think a top half finish for now at least is realistic. That's just my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen You can't compare a newly promoted side to the champions. But they're routes are similar in that they both need good solid defence. Liverpool's midfield was unbalanced because Kieta was roaming from position and leaving too much space. hence Fabinho coming on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Liverpool can concede 3 and know they can score 4, Leeds aren't going to do that. That's the difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I dont think Liverpool will get anywhere near the league defending like that. But it was the same last season. The difference is the forward line. arguably the best in Europe/world. Leeds don't have that luxury. That's why it's so important to be solid at the back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen He's the best manager you've had for many years. Youll do well to keep hold of him I think. I rate him. Seems to be a decent bloke who you'd wanna play for. And exactly. Im not saying I want them to get relegated. I just think some fans are blinded by the premier League dream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I'm just saying how I see it. I'm not wrong and I'm not right. But from yesterday that Leeds back line looked dodgy. That will get better in time but I still think top ten is a ridiculous aspiration ( yes I know sheff United did it but wont again )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yup. On the money. It's funny how an opinion rattles so many people. Stay in your lane and try do what you've gotta do. Anything else and you risk getting relegated because you overestimated what you thought you could do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And that matters because?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardpotty @danpatton__ Rushden and diamonds are in there and they were relegated to the conference in 2006 so has to be prior to that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And it will be you 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Premier League survival is a lot different to chasing promotion buddy. Liecester almost got relegated first season back in the big time. So what does that tell you. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen When did I ever say I was offended by playing good football? 😂 I'm not offended by anything but I stand by Leeds will not finish top ten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And that I think will be your downfall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen 😂 love you too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I personally don't think Leeds fans understand the difference between the prem and the championship. Whole new ball game. Survival is 100% the only aim . Anything else is a bonus , always has been that way and always will be first season back in the big time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Leicester won the league a season after surviving by the skin of their teeth. Wolves came up with a good budget and a good manager and a good spine to the team. Leeds are nowhere near wolves pal. You're in Dreamland if you think that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Touchy boy aren't you 😂 we will see at the end of the season. Yours not getting top ten. End of story. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I think sheff will struggle this season. I just don't get this whole Leeds thing. Survival is the most important thing. Thinking you'll get top ten with one 30m signing from the championship is daft. Yes sheff utd did it. But they won't do it again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen No you couldn't. At all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonceptKitz @HullCityItalian @HullCity @UmbroUK @HullCityST @HCAFCTigerlink @HullCity__News @HCSStweets @HullCity_Br @TigersBlah @HCAFC_FR @thekempton @TigerTubePlayer I miss Bonus Electrical ☹️ the good old days , would wear all of these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Man city  Man United  Liverpool  Arsenal  Chelsea  Spurs  Everton Wolves  Leicester  Sheff United   You aren't the worst team in the league. But no way are you getting top half. Beilsa is a good manager. But not a chance with two new signings up from the championship. At all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen And that's exactly what Im saying, that should be the target. If you play well you deserve to stay up, but thinking youll get top ten because you were good defensively at the back and you signed a £30m striker is asking for trouble. IE Fulham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @OharePeter @Jevo989 @themichaelowen Not shook at all pal. doesn't bother me mate. If Leeds stay up then they deserve to stay up. But I've seen so many comments about Leeds getting top ten and in my opinion I don't see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I have watched many seasons where teams go into it thinking theyll be okay. Fulham, Sunderland, Newcastle, West ham, wolves etc etc. All of them clubs had one thing in common.  They couldn't defend. Leeds to me were all over the place yesterday. If that changes fair enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @ocukgilly @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen 😂 funny how an opinion triggers people into becoming offensive init. Especially when that opinion differs from their own. Leeds will not get anywhere near top half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @OharePeter @Jevo989 @themichaelowen I will happily discuss half way through the season when you're nowhere near where you think you should be👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OooahhBerardi @OharePeter @themichaelowen That's exactly what I mean, I never said if was Leeds fans  There are some who think they'll be pushing Europe etc etc. It's a good season if you stay up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillardGlyn @OharePeter @themichaelowen They still had to fight with everything they had, they were organised and regimented. Leeds didn't look like that. It may change. But one club in how many years? Your aim should be survival<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OooahhBerardi @OharePeter @themichaelowen You can't write a team off after one game and I've never said Leeds were poor.They deserved a point. But to me, for a promoted side to think after 16 years theyll easily survive is ludicrous, look at Fulham. Spend £100m,still go down when people thought " no chance spending that"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillardGlyn @OharePeter @themichaelowen Okay mate. Try going for the league while you're at it 😂 you'll be in a fight one way or another. Because promoted teams always are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OooahhBerardi @OharePeter @themichaelowen Clearly yesterday Liverpool weren't. But teams who have a good foundation at the back, who are hard to beat and put you under pressure will punish that back line. That's all I've said. Never said Leeds played bad  They deserved a point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillardGlyn @OharePeter @themichaelowen Tbf Barcelona signed Braithwaite 😂 I never said Leeds didn't play well  I just said they didn't look steady at the back. They deserved a point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillardGlyn @OharePeter @themichaelowen When did I say he was a bad player?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillardGlyn @OharePeter @themichaelowen He conceded the penalty that won Liverpool the game 🤔 ive never once said Leeds played bad, but they need to sort their defence out. That's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OharePeter @ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @themichaelowen Leeds played well and did deserve a point. But my point isn't about yesterday. The defence was all over the shop. Yes so was Liverpool, but Leeds have a lot more to lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ocukgilly @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I agree, but Liverpool aren't battling relegation. Any team that wants to stay up needs a solid back line and foundations. You were all over the place yesterday. As we're Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jevo989 @mattsw_g @OharePeter @themichaelowen No, but there's this whole " top ten easy" malarky. If you get that I'll say well done and we'll deserved. But I don't think you will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OharePeter @mattsw_g @Jevo989 @themichaelowen Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen I never said Leeds played bad. They deserved a point. But anybody thinking this Leeds team will talk into the top ten are stupid.Fulham spent £100m and got relegated. There's no guarantee you'll be able to stamp your foot. Just because you were good in the championship means nish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsw_g @Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Oh here we go. The championship and the premier League are a whole different ball game. Anybody going into the prem thinking theyll walk it are deluded. Just because you had a good GD in the championship doesn't mean youll have good goal DF in the prem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jevo989 @OharePeter @themichaelowen Yeah and I never once said Leeds played a bad game. They deserved a point. It was a great game. But they looked leaky  Not in terms of just goals, but conceding possession in dangerous places. Need to tighten that up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OharePeter @themichaelowen Say it loud from the back. Had a big argument on here last night when I said if they defended like they did they would struggle. Absolute blinkers thinking theyll get top half. Astute teams will pick them off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oasis Lee Evans 💪👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nar_eik @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 Again. It's not that ball deflects off his leg. It's that when it does deflect, it hits his arm because it's an unnatural position. If his arm is by his side like Hendricks for Newcastle earlier, it doesn't hit it. It's handball because of where his arm is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I'm a barista when it comes to a coffee, you'd be safe 😂 I'm sure they will! Someone for everyone and all that ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll It's a shame I'm in the UK because I'm an absolute delight, kidding.😂 you'll meet someone in time 😁💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discodaveforest @omid9 Never once you would be shit. I said you didn't look steady at the back. Which you didn't. If that's changes good on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 Ah yes, that's why you act like a child on twitter 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 12 year olds are funny 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 No he supports Chelsea 😂 and no that's not true at all but I'm glad you're narrow minded enough to think that 😂 just because you disagree it doesn't mean you're right.  You too darling 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nar_eik @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 Same thing happened with Jeff Hendrick a minute a go, arm was down by his side, VAR checked it and didn't give it. Do that with the Leeds handball it's not a pen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 I never brought it up Omid did and then you took it upon yourself to comment after my reply. So you obviously objected to my opinion. An uneducated lazily formed opinion is worth as much as your opinion as it is any because it's an opinion  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikejoycedrums Melts me every time ❤️😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nar_eik @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 Of course it does. If his arm is down by his side, it's not given because it doesn't hit his arm. It only hits his arm because it's in no mans land. Doesn't matter who you were playing, it's a penalty all day long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 Fair point, one in how many? I love how touchy people get over an opinion. I literally said Leeds looked leaky. I didn't say theyd get relegated but I still think you'll struggle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 It's not just about the goals you concede though. It's how you defend, they looked all over the place. As did Liverpool. Look,  I'm not saying Leeds won't do well, but look at Fulham when they spent £100m and still went down. It seems people think Leeds will get top half. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discodaveforest @omid9 The most important foundation for any team coming up to the prem is restricting the amount of goals you concede. A decent GD is as good as points at the bottom, that's why it's important to have a solid back line. They didn't look solid. Neither did Liverpool. But different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discodaveforest @omid9 Yup, and it was a superb game to watch and they did well. Deserved a point. However, as I say. Doesn't matter who you're up against if you're back line is a over the place you'll struggle. IE Liverpool. I just think Leeds need to tighten that up, a lot to lose at the bottom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nar_eik @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 That means nothing in real time  His arm was out like he was landing a plane. It's a bit naive of the defender to have his arms out. Watch most PL defenders, arms are tucked in because they know what happens if their arms are out and the ball hits it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 But as you say, new defence. It may improve but you'd hope it would. No easy games in the prem son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 Having a good defence in the championship means nothing when you come up to the prem, completely different ball game... That's not the point, I said Leeds looked leaky. I never mentioned Liverpool, you did. It's my opinion they didn't look steady across the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 So worrying how many goals you concede in a title race is more worrying than how many you concede trying to avoid relegation? Come off it, the game was superb, but as I say I thought Leeds looked Leaky. As did Liverpool, but Leeds need a solid defence if they want to stay up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 Please explain how a team who just won the league will be more worried than a team who just got promoted and who's main aim is to stay up? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 So did Liverpool in the prem 😂 its a season opener yes, but Leeds looked Leaky. That's not to say they would be against lesser teams, but I still think Leeds fans getting way ahead of themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Astonthebarber @GTTO2024 @nocontextfm1 Keep trying bro 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monkiimagic @omid9 Yeah that's a fair point 😂 I knew that as well. Big fail 😂 but my point still stands haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omid9 I wouldn't be so sure, a lot of teams are a lot solid than you faced today. You also look leaky. Admittedly did play some good stuff 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LUFCalex_ @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 If you watch most defenders these days. They took their arms in to avoid it, and if it does hit it by your side it can't be given. Having your arm out that far away from your body whether it deflects off him or not just gives the ref no other option. Shit really, game was superb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LUFCalex_ @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 In terms of the position of his arm, as soon as it hits it. It's a pen. It's just the defender being a little niave. Things like that often end up with a penalty because it's not in a position which seems natural. Even if it bounces off him, you can't have your arms out like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LUFCalex_ @Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 First one was always going to be given because of the position of his arm. It's slightly harsh I agree. But if his arm is down by his side, it wouldn't be hand ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 If his arm is down by his side, it's not hand ball. But his arm was out as if he was landing a plane. If it hits your arms in a position which seems unnatural, it's a pen 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of people praising #lfc #leeds and rightly so. However, I don't think that score line happens 20 games in. Liverpool rusty at the back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Astonthebarber @nocontextfm1 They were stone wall penalties 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Taught him well 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaimestaples This is what happens when you're stoned 😂 you get these reaaalll good ideas 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DennisC42526783 @KirstyLPorter @JeremyClarkson As much as I love Echoes, The Wall and Animals hit me differently, that's not to say I could still choose 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can't see her starting over Kane to be honest 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I watch The Wall I think " this is my favourite Floyd album". Then i listen to Animals or DSOTM and I'm no longer convinced my choice was correct. Ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 How has he pulled that one off? 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoneheadsPage I have an intercom to a communal door. I don't know what the answer is 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, being diagnosed with MS hit me like a brick, but when I put it into perspective. It could have been a whole lot worse. I'm thankful I've managed another six years without any significant damage 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstyLPorter @JeremyClarkson Thanks 😁 I couldn't even name my favourite Pink Floyd Album let alone song ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's be clear #pinkfloyd fans. You cannot have a favourite Floyd song. It is literally impossible to choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstyLPorter @JeremyClarkson You cannot have a favourite Pink Floyd song. It's literally impossible 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I don't have cream with mine ha. But I get what you're saying. I don't have sugar in either tea or coffee. I think it ruins the taste<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll dude,  you don't need no sugar in coffee 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody's clever nowadays<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 Exactly mate. It's a job. it's very intense. But it goes quick and there are some decent people there. That's good mate I'm glad. Been in a job you like is mint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBruce84 Praying you find her Alex. They're the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBruce84 Best thing to do would be to trace where you have been recently or know where she likes to go. Also take some hot food with you as she may smell it and approach you. Also try a dog whistle. We lost our Jack Russell and managed to find her that way. May not help but worth ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 Lost my job and couldn't get another so I'm a burger flipper at maccies at the minute 🙄😂🥺 just finished and I'm knackered 😂 hows your place? Better than your last? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benniebez1 @MustStopMS Mainly the latter for me 😂 and to be honest. I've only noticed it in the last year. It's not that bad really I can manage it. The fatigue is worse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @PaulPaulcourt75 Vast majority of kids are asymptomatic which means theyre not a carrier. Also, how can you expect young children to wear a mask they have absolutely no idea why. At the end of the day, if you want this to be over. Wear a mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @PaulPaulcourt75 As I say, the government are incompitent and mugged everybody off. But the point still stands that even if you don't agree with it. You have to think of the bigger picture. Some people will be terrified and rightly so. Kids aren't as susceptible to it and not many have died<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @PaulPaulcourt75 I agree the government has made an absolute arse of it. And it's probably why a lot of people resent this whole situation. When you're led by a bunch of goons people are gonna be against it. But to me. It's not just about me. It's about everyone else too :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @PaulPaulcourt75 Yeah but the difference is the players are tested regularly to make sure the risk of spreading it on the pitch or whatever is mitigated as much as possible. You can't test everyone in the street. I don't understand the whole anti mask thing, you have to be sensible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulPaulcourt75 @gowansstephen1 That's why I asked 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonManford @onepeloton Is this the start of a music video as well? 😉😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS It seems to be more apparent later on in the day. No idea why<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattFrampton Letting the ball go under your foot in a game you won 5-1 Vs getting caught out to go 1-0 down in extra time in a play off final. It certainly is the worst 😂 just saying LEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Oh mellisa you melt my heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emxblackx If I should get pizza or not, you? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There is great comfort in knowing that your values and struggles are relatable, but the only way to get that validation is by letting your guard down and becoming vulnerable,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine seeing David Gilmour live and he plays comfortably numb. I think I would pass out with joy 😭❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hcahocuspocus @Melissassmile He looks like he's waiting for an answer to the question he just asked you but already knows you're lying 😂😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@qikipedia Joey chestnut wasn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidlewissmart I agree on that, seen it on a few tweets about the staff thing. It makes no sense to inforce it on customers and not staff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidlewissmart It's like it everywhere mate. I went to a shop yesterday and the security guard said he couldn't enforce it, its the police to deal with<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Bury are 109 better than hull and they don't exist 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc You have to support a team near you if they're doing well. Apart from leeds 😂 I remember Harrogate in like county league. Amazing they've come this far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc That extra 9% makes all the difference 😂😂👌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@js1878 @appoefc They're just a dad and his son wanting to be part of the ceremony at home, yes its unbelievably cringy and embarrassing but if they want to feel part of something they're passionate about so be it. Don't make this out to be about cruelty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not having this at all 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>said this before. Supporting Liverpool isn't like supporting any other team. It's special. Everything means something, you're part of something which is more than just a club.I can't explain what it is.but been emotionally involved breaks you time and time again happy or sad #lfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YAAASSSSSSSSSSS @LFC   "I told my players it is a pleasure to play for you. And if they didn't believe me. They believe me now"  YOU LOVE TO SEE IT ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeTMitchell I mean. You've basically just lost £5 by backing city mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just used ambivalent in a sentence. 😊😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox I've said all along they don't exist. They're just your mind playing tricks. My grandma always says she believes in them " because of the things " she's seen which made no sense to me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back to work on Wednesday. Oh god<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Happy birthday Melissa! Have a wonderful day 👻😁🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ It's just the fact that they're getting further and further behind without the ability to challenge because they don't have the right model from the owners at the top to do it. And by the time they get to that level. The other teams will be even better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ That's the thing u don't think they've got the spending power like they did and can't afford what man city Liverpool United can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Yeah I see what you're saying. They're a bit more solid but that back four is awful and the midfield offers nothing. Take the forwards out that team and you're battling relegation honest to god<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesConlon_ I undervalued my family for too long 👻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ I don't think judging results against wolves and sheff United will cut it when we're talking about playing teams like city and Liverpool and arsenal and even Europe elite. They'd get mashed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ They need strengthening to make a fist of i think. Yes they won tonight but not because they were any good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ They're shite as usual. Just got lucky with the two mistakes They are way off top four.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually really nice to see the love for @daRealAkinfenwa especially from the big names and people. Well deserved ✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler Yeah exactly. A lack of investment from the owners is only going to go one way. If it was the manager who was shite I would say you have a point. But not when it's the owners. It kills the spirit of the club. Doesnt matter who the manager is. Were shite 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler I'm not saying you're wrong. But this all comes down to those at the top. The people care about the club but the owners don't. It's a poisoned chalice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler Not to the fans and the people who care about the club. It's the owners and the owners only. Fans don't deserve it one bit. Bury, Coventry, Portsmouth, Blackpool, Sunderland. Bolton, Wigan the list goes on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler You literally said you deserve to be in league one if your owners are shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler Well no. They deserve to be in league one because of how shit we are 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cIutchs Mate I'm literally listening to that song right now wtf 😳🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waller_matty @DavidMeyler They go hand in hand though. Bad owners won't invest in a good playing squad. They smother the club for the money and let it rot. No fan deserves what happened to portsmouth or Sunderland or bury no matter what your  agenda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull What the bloody hell are we doing in hull?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't I have something like this 😂 it's what dreams are made of for us FM loving blokes ( and ladies ) 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_Richardson45 @HullCity Been like that way before Bowen left pal. Recall the squad before the prem season Bruce left. That was the beginning of the end for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The issue is. How do you keep mccan after this shit show?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HullCity Oh dear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeTMitchell He's leaving next week lad don't worry 😂 him and bowler are exactly the same. Yeah he is. Be a big player in that midfield in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeTMitchell Tbf, the whole squad is. Lopez is making a massive difference when transitioning forward though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeTMitchell 2-0 up mate 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@conpryde Quick question if I may, trying to use the acapella app but for some reason when recording the second video it seems to be with heavy distortion and not clean like how I recorded it. I have no idea why 😑 am I been thick or is there a way to stop that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkFloydPolls @GilmourOrgasm @davidgilmour @rogerwaters @nickmasondrums @pinkfloyd Wish you were here I reckon or Pigs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@conpryde Did you use an app for this? I need it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avadevbh @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson Makes no sense but okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avadevbh @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson No, no they won't 😂 there's a reason why bottles of bleach still say " do not drink " on them. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as the windshield melts, My tears evaporate leaving only charcoal to defend. Finally I understand the feelings of the few. Ashes and diamonds, Foe and friend  We were all equal in the end.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly, hot weather can fuck off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaggedLittleMe Worst thing you can do is use Google mate I wouldn't advise it ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity @PJBuckingham @bbcburnsy Not far wrong 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaggedLittleMe Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clarksville999 She is beautiful. Thank you for saving her :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you have to do is read the replies to this to realise how fucking stupid and racist some people are, yet they act like they don't know it. Inbreds the lot of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity @PJBuckingham @bbcburnsy About the same price as David Luiz then? Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do any #hcafc #hullcity @HullCity happen to know what this would be worth?

<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Completely agree Elliot. I find it really difficult to support the club at the minute. Every single news story and game is just bad news and it just doesn't look good. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if we ended up back in league two<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some absolute wet wipes on here. Total fucking morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFoxon @BurnleyOfficial Because white privelidge has led to the black lives matter movement whose only aim is for equality for black people, if you don't see how a white lives matter banner is ridiculously calous after the whole George Floyd thing. You need to read a history book :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevenG1896 @Ademolaxxxx @premierleague @budfootball There's was nothing wrong with his performance at all. Don't forget it's the first game and they'll be rusty. he was our biggest threat on the right in the first half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbichene @Ademolaxxxx @premierleague @budfootball Because crosses are the be all and end all for full backs, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ademolaxxxx @premierleague @budfootball He wasn't rubbish. But he wasn't MOTM and I'm a Liverpool fan. Sky gave it comeman and I think that fair. He was excellent up against Mane 🙄🤮😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Parky08 Honestly? No.  I was all for the re start just to finish the season, but without crowds it's lacking so much atmosphere that makes football amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Yup, seen one on your video beard 😂 top work again my man 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZionWRLD @MJ_7462 @HullCity Okay bro, okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ_7462 @ZionWRLD @HullCity The Leeds thing is tricky. We see them as rivals and they don't really care about us, but they do have this ridiculous notion they're a massive team when they're not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simply_Palace @robbie210793 @cj9714 @Bjorkstan23 @HullCity There are a lot worse teams in the prem than palace I will say that. I can't dislike them either ha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bjorkstan23 @HullCity LUFC in bio Charlton badge as profile picture  You sir can say fuck all about anybody when you're sporting that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull He needs to go. No win in ten, don't look like scoring let alone winning. Need a change or were going down. But then again with 8 games left it may be too late. Ah well. League one tour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off @HullCity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mccan out. Now. #hcafc #goingdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ It would worry me more if people disagreed. It's so obvious how bad he is<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichardRooker It's amazing to watch and think how he got in that position in the first place. Honestly, if he could he would go to war with every country to prove he's the best president they've ever had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardRooker Always been the case. The pandemic isn't helping, people are fed up, trump just isn't going to do any justice to his cause with his press conferences, the guy can't string a normal sentence together 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardRooker True! But as much as Johnson is a womble. Even he wouldn't stand in front of a crowd and say today was a good day for a murdered black man. The guy is crackers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the fuck are Americans so stupid to elect a president like Trump? The guy is so out his depth he doesn't know what he's doing. His speeches are meaningless and to be honest they would annoy me as an American. the guys in fucking cookoo land<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@franklivsyu @RishiSunak Fuck the thousands that died or will die because of people breaking the rules then 🤣 as long as his little boy is okay. Apart from driving him in a car where he didn't know if he could see or not. That poor boy 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpeache16 I'm not worrying. I'm perfectly fine knowing Cummings is a lying elitist 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpeache16 Never give up trying buddy 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpeache16 Were you born thick? .  Probably why you dont realise what Cummings has done has shit on you. Oh boy  https://t.co/Q0BBlvXgRq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpeache16 No profile picture. No followers. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelneptustar @BorisJohnson Angie. To decent people who have adjusted to the rules he looks like an absolute cockwomble. You cannot implement the rules and then break them yourself. Nobody will ever trust a word you say ever again. In the coming days and weeks they will realise the scale of the uproar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@15pintsplease @BorisJohnson That's not quite true.  Most people across britain who have sacrificed something. Lost loved ones. Not seen family for months will care about this more than you can imagine. Spitting on everyone who has done something to help combat this. Cummings exploited his own rules. End of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamNo0neNow @BorisJohnson If people believed him they need to be culled from the Gene pool. The guy literally admitted breaking the rules three times . Anybody else and their toast. But without him this government would collapse in on itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzgie @BorisJohnson What car do you know that can travel 250 miles without needing fuel and or a break? 🤔 He's pulled the wool right over your eyes hasn't he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzgie @BorisJohnson I think you need to go back and check out what he actually did? He broke the rules. Simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@15pintsplease @BorisJohnson But, they do? A lot of people are mad and rightly so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANSTELLOK @BorisJohnson He could make Sooty and sweep look clever 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Darling @BorisJohnson Please explain to me what you actually mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntonyStyles5 @BorisJohnson Exactly. It's untenable. Everybody saw through it for what it was. The only reason Johnson hasn't sacked him is because he knows without him the government has the capability to collapse. That's the state of it. Very dangerous scenario<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does @BorisJohnson not realise that every thing he is saying about the public effort and the spread of the virus makes Cummings look even worse?  What a shit show this is #BorisJohnston #lies #SackBorisAndDom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @piersmorgan I love that episode 🤣  Ey that's my video recorder ahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlB_93 @BBCNews @itvnews @piersmorgan @vicderbyshire @Lord_Sugar You have to hold people accountable for the fuck you he has sent out the British public. He is a cretin. Caroline flack didn't deserve the amount of abuse she got. But people in the limelight know it's a dangerous game to flout the rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlB_93 @BBCNews @itvnews @piersmorgan @vicderbyshire @Lord_Sugar I think destroying a man's character is a lot less important than him destroying public health advice for his own selfishness. The story was complete bollocks. He just thought he would get away with it. personal attacks aren't great. But attacks on his actions and morales is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlB_93 @BBCNews @itvnews @piersmorgan @vicderbyshire @Lord_Sugar That's completely different tbf mate. The hounding of Caroline flack was nonsense and shouldn't have happened. But this guy has gambled with people's lives when those very people stuck to the rules when he didn't. it's a punch in the face to everyone who sacrificed something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark_Spencer Was you born thick or did you just become completely ignorant and out of touch with modern day Britain? Whatever he span today he span himself out of any respect decent normal people had for him. It was an absolute car crash and you know it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. He's basically just said the public are thick as pig shit for not spotting the loop hole.  Ridiculous #cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turner_hull @jamiewhittleton 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton It's more than a car journey mate. Biggest scandal for a long time. He's undermined my effort. Your effort, your parents efforts. Nurses efforts. Key workers efforts by ignoring his own rules. This press conference confirms he broke them. The NHS survived because of us, not him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You seeked medical advise before you drove back. Did you seek medical advice before you went to Durham.  No.  GAME.SHOT.MATCH  #coronavirus #bullshit #guilty #cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" testing my eyesight"  WITH YOUR 4 YEAR OLD CHILD IN THE CAR.   Fuck off mate   #cummings #liar #LockdownIsOverThanksDom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_smith1987 @BethRigby Sensational upfront questions. He couldn't answer them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sensational blabbering to divert the actual fact he broke the lockdown rules three times. #cummings #doneanddusted #getout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You've used your privelidge to do what you want Ordinary people stuck to the rules because you told them to. You exploited it. Just resign. #cummings #liar #outoftouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you had the virus but still went to Durham. Right  You broke the rules of the lockdown. Simple as that #cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's done exactly what I thought he would do, looking for sympathy. #getout #youbrokethelaw #conman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is irreparable no matter which way you look at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baddiel @mrchrisaddison Just thought exactly the same. The longer he makes people wait the more pissed off people will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Sun is shining in the sky.theres not a cloud in sight 🎶🎶 la la la la 🎶🎶😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Nah mate. It's up to the parents to decide if it's in their best interests. You said it, not me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If in this press conference today Cummings doesn't resign then the government really are fucked. Nobody in the public will accept what hes done. I can't wait for the sob story #cummimgsout #cumgate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man puts nation in lockdown Man gets rumbled for breaking his own lockdown Man breaks lockdown for a second time.  Press get slammed for hounding Cummings after he broke the rules.  He is literally mugging every single person in this county off and laughing in your faces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More bothered about the press hounding a con man than what the con man has actually done. Fuck him, the guy should be out a job for being a hypocrite..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GallIain It literally backfires on him in every way possible. No way should you be travelling 300 miles in a car with someone who has coronavirus symptoms. Let alone during his own lockdown. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campanafin @Tim_Burgess @mrdanwalker @GMB @piersmorgan @BBCBreakfast @Channel4News @krishgm Nobody has confirmed that story about his boy. Also, if he's driving to Durham from London with the virus isn't he risking spreading it to people up there? Oh and also, your efforts to self isolate now mean fuck all 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Posted on Facebook. I wont ever entertain anyone who backs this government ever again after this. I'm beyond angry.  #fuckyouboris #BorisTheButcher #disgrace @piersmorgan  https://t.co/1tMrdvykqU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidlewissmart She is sensational<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is absolutely fantastic, fair play 👍 we all know the truth, we've all seen through the deceit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hollyamcd @EviesAunty 100% a spin on the reason he went to mitigate the reaction he would have got if he had not said it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder what his reaction was when he saw the headlines 🤣 #BorisJohnsonCoronavirus #bottler #CumminsSacked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldengirlnot I'm so sorry. It's absolutely horrific. I hope when the time comes you get better. Wishing you luck 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It stuns me that Boris Johnson thought that at his press conference and defence of Cummings was, in any way, a good idea... #boris #fuckedit #BorisTheBottler #cummmings #johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@showmetheguac It's always nap time. Woohoo!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JLizB8700 I was confused by it. It didn't make sense at first but then when I read the comments I got it 🤣 I was stunned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLizB8700 I was just going to say the same thing. It is so nieve of him to think he would get away with it 😬 yup, nothing will change, until the elections etc etc. Yeah that's a good point. Government will use it as a deterrent to their short comings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"in the clearest way Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and the letter of the lockdown" 😳 WOW Even the daily mail has turned on them.  Jesus! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isnt going to go away @BorisJohnson #borisjohnsonspeech #BorisTheBottler #youcouldntmakeitup  https://t.co/FEoP1ht8SX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AHEM #borisjohnsonout #bottledit #government #shitshow  https://t.co/Rsxho2XEOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLizB8700 The fact the civil service has done that against the prime minister is a much bigger issue than the cost of a job, it's pretty much put the nail in the coffin for the government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyCoyle89 Just unfortunate they've pulled all the trees down and burnt them all in front of us 😬🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Until you have to on 300 mile journey right 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 The general public breaking the rules as bad as it is. Isn't a big deal. A senior adviser in the government doing it in broad day light and then been defended by an inept prime minister is a massive issue. Beggining of the end for these lot now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 You know that contradicts your own point massively right? 🤣 You can't tell the public to do one thing and then do the other. Once that happens. You've lost.  There is a lot more on the line than a mate backing you up. Thousand of people have died and he's just undermined it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Also the issue is that people have had to watch family members funerals on video calls or haven't seen their parents and then they die and can't go. The issue is that if the government can't follow it's own rules and then condones one of them breaking it were all fucked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 I find it hard to believe that you don't see anything wrong with it when kim goes to work every day and puts herself at risk every time she does. We've all made sacrifices because of this. If a government figure doesn't, then the rule is invalid. Come on Steve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Have a look at what's happened with Dominic Cummings. I'll wait 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 All I will say is would you go and spit on the graves of all those who died from Covid-19? Because that is exactly what Johnson has just done 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebr98325879 @piersmorgan I don't think we are buddy.  https://t.co/Zrqq7pFIG1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySports @DWindass10 Goosebumps every single time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Boris is sat in downing Street thinking "shit, what have I done, I'm dust" Or he's thinking " that went well, I'm sure the public will believe what I said because they're thick" And let me tell you, it's not the first one... #BorisJohnson #nobackbone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this should show anything. It's that #ToryBritain has never been about the people. It's always been about them and their self interests. They don't care about us. They care more about their backers who fund them. Simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraddersOak Yeah i agree on reflection Labour are way off. But this will make a difference at the polls. Especially if the public no longer trust Johnson to lead the country which now feels inevitable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This government's leadership after this is untenable. It is nothing short of a shit show to defend Cummings. When everybody else in the UK is doing as they're told. It's laughable he gets away with it. One rule for one. one rule for another. Fuck em. Get them out  #johnsonout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot on.   This government is a joke. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnsonMustGo the government has shown a total disregard for the British public with all the Cummings. They are well and truly done and they know it. that's why they're defending Cummings. They have no other option. The people will see through it and its only going to get worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is done. Nobody in this country should trust him after this. Absolute womble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best day of my life ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danny__kruger So are you going to refund all the fines to the people who received one for breaking the rules because you clearly deem travelling 300 miles acceptable ? Oh no wait. You're a Tory government and don't care about anyone but yourselves. Fuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Good luck ☺️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Withdraw yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 You mean like the personal attacks on nurses and doctors who put their lives on the front line. ABSOLUTELY SUNSHINE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 I'd chop you up and feed you to the pigs mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Let's hope you never have to go to hospital then 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 🤣 so every person who's ever been on life support has been murdered because they turned the machine off? Ok 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Again, makes no sense. If you were infected you'd go to hospital, and once again. you must think nurses are selfish people then? Hahahaha have a day off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 That doesn't mean the picture relates to that?   I really don't have time for people like you. Let's hope you never have to go to hospital to be treated by these nurses. Because if they ever found out, they'd turn the machine off 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Okay. So tell me when this picture was taken and where? You don't know nothing, at all. Your giving your view on the presumption that nurses are careless yet you wouldn't give a shit about that if you were on a hospital ward fighting for your life 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 " proudly been stupid"  So after a 13 hour shift or putting themselves on the front line you don't think they deserve respite to raise their morale? Or do you not think most people want to see nurses with a smile on their face while trying to stay positive while battling this? Hm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 And you know this how? My sister is a nurse and they didn't have relevant PPE for a while but still went to work every single day. Yet somehow according to you, it's their fault. 🤔 Do you really think nurses and doctors choose to be at risk? Strange one that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 I'm lost for words at your ignorance  Let's hope you never need to use the NHS then. Because your view on this is completely fucking wrong. It's not as if they choose to go to work and put themselves at risk because of the ppe now is it? They don't have a choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallywilts @martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Never said that. But when they're putting there lives at risk every single day to make sure people get better, I feel a certain amount of appreciation should be shown. Not this bullshit this guy spouts, it isn't needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdSmith62089694 @ProfKarolSikora The thing that I look at is the overall population of the world. 8 billion people is 8000 million people. 5m cases sounds a lot and it's tragic. But kept under control the majority of people on this planet will be safe :) we just need to be sensible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 Those very nurses may save you or someone you loves life and you'll change your tune about the people who did everything to make sure you or they stayed alive.. If you don't appreciate the doctors and nurses of this country. Don't use the NHS, we would be nowhere without them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 So nurses on the frontline who put themselves at high risk every single day try and lighten the mood and they're spirits by dancing and you have a problem with it? Okay 👍 my sister is a nurse and believe me, during a 13 hours shift a little bit of humour goes along way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinlarge2019 @louanndavies @Suewilson91 This literally makes no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Maybe you need to invest in a large umbrella 😁 sounds scary though 😬 I've noticed how bad my body is at regulating temperature. it sucks! 😟<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hippotigerdile @juliejmoses @handymelon @herdyshepherd1 Makes no sense to make a sheep do it when you can get a dog that will gladly walk for you. Blows my mind people think this is perfectly acceptable towards an animal. Just for a few points In a beauty contest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @andrewrobertso5 @JamesMilner @MGmotor OFAH was the only one worthy of winning this. National treasure that programme<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Thanks. You could have not bothered commenting and let me do that anyway but meh 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Oh Dr Annie. If you dig deep enough you may find Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vikkilunn @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 If that video is of a 60 year old man doing that to the sheep your views would be completely different. Don't let the fact its a three year old girl cloud your judgment that this is perfectly fine. To me, it isn't. Take it or leave it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vikkilunn @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Not in the case of the animal though. That's all I'm bothered about. That sheep does not belong in a beauty contest. It's a sheep and should be allowed to do what sheep do. That's all I've ever said. People have commented because they don't like that idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vikkilunn @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Here we go again round in circles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 I was comparing the treatment of both. Not comparing animals. You really are looking for things that aren't there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 A comparison made to the fact that slaves where dragged around on ropes and chains similar to that of the sheep. Verrryyyy offensive. If you thought it was ridiculous you could have just not tried to take the morale high ground. But we live and learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 No no, I voiced my opinion. You took up the obligation to try and belittle that opinion because it doesn't align with your own. Just because it's different doesn't mean you are right or I am. But you carry on trying to raise an argument to boost your self esteem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goosebumps 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vikkilunn @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 No I'm just bored of people been offended by an opinion. Just because you don't like it, it doesn't mean you're right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @vikkilunn @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Quite the contrary. You are entitled to your opinion. I wasn't the one who singled out a comment on twitter and decided to start an argument. You could have walked away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vikkilunn @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 You're like the 5th person to drag this up. Go back through my old tweets I'm not going through it all again no matter how much you're looking for an argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar It still baffles me that even after thousand of years of faith that nobody has figured out what gender their god is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar Because a woman would do a much better job then creating the most intelligent species in the universe and then let it destroy it self. But as I say, it isn't real. So I don't worry about things like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar That's because he doesn't exist. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar Hehe, better hope that God of yours puts me in hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar I'm nice and calm me 😂 you're the one going mental over someones OPINION 😂 joker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar Nope, never been vegan. I just care about animals. I'm a bad bad person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar 😂 you've lost your head mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IksarCleric @emilbordon And let's be honest if that sheep headbutts her and injured her, which it nearly did. You'd all be saying it was a stupid idea putting a fucking sheep near a 3 year old girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IksarCleric @emilbordon I haven't said anything that is fact. I have continuously said it's my opinion which it seems had upset people quite a bit 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made me chuckle 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar I don't own a dog. But a dog and a sheep are completely different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar At the end of the day James. Since your so triggered. I won't apologise for caring about the wellbeing of an animal. Whether you agree or disagree with me I know my love for animals is ten fold what yours is. And I can sleep at night knowing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 I just want a beer and a curry in spoons mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 It's the hope that kills you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeScott92 Fantastic mate! Hope he makes it home in no time 🙏😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceblue @Sean_M_Lewis 😂 the biggest solution would be to leave animals to their own devices and not exploit them to win a beauty contest. But I guess its just preference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceblue @Sean_M_Lewis The age of the child has nothing to do with it. Neither has the fact of whether the sheep is treated good or not. I don't believe it's right. You believe it is. Make sure you pick your toys up out of the pram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceblue @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 opinions aren't wrong 😂 they just don't align with your opinion. So we won't ever agree. Try all you like to chanheu mind.   You won't.  Goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Well that's an improvement right! The only way is up!! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll That's not good. Are you not having a good day? 😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @Jay_LeeJohnson @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 😂 met one in a baahhhh once 😂 that's good I'll give you that. .anyway, I'm not been ridiculous, I stick by my belief in the way you stick by yours. The difference been is I didn't comment on somebody's post just to make mysel feel better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_LeeJohnson @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Again. Trained. I don't get why people have such a problem with my concern for the animals wellbeing. I guess I just have a reasonable amount of empathy. My bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar If that makes me a bad person. Well I sleep fine at night with my morals especially for animals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar I'm trolling nobody 😂 it is my belief the video is cruel.  Her pet is sheep fine . But it's a sheep. Let it do what sheep's do  Because for some reason the ones who don't have a voice need someone who does to stand up for them once in a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Haha James don't give up the day Job eh 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphixy Sorry :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliejmoses @handymelon @herdyshepherd1 Or she's scared that if she doesn't obey the rope will hurt her even more. I'm just sympathsing with the animal. There is no need to be doing this whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@handymelon @juliejmoses @herdyshepherd1 Or because the rope hurts, or because she's scared of what will happen, or maybe she just likes been on the end of a rope 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliejmoses @handymelon @herdyshepherd1 No no, not a vegan in the slightest. I just think this is wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliejmoses @handymelon @herdyshepherd1 Again, you could dress it up in a bow tie and an expensive suit and I still wouldn't agree a sheep should be pressed around a field<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@914medallo @K2thebizA @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 It would run away if not on a rope. Simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesecar @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 😂 I am!. I just care about animals and I empathize with them. I absolutely guarantee you it makes me feel better. Having a child is different as I've said before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @K2thebizA @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Ah I wondered when the argument would run dry and the pettiness would start. Don't let yourself down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sobbloo The sheep literally nearly headbutts the girl twice 😂 and is grunting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Brilliant. Changed the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sobbloo Me? 😂 I'm not the poor thing. The sheep on the end of a rope is. 😂🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sobbloo Domesticated as farm animals to stay in a field and eat grass until we decide it's time for the dinner plate, not to win an award that means nothing apart from humans wanting a bit of fame and money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sobbloo @Sean_M_Lewis @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Again. I've seen men pull aeroplanes. The sheep goes nowhere without a rope, it runs off. The reason it moves is because the rope hurts, easier to obey then be in more pain,right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @MissLMLewis1 @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 I just want to say that you are entitled to your opinion. I respect that opinion. But I disagree with it and I will fight my cause for those who don't have a voice. I hope that's the end. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K2thebizA @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 I mean domesticated enough to live in your home. as I have said, it isn't a dog. Leave it to it's devices away from all the fashion show bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_M_Lewis @graceblue And yes I eat meat. Not lamb, but other meats. Do I feel guilty about it, yes. Do I want to change that. Yes. Is it difficult in today's society? Ssometimes. And sometimes those who don't have a voice need the ones who do to stick up for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_M_Lewis @graceblue No, I care about animals enough to be bothered by something which doesn't sit right with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceblue @Sean_M_Lewis And there's my point. " Trained"   It's a sheep, not a dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K2thebizA @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Again. Domesticated animal who is capable of understanding basic commands. Take the rope away that sheep is not doing what you want it do. It's a "wild" animal that belongs in a field. Whether that's to be slaughtered or not. Let it keep its dignity it was born with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graceblue @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 And as my previous tweets. It's a sheep. Not a dog. There is no place to be training animals that aren't domesticated. Leave them alone to do what they were born to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clancarrdorset @fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Please read previous comments. Im not getting into this with you as well, sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @MissLMLewis1 @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 It could be wearing a bow tie and an expensive suit and I still wouldn't condone it been tied to a rope and dragged around a field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 You're on a different planet. 😂 My comparison is because you condone this animal been treated like a slave. Dragged around with ropes and made to do what the other person on the other side of the rope wants. In what way is my comment racist. Rasicm has no place anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @MissLMLewis1 @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Don't tie ropes around their face and drag them round a field when he's doing it though does he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 It has a rope around its face been tugged by the girl. What else is it going to do. It won't run off for fear the rope will hurt more than it does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 No, I said animals don't have the intellectual capacity that humans have. They have always been our understudys, following commands and orders because they either know no different or are scared. I would love to know what your opinion on slavery is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @914medallo @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Okay, I was wrong on that. But that's not my point. No matter where that rope is, it is the main reason that sheep does exactly what that little girl wants. Get rid of the rope the sheep is going nowhere or it runs off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@handymelon @juliejmoses @herdyshepherd1 Why does the sex of the sheep matter? 😂 Equally so, training a sheep.Sheep are not meant to be trained. They are not dogs who have some understanding of human characteristics and commands.That sheep walks because it has a rope around its face.take the rope away it goes nowhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@914medallo @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 If somebody put a rope around your neck and pulled it to the point it was uncomfortable you would walk wherever they wanted you to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@914medallo @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 That literally makes no sense. All those things are materialistic that man has made because of our intellect and consciousness, which animals do not have. It's like saying a car has leather seats so it must be good to drive. Means fuck all. It's a sheep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_M_Lewis @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 Also. I've seen grown men pull aeroplanes. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_M_Lewis @fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 So if you're walking a dog and it doesn't want to walk what happens? You have to make it, by pulling the lead and instructing it to move with you. The little girl is cute, but making a sheep do this isn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 The girl literally has two hands on the rope and the rope is not slack. Which suggests the reluctance of the animal to walk. If he wanted to, he would be happy to walk on a slack lead. Just like a dog is when it's trudging along next to you.But keep those blinkers on eh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzymittens @emilbordon @herdyshepherd1 @TeaJunkie1 What, a sheep that roams the land loves a rope been put around her neck and dragged along?   Of course she loves it. Who wouldn't 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrwhite321 @danilio95 ,😂 ahahaha ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JEGullis @mrjamesob Right. So the amount of deaths we are seeing is not a result of the government's failure to react quick enough. Give your head a wobble.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hulllive Its probably a comet, I saw something about it the other day. It just skims the earth's orbit. I may be wrong though 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Michael58739848 @tariqpanja I think you're missing the point. They bribed them, which basically means the other countries didn't stand a chance, all the money spent to try and win was for nothing, it's shithousery to the max<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Exactly! 😏 That's what made senna what he was. He could pull something off nobody else on the track would even dream about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Convinced senna would have won so many more titles had he not been killed. Prost was one of the few who could push him but never really got close enough if that makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull You just knew he was a winner just by how he acted. Legend<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I pray every day that I get a message and it's you 🎵🎧🎵🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a result lads! @HullCity #hcafc. Not often i say this but I am so proud of this team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity GET IN THERE!!!! Best performance of the season that. Took our chances. Get in, buzzing 😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity come on lads, get the big man up top on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity COMMEE ONNNN YOU HHHUULLLLL ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not saying im jealous of my little sister but. I AM VERY JEALOUS.❤️❤️  https://t.co/VSNMkcetN4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity can we get every one on board with this please! Never known tension like it since Coleen Rooney had something to say...  https://t.co/Pcjv23UzRi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HULB04 is the best thing I've seen on twitter for a long time 👍😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like this coronavirus. But I also like this coronavirus. But which is better. There's only one way to find out....  https://t.co/LRS5nFbS8V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely fuck all 😖🤪 #skysports #nowt #turnitoverimnotwatchingthis  https://t.co/jU3U9L5EGf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WatfordFC @LCFC @FootballManager The scenes in the production office when that equaliser went in  https://t.co/ILmVY16E4x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Hard to disagree with this tbh 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyKaveh Tbf we all know Brady is a sandwich short of a picnic. Different story if West Ham were chasing top 5 like Sheff United or runaway leaders in the prem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport Cheers Floyd, it's the rhetoric you've used for the past 6 months and it isn't getting any better, it's really frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched interstella again. What a film, one of my faves 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on that sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright alright alright  https://t.co/w9PXbaGF3J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when you're really agitated for no apparent reason? That's me right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexDolly Not much better than a nice spliff to get you to sleep Doyle. 😋😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Corteeners are shite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spraggy Is it weird that Olaf actually looks like you spraggy? Or am I just seeing things here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity @FareShareHull Well done lads! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Dawson free kick Vs Kidderminster. 2003/04. My first game 😍☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AVFCOfficial @AVFCFoundation Fair play 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ted246_ @piersmorgan My thoughts exactly 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Yup. Just finished it. Unreal film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHillidge @StanCollymore "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease". Yet millions of people get the flu every year. hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The revenant is on Netflix. That's my late night entertainment sorted 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @BrianUkulele Why would I not? If theyre not infected I have no reason not to. And anyway, if I could I would quite happily fit the Burden of having the virus if it meant they never got it. Because they're family and I love them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLMLewis1 dye reckon 😂🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcchalk @StanCollymore "A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease" yet somehow millions of people get the flu every year , strange that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that amazes me is how slow governments have reacted. As soon as one case is reported: close the borders. Tell people to isolate who are unwell. Trace contacts from first case. Would slow the spread right down. Why wait until it's too late? #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am very sad that @premierleague will probably be suspended in the year #Liverpoolfc run away with the league, however, people's lives are way more important than a piece of metal and a name on a board. I care more for others than winning a league. Sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Right decision though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Had to be done. Not sure doing it the way Pearson did it was the right one but 3 wins from 15+ games and performances like tonight are always gonna end up the way it has<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHillidge @StanCollymore Except it's not a vaccine. If it was a vaccine you wouldn't get the flu regularly, it's more of picture repair kit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 so 🤔 your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore There's no vaccine for the flu! Otherwise the flu wouldn't exist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been saying for months #hullfc need to give Radford the chop. Form since last season is woeful, another pathetic display tonight. Two challenge cups blinding those who think he's the man, he isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a chat in the village pub earlier about #Covid_19 and said it could kill millions. The barman said nah it won't kill millions. YOU WANNA BET? 4% OF 7 billion people is millions. This is why we need to act and act fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iatemuggles Only fools and horses 👍☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expecting my first shifts to come on the portal today.  None.   Fuming 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperbiaCity 😂 concentrate on your own team pal 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spraggy Billy is going to be so pissed off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 Tongue in cheek ye melon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 pissing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kinglrg_ @Jennwilliams23 Brilliant 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Ooo that's weird! I didn't know that was a thing 🤔😖 were they bad? I used to get them all the time when I was younger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll That's true! They know about the tiredness and loss of appetite, this taste is fairly new but I will tell them about it, did you have any strange ones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't really like water. But put ice in it and chill it right down and I'm all for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Ah, well at least I'm not the only one 😂 it's only come on last couple of days and isn't a massive problem. I just noticed it earlier. Thanks!! ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is pissing it down lads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll hey! Did you ever have a kinda metallic taste in your mouth when taking Mavinclad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to go for a drive in the rain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Cutteeeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just suspend all international travel. Commit to social distancing. Ensure shops have stock of essentials, pay those who need it to get by, fuck the consequences. Millions of people's lives are at serious risk all over the globe. Oh and nuke China , dirty bastards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wind is gonna rip the side of this building off, jesus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in a city centre flat on MY OWN with no job ( soon to be changed though ). I suffer with depression and anxiety and I'm a tad overweight but hey.🌝, Not like this coronavirus is gonna make my life that much worse, unless it kills me 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government need to act now while there is a chance it can be contained. We don't want to be like Italy. This virus will kill millions if were not sensible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have wrapped that up in 90 mins. Atletico goal just shocked them. Disappointing #Liverpoolfc #LIVATL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanCollymore I can't see any other way around it. They can't finish the season until it's I set control. It's just too risky now players are getting infected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Best video on the internet that😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 I agree , 33 shots on goal and not winning is criminal. It's a bit unlucky tbf, but have to take your chances<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Olympiacos 😂🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Would still be 2-0 if Allison was inbetween the sticks. Adrian has done okay but this is completely different level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was good while it lasted 😂😵😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Urgh. That is so poor from Adrian. #LIVATL need a better back up keeper than him I'm afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a howler Adrian jesus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YAAASSSSSS!!! GET IN THERE!! @LFC beautiful! #LIVATL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea how this has stayed 1-0 #Liverpoolfc #LIVATL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to say that the fact my 3g works better than my 4g and has done for a number of months is ridiculous @ThreeUK . How can you say you're getting 5g when this doesn't even work. It's a load of rubbish and needs sorting before I leave you. I'm sick of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AHH @ThreeUK never change will you. Not as if I pay you or anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is Liverpool's for the taking. Atletico can't get out and don't have the pace to match. #lfc #differentteam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll DO I?! 🤔 We need a sleep off. set your alarm. On your marks. Sleep ☺️☺️😌😌😴😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yup, normally I dont hear anything! 🤓 Sounds amazing, enjoy! I'm holding off until it's bed time later 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll No, I'm THE WORLDS GREATEST NAPPER! 👻☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I hope so, I'm glad they've sent me a letter though I don't think they've do e that before. Exactly! I'm not complaining, I love sleep!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yup, me too! Especially when capaxone wasn't working. Though these tablets have wiped me out 😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I was surprised, I've never had that before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Letter from hospital that my latest MRI shows no change to my previous. That's something good. I'm in shock 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapitalOneUK offering me a new credit limit and then telling me I can't have it when I click on the link is a bit low don't you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The national living wage is a con  The more you increase it. The more things cost. You literally aren't benefiting from it going up. The markets will follow suit and raise the prices. You don't gain anything. #budget2020 #con<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baffling that atletico fans can't go to see their own team at home yet can visit the UK to go to a game 🤔 taking this very seriously it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seagull outside needs to stop chirping. I'm trying to sleep you inconsiderate prick 🤫😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarvesterEAS @BarryJGleed @FootyAccums Normal flu is a coronavirus, there isn't a vaccine. You can get a " a flu shot " but this won't mean you won't get the flu. time will tell how it deals with summer in the next few months. It may disappear like the normal flu does but then reappear when it gets cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ All comes down the jokers at the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Be another bury if they're not careful pal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ It's a right mess. The director just resigned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I'm going to when I get home. I've come to my mum's for tea and I'm just like 😬🥺 😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can tell Ive taken these tablets. I just want to go melt in bed and sleep. Felt sick for day an half and genuinley feel off urgh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBishop_ Owner and chairman In dispute. Owner said he was leaving the club then said he wasn't and was going to remove the chairman but the chairman wanted rid of the owner 😂. It's a mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNev2 Suspend the league until it gets better. Move the euros to 2021 and play the rest of the season during the period where the euros would have been. There is no way it will be cancelled  The repercussions would be way to much for many clubs and the FA themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wanna eat cereal forever if that's okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhotogFranco @WGRZ @mssociety @MSSocietyCanada This is cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tigerian Looks amazing 😍 yeah I can take or leave them. Also, more black pudding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my word 😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidlewissmart I heard these yesterday and I thought you may like it. I'm certainly digging it   https://t.co/NVE1PJSYP1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#villa are rubbish. Trying to do what they can't, causing problems for themselves. Saying that I would rather support them than liecester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yah you see that's my issue. I only have today's course to take and then I'm done. But I'm worrying I would get very very ill with coronavirus because of the DMT I'm on. My immune system seems to be okay, I don't genuinley don't get poorly as much as others but I still fret<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ISNTAlex Turner singing 🤯  https://t.co/fbvAVaoWik<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I need to come off twitter. Too much doom and gloom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dfitzgeralds @JamesTunstall89 @JamesPearceLFC That's exactly what I said ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak The question I have is; how many people have had the virus but have recovered without knowing it? So didn't get checked. The death rate is probably lower than shown. But something is odd how no survivors have come forward and the government are very coy on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTunstall89 @JamesPearceLFC They won't call the league off. They'll play the games behind closed doors if it's get very very bad. At the moment it should take weeks for the virus to get to where Italy are and they have it much much worse than the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Not even debatable!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conpryde 100%. No idea how VAR don't look at that and give it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrNickMason A great saving clearance but wtf is the Adrian doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity 😂😂 what's the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#everything #remember #me  https://t.co/qCuuFPyszJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing with #coronavirus is that we actually don't know the full scale of it. 100000 cases but how many more have had it and not had symptoms so bad they report it? Could the percentage of deaths actually be lower?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/9scaJV05lf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caribbeanpotter @PJBuckingham Yup absolutely correct. He won't adjust it. Sticks to what he knows. We will go down if he stays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rubyourock @stokecity Oh mate were dog shit. Worst ive ever seen in my life against Barnsley. Today was just unaceptable . We will go down. Glad you've turned it around though that could kick start something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would you buy your home town club, where the people here made you one of their own, plow loads of money in and then say it's for the fans, and then strip it of all it's got, until you destroy the club and the city who accepted you? CUNTS #Allamout #mccanout #getoutofourclub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker @BBCRadio2 How do you have your cuppa?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKidPoker I think if it becomes an endemic it may be here to stay like the flu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gasher01 @mrdanwalker @BBCRadio2 Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker @BBCRadio2 Best person youve interviewed,,?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiger20004 @stokecity It all starts at the top as they hire the boss, then they get the right players in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiger20004 @stokecity But In all fairness they had all that money and got relegated? It depends entirely on who you invest it on. If the manager isn't signing the right players, you're going to struggle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiger20004 @stokecity The majority of it will see it as a massive turn in form and they go up next year etc etc. Without a doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst thing about today's loss is that @stokecity fans will now think theyre now world-beaters when it's just because we're actually really, really shit #hcafc #weareshite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard69624248 @grantmccann11 Richard. The majority of the fans want him gone. Nobody devoted to this club will accept what we've seen the past few weeks. It's a disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham But how do you not see that your tactics aren't working and still be reluctant to change them? He looks completely lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Shite lads. No other words for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You wouldn't understand. Good sons like you wouldn't understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody who tells me that it's not #mccan out is an absolute fuckwit. #hcafc #joke  https://t.co/dNoj9l3TAr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Every single player on that pitch as well as the manager should donate their wages to the fans who went down to support and then hand in there resignation letters. Absolutely disgusting. #McCannout #hcafc #absolutejoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any #newcastle fans slating Bruce since the start must be really feeling bad about it. What a job he is doing with what's available! Appreciate him! We did! #bruce #newcastle #boss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool are 61 points above the bottom side Norwich. That's 20 wins.   Twenty. wins.   Wow!   #LFC #ynwa #LIVBOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Get a bet on that 5-4! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScfcZakk @stokecity You played us. And we're fucking wank. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a single shot on goal after 55 minutes. Joke #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost 5-1 at home to brentford. Very nearly got beat by Swansea after leading three times. Get hammered 4-0 at home by Leeds and then getting hammered 4-0 today. Time to go mccan you useless prick #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattFrampton Yup exactly. It's been on the cards for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattFrampton I agree. But he will always be the brunt of it. As will any manager, if they refuse to change the system and continue to get these results. I've never seen a city team so bad ( I'm only 26 ) ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattFrampton Absolutely. But mccann has not done himself any favours at all. Inept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is beyond embarrassing @HullCity #hcafc. Sack the useless cunt in charge and get somebody in who knows what hes doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Then they shook hands after the game. Right 🤔🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is a big result for @LFC I think, massive confidence boost. But they look a completely different team to the one before the winter break. Take a win though #lfc #ynwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler As they are now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do #lfc look so laboured? #LIVBOU #PremierLeague #confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull I am now a central part of your minds landscape ☺️🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Yep. All of it is 💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Was listening to this about an hour ago. Hold onto your friends 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>70 goals in 100 games is ridiculous #salah #unbelievable stat Geoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get how that's not a free kick on Gomez there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootballJOE They look like a team with no confidence. I don't get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear @lfc #lfc. Sort this out boys jesus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS @makkydoll I think it's a bad virus but I don't think it's AS bad as theyre making out. The death rate isn't exceptionally high and the cases are ( I think ) sliding down. I am just staying away from large public gatherings and washing my hands often. Hopefully be okay 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcburnsy Honestly? Brilliant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Nope, but I wish I was 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Right, so for the time been why not stop intercontinental and national travel? Because it's clearly spreading due to travellers. And tbh, I don't want to die 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pottsiegamer @GuardiolaAgenda @GaryLineker I don't think you can take a smile as literal. When they're playing with such power and pace they need to be focused and concentrate. That's probably what it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pottsiegamer @GuardiolaAgenda @GaryLineker Absolutely spot on. The league is what every single Liverpool fans want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pottsiegamer @GuardiolaAgenda @GaryLineker It blows my mind people are jumping on the "bottling it" bandwagon when we've by far been the best side for a while and were gonna win the league. Stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have my welcome meeting at my new job tomorrow after four months without work. It's gonna be a shock and half when I get to it having to get my arse up 😂 looking forward to it though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Its like the last album Currents grew up a bit and this came out 😎😂 yeah he said in an interview the original wasn't quite right. Still can't believe he left Patience out though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yip. The new album? Some good tunes on there.😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is just something so chilled about playing poker while listening to Tame Impala 😋🥰😎🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT What a fucking tea pot this guy is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophaedwards have you not got FB messenger anymore? Or are you just ignoring me 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuardiolaAgenda @GaryLineker You call 1 defeat in 28 luck? Righhttt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you call a 25BB all in with QJ off and get there? Oh I know it's because it's @partypoker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicky34colville Shouldn't you be in bed? 🌛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler Yes David. 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this brings back memories! 😖😁  https://t.co/jY6z0bFUWF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omid9 Anytime 💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeOlson   I think somebody is trying to be you  https://t.co/nGVS6f15c2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicky34colville Better now we are friends again 🤔😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its funny, don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you just start missing everybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicky34colville YOOOOOOO 😊😋 how you doing? 😊🤔🧐😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbc5live @elisjames @nomadicrevery @danilio95 I wanna go home. I wanna go home right now 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omid9 Now this. This is what we like to see. magnificent 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyberadam26 @MSSocietyCanada @mssocietyuk Me too 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 will you go get her please x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Ah man. I will have him  https://t.co/Hx95um5v7j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity1975 @PJBuckingham Maybe im a cynic. But I think FC fans expect a lot more than what they've been getting since before FC lost 9 in a row or whatever. New team and still losing games like that today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity1975 @PJBuckingham Aren't FC supposed to be one of the best teams now though? They always seem to drop off second half. They have a team more than capable of winning the GF. I just don't see it with Radford, they've done nothing since that second challenge cup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity1975 @PJBuckingham Oh and yes city are wank 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @HullCity1975 @PJBuckingham If FC fans are serious about winning the GF then Radford has to go at some point, the form just isn't good enough for a team spending what FC are. That's just my opinion. 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile  https://t.co/1oFFZkvhIm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yup. I never thought it would be something related but makes sense. I would rather sit in a quiet room on my own to be honest ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I realise now that from a very young age I must have had MS as I have always hated loud noises. At family gatherings or going to the speedway it was torture and to a certain extent they still are, they unsettle me big time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity1975 @PJBuckingham Radford should have been sacked a long time ago. McCann is poor but who else are they going to hire. Nobody wants go join a sinking ship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLMLewis1 check this out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope #Wolves get into the champions league. Theyre just a team you cannot dislike. Got a good squad and a really good manager. They make the other teams chasing the champions league look bang average<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jiveDurkey @bradders_david It's weird to think every single person in this Video is no longer alive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Haha yup our house was the same growing up. Im sure it'll be fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll It's pretty scary. Im going to isolate myself if it gets here 😂 yeah that's rsly important, and I don't normally spend a lot of time with strangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Oh god I am not looking forward to this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Thanks for this 😂 im literally due to start my second course on Wednesday 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 mate this is fucking mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgoldbridge Spot on this fella to be honest. They aren't going to collapse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett The Wall. Easy. A very very good album. I love it so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCLegacy Put Lovren in the Mersey and never mention his name again  Woeful defender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC get a nice little boat. Set it on fire. Put Lovren in it and set it out in to the Mersey. Worst centre back I've ever seen #lfc #lovren #terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCLegacy Opinion on Lovren?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Liverpool fail to win the league they will go from a team capable of winning the league to a team that's fighting with relegation. It just won't happen. So don't stress #lfc #liverpool #ynwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evanfanning I've said the same thing for a while!! He's absolute garbage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc They were never going to match that nobody ever will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovren should never put on a Liverpool jersey ever again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Yeah but, still gonna win the league 🤭😋😁😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How lovren made it as a footballer I will never know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf is going on 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Qué wheels have fallen off tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @WatfordFC What was Lovren doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mightyleedsisb1 @hullcity1904jd @1982Stanners Yet here you are commenting 😂😂 #ironic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Who the fuck would vote for McLaren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 @HullCity I can't even dispute it. It's torrid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 @RyanGibbon8 Nah mate enjoy it 😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 @RyanGibbon8 Things have just gone downhill for you haven't they 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewjones25 @Colinthemiddle @HullCity I don't get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are fucked lads #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of Leeds fans commenting on @HullCity posts is actually embarrassing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Ive been called worse 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cyberadam26 @MSSocietyCanada Adam, I followed you on the back of your tweet and wished you luck. Now I see you are undertaking a walk for the @mssocietyuk. I have MS and it's amazing you are willing to do this for us all. So thank you! Hope you had a lovely birthday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood I just hope you've got a good credit score for when it breaks down because its a little bit pricey so you may need a loan 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood You know youve made it when you go to Grimsby in your BMW to eat 20 burgers. 😉 Top work beard, you make me sick. Why can't I eat that much 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton The button on my boot stopped working so I took it in and they said it would be £8 to diagnose. I said I can show you it doesn't work! And they still tried to charge me it. Still not fixed 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Yup exactly! I don't get how they can do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootballManager I mean, I went from Cardiff in the championship to man city via Watford withing three years. Say no more 🧐🤭🌝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Same with Stoneacre pal. Trying to charge me £80 to diagnose a problem when I have 5 years warranty. How does that work. Conning fuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 I wouldn't have a twitter account if I did that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 I will see what I can do ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Should I check it out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Which one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't just "nap" 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Pondering..... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @Chaokoh_UK "knowledge"   Cracked me up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fall // Editors   Inject that fucking outro into my veins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Catchy,!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 what do you reckon? 🤔😏 https://t.co/yQLplJI4Kp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveHarrisonBBC @RadioHumberside Why does it keep rising so ,much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 True! Questions may be asked 😂 anytime haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 @rogerwaters @davidgilmour When I read it like this it does feel a bit gay. 😂 #noproblemwiththat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 @DrSamLoomis1031 @RushFamTourneys Imagine of he replies 😳😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrSamLoomis1031 @BradenCampbel16 @RushFamTourneys Yeeeaaahhhhhhhhhh 🤔🙄 haha 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 @RushFamTourneys @DrSamLoomis1031 Im just passionate about this 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 @RushFamTourneys @DrSamLoomis1031 Gilmour FTW 😋😜😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite that awful game. It was an absolute joy taking these two to the footy 🧡 #dadmode #broody #lovedit  https://t.co/vFwEcsaR3R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Because mccan yet again set the team up catastrophicly wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatjamieT Worse 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioHumberside Nine defeats in a row if you don't include the two draws! #fail #amateurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyberadam26 Happy birthday Adam lad 🎈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Can safely say im not going to that game 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler @HullCity Wasted trip son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Just said the same thing in my tweet. Any real top side would have put it to bed in the first half it was that bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Worst thing is they deserved it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeHassan30 I genuinley don't understand what made them sign him. He's had one good game this season and we didn't win. Then again we've not got much else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What exactly did #hcafc see in Magennis? Absolute donkey up top. Dont think he won a single header or had a shot on goal and he's a fucking striker. Jesus wept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tigerian @HullCity I've never seen a performance as bad as that first half Ian. I was shocked how bad it was. We didn't get near them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_brookes @PJBuckingham The Allams don't care whatsoever what league we are in. All they care about is the money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham That first half was probably the worst city performance I have ever seen at the KC/KCOM. We were all over the place and a better team than Barnsley would have put it to bed before half time that's how had it was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sums up #hcafc @HullCity perfectly. My sister won tickets to see the game. I tried to get next to her and had to settle for two seats down as the others were taken. When we got there there were at least 8 seats empty that looked taken and I sat next to her all game. Goodo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham The issue isn't the players. I think we have a squad good enough to survive, but over the past ten games mccan has consistently got it wrong and we've paid the price. He doesn't have a clue how to fix it and that's the biggest problem. Relegation looms on the back of that game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HumbNarpoSec @Joeywoey98 @HullCity It was absolutely mccans fault. How many times has he set teams up wrong of made substitutions that cost us the game? First half tonight was worst performance I've seen from a city side and it's his fault for the way he set us up. Second half was a different game = manager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Lo doubt mccan will come out with some bullshit about how we played but the be all and end all is that once again his selection and tactics were wrong and he consistently manages to try and wing it when the going gets tough. Get him out, way out his depth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow @HullCity just wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love The Wall and DSOTM. But I find Animals to be PF best album  There's just something about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT Been 2-0 up in the FA cup final and losing 3-2 🙃🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScheifferBates You get your wine. You fucking season it 😂😂😂 brilliant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 @Just_pinkfloyd Nahhhhhhh, you've picked that purposely to show Roger off. Im not having it 😂😂🧐😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 B, I think 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 I agree, I was shocked when I read the lyrics first time ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Agreed, the second has a bit more bite to it and on that not im going to put it on his<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Do you prefer that first or second part?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 I usually put it on when I can't sleep to be honest 😂😊 or when im stoned 🙃😳😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got electric light And I've got second sight I got amazing powers of observation And that is how I know When I try to get through On the telephone to you There'll be nobody home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll YES. THIS 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barstoolsports @gonepatrol That's just stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Passion4FM 3-5-2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @LFC #liverpool #lfc but Keita isn't very good at the minute. Way off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool look really tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamLeadbitter Absolutely 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to go go shop to get a drink and some chocolate but I really cant be bothered to get out of bed to be honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesGunn Im not crying 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @Alex_OxChambo @MoSalah Am I the only one missing the sound of the crowd here or what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bblyds @KellyCates Oh wow 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting to smash in their windows And kick in their doors Waiting for the final solution To strengthen the strain Waiting to follow the worms Waiting to turn on the showers And fire the ovens Waiting for the queens and the coons And the reds and the Jews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton Town Hall where we're going to be Waiting to cut out the deadwood Waiting to clean up the city Waiting to follow the worms Waiting to put on a black shirt Waiting to weed out the weaklings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 Perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @Tyson_Fury how do you beat Deontay Wilder?  Well, first you rattle him  Then you wobble him  Then you wobble him again Then you get them to throw them towel in Job done #furyvswilder2 #differentclass #thenew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was never any doubt after the fourth as Wilder just looked completely wobbled #furyvswilder2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WildervsFury2 I don't think anyone predicted that , absolute onslaught and was only one winner after 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CogginDan Had him from the start mate  Wilder got nowhere near him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES THEN @Tyson_Fury you little dancer. Had him from the start. Perfect stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CogginDan Possibly so! He's all over the place. I've heard he has a busted ear drum as well but he's nowhere near. If fury doesn't win this now then 😳🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cropper_04 Just said exactly the same thing, he's not doing anything. Fury is all over him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#furyvswilder2 Fury all over him, something not quite right with the bomber here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twice?! What #furyvswilder2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanessaKade Having patience to wait for the right spots to raise, three bet etc etc. When I started I raised when I wanted to, not when it was right to do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeirinBurns @Lukewood666 @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC My original point was that it's a bad injury, but I've seen worse on a football pitch. It's just opinion not fact, I've had a look and it does look genuine in which case that's crazy. My mum dislocated her shoulder and I've never seen her in such a state so....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexgough_ I thought the Matt Smith and Karen Gillan episodes with the crack in time were the best of the lot. I haven't got into it since they left. but Tennant as the doctor was so perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt_brfc @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC Eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanTweets_ @tynelexyclarson I had this discussion, something just didn't make sense when I watched it. Like I didn't get good vibes you know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouchNish Nothing beats that FA Cup final goal. I believable strike that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm backing the Gypsy King 👑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also genuinley think Pink Floyd should have released Waiting for The Worms as a single as it's very good and very underrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The drop in One Of My Turns just does it for me that's all I will say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeirinBurns @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC Oh! I think you are right for which I apologise! 😂 My bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nathh212 @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC  https://t.co/Yp4WMzX6gH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeirinBurns @Lukewood666 @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC Tbh without wanting to stir the pot the motive to say she did is a lot larger when you consider how much more of a story it would be in the papers and for women's football to then say "look at us women were just as tough we deserve equal pay etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT Omg ARE YOU KIDDING? 😳🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallumBeverleyy Oh boy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 You really should, I believe it's where Pink Floyd got their sound from in the sixties. They're very good. Quite psychodelic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallumBeverleyy Im hesitant but I always cave in 😂  I've only ever seen them in Clarence near me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallumBeverleyy £1.20 a bag is a bit steep to be fair 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Definitely Gilmour 😉😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scott Parker , stood there with his impeccable suit and tie patroling the touchline. It makes you proud to be British #scottparker #DERFUL #godsavethequeen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallumBeverleyy Aye, they're so gooooddddd 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Have you ever listened to King Crimson,?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know why I comment on things sometimes 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_kjf @KeirinBurns @BBCSportScot @ICTFC Matter of opinion which I haven't disagrees with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_kjf @KeirinBurns @BBCSportScot @ICTFC What's to ignore? My point wasn't saying yours was invalid I just think there's been a few that I think are worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact I have only had a packet of Jalapeno Pretzels today isn't good, I should probably get some food but BED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeirinBurns @kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC You mean like Bert Trueman who broke his neck and carried on? Im not undermining your point. I just think there's a lot to see that's equally if not worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 ,mainly Floyd and The National at the minute 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Phil, in the context of the Q&amp;A does it seem right that the first questions were regarding a take over? I know they've done a lot of bad stuff but surely getting behind this new team and manager is more important than the takeover at the minute? I fail to see the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN, ALAN. STEVE, STEVE , STEVE, STEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_kjf @BBCSportScot @ICTFC you never saw Eduardo snap his leg or Ramsey or cisse or Andre gomes? They're all equally as horrific tbf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The young chap from Australia deserves every ounce of support from every single bit of kindness anyone has to offer. No child AT 9 YEARS OLD should have to deal with that, ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly right if I ever end up living with someone, do you seriously think im sharing a double bed? Not a fucking chance. it's all mine, get your own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 ,who you got?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a beautiful guitar, but according to squire wiki it's a cheapo. That it definitely if not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But my inquisitiveness got the better of me so I researched it. Turns out the previous owner left the serial number on from squire and looks like it was made in Korea at the Samick Plant in late 1980s. Which is mad considering its older than me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing research on my strat was interesting this evening. The guy who I bought it off said it was a 1989 squire strat, but had replaced the squire logo with a fender logo. I left it at that and sorted it out and it sounds great!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These coconut ice lollies from Aldi are the absolute bees knees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoCare45556969 Of course I did 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad @marcc9999 was 16 the last time liverpool won the league, I wasn't even born. My grandparents were in their mid thirties. To see them win the league is worth it just to know how they will feel when it happens #liverpool #worthit 🧡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoCare45556969 In what way does my tweet suggest I specifically enjoyed it? I merely made a point that women are just as bad as men and it needs to be a level playing field. Abuse is wrong no matter what sex, age, beliefs you have. Stop trying to dig up something that isn't there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoCare45556969 Have a day off, I wasn't laughing in the first place you moron. My point was that women need to be held just as accountable as men. Do you think men don't kill themselves over women? It's a poisoned challace especially when you're famous. Doesn't mean she deserves to die<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll That would literally be a dream job I reckon 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll See, another one 😂. It's sooooooo good!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Never trust the Postal service! 😂. As soon as you post it they'll be on it and they'll eat it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll You could send it first class to me in a sealed container within a chilled box? Maybe that would work 😂 #itwouldnt #dreamer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I can't be bothered to go out and get food so im going to raid my cupboards and probably end up with oven chips and figh fingers 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are we really surprised about this outcome for #mancity ? They've got money to burn, and obviously have no regard for the rules and the other clubs in the division. I would suggest a points deduction as well. ;) #weregonnawintheleague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissLMLewis1 Yup, might be. They alternate the names in the alphabet between male and female. So the next one will be a woman's name beginning with E. Put a bet on it ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looks like dreaming, but it feels like dead, I guess Do whatever moves you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCity Brilliant! Fair play. A wonderful human that deserves a send off. A brilliant bloke and will be missed by many. Rip Kris pal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HullCityStats I don't think it's the manager. I think he has a clause in his contract the club don't want to use so they don't play him. Maybe im wrong but seems a possibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 180 😜😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carra23 @themichaelowen @LFC The first book I ever received was Michael Owens biography. I had the training video he did with southall. I had him on the back of my shirt.

<|startoftext|>I was literally top ten stack and then two hands later I was out. Made a stupid call then 1010 into JJ. Poker is brutal and got me tilted<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiamS6Times @themichaelowen @Carra23 Maybe I did, as I kinda agree. But it was a long time after when he could never go back etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamS6Times @themichaelowen @Carra23 Yes exactly, but he's still got to make a career and earn money, why would he turn United down? And that's because they were club legends at the time they could have moved, owen was young when he left Liverpool and nowhere near as much as a figure as those two<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamS6Times @themichaelowen @Carra23 There's no difference, they're all in the same boat, still moving clubs from someone they were held in high regard, Gerrard, carragher, Owen all admitted they were everton fans yet now support liverpool, because of football. I get your point. I just don't think football is loyal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamS6Times @themichaelowen @Carra23 I get your point, but at the end of the day players will follow the money, look at how many players have played for their rivals, just because he played it doesn't mean hes shit, Gerrard nearly left, Torres left, sterling left etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamS6Times @themichaelowen @Carra23 I disagree. You aren't ever turning down a move to one of the world's biggest clubs with the money on offer. You wouldn't turn down a good job to go work at Tesco. Alegencies have never existed in football, it's just a job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatestGamePod @Carra23 @themichaelowen Once a red, always a red!  I always thought he was treated a little unfairly, brilliant and honest about his career and been honest he's probably one of my favourite ever players. Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSWarriorPrinc1 Oh, don't tell me this, im due to start my second stage in the next week or so 🥴<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I mean. 8 years is a long time init  https://t.co/7AEo1G6bYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerTenno @PJBuckingham Defence is all over the shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham I mean. Absolutely shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerTenno @PJBuckingham Give over. He couldn't do anything about that. Unmarked header Six yards out. Blame the defence not the keeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Dross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull It's all absolute garbage this pal. Getting torn apart in the middle and that first goal was too easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look I won't lie to you im shitting myself about this coronavirus. Genuinley think it may kill me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"there is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact, it's all dark"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Bands_FC Shot in the house were imagine was filmed apparently 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think what you all need to do is go watch the Once Video by Liam Gallagher on YouTube because it is close to perfection #LG #ONCE @liamgallagher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano @HullCity Yup, 100% heading that way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elgilliano @HullCity Didn't expect it at all 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSportBoxing @Tyson_Fury Will never know how he didn't win this fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tigerian @talkSPORT Molde to Galatasaray on loan. No idea why but my agent was all for it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Good morning! Keep  spreading your message and smile. There is no limit to what you can achieve ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sporf @ManUtd When you say rebuild? It's kinda pointless selling your mansion and buying a caravan? which is what they've done 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tigerian Was always going to happen unfortunately Ian, where there's cash there's the Allams. Anything for their back pocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 happy birthday, because telling you on whatsapp just wasn't enough for me 😘  https://t.co/K9KgfFxS8a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Why Phil. Why?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Are we just going to ignore the " this is massive, this is so much bigger than I thought it would be" innuendo or shall I just move on... #childish 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @StanChart I remember going on the stadium tour and the guide asked us how many trophies Bill Paisley won as Liverpool's most successful manager, for some reason I answered it with 19 and was correct. It's just one of them things that astounded me when I was getting into football<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katyhelend Keep going buddy! Wishing you all the best. At least it's sunny out 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuWallis Valid  https://t.co/w8RPT0SDly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samoverton10 @lee_dolman @bbcburnsy @HullCity @HumbersideSport I agree. But when it all goes tits up and we get relegated you'll have the answer. The only players we are signing are the ones mccan is pals with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 It didn't make sense to me, go above 4000 feet above sea level and you're starting to gasp for breath There is no way at 25000 feet you'd be able to breath. Doesn't make sense, glad you thought the same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lee_dolman @samoverton10 @bbcburnsy @HullCity @HumbersideSport Look at Eaves stats. He's still shite in the championship . Can't sign league one players and expect to stay in the championship. There's a reason why they play for a league one club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Notchrishelm @PJBuckingham Im glad im not the only one who thinks this 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 She just Malts so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I discovered Im an introvert. Googled it and it's me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone once asked me what perfection was. I just showed them this♥️♥️♥️ #doggo #loves #cutey  https://t.co/nA6YzmDYCe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched #12strong the other night I enjoyed it a lot but when the helicopter goes to 25 thousand feet and they're sat in the chopper without a mask on? Surely that's not possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qikipedia Global warming? FAKE NEWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all good, it's a song by a band called Foals :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im done with the world and it's done with me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomrosenthal I wasn't expecting this to hit so pure but my word this is the most beautiful thing ever ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macncheese065 @LFC @MoSalah Said this a minute ago. I don't trust him whatsoever<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TommyCoyle89 Good luck champ!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Did you really think we'd get there? Were shite, no bottle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Need to sort it out Phil as they have been awful past few games. In danger or slipping badly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Said months ago our midfield isn't up to scratch. No bastard to grab the game and take it to them. It's bypassed so easily and it leaves the back four stretched time and time again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Im not even blaming the club for this. To lose 10/15 thousand fans is osburd and this city fan base should be ashamed imo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lose and it's three defeats on the spin  Not good at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as grosicki and Bowen leave. Were going down. #hcafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are shit. #hcafc. Surely people don't believe we we can get play offs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_pinkfloyd I love this film ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatrionaMcNicol Brilliant 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_kammy @SRTRC_England Genuinley don't think I could go there, I fear it would be too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a guy call down a triple barrel with a 3 high flush. Unreal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABellInTheBurbs @tattoo_jak @BreeOlson Now we get it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyDeraney Won't be long. Be a good girl 🥺😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tattoo_jak @BreeOlson Point still stands though that it doesn't fit 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeOlson You mean a bit like this....  https://t.co/b6VVYVaBzO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know what you have done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Yup that's me all over 🤣 though im pretty sure I know where it is ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 I will find it tomorrow I hope thanks :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reverend_Makers You only have to look at what happened previously in 2002/2003 with the other coronavirus. Only around 1000 people died from that, then you've got bird flu and ebola that all dropped off  If they contain it things will be fine as previous :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradenCampbel16 Happens to us all. I still need to find it though ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the fuck do you lose a birth certificate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC Shoot Lovren. Absolute dogshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shrewsbury deserve this. Played well second half. Liverpool complacent . Good game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @shrewsweb How had is lovren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovren is so so bad @LFC get rid of him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I am surprised you missed the MASSIVE motor home on the Drive.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Exactly! Everything goes. I would probably stop though if the wallpaper started flaking and I had to knock the house and down and build a new one 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll It also applies to the: sofa, oven,fridge , TV , bed and toilet.   A cleaner that doesn't clean is a very good cleaner 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IceyLindelofV2 @utdarena I hate the fact that as a Liverpool fan Scholes and Keane are two of the best central midfielders the premier League has seen. Scholes was unbelievable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 I have a couple of interviews this week so fingers crossed. What agency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackMcC_47 Im unemployed I have no chance 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She did buy me an oven pizza though. Silver lining n dat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mum wouldn't sub me £8 so I could get dominoes. Bitch 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danilio95 spot on 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 Nah mate he's spot on. If he plays like he did last night consistently he is unpLayable. Tore robertson to shreds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@30SECVlDEOS Why did she do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly why every single dog on this planet deserved to be loved ♥️😭  https://t.co/JfUvvdCIzj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuickTake @CLSAInsights I had a bumpy ride last year I really don't want another one 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOCKOP Weird. Literally just thought he would fit Liverpool very well if he is consistent like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is something extremely special with this @LFC side. To go 40 unbeaten and take that many points is unbelievable . It takes a lot to get just a point from this team let alone beat them. and I can't see anybody doing that #LFC #unreal #premierleague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great teams find a way to win. That's it. @LFC #liverpool #winwin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_hcafc Second half you would have had every right 🤣 but great teams find a way to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea how Liverpool won that game. Wolves were excellent but it's these kind of games that make champions. Fabinho has to start, different gravy. They aren't chucking this away now #WOLIV #liverpool #winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_sps @davidgilmour Please upload the solo to this. Absolute perfection ♥️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaveHarrisonBBC @RadioHumberside This is no surprise whatsoever, never seen more than three people/couples in there. It was only a matter of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She gets the wrong seat naturally. I, however get shoved in the back. But im okay with that  https://t.co/mu9aZZrR1G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2point4bikes @ThreeUKSupport It's been this way for quite a while though, its getting frustrating when simple things on the network are difficult because they don't load<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's back.  https://t.co/5zAlYtXW8s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otter_News Not jealous whatsoever 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchdog13 Nowt wrong with the Tambury Gazette!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @andygoldstein05 No honestly , on a serious note here. Please please please do NOT save the club. Let it crumble 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClockEndJackk I will find someone with a phone unless it kills me....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptaJoe @premierleague Fucking nosedive 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFC_UKI I managed these on my @FootballManager mobile save and didn't even make the correlation. Im ashamed of myself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You could give an aspirin the headache of its life...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like drink, sex and dogs. But not necessarily in that order....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beattie2028 @LFC It's too premature even now, but you can't see them losing as many games as the others to lose it from here. I agree, can't see them losing 4-5 games to put them under pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beattie2028 @LFC Give over. Too many games to go back then and still had spurs man city and man utd to play in a busy period. To come through this month with the amount of wins is winning mentality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't believe now 16 points clear with a game in hand. Then im not sure you ever will. That result is massive.  YOU LITTLE DANCER 😍 @LFC   YAAAASSSSSSS 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler Nah not a foul for me. He drops the ball, if you can't challenge a GK then don't let outfield players in the six yard box it's pointless if everything is going to be given as a foul. But you knew they would disalow it anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it burnleh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@denisjthornton @ShredvanWinkle @starstrickenSF I might have spent that wrong. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL Agree . And I think the rule isnt marginal enough. It gives the defenders an advantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denisjthornton @ShredvanWinkle @starstrickenSF That's kind blowing! 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I think used correctly VAR is great. But the minor offsides and handballs are just sucking the life out of the fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL I think the way it's used is a problem, fans don't know what's going on, it isn't really that clear etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyJayL That's the other issue. People aren't blaming VAR, they're blaming the rule<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Westpauper @TheSunFootball @alanshearer Wait, what. It's exactly the same as the tackle yesterday. That's the point, it has to be consistent and clear. The fact one was given and one was not is the whole issue<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This will never ever not be funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HcafcPaul @GrosickiKamil @HullCity @HDMHullCity @PJBuckingham @bbcburnsy Bit much 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nwa2275 The funny thing about it is that Leeds don't give a shit about us 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissassmile Wooppppp 18k 😮  https://t.co/cr5ewdhtsM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nwa2275 I think thats the reason why we fade in second half a lot already, we get tired but hopefully getting past that. You're not doing to bad. We just need to make sure Leeds don't get promoted 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nwa2275 If you got it off a commentator that's even worse 😂 but yes we won 3-0 and yes I'm as surprised as you are 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nwa2275 We beat Luton 3-0 pal 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sav_Dog_Guetta @swfc Maybe we will maybe we wont. Depends if we hammer you eh ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to go see @Elbow at @bonusarenahull but £50 a ticket is a bit steep for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev Said the same to a mate. I would much rather watch liecester than them two. They have nothing about them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilmourOrgasm The solo is actually sublime. I like the original but this one is so pure 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirlspussy And then later on he's going to cook a roast @danilio95<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mssocietyuk My first relapse and eventual diagnosis was through having double vision. I never considered MS. but I made a full recovery. Yey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull It's always going to be yes. But my head and heart are conflicting 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @angel28kc The truth is out now! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I buy this guitar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Hi sorry I fell asleep last night #theirony . I can't avoid coffee 😂 I can't function at work without it ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll It's crazy isn't it. It gets me mad. Then sometime I start to get upset because I can feel how much I need sleep but can't drift off. I wish I could sleep through the day, does that happen often for you? Any tips haha   Apart from sleeping a lot nothing at all that I noticed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll I just want to sleep for months! but then can't sleep on a night. It drives me crazy! 😣I agree! It didn't give me any side effects . I wanted one just do I know it was doing something :3 did you have any? Glad you think it's working and getting aboyt! Its a good feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Yeah I hope your relapse free or the majority! :) How did you find the treatment ? And I'm alright. No real big issues thus far. Though fatigue is getting a lot worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll Woop! Congrats. This will be me in six months 🤫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When it's peaceful and the only thing you can hear is the sound of the rain against the window and the faint rustle of the fan in your computer. It's good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 Never in doubt 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 I'm starting to think the same thing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf was that defending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spurs. Chelsea. Arsenal and Utd are all 10 points behind Liverpool ( as it stands ). People who said it wasn't a two horse race probably didn't expect the gap to be this much after 6 games surely. 😂😂 #football #biggap #twohorserace #premierleague  https://t.co/jCCa9t9YGi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 @Arsenal The issue is they play out the same way every week, teams are aware of it so when they do it they're on them  straight away and they lose it. Going forward your brilliant, but no backbone at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal are so so bad #premierleague #shite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all that is now And all that is gone And all that's to come And everything under the sun is in tune But the sun is eclipsed by the moon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealSquidInc @I_am_PJS @simonjbreen @JamesMelville Yup it's ridiculous, everybody knows it and I agree with you completely, the problem is the uproar by those who still believe in the law, which I think would outweigh those who don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSquidInc @I_am_PJS @simonjbreen @JamesMelville I get your point but the basic principle has always been there  That's the point. It's archaic, and they won't ever change it so it will just keep happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need something to watch on netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSquidInc @I_am_PJS @simonjbreen @JamesMelville Since 1700s? It's the only reason they don't do anything about it because it's Americans " rights" just glad I live in UK ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_am_PJS @simonjbreen @JamesMelville It's because of the second amendment in the Constitution which states an individual's right to bear arms. It's completely fucking stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Everybody watching that just sits there and goes "why" "why did he do that" it's laughable and I'm not even an arsenal fan  https://t.co/qa91OeyiPG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @N_Whittingham Yup! Astonishing isn't it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @N_Whittingham Yeah the ending makes it for me. Considering he didn't fire a gun once is incredible bollocks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @N_Whittingham Sorry pal! Thought you'd finished it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N_Whittingham @ShackHull I think the emphasis had to be on that he never fired a bullet and then did what he did and survived  If you don't bleed that it doesn't work i don't think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull The ridge that is<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beardmeatsfood Yeah, let's not talk about that. " He did play that pass over the attackers head though" 🤪🙄😒 #rrriiiggghhhhtttttt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's only one thing that can make me feel better after that shit show from England. And that of course is my nightly catch up of @beardmeatsfood ( probably do a better job at clearing up than those england defenders ) SEE WHAT I DID THERE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeTMitchell 100% agree, too careless at the back at this level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All that promise last year and it ends up with a shit show of defensive errors like that Get rid of playing it out from the fucking back as they can't do it clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha. Think it's time we think the strategy of playing it out from the back because this is poo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No other way to describe that then WTF IS HE DOING. that's lack of match practice and thinking you're too good on the ball. Also why he's down the pecking order at city. Can't do things like that in big games and not get punished eventually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely goal that from England but I ain't gonna grumble about the decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was utterly inevitable this second half. Been absolutely woeful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinkFloydPolls Ahhhhh stubbed my fucking toe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS Q1 - 5 Years ago ( I think ). I actually feel okay with it for now. I've only ever had two proper relapses in my life. And both times I've fully recovered.

<|startoftext|>Will tell you this now. I need to stop playing poker. I make such stupid decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 scenes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing to think the #lfc side who won the champions league had players from Hull ( Robertson ) Henderson ( Sunderland ) mane ( Southampton ) Wijnaldum ( Newcastle and Trent AA ( youth academy ).

<|startoftext|>That pitch invader was sublime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchdog13 I agree it's harsh so early on  But with his arm like that then you're going to take the risk of it hitting it. A long way to go though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchdog13 His arm wasn't in a natural position. Soon as he moves it out like that he's opening himself up for something like that to happen. It's just unlucky<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JWhittlesElbow Im a neutral 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWhittlesElbow The thing is, I'm a Liverpool "fan" but I'm a hull supporter. Liverpool because it's run through my family for a number of generations but Hull because it's my home town club.

<|startoftext|>@HJohno64 @TheSportsman Was an amazing day. It was always going to be our year after the run we had. Just glad I was able to witness it at Wembley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Ashamed to even think this is going to happen in my home time  Absolute chaos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CMacIver11 @E_Clifford139 I'm struggling. Maybe that Lb at man city who's always injured or Alba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gazhcafc90 @E_Clifford139 Fair point that Gaz !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Yeah I agree. Messi can just change a game in an instant. But at 1-0 you've got a chance. Haha I'm the same. I just get mad about the England thing with Maguire. Takes him to go to liecester to get a call up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 100% mate, his rise is unreal. He's not been excellent going forward tonight so far. But in terms of where he's come from its ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 It's astonishing to think where he was 2/3 years ago. Easily one of the what LB in the world these days in my opinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev I think that's what they offered me. Or the other main one, glad I stayed clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev Ah they weren't even mentioned to me, I just chose not to go for them, i kinda had a feeling they would do some funny stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev If you don't mind me asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev Which ones are they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev They were offered to me but I refused them. Didn't trust them at all. Can be addictive and can make you go loopy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev No don't do that, I'm quite enjoying him proving he's an absolute fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ashley Young is such a fraud. How he gets in this Utd team I don't not know, can't stand the cunt anyway but still. Hahahaha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Man Utd side is garbage let's be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does a bee the size of a zeppelin manage to fly into my bedroom through a gap no bigger than an encyclopedia. Was huge! Luckily I coaxed it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I moan about having to go to work. But in actually fact I hate been off when I have nothing to do, drives me crazy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brian_gendo I think the issue is the march engine though. The game as whole is good, but that lets it down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brian_gendo I get what you mean. I created my own club. Was promoted first season, but I couldn't sign anyone and it was difficult to get anywhere. I gave up in the end and carried on my career in league one which ended up going rather well as im now with Man City.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brian_gendo I can't enjoy the 3d. I never have really, the graphics are a lot better , but I find myself getting annoyed at something's such as the goalkeepers and sometimes the attacking. It's come a long way though. What career are you on the minute?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brian_gendo I agree. There's a few bugs which are annoying! I thought the latest patch would address most of them :( it's weird because I've really enjoyed this year's in terms of the new layout and tactics, do you use the 3d engine? I find the 2d version a lot better for march experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brian_gendo Why do hate it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMeyler @HullCity Those were the days! One of my favourite players for city Dave who always tried his hardest for our club. You gave us some memories that will be with us forever :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dominos on its way. On aye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Hull, east Yorkshire, england. Gods own country ( apparently )  It is good though ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I would give to be able to go to Pink Floyd and the whole Pulse show thing.  Absolutely spectacular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TOGETHER WE STAND DIVIDED WE                        FA                             LL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 @felish_a Aye. Sativex they use shows up. Not sure on the others. I don't need it but may in future somewhere along the line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felish_a I know the benefits are good for us, but my work randomly drug test so it's a no go sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Ahaha fair point! Luckily I've woken up fresh as a daisy :D round two tonight 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My dreams are bound to come true somehow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really really really want to watch afterlife again. But I'm not sure I can take being the blubbering idiot I was the first time I watched it. @rickygervais what do you reckon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I will say is that @England look a team. Not a load of individual players stuck together. Over the past couple of decades that's the biggest problem. But no egos and rivalrys. Very very promising #ENGMON #eng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought Barkley was excellent tonight, provided that edge that was needed when going down. Southgate deserves a lot of praise for the way we are playing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should I be drinking on a monday night? Absofuckinglutely. Going down a treat believe me. 😁🍺🍺🍺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keane was all over the shop then.  I'm not sure we're going to win this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I miss missing you now and then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeyface @mssociety Tell me about it! It's awful when you forget something that you shouldn't really forget. I hate it! Car keys are the worst 🤐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Im done with the world and it's done with me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I give teddy fruit and veg nearly every day. She's got a nice cosy house to sleep in, gets cleaned out regularly and I let her out so she can stretch her legs. Does she appreciate it? DOES SHE FUCK. Little shit bit me when I wasn't looking. Not impressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecondYellowCrd You must have thought I was a right tool hahaha Jesus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Medusa Ruby Ale from Aldi is the absolute bomb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecondYellowCrd Are you using a safety harness just to be sure? You never know what might happen !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecondYellowCrd How talls your fridge?! ;)'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hopefully me and @danilio95 will be off on a trip to Ireland. I'm pretty excited about it. Aye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you find money you didn't know you had in your wallet. Bosh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveHarrisonBBC Magnificent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious question @rickygervais how have I only just seen Special Correspondance?! Bloody brilliant<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danilio95 @Jmac_47 I love the choice of the black emoji there mate. Very authentic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 @danilio95 Why have you done that FFS. Now hes gonna jump in on it. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 Wouldn't advise that mate. Probably short the circuit and then it will be a goner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeeMissBea The fact Steve Coogan plays both these parts so brilliantly is amazing in itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EasyWithAces I think the beauty of steaming is that it gives viewers an insight of what it is like to be a pro but also everything that comes with it. The losses and bad beats etc etc. I know for me watching regularly I was able to adjust how I play and improve my game because of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This kind of weather makes me want to go on a long drive with the windows down and the music loud #justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 You're a dick head. Probably need a new battery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 What's up with it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jmac_47 Shit house<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 Omg the photo. I laughed out loud FFS hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 What can I say. I know things haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev By far my favourite. Goes down a dream. Even better on tap but only know a couple of places where I live that do it #sadtimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev Aint got nothing on Staropramen pal. And it costs more. I never get it when I'm in the pub. Too expensive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuckinggCorry Sorry but. Staropramen is the daddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They know, and so do I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deezeruk hate to be a complainer but this song below cuts off half way through for some reason. Please can you sort as it is a very good tune otherwise  https://t.co/wSVLyijUHs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a tune and don't let anybody say otherwise!  https://t.co/ZSkji22AnT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 @DaveHarrisonBBC @alternaheritage Back off Darth. I found it quite funny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So it's probably a kiss goodbye then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get to work and somebody says " what's that in your shirt"? MASSIVE STAIN. Didn't even notice as it's been in the wash. Not impressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay day next Tuesday. Which means payday= dominos two for Tuesday. Beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toystory Oh aye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything's cool, I'm great, it's fine  https://t.co/bICaQUT6w2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroadcastMoose @ShackHull @jarrodbowen_ It's always being the same with Hull. Huddleston's. Maguire. Livermore. Overlooked all the time because they play for little old Hull. Soon as those moved on they were back in. Especially Maguire become critical to England. Doesn't make sense to me but that's the FA for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobiwilson56 To be honest. I support Hull and no supporter is going to hate me as much as our owners. So I'm only onto a winner here  Send the dosh my way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find repeating in my head. If I can't be my own, I'd feel better dead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@henrywinter @FA @EFL Agree completely. You can't have VAR at some and not others. It doesn't make any sense to the teams who don't have it. Brighton and Swansea  should have their games but we're robbed by no VAR  Jokers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shiner_sam One brown and one slightly green Because I'm a freak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falling asleep for 2 and half hours at 5pm wasn't ideal. Now I can't sleep. FML<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm sorry. But jump horse racing it's an absolute farce. There is no a way a horse should die just for people's entertainment. We don't condone bull fighters? So why horse racing. Two fatalities today should be enough to get rid of it completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fox is dead in the garden. The hedges are on fire in the country lanes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YouViewIt38 @MustStopMS I haven't heard of that. But I love sleep anyway ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouViewIt38 @MustStopMS Correcto. I'm always tired. ALWAYS URGHH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS I have said all along since my diagnosis that my tiredness is a different kind of tiredness. People don't understand what I mean but it's true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't think Comfortably Numb live at pulse in '94 is the best ever solo performed live than you're completely fucking bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Piekos @RadioHumberside An alcoholic most probably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best bit is that I left in 2017 and the debt is until sept 2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a letter sent from debt recovery 18 months for a water bill for a property You left 18 months ago is a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the BBC has run a story about a 25 year old who was diagnosed with MS. they would probably have a field day with me then at 19 and suffering with double vision for three months. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EasyWithAces Wow I fell asleep while I was watching the stream last night, good to see you took it down . Congrats dude! 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't worry. Give it time. Things are the way they have to be 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABPSouthampton I know! 😁 I bill them in PBS ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABPSouthampton Wow! And I thought the RoRo vessels were big<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. So, I believe the referendum result should stand. BUT, if the deal can't be a deal, and can't be agreed you have to pull it and ask the people again. There's no way we can have a Brexit like this surely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArcticMonkeysUS 505. Easy. Next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have never been in love until you have seen the stars reflect in the reservoirs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine losing the league title at home to fucking burnley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shiner_sam @MainlyOasis Good album I think. Criminally underrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis @shiner_sam I think Born To Be A Dancer is also a banger on this album. It was the album the nurses played when I had my MRI so it has special meaning for me in a weird way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gcesposito @cavlar12345 @MundialMag @pepper_pig28 I know about the Spanish thing with certain letters but it just sounds daft 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliesxworldx @rickygervais Gets me every,single,time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais The part which I've watched over and over again ( and cried over and over again ) is where your dad regonises you " you're my boy". Everything about that scene makes me weep in sad but beautiful way. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes, I write replies to people on twitter who I think are fucking morons. But then I think better of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think I'm going to eat all of these chocolate pretzels tonight you are 100% fucking correct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danilio95 Fuck off mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not me?  Why not you?   Who not now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buddaofeuston @rickygervais I've been there. I've been exactly where Toni has where everything is worthless. But you've got to remember the goods things and the good people. And the dogs! They'll all make you smile in the end x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buddaofeuston @rickygervais There's always something or someone who can make you smile. Remember that :) it's not all doom and gloom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Ricky, honestly. I know you've already liked my tweet and I don't expect any recognition of this one. But I'm watching it absolutely spell bounded by how wonderful and beautiful it is. Not forgetting the dog. I really shouldn't be sat at work watching it with tears in my eyes! Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me. Into my Arms came on afterlife and it broke me. @rickygervais<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais ive just watched the first episode of afterlife and now moving onto the second. Can I just say that it is wonderful. I can't wait to watch the rest. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EuanTennant1 @GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal Con men my friend. Jokers who have no place amongst those of us who are genuinley are ill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccasears I will never give up or let it beat me. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At @PolarBearHull waitinv for the orelles. Yessss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal I believe those who prove their belief through medicine and results  Show me your results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal But you have no proof? So how can people believe you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal But you have no proof? Why are you just justifying yourself on Twitter when you can be using your "knowledge" through the mainstream?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal Because it's not plausible? Because there isn't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal Come off it. Why haven't the doctors proven this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal I appreciate your beliefs in wellbeing and good health. I know that you truly believe of which I will not disputed however. I disagree with what you choose to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal If there was any proof you could do what you say is true. You wouldn't need to justify your reasoning. Simple as that. Absolute con<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal You really really don't, trust me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal So all the doctors. All the MRIS showing legions, All the specialists in the field are wrong? If you had any credibility and proven results you wouldn't have to take to Twitter to justify your lunatic ideas. You are praying on the vulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 " what you been up to lad?"   " Now much mate. Mainly sleeping, you?"  "Ah you know. Losing my car keys and that"   ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @RHChilds1 More than welcome. Just remember that the community is a valuable thing with MS. You'll always have friends around it :) take care and smile 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHChilds1 @BarryTheCat4 Thank you. You too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @RHChilds1 I do. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago when I was 19. I had double vision at that time. It's normal to worry about things like that, I sometimes worry about it too, but be assured there are treatments which can bring it back if you do, take every day as it comes and don't worry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHChilds1 @BarryTheCat4 MS is just one of those things that unfortunately you have to live with day in day out. Appreciate the good days when you have them. There are many who struggle. Many who don't. It's just how it goes. The best thing to can do is wake up and smile :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenevieveFlight @GMA @SelmaBlair @ShambhallahHeal You're whole belief system is warped if you think giving vulnerable and desperate people false hope for something which is not true in a way to make you money is acceptable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AA In small blind. Raise and get called. K84 flop. I raise and a shove from the other player. KJ. guess what the river was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SelmaBlair Selma. I was 19 when I was diagnosed with MS. I Sometimes struggle with it, like we all do. But the courage to speak out and show up, means more than just an interview. It means you're fighting back. Like we all do! And that's why us with MS totally rock! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHChilds1 @BarryTheCat4 The one thing all us with MS have in common is that we are defiant and brave enough not let it beat us. That's what makes us brilliant :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the newest Slow Readers Club album very much!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How could anybody not have enjoyed partridge. The point of it has always been not to make you laugh constantly. But to make you laugh when you're not cringing. It did exactly that. Essential partridge! #AlanPartidge #greatstuffitreallyis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 @brun_lucy @MSSymptomsGone @mssocietyuk @gwentmusic I never said there wasn't BUT. The side effects ( I think ) are very mild compared to other DMT's. It's more of an inconvenience I found<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brun_lucy @lauramann212 @MSSymptomsGone @mssocietyuk @gwentmusic Capaxone is the drug I started on There are no real side effects. But make sure you massage the area before to avoid injection spots where you inject and you will be good! Good luck!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenMullaney1 @HullCityStats @bbcburnsy @HullCity @mattdeanradio @HumbersideSport @RadioHumberside @swanster66 Haha have a word. It's his opinion, as it is yours to not agree with him  I agree with his points about the players he's mentioned for reasons I have said. Doesn't mean he or I are wrong for disagreeing with what you think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HullCityStats @bbcburnsy @HullCity @mattdeanradio @HumbersideSport @RadioHumberside @swanster66 I don't understand this tweet at all? Evandro probably one of the biggest earners who's now in his twilight years. Henrisken hasn't lived up to promise we though he would and ridgewell was just to till the gaps. Oh and also it's burnsy opinion 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis I cant do this. I really can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" spurs can challenge for this title " no they really can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMBLAKE @MainlyOasis Im glad I'm not the only one who believes this. 😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 @mssociety @christine_pdx Completely agree with this. I think there are many many more than first thought and not just in the US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mssociety @MustStopMS @TheMightySite Yeah but would sleep for 23 hours a day and only wake up for food 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis I will be sad if slide away doesnt win, but live forever winning really isn't a bad thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Has to win. HAS TO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis COME ON SLIDE AWAY YOU BEAUTY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanBroadley Congrats. Join the club 😉😁 #firsttimersunite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They say people never change but that's bullshit,they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreakfast Top top work guys. Well done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreakfast The story of Tony and his passion for the 10 amigos and how many people have turned up really encapsulates the human spirit when called upon. Truly astounding to see it all come together like it has. @mrdanwalker should be proud of what has being achieved with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreakfast This is truly heart warming. ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spraggy That would be funny as the last time I got off a plane was 10 years ago when I was 15. That would confuse many people 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..." "I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlenderSherbet This is what I want to be when I grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS Walking around with a banner that reads "I've got MS, I know it doesn't look like it but believe me, I HAVE"  #probablywonthappenbutstill<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @TheSmiths_iP I've seen Morrissey live twice and both time I prayed he played it but he never did :( he did play how soon is now though which blew my mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @TheSmiths_iP Well I wonder is one of my favourite songs ever. It's equally as good when your hammered 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @TheSmiths_iP Agreed,you know its gonna be top just with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev Exactly. Can you imagine being on a bus with her or a train or walking down the high street . You're either going to attack her or shit yourself and run. That isn't ideal is it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @TheSmiths_iP I prefer Meat Is Murder as my favourite album. But this isnt bad,they didn't do a bad album really to be fair. 😂 Hand in glove was my first love for the smiths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 the drummer knows what the drummer knows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryTheCat4 @TheSmiths_iP I refuse to even consider a vote here haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSmiths_iP @BarryTheCat4 I'm not choosing. Too many bangers in here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365bingo @bet365 Can we have a fifth choice that just says " none". Then we can all be happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dog_rates I think this is possible the greatest thread I have ever seen. I could like every single picture and never get bored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev I genuinley don't understand the defending of her. It baffles me that anybody would want somebody in this country that at 15 year old decided to join a terrorist group. You're old enough at 15 to know the. Consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaimestaples @beccarr94 This took a turn I wasn't really expecting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 @Fdemyelination @MustStopMS I haven't had any side effects at all apart from being more tired. I was on capaxone before and that wasn't working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday Kurt. :) Your music still lives on more than you can ever imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fdemyelination @lauramann212 @MustStopMS I don't know much else. But it has a good success rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fdemyelination @lauramann212 @MustStopMS It's a chemotherapy drug that reduced your blood cells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauramann212 @MustStopMS mavinclad. Just finished my second week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are many many amazing albums. But none will ever come close to Humbug. My one true love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Submarine by Alex Turner was stupidly forgotten by me. Only bring back good memories surprisingly . Love the album very much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Im not voting. I honestly can't pick between them two songs. It's impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It still pains me today that Oasis never released Slide Away as a single<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KDC_LegitHD I'm a big Hull fan but I also support Liverpool because of my dad and grandad support them and that's what I grew up with before I went to my first Hull game. Given the choice it would be city  I've been the brunt of many people saying I can't support two. But I can :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fell asleep at like 6 and woke up at half 7. Now for some reason I can't sleep. Meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS Luckily not something I've ever experienced yet 4/5 years in so that deserves a chufty. I've only ever had cramp of sorts a hand full of times in my life.i must be lucky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev They were awful that substitution when he swapped his RB was laughable , they'll get destroyed if they play like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea were absolutely woeful. Slow and Predictable.United on the other as much as I hate to say it were excellent from back to front. Really really good performance from them that. Made Chelsea look very average #CHEMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reluctantnicko Who are they going to replace him with though? They've been through them all?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinley can't believe how bad Chelsea are<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bonusarenahull If you're not choosing Slide Away here then get out now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't sleep. Excellent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hullccinfo good evening. Please may you advise why the bins at my block of flats have not been emptied in the city centre? This could attract vermin and isn't ideal for the block? Thanks  https://t.co/ulQPhsxJyw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Felt sick on and off for two days. Not sure if it's my medication or not but bleaurgh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootyAccums Arsenal coming back to win 3-2 In the FA cup final 😥😑😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RFCUnionist @E_Clifford139 Exactly. It was just a case of need another striker anybody will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shiner_sam @MainlyOasis I agree completely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God Carrie Fisher was hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 Must have even from United. Was a good deal to let him go in mind opinion so we could replace him with nobody 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Clifford139 This is exactly the argument I had with a fellow city supporter who said they wanted to keep him. On a different planet. He's being unlucky with injuries but he's absolutely woeful for this level on my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brandon_Beaber @MustStopMS @mssociety I do think there are certainly more people originally thought to have MS that do. And that number may even be more for those who are lucky enough to have it and not relapse ( rare but there's a chance )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really did forget just how fucking good Definitely maybe is. Possible the greatest ever debut album?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGregory1 @bet365 Quite possibly could be him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinkfloyd @Just_pinkfloyd Dunno, but I bet it's something to do with Pink Floyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGregory1 @bet365 Agreed, im sure I saw a stat somewhere a long time ago saying he never missed, something to do with the way he took them. I hope were right 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 Graham Alexander at Burnley?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGregory1 @bet365 I thought this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm stuck in the limbo between sleeping and getting up 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fmbase In what way is the ME broken? The only thing I think is slightly annoying the lack of crossing into the box? I'm interested to know so I can see myself :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stapes @SMillward98 No honestly people really are this thick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_paulcheath @peter_levy I don't see what there is too disagree with? But you too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 DIRTY GET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_paulcheath @peter_levy No. No I do not as that is a criminal offence. I no longer smoke cannabis due to random work drugs tests. But you're completely missing the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_paulcheath @peter_levy I get what you're trying to say. But i can't stress enough that medicinal cannabis has no THC in it and it is no smoked. It is a spray for under the tongue. It's not like Methadone as a substitute for heroin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_paulcheath @peter_levy Again. Medicinal cannabis is not addictive because it doesn't contain THC. which is what gets you high and also shows up on any form of drug tests .have I smoked weed? Yes, do I have a full time job and live in private tenancy? Yes? Do I own a nice car? Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" so Paul in payroll has told me youve being scanning you're bottom on the photocopier again. We talked about this. You're on your final warning"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@76georgezeeking @StevenEllam Dumped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_paulcheath @peter_levy As a person with MS myself, at 25, I think medicinal cannabis is fine. It has the THC removed which is what gets you high when it's heated, there are no risks whatsoever in my opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pchapman24 Shouldn't have to pay the TV license fee at all. It's archaic and outdated. I for one do not pay it and never will because I don't watch TV 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homeless in this day and age should not be a thing. There are enough empty houses to make sure everybody has a home. The system is a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You still take my breath away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 cannot wait for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 @HDMHullCity @hulllive And mazuch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr I don't even know how this was possible. But so glad it was!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Haha! Made him look like a world beater didn't it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull I remember when we were signing him and everyone was going ' watch this video of him on YouTube he's class" errrrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenadamson_ Nahhh this isn't a thing surely 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smeds04 @MainlyOasis Tis!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoBlain @Grooie1995 @MainlyOasis Thanks mate, appreciate that feedback there 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grooie1995 @LeoBlain @MainlyOasis What you thanking me for here buddy? 😂 Not saying your opinion is wrong. I just disagree with you in every single way possible. But you like oasis so I can't be mad 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetHandsPlant @Tyson_Fury Good on you buddy,good on you 😥☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slide away is and always will be the best song ever written.   It is perfect   Nothing to add, your honour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoBlain @Grooie1995 @MainlyOasis Nah man slide away is the best song oasis have ever done by far, everything about it is perfect. Intro, lyrics, solo, outro and noel at the end is just utter perfection in every single way, nothing can come close to it in my opinion. But I bet it gets beaten by DLBIA or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis If anybody chooses my big mouth over slide away here then they need to get into the sea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 The crafty cockney all day long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mswainyy @MainlyOasis 100% this 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomfletcher1978 @fmbase @fmscout 4231 has always been my preferred formation because it's versatile. If you're defending a lead you can put your right wingers as right midfielder/ change your CAM for CDM Etc etc. When going for it sub your CAM for a ST and play 442 with wingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karljvincent I will have 2 😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmberNectarHull Im not saying for a second that the majority of the creative work on this was anything other than those at the club, however outsiders were clearly used to determine an outcome that would please the majority. I don't see that as a bad thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberNectarHull Before you all jump in though remember this wasn't just the club who designed this without supporter input<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinley like this a lot. Well played<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCSport Honestly. I fucking love this bloke. He deserves every bit of respect and admiration he gets. Not the piss poor antics of two BBC pundits. Good luck to him #hcafc #swfc #SteveBruce<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis The fact that Slide away is winning this by a country Mile does make me so happy. Im not saying it's the best song ever written but it's definitely in the top 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootyAccums Messi to evergrande for £17 #bargain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fucking fire alarm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FridayNightFM I generally tend to sell them once their status start to drop. 50m is a decent price for a 33 year old, but you could replace him with a wonderkid for that amount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FridayNightFM If you can find a decent replacement sell him but if not keep him, I keep them until their star rating goes down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FridayNightFM Look at his physical stats. Usually they plummit as they bet old ( goes without saying ). What's his star rating?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FridayNightFM Yes, 100%. I just sold 35 year old Dybala to Madrid for £2.5m and freed up £350k in ages. Replaced him with a 20 year old wonderkid on 90k a week. #lookingafterthefinances<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still quite pissed I didn't shove the river on the hand that cost me most of my chips when I knew he was bluffing v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man utd are so OP on this save. Won the champions League six of last seven years and won the prem t in a row. Putting me off even going on as they just beat everybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe I didnt cash tonight. One hand did me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn lost a huge pot down to under 20 bigs. Could be bust soon :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dopeburgerltd @danilio95 we would smash this lad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PositiveAdkins Completely agree 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accountfm Madness. Kinda hands PSV The advantage now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accountfm I saw it at 3-2 and thought ah it could go either way that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It still confuses me how Americans put the month before the day? Like how does 01/27/19 even make any sense . There isn't a month 27 ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accountfm 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iskra Stop it  https://t.co/6Z7eS7Ng91<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 True! Luckily it was only a quid 😂 decent bet that though what I'd do for one of them at the minute #skint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 Newport! Thought it had won haha. Decent that lad! Nice little earner. 😁 Ive had the majority of my bets recently were on team lets me down reet jokers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 Something I could see happening in there 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 had a £1 bet on yesterday 7 fold. ( Spare change in my account ) and it would have won had Newport not scored 90+4. 😂  Cost me £98 the cunts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole?  https://t.co/8bmbSndxL9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis I wish I had his voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im still not over if<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow @AFCWimbledon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SO  Off a 1.05 bet for £98. Newport county two divisions below Middlesbrough scored a 90+4 goal to ruin my bet. I am the unluckiest cunt alive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off newport wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @piersmorgan @talkSPORTDrive For once just once in my life I completely agree with piers Morgan  You can't overlook viera as good as Keane was, viera was also techniqually brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swear to god if Lincoln and bury draw I am not going to be happy that Newport scored a 94th minute equaliser and denied me £98<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeScott92 Pulis is a bit of a fraud to be honest. Luckily it was a joke bet with shrapnel in my account. I thought they'd be going up this season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeScott92 Middlesbrough at home though weren't they. 90 plus 4 Jesus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayy_NA Yes then lad! You'll be running marathons before you know it 😁👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeScott92 Try having Middlesbrough. My bet was on the verge of winning £98. In fuming. I don't bet anymore because of shit like this. Okay so only £1.05 bet but still im furious. Congrats on your win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newport county of league two score 90+4 against a championship side and busted my bet that was going to win. And that you're honour is why I don't bet. Even if the bet was 1.05 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Newport thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off oldham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barnsley = guaranteed to prove you wrong. Get in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_brookes @PJBuckingham You can't be serious? Why would you not want a managers contract to be renewed after ensuring survival for two consecutive season when we looked dead and buried 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennyImafidon @mssocietyuk Hi Kenny as someone young (25, 20 when  diagnosed ) with MS I would like to do this. however, I don't want to take the £15 offer/voucher. Can this be redirected to the Ms society upon my wishes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cullum_beech @AndreAntoniazz2 @MainlyOasis I didn't at first. But if you keep listening to it honestly it grows on you. I love it now and how it sounds  Very Bowie who I love so I guess that's why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreAntoniazz2 @MainlyOasis Agreed it did baffle me he went like that but at the same time I liked the fact they changed and made an album like AM as suck it and see was a bit limp. Problem is people who liked them have also grown up. I don't like WPSIATWIN I much prefer the new stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how but I'll make it in the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody who thinks DMA's are a gimmick need to put For Now, go and lay in a dark room and listen to For Now and then tell me. It is sublime #dma #amazing #fornow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreAntoniazz2 @MainlyOasis They grew up mate thats all. The Beatles did it, Nirvana did it and Oasis did it in the end. Most bands will change their sand as they develop. But I guess Im biased because when humbug came out it changed my life #seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreAntoniazz2 @MainlyOasis Soddy Favourite worst nightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreAntoniazz2 @MainlyOasis I beg to differ. Humbug, AM and TBHAC are some of the best albums written. Can you imagine 30 year olds talking about what they did on WPSIATWIN? I think they got so much better after TBHAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 @NBiffs Wonder why 😂 that was a needless big hit with two of them. Surprised he isn't in a coma that lad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FootyAccums I loved the van persie volley for arsenal against Everton. But if anybody says an other than Scholes against villa then 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I need you now? Did I need you then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know how but I'll make it in the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell you what. For Now by @dmasmusic is absolutely stunning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr See it's weird because I don't like how the MiTo looks. I test drove one and it was nice but in the end I got the guilietta which is like a bus! That's the beauty of Alfa's nobody ever says it's ugly 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr Haha I agree! The genuine reason I got one was because of Top Gear. " You're not a petrol head until you've owned one" my mates take the piss because I have one. But I don't think there's many beautiful cars that beat alfas and that's why I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr Can't go wrong with a fiesta or a polo or something like that to be fair wish I went down that route first to be honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr Very nice. It was my first proper motor after an Ignis. The best thing is you don't see that many about! There are some lovely Alfa's about, I would love a guilia! And yes mate very sensible! they're lovely cars they just cost a fair whack to run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr Definitely. I think that's what puts people off. If they didn't have that reputation I think they'd be a household name as cars like my guilietta are wonderful 😘  https://t.co/qVwdNhOJ0s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's face it. We all know that plane is at the Bottom of the Channel and the two on board are most likely dead. Nobody can survive that long in freezing cold water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr This is true and I agree but modern Alfa's aren't like that I don't think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I wanna do is play poker and make so much money I don't have to work. Basically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSportsman CUNTY OWNERS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr Seen it pal! But I prefer the ones where they take the old Alfa's on a trip! If I could have any Alfa it would be a 1974 GTV ❤️  https://t.co/gL7N6NiiAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahaha wow! Top dollar stuff this 😆😆😆😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr God they're stunning them. I've never seen one even online  The best thing about the 4c Is the engine is only 1.7L.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackJack_Parr That's good then 😂 wasn't aware you drove an alfa.kudos! They're beaut but mine costs me a bomb in fuel. they get a bad rep but I've had nothing wrong with mine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All I want is 10 fucking thousand coins so I can upgrade my janitor on rollercoaster Tycoon. Is that really too much to ask?! #stressed #waitingtorefill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamJamesWalk At least you know it's not because of the sexual urgencies you have for her pal 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTSportBoxing Im pretty sure it was a Fury fight as I never bothered with it  Now when it's on I am watching it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy here has a magnificent comb over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iskra Very much so.  https://t.co/oOWuD3xzFZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine spending £100m and still getting relegated. That's like buying a house to live in the garage #FULTOT #relegationfodder #chuckedit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Hahahaha knew it! Can't kid a kidder son 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Takeaway at the end of the journey though pal so doesn't really count 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham Yes but he wont get one as he will probably earn too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only now do I realise how alcohol/ tiredness affects me when I try to drive 😮🤐😯 #task<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know about Bielsa spying but from what I can gather @marcc9999 has a decent portfolio of my twitter activity.....  https://t.co/Zk8rfDl3AH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"status incomes tax*  Riigghhhttttttt.  No scam here.  None whatsoever.   😂😂  https://t.co/AtfhobnBxk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So falling asleep and waking up at 11pm wasn't the best idea. Oh well I'll blame it on the medicine 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1982philwalker @MustStopMS I am exactly the same. The lack of side effects had made me wonder whether or not it's actually doing anything. But reading up on it and the things I've been told really can only be positives. Thank you for your reassurance. It really means a lot to know im not alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennyBangdal @makkydoll @MustStopMS That makes me feel better, thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1982philwalker @MustStopMS The side effects issue worried me a lot and I was reluctant to take it but it seems I've responded well but I've only had one dose. I came straight off capaxone onto it. The last relapse I had was a year ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @MustStopMS Of course :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makkydoll @JennyBangdal @MustStopMS I just started Mavinclad yesterday. Did you experience any side effects? I've not had any so far 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MustStopMS I have just started Mavinclad  My first dose of tablets was yesterday and I've not had any side effects. Do they normally onset after a few days or as soon as you take them? #chatms #mavinclad #wasnervous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tattoo booked. Yeyyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always weird when you see your place of work on the telly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My god Holly Willoughby is fit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kerry Katona on this morning  38 years old. Bright purple hair. What the fuck are you doing you child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really should stop playing online poker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpankTheBookies Of all the things I missed. One trainer is the big one. I'm a thick bastard and don't deserve to win and sniff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpankTheBookies Is it 122? Using bodmas. Two trainers = 20. + two ties = 28 × 4 for the tie = 112 plus 10 for the trainers ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really not looking forward to taking this :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham @ShackHull People getting waaaaayy ahead of themselves here 😂 booking the play off final off work " just in case " is just plain daft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way you hold me like a creature brings me back the thirst for freedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have only two emotions  Careful fear and dead devotion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NME Killed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 Class game! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 should go back on soccer manager you know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Ocean // Richard Hawley   It's so perfect that it actually hurts when I listen to it because I wish I wrote music like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 What's bad about that? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 Fuck sake 😂 what did you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomg105 did you get blocked off your other account again lad? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlp_sabres @RealKidPoker @PokerStars I may :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These long ass sleeps are joyous. Even if I do miss half a day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlp_sabres @RealKidPoker @PokerStars Will definitely read it. Glad you recommend. Yes he had a helmiuth and brunson one too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fed up of people taking the piss out of me. Fuck you all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad's just digged this out for me 😁 @RealKidPoker @PokerStars 😁😁 this is my reading for a few days  https://t.co/cewSGPu9Wx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yaaasssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexHall27 @FootballManager Hey dude. Not anymore since the update doesnt seem as bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the poker action on @PokerStars was over. BUT ITS NOT WOOOOPP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's days like today you realise how much of a bastard MS can be. Back ache, tired and my legs aren't working properly. Having a beer before I get In bed and stay there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelycaz74 How is this good 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 You need more twitter friends 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokerStars Oh definitely the knitted heart making its way to the winner was amazing. My favourite poker moment was the rivered full house Q5 runner runner! That was unbelievable. Thank you for streaming it. Was a pleasure to watch :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostRider_TV @frogseye75 @Stapes Lol gimp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostRider_TV @frogseye75 @Stapes You called him a peasant for owning an android phone. Android are bigger than Apple. Which would suggest they're more popular so therefor how can that make you a peasant? A peasant would be owning a Nokia 3310. I really don't understand your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming Back To life is one of the most perfect songs I have ever heard. It's a dream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostRider_TV @frogseye75 @Stapes As in android, which is bigger than Apple Android?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamJamesWalk 😂 betting on who's going to die first. Awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamJamesWalk You'll get aids long before my Ms Kicks in pal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamJamesWalk this it your account isn't it and not Lexi's. Just need clarification<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I was ready all along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Told my love to wreck it all. Cut out all the ropes and let me fall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess you realise in the end who your real friends are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 don't even tell me this isn't sickening 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hull1983 Nah I'm kidding you can never advocate drugs in any form unless Its medicinal #truth   Not saying they're not brilliant. But not saying you should do them 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JOE STAPLETON LIKED MY TWEET  JOE STAPLETON  LIKED MY TWEET  OH MY DAYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hull1983 The simple is   " In moderation. They're awesome"   #justAjoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an amazing. Superb. Unbelievable tournament @PokerStars @Stapes @hartigs I've watched it all and loved every single minute. Loved it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So tomorrow is a big day. The last time I will self inject after four years on capaxone.  THE  END IS NEAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokerStars I did want Bicknell to win. But i think Baumstein the way he's running will take it down. #toohot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way, which one is pink?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically what you're telling me is you don't think my tattoo is totally fucking cool.  Said no one  Ever   😘🖤  https://t.co/JIhbP3Q7Hv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I just say that every time @krissyb24poker appears on the @PokerStars TV livestream I fall that little bit more In love with her #sorrynotsorry #QT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh and for the record @Stapes I totally did this to get a reply along the lines of. " You're a dooshbag for thinking that, but thanks"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I happen to think the @PokerStars stream would be rather boring if @Stapes didn't host so for me, he should just do it on his own  Imagine how many people that would annoy 😂 #pokerstarstv #hatersgonnahate #givetheguyaknighthood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull How I wish I was for odds like that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Hope you staked big my friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never spent a penny on @PokerStars. Freerolls in a 25k buy in event. Finishes 21st out of over a thousand entries and bags £150k. That's what dreams are made of. Kudos that guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull If I had the money I would be banging hundreds on that if there wasn't a maximum stake. Should have been 1/2 or something surely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'm in love with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just can't get the thought of you and him out of my head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokerNews @PokerStars Errrr, how?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU CANT USE CAPS and then apologise for using them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam1Dev It's Julio geordio 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spraggy  https://t.co/yQEOj202PJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes then @spraggy woop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reeces @E_Clifford139 I mean, this is magnificent twittering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 Im only in 2027. I've got a long way to go before I become a hero in the football world like you, mr chairman!  https://t.co/2bYZ7UVBJm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mustapha Kanit is a boss #PokerStarsTV #poker #boss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whaaaa. Someone managed to get the man city job after they offered me it when I was mid table with Watford. My transfer budget for the new season is £263m 😮 the most i think I've ever had on any FM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveHarrisonBBC @bielbs56 @northferribyutd @VFTAE Good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TOGETHER WE STAND  DIVIDED WE FALL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember me when you dissolve in the rain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an actual piss take<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Bullshit. I quote my uncle who does maintenance on police cameras " they only operate at peak times such as rush hour as they cannot cope with the amount of tickets they would have to raise for speeding drivers 24/7"   Nice try though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So so pissed off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you ABP for making me stay till 5.30 and get stuck in traffic. Much love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Us And them And after all We're only ordinary men ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss the comfort in being sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If she floats then she is not a witch like we had thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwayDaySleepers I had my flag up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So even though I'm quite enjoying my Watford save I've decided to create a club. Up the T's Pennyroyal FC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People ask me what I watch on the telly. I say " I don't watch TV" when in actual fact I just watch marathons of salvage hunters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need food but can't be arsed to do anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AccidentalP Hahahaha 😂 amazing @danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RicardoHCAFC @LeeScott92 Scored 2 goals in his past 40 appearances 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DONT EAT YOUR MEAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a real big craving to watch nirvana live videos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcc9999 As if this is still going 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I won £115m first thing I would do is book a trip to vegas, play high stakes poker, and buy 10g of cocaine to snort off a hookers tits #pleasemalord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired. Little bit drunk and slightly depressed. Welcome to WHY JOSH HARDLY DRINKS ANYMORE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samjane6766 @ShackHull Hahaha shack. You're tweet has opened up a whole new lifestyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samjane6766 @ShackHull I am nicking that hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @Samjane6766  https://t.co/xZ9XYrlKg1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samjane6766 @ShackHull Makes my Friday night. I know it's coming and the excitement is too much 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samjane6766 @ShackHull I live for this tweet Sam, honestly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 Tis true though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham Oh and please don't think I'm attacking your view of Keane. I'm not, I respect your view that you think he's " decent ". I however, think hes shite and we won't miss him at all. Just proving my point tis all :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham Let's compare to another manchester United striker who went out on loan at the beginning of his career. Let's say fraizer campbell. By the time he finished his first spell at city he had bagged 35 in 65. A strike rate of nearly 1 in 2. I rest my case about keane  https://t.co/U9uSRNXlec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham In his last 40 appearances he has scored 2 goals. That's a strike rate of 2 every 20 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham 69. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham 59 senior club appearances   5 goals.   1 in 10  For a striker   You do the math sir, rather have bobby zamora up top.  https://t.co/xcDGicZAT4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham Look at his stats. I can back up my opinion with facts which can't be disputed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham He's not a championship striker, doesn't have the attributes, I don't rate him, his record is awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeScott92 Mate, he's garbage 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham All you have to do is look at his stats. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but as a footballer he's nowhere near good enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham Serious question. What team you being watching? He's woeful and by far our worst attacker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Edmond14 @PJBuckingham Why would you want him too. He's shite. One goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know all about me and that's what's so frightening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cazza78MUFC Underrated but equally as good as Kante in the job he does 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cazza78MUFC Did a one man job on a Liverpool midfielder that had 3 trying to do the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Silver tongue Hill where you talk up what I play down. I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the result Liverpool wanted. Highlights the need for another CB. I still think they'll win the league if they play how they have been  A world class goal has won it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOVREN HAHAHHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No denying that's a quality finish. Only place keeper cant save it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker IS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET INNNNN YASSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loven: doesn't look over his left shoulder. Doesnt react to Aguero getting to the ball first. Doesn't put in an attempt to stop the ball. He is woeful. #lfc #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my combined Man City and Liverpool XI - what would yours be?  https://t.co/HVrQi5cIeT #bbcfootball via @bbcsport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were Marlon Brando. I was Steve McQueen. You were KY jelly. I was vaseline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365Gaming @bet365 " let's his assistant do the talking"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy 70th birthday to the bestest grandad in the whole world. 🖤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a job Chris Houghton is doing at Brighton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MainlyOasis Slide away is better 🖤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I was scared. I would  If I was bored. You know I would And if I was yours. But I'm not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 mate, you alright?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The little riff in Shine on you crazy diamond after the opening solo is perfection baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter likes to remind me that EastEnders is on. A show which I haven't watched since I left home three and half years ago FFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still feeling under the weather but better than I was. As such I have not been shopping and got nothing in. So I have bought Chinese. yey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__LAWES @bet365 You're missing the point of the chant then 😂 that's why it's sang because of the reaction to it  We all know it's shite lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__LAWES @bet365 Oh does it. That's why they ( we ) sing it. Even city fans myself included know it's an awful chant, but funny all the same when grown men get on twitter and rant about it being shit 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just so you know @HullCity #hcafc fans. We're only two points behind villa. TWO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bet365 MAULED BY THE TIGERS. YOURE GETTING MAULED BY THE TIGERS 😂 #ILOVEHOWITPISSESEMOFF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberNectarHull I'm feeling well and truly sixy right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJBuckingham POSITIVE GOAL DIFFERENCE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull @PJBuckingham Aye, I remember that. He missed that one as well 😋😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be so typically city to end the run with a defeat at home to fucking Bolton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look. Still not well. Fuck off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddockII It's ridiculous, I mean I do live right in the city centre, but 3am takes the Michael . Happy new year by the way :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome my son. Welcome to the machine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, honestly right, straight up no messing around this is the best thing ive ever seen.  MAGIC   https://t.co/WFgHE5nplT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of cunt decides to let a firework off at 3am?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWaster I'm 25 and theres no way I'm kicking Nigela out my bed if she were ever in it. I'm not even ashamed. #milf #gilf #howizshe57?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing better than putting Shine On You Crazy Diamond and losing yourself ❤️ especially when the clock starts 12 on the day you really detest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidlewissmart Looking forward to White Lies and Zurich albums :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's very quiet here in the town centre to say it's new year in 21 minutes. I fucking hate it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it all gets real All I want is you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Agreed mate. Don't understand why people do it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiewhittleton Should be banned unless for public display like Australia. Not fair on animals at all. Really pisses me off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love you. Like the forest loves the rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dog on the roof cracked me up 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not saying I've never seen or loved a video as much as this one online. But its definitely in the top one. ❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not impressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazCoombes @JimmyKimmelLive This is just superb ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95 cracks me up every time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not being able to breathe out of your nose is fucking horrendous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themichaelowen if you could own any race horse which would it be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themichaelowen what makes you happy more than anything else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themichaelowen proudest moment as a footballer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themichaelowen could you play in this Liverpool side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danilio95<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 I'm not saying you're a shit side. I just think with your defence you are way off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Your defending was abysmal though? The first penalty was stone wall he had Two bites at home. The equaliser was just shoddy defending by not clearing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowansstephen1 Ah come on mr g  You cant say arsenal are anywhere near Liverpool or man city's level yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living  hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Can even begin to think what it would be like to be that inbred you support your local sides nearest rivals....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull Leeds fans from Hull. Should be banned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OGringo1 @rickygervais What?! Right tipple that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reluctantnicko thoughts on Hull form? Imperative they keep hold of bowen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackHull This is a fucking disgrace mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scicluna1986 @StanCollymore Zzzzz boring cunt<|endoftext|>
