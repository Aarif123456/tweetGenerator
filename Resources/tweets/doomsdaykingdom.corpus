<|startoftext|>So I don't think that Z 13 was never solved? I am still not sure. Since Z 340 is cracked can they use it for the other one? #truecrime #ZodiacKiller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the fourth one requires only 1 switch of word order not 2 or 3. So if that is actually the correct one and not the 1st one. This is like a suicide note. That is why I was like no... It's sounds like an acceptance of it. I want to know the FBI's ideas.  #ZodiacKiller #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that perhaps the first one that I said is probably the right one... But I initially thought that the fourth one was actually what he meant and "death" was the only word switched. The problem is we don't know "new life" "life" and "death" intended positions #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... basically he's meaning:  ... my life is death New life will be an easy one in Paradise  Or  ... My new life is death Life will be an easy one in Paradise  #Zodiac #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am beyond convinced that last 2 lines we're messed up by the Zodiac himself!   .... I know my death is new life Life will be any easy one in Paradise  Or   ... I know my death is life  My new life will be an easy one in Paradise.   There is also a third way that I saw it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've started questioning the existence of the Zodiac killer. I mean one man or at least a group of comrades. I am one of the few fringe people that question it. I HATE that I feel like that, but I am not going to lie. #340solved makes me doubt it more I think! #Zodiac #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my question... So the UK allegedly was working on a #COVID19 vaccine before anybody pretty much except MAYBE China. Did they find anything or what? They were allegedly working on this since I think late January early February!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also @NBCNews in 2004 the record of the most HIV deaths in the world ever with 1.6 million give or take &amp; covid19 is about to beat that worldwide record. 3 weeks left, during holidays, during winter... We have a problem folks. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid has had way more deaths in the USA in less than a year than HIV/AIDS did in all of 2018. It was estimated at 16,000 people died that year. With #COVID19 290,000+ now! Why did I compare it to HIV look at my previous tweets to get that whole picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 a heck of a year! I think my 2020 shocker would have been finding who the zodiac killer is or aliens coming... Aliens less surprising actually. The 340 solution is a big deal even if the year doesn't have the 2 major events that would be beyond anything! #truecrime #Zodiac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DulcetTone *their<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DulcetTone Did you see there video? Like 51 years to get it for a REASON!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In an odd way Zodiac was an idiot. The reason it was never solved without these insane computer programs is because the dude make mistake in his own code! "Death is life" I think... Did he kill himself?! He sounded young or very immature too. #zodiackiller #truecrime #340solved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg... @HISTORY why did you cancel that show I LOVED it!! Recently I have thought it was a prank from the killer! THIS IS ALMOST GSK'S identified big crime news! #truecrime #zodiackiller #340solved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See #COVID19 as a odd positive if the mRNA  based vaccines work w no long term side effects. That is a step towards development of DNA vaccines. Those would be on the list of the most influential discoveries and achievements of humankind... Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has never been a freaking vaccination in history used on humans using mRNA! This is the last frontier before they create the DNA altering vaccine. It's just one step behind it. If humans can master to alter DNA afterbirth. That is monumental! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I try to say no people are being crazy #covid19 is a natural occurring phenomenon... That sure required a brand new type of vaccine never used before... That Australia thought it was okay to make a vaccine with HIV parts to stop it... That has kept surprising us...  https://t.co/baME8gYsbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate being that person but what's come to light about the #covid19 w/ HIV parts vaccine in Australia being a thing &amp; the insane zig zag that covid19 has been doing leads me to believe it was made in a lab or was most likely altered in lab. A bio warfare agent gone wrong... Idk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was common sense that covid was not just a respiratory illness due to insane number of symptoms that had nothing to do with lungs. I suspected it and even had a conversation about it with a doctor. I got a BS in Psychology... Yet I could see it. It was more that we thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said at the start #COVID19 was not necessarily a respiratory illness alone &amp; that it is actually inflammatory. Later on actual scientists were saying that yes it is essentially, because it causes inflammation in the inside of the blood vessels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if like that HIV component and covid-19 somehow meshed and it turned into the love child of a 2 insane viruses. How... I am beyond stunned. Do #COVID19 &amp; HIV actually have something in common scientifically &amp; not it's not just me seeing patterns? I want answers on this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need clarification on what company was doing this. I'm reading the article but I'm a little confused on that part... CSL? Who put HIV components in the damn covid19 vaccine in Australia?! That seems irresponsible... What was the reason for it?! What connection did they find?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much we keep learning and discovering about HIV is astonishing. I don't think another disease has been more studied. Yet here we are... No cure &amp; now we are mixing benign components of it with covid-19. That doesn't sound smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so incredibly stunned. WHY WOULD YOU INJECT ANYTHING HARMFUL OR NOT INTO PEOPLE FROM HIV?! AUSTRALIA WTH!?!?  #COVID19 is a chest game &amp; HIV well the witch is crafty as all hell! It's one of the few illnesses that we learned about EXTENSIVELY and we STILL can't cure it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... how they are similar 3. I BEEN SAYING SINCE THE GATE LOOK INTO HIV TREATMENTS. They didn't look into treatments I think they look into the actual virus and used it!! Omg I am stunned. It's freaking FASCINATING! #COVID19 #COVID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg I'm not finish it with the article but I just read that they used a component of HIV that's non-harmful apparently for the vaccine!!! My mind is blown!!!  1. Why are you playing or manipulating HIV and/or it's components 2. I am a lot more right about...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit!!! I was just talking about the HIV/AIDS &amp; #COVID19 awe-inducing similarities like 24 hours ago. What the heck happened with this to mimic HIV or whatever happened! Wow. #covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh gosh 2021 really is the sequel! #COVID19  "A mysterious and fatal illness sickens hundreds in India"   https://t.co/8eRbM5CYxP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this is extreme but I would not date nor talk to somebody who does not wear a mask! It's that selfish of an act imo. Trust me seen a few good looking guys, but the no mask was more than enough to not look twice... And say among other things... "That's a shame." #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are there even mink farms in the world? I mean are we eating them... Otherwise... That's real selfish of Humans if I think what I know it is. Yes that is how I meant to word that. #COVID #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm trying to figure out what vaccine Moderna or Pfizer is better... I think I'm leaning towards Pfizer until we see what Johnson and Johnson brings with they're 2 dose vaccine that's not ready yet. #COVID #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was for Moderna... They say that is good for 3 months. I guess that means that they don't know if it can go past that. That's pretty insane if it is just 3 months! I am going to keep deep diving into that whole pile of beans. I am kind of shocked.  #COVID19 #covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGregLittle2 @CarlKaras2 So far for 3 month is what it  looks like for Moderna. They don't even know yet if it can last longer themselves which is kinda shocking. So at least 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 IDK about the 3rd. The only other company I know that isn't ready yet is Johnson &amp; Johnson. So idk how right but it looks like Moderna seems to be good for 3 months from what it looks. It's not anything like the flu vaccine this is a whole different type of technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another thing that's pretty messed up is with HIV you can avoid that by not putting yourself in the possible exchanging of blood. #Covid19... Well I need to breathe.. you can get it from "contaminated" air. You are hard pressed to figure that out  since you can't see or feel it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have compared HIV/AIDS &amp; #Covid19. They have this odd... Idk. Both even came for animals! Again it could just be because they're both viruses. I have also thought they should have tried HIV meds from the get go! Was that tired? I know malaria medication was tried. I wonder...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, HIV/AIDS started off with the alert of pneumonia just like #covid.  It too has many different symptoms &amp; people can be asymptomatic. I get they are both viruses... But it's interesting. #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spoke to a doctor who said how much their reaction during the HIV/AIDS epidemic is very similar to #COVID19. That continued to get me thinking. I don't think people understand how unprecedented and historic this is. This is going in the history books and not for a good reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2019 around 690,000 died of HIV/AIDS worldwide. Well over 1 million for #COVID so far! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what's even crazier is that I believe the highest number of HIV/AIDS deaths worldwide was 1.9 Million in 2004. Covid has 1.5+ million in it's 1st year of being discovered!!! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what's real crazy that statement is actually more truth than you would think! Worldwide in 2018... 770,000 &amp; 16,000 in the USA died of HIV/AIDS. Covid has flown past these numbers! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot of things that I saw coming in my lifetime. A virus that has no stopping it, can kill in days, &amp; IS ALTERING OUR LIVES &amp; which isn't HIV IS SHOCKING! The 1980s HIV/AIDS boom &amp; discovery might have a run for it's money!  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait I don't know if this is true or not but I heard that the coronavirus vaccine is only good for 3 months!??? you need two doses of this injection and yet it only works for 3 months!! You won't even get through winter!??? #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confirmation of my fear... We DON'T know what the reactions are or will be! #COVID19  UK issues allergy warning about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after patients fall ill  https://t.co/tjTZUzpu09 via @nypost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would you give anybody accused of murder bond?! Especially that he killed a 16 year old child! #truecrime  'Devil worshipper' released in 2016 homicide case arrested in shooting death  https://t.co/UN9ajDYWcN #FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that the killer says there are more victims &amp; the cops and FBI completely deny it... and guess what there were seven! That's shockingly. #truecrime  D.C. sniper Lee Boyd Malvo: I was sexually abused by my accomplice  https://t.co/e8HzpcJW15 via @TODAYshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I forgot about Timothy McVeigh that was only 4 years! I forget that guy even existed! It's a huge case of domestic terrorism, but unlike 99.999% I don't recall the existence of the perpetrator! Never heard ANYTHING about his life only the aftermath of the bombing. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious question: why was John Allen Muhammad the DC sniper executed so fast? He was on death row for only 6 yrs. Don't people stay on DR for like 20 yrs? The 1st and only case I know of that started &amp; then ended by capital punishment in my lifetime. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright in a fast food joint it was empty except me. When I turn around to leave I see 4 idiots sitting behind me. Are you serious?! That is beyond messed up with #COVID19! It is intent with malice to spread it if they have it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is 2020 and people are still raping others and still raping CHILDREN... And now they are doing it at doctor's offices how the hell?? #TrueCrime  Girl, 14, sexually assaulted in NYC doctor’s office hallway in shocking caught-on-camera attack  https://t.co/rz98Ioy66p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I'm starting to believe that we should have post-birth abortions. I don't care how old he was or anything. There is zero excuse for a 9 year old being allowed to be a serial rapist. A pure danger to society. #TrueCrime   https://t.co/UIBcOafZkl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are killing their newborn kids and there's some of us that can't even have kids! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Echo Michelle Lloyd's poster. She went missing on mother's day just like Susan Morphew. She is also around the same age, but we have a lot less information about her case and attention on it. #Missing #missingpeople #Missingperson  https://t.co/1gNY0mGk0R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wish that the media and public concern for missing people was fair and didn't become so contingent on their race and/or their social economic status. #Missing #missingperson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe that I haven't heard anything about this Echo Michelle Lloyd case when she went missing the same day that Susan Morphew went missing!!! So why is everybody obsessed with Susan and everybody ignored Echo? It's it money?! #truecrime #Missing #missingperson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just white &amp; black people who go missing. There's Native Americans, Hispanics, Asians, we should show a little bit more concern for the others too. I've only heard of one Asian, one or two Hispanics, and now one Native American missing in my 34 years of life! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have never heard of an active missing person's case that involved a Native American except for Jalajhia Finklea like 2 weeks ago who was found dead. I'm 34 years old and I've never heard anybody work on an active case of a missing native person! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now on that list is that hands down Native Americans are possibly the most disenfranchised Americans &amp; forgotten! I know Hispanic are a 2nd... But people act like Natives don't even freaking exist! Hispanics go missing not a blip. Natives go missing... Crickets. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know my great-grandmother was a Native American. I don't know anything about her except her 1st name. I know I am not part of that community because I'm so far removed... But all these bad things going on with Natives even today has me feeling so bad for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a little word of advice if you suspect that you have covid-19 and you're going to the emergency room I guess it's common courtesy for you to let them know beforehand. My area wants us to call ahead. They need to prepare PPE and an isolated area. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like the element of a 15 year old raping someone is hard to grasp even more so than killing someone imo. Yet to have a 15 year old do BOTH is beyond words. The scarier part is the people that killed Candace Rough Surface are out free! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I am learning about the  case of Native Candice Rough Surface. The people that killed &amp; raped her hardly served time! Secondly, what 15 year old decides to rape, kill, &amp; drag the body of anyone along with their 16 year old cousin?!  #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is potentially a wide opening of a potential serial killer(s) or human trafficking scam. Share this!!! I am with @CrimeJunkiePod this goes deeper. #truecrime #HumanTrafficking BWBRSA: Operation Fireball, let's play it!  https://t.co/eLl3zYAs0U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly if you don't wear a mask where you're in a place where everybody else is wearing a mask I immediately consider you a trash person. I don't care if I am attracted to you or not. Yes I'm in Florida but in my county mask are mandatory in public buildings! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's called that individual had a word limit they had to fill... Aka BS like you had to for those 5,000 word papers in college. You got to finessed it! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DealerCereal If you speak the language then of course you would know but to me a non-native ear it does. Also they aren't even the top 5 languages were I am from so def a foreign ear on me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bshouldice I can't say. I really don't have any stats on that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the heck this actually the 1st time I hear a firefighter do something scandalous. I won't count Morphew since he's a volunteer firefighter. I THINK there might be be 1 more case... Fisher who killed his whole family. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to know what happened to Wuhan, China during and after the American phase. Everyone stopped covering it. How did they fair? #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember how scared I was when I saw Chinese gov block off Wuhan like they did. That was one of the "omg" moments in history for me. Idk if they did, but atp I thought they were abandoning them and forcing a local extinction... IDK what else to call it a die out? #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I had to choose between China and Iran on who lied about their numbers most I'm going to go with Iran. We saw like football fields worth of mass graves in satellite images! China was making massive hospitals &amp; Iran was making graves. Idk maybe China hide it better?  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the real truth is that we don't know the magnitude of what really happened in the spring in counties like China, Iran (most of all), Russia,  &amp; with North Korea we literally have no idea ever what is happening there and they might have not had a problem until now! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now most likely either way you look at it traveling &amp; tourism is probably going to get hit hard anyhow this winter! So we trying to save it early on was useless if the 2nd wave actually becomes the earthquake and last spring was a foreshock.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could have been... okay traveling &amp; tourism we got you later, but for right now let's save the rest  especially healthcare &amp; try to prevent a national economic down turn that could take years to repair. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that all travel to the United States should have been halted extremely early on even at the cost of the travel industry &amp; tourism. Instant now we have a situation where multiple industries are being threatened &amp; the general economy is weak. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was still perplexed by the fact that the United States did not close all borders in February at the latest! When in January it was clear something was going dowwwnn in  Wuhan! Also I want to credit @lookner for being the one to sound my alarm bells back then!  #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I am nobody but I've been following #covid19 since before it was named covid-19 back in mid January. The worst is yet to come folks mixed in with the Flu and holiday season this could be a huge deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again I know this is supposed to be a true crime account but I will be tweeting about other major news stories impacting Americans. I feel like I am compelled to. #COVID19 will be discussed here along with #truecrime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnWeatherman Thanks! The one good thing for me is that even before covid I always knew the rule of never touched your face with unwashed hands in public via training for the flu. Keep us updated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Florida is literally one of the most expensive states or at least in my area is and unemployment benefits are only $245 a week I think 27th in the nation. A 1 bd in a rundown neighborhood is $995 a month at least! #COVID19 #unemploymentbenefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnWeatherman I use to work in healthcare until Aug when I resigned and we would NOT let anyone with a temp of 99 in our office. I hope you kick #COVID19 in the butt!! Although now I am even more scared for myself as I cannot afford healthcare and have a higher chance of complications. 😦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are you all shocked that they found coronavirus in the USA in December 2019?! When there was an academic article in The Lancet saying that coronavirus was in China in October! @CDCgov or whomever has less common sense than a chick with a simple psych degree. Unreal. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think Ray Rivera actually killed himself. It makes more sense than the whole James Bond murder plot. #unsolvedmysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In is insane how they were on reality TV and the whole bit, but this case never got much if any national media attention. I feel like there where never any leads or anything besides the ex. #michelleparker #MissingPerson #Missing #TrueCrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last time I looked none of the podcasts that I really like have ever made an eps on #michelleparker. #MISSING #MissingPerson #truecrime @TCATTUnsolved @UnresolvedPod  @genwhypod @CrimeJunkiePod @TCAllTheTime @CriminologyPod  https://t.co/Qvd4MBqV5C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINALLY one of the podcast I listen to makes an episode on #JenniferKesse! Please do one on #MichelleParker... There is a very interesting element to that case. At one point we thought they found her body on my UCF campus. #MissingPerson #missing  https://t.co/F4vjswvs2I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pretty insane it could have ended very badly! Lady kept her composure even though she was terrified. Also her neighbor was awesome to let her in no questions. Women looking out for each other level 10! #truecrime   https://t.co/99LBbMs32H<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're going to be a delivery driver you can't be terrified of going to people's houses! This chick thought I was going to kill her! What. I just want food and to hide in my apartment... There's nothing nefarious going on besides my girth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no Manny. I would be shocked if there was. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow his reaction to seeing the victim's picture is fascinating! Either he is a good actor... Or idk. I have yet to ever see a killer react so much to a picture of their murder victim.  #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah he looked like he was in quiet delight. I too saw a very subdued grin. Wow. I have never seen somebody caught in history be happy they got caught for murder except the Mansion family. I think Richard Ramirez was pleased with himself as well. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also out of all the Latin languages French is the one that I least understand. I couldn't understand a word of it to be honest while they were talking in it. I think it's probably the least similar of the five languages? #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does German and English come from the same like language family like Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, &amp; Romanian are derivatives of Latin? There are a lot of words that are English sounding in German. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh... It's strange how easily I confuse French and German. It's because both have such over exaggerated pronunciation of words. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are seriously drag out the part of France. I'm starting to lose interest. The France stuff is just confusing and idk. It made it feel like a different story. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She also knew her son was the one killing the cats! Also she added that their were 2 pairs of hands... They need to dive deeper into this or is this BS? #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow his mom is a piece of trash. Seems like a lot of killers have parents that have a meh view about it or deny it. Jeffrey Dahmer's dad seemed like that. It always bothered me. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also is it just me or do we not hear a lot about murders in Canada but when we do it's always something real extreme! Like this series, the pig famer, the Ken &amp; Barbie couple that the WOMEN HAD HER LITTLE SISTER RAPED AND KILLED!#dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again I'm only halfway through the entire series but did I just understand that his mom knew about the cat killing videos?! 😮  #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also I'm kind of disgusted at some of the people in the doc that seem to be more concerned about cats and dogs rather than a human being killed!!! Maybe I'm perceiving it atm.  #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what I'm saying is I question if this was his only murder and his actual first? #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean I get the person is probably did horrific things to cats, but when he graduated it's like he skipped normal escalation of acts. That might have actually been his undoing too big too fast. #dontfuckwithcats #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About halfway through the whole #dontfuckwithcats series on Netflix. So I decided to go to Wikipedia and read about it. How do you go from killing cats to on your FIRST human kill dismembering them, performing necrophilia, and possibly eating them? 0 to 100 real quick! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think in all the mass shootings that happened the one that messed me up badly &amp; left me unable to do things was the El Paso Walmart shooting. Idk why....maybe it's the only one that I saw bodies on the floor. That was the most horrific crime scene I have ever seen. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some channels on YouTube make almost daily videos on Chris Watts can we please talk about an active case at least?! There are so many people that need help! This is a closed case &amp; legit does not need DAILY attention! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although I doubt #LoriVallow would probably realize that malachite green and Malachite are two different things either way they're both toxic especially malachite green. She might have know actually and it is all symbolism even if they arent the same things. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also just so that you all know malachite green and malachite are not the same thing! Malachite green was just named malachite for the color of malachite not because it is malachite! #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait didn't Alex Cox had high blood pressure which contributed to heart disease or something too?? Hmmmm    👀 #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought about that possibility months ago but I thought it was so far-fetched I think I even forgot about it the malachite poisoning theory. #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you're telling me that #LoriVallow is such an evil genius that she figured out that she could kill all these people using malachite and not get caught?! What she made tea or coffee with the toxic water she let the malachite sit in?! This is insane though! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has there ever been a documented case of somebody dying because of copper toxicity more specifically via malachite? I don't really see it in my searches but who knows! #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about Tammy Daybell.... Natural causes my butt! #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much copper in your body can lead to heart failure... Joseph Ryan died of heart failure but Alex Cox died of PE... Idk if copper poisoning can give you that. It does give you diarrhea... Cox was in the bathroom with feces around him when he died. #LoriVallow #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyhow if you ingest malachite you can become sick because it has toxic levels of copper. Did #LoriVallow use it to poison her Alex Cox and/or Joseph Ryan. Did she keep giving it to Tylee too in order to make her sick? #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright something just clicked for me. I kind of collect crystal. I have both polish and unpolish ones. I have 1 chuck of polished malachite. I wouldn't buy unpolished because it's toxic if ingested. Also I suspect that it also may contain asbestos. #truecrime #LoriVallow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelliesright @ToniRagusa Who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I just heard that apparently they're still looking for the shooter. #mayfairmall #mayfairmallshooting #Wisconsin #shooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any idea about the shooter? Dead or alive? #mayfairmall #mayfairmallshooting #shooting #Wisconsin #Milwaukee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to delete that I don't want to in put that out into the public space. They didn't know the ramifications &amp; the apology was real with actions 1st of all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSCorleone I was looking to find a live stream and I happen to see a few incidents there in the last year. I would not know though. I am in Florida. Wisconsin is one of the states that isn't talked about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We hadn't had a mass shooting in America in a little bit I think. I don't recall a shooting this year but then again #covid19 has been what I'm focused on. #mayfairmall #shooting #Milwaukee #Wisconsin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So looks like there is an active shooter in Mayfair Mall. There are people in stretchers. #truecrime #mayfairmall #shooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a case that no one talks about. Very strange. #Missing #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the pic of #QuawanCharles on the right side upper corner his face looks untouched looks like he is sleeping. He was a human being with all the same wants and needs that you have! Not only that he was a kid! Zero reason not to punish the responsible party! #truecrime #lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if it's decomposition but have his face looks like it's burned. It looks like maybe a chemical burn... Idk. It could just be normal for decomp.  #QuawanCharles #truecrime #lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly I saw the pic of #QuawanCharles. This wasn't in black &amp; white. This was in full color &amp; high resolution. I looked at him. HE DROWNED?! That is a lie!     Where the hell is the bloating from water?! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out about #QuawanCharles... All I can think about is Emmett Till. That boy was killed by grown white men, because a white lady decided to lie on him in 1955. Both boys with faces of innocence were unrecognizable in death... No way Charles drowned! #truecrime #lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether we see it or not people are smarter nowadays even though we act more stupid. Why would you blow it up instead of just burning it? You burn off the flesh with firefighters present &amp; heck you donate the bones to a museum or something... No?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How cool must it feel to be VP 2 terms &amp; then come back run for President &amp; get the win when people thought you out for the count?!

<|startoftext|>Please @realDonaldTrump  you had 4 years for once do the right thing and leave in peace man. People will respect you more if you accept things with class! #PresidentElectBiden #2020ElectionThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cant believe we have a new President. A guy that has been in the WH before and isn't a stranger to the people. It's nice. It's like 4 years America was interrupted or held hostage. I hope we can just try to focus on AMERICA &amp; making this country better. #PresidentElectBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is true America rarely removes its sitting president on the second term. Last time I think was Bush the  Father? Coincidentally he was a republican as well. #YoureFiredTrump #YOUREFIRED #PresidentElectJoe #PresidentBiden2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really was angry with Dr Fauci at the beginning of this coronavirus thing... But maybe he was being held like an intellectual hostage. Like the doctor who died &amp; was the 1st to warn China? Idk... What is going to happen to him. #Fauci #YoureFiredTrump #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all do know that coronavirus is still alive right? Covid19 doesn't care who you voted for!!!! #YoureFiredTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the flip side of that I have never in the four years called Donald Trump, "President Trump"... Like I legitimately don't remember one time doing it. #YoureFiredTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You ever notice how people in the last four years still call @BarackObama President Obama... They don't use Former President Obama... It was like a subconscious thing. I still call him that myself. #YoureFiredTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was one of then 2 guys that I would have voted for if they had gotten to the nomination. I would have gone rep for the 1st time ever. This tweet is not about parties. It's about America! Like it supposed to be! Thank you! #YoureFiredTrump #DefendDemocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact these people are so diverse you got LGBT, you got whites, you got blacks &amp; are all legit cheering like they're at a rave is hilarious. Not them... The fact that so many diverse people are happy that you're gone! That's embarrassing. 🤣 #YoureFiredTrump #DefendDemocracy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It true you know racist people were emboldened by Donald Trump to openly embrace and show their racism! I was scared for America more scared than when 9/11 happened, because we were fighting our own county folk.  #DefendDemocracy #PresidentBiden #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump all you did was divide. YOU never tried to make us United. You try to divide us with BS, so you can conquer for your own ego! YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT AMERICA! #DefendDemocracy #PresidentBiden #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can some people still stand by and want to hand America, OUR COUNTY to a dictatorship?! We the ones who saved the world's ass in WWII and stopped a man who was hell bent on world domination... and now to allow it to happen to us in 2020 is insane!  #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know why so many came out and voted for the Democratic party because WE HAD TO IT'S NOT FRAUD TO USE OUR RIGHTS! We couldn't leave America in the hands of #DictatorTrump, and just wait for the gas chamber in the horizon. #TrumpTerroism #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I forgot about Alaska Trump is taking Alaska with him too. #ThePostElection #ElectionResult2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't know why, but it still hurts that Florida went red! When that was announced I cried for a while. That really broke my heart. I thought Florida was better than hate!! #ThePostElection #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dictatorships when America is involved tend not to end well for the dictator. This is a dictator in the making... An American dictator. Please wake up. Hitler's sequel in a country that freed the world from him... A turn of events. #ElectionResults2020 #DictatorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America is the poster child for world democracy &amp; Trump is leading us into America's 1st dictatorship! This is a movie plot turn of events it's so unbelievable! #ElectionResults2020 #DictatorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am legit scared that America is going to end in a sad tale. From #1 superpower to a war torn country. I never thought we would end like this at our OWN hands even after we beat another dictator... Hitler. #DictatorTrump #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald Trump is going to actually be the death of America. This is insane! #ElectionResults2020 #DictatorTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It makes me so sad to think that we have to live in a place that took 50 huge steps backwards &amp; on the verge of #DictatorTrump. I want us to get along &amp; I want us ALL to be free &amp; treated like humans. #ElectionResults2020 #TrumpTerroism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is a pretty big confessions on my end. I just voted for the survival. That's pretty messed up when you have to do that in 21st century America! When you think civil war and genocide could take place under #DictatorTrump. #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is that the reason why I voted the way I voted was not because of any political platforms. Not abortions, death penalty, housing, taxes, immigration. I just voted for the group that was less likely to put me in a gas chamber because I am brown. #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one thing I say about my area is I am happy with the racial diversity here &amp; intermingling of said groups. My state went red, but my metropolitan area went Blue! There is still hope... right? #ElectionResults2020 #TrumpTerroism #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You and me both. I thought that deep inside us we wanted to be United and strong as 1 diverse nation. That is way we could work on our problems not exacerbate them! #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The level of homogeneity in that group is stunning! 99.999999% white I THINK I see 1 brown person &amp; 85% look like they are fair haired. You sure members of incest are not part of this new domestic terrorist group? #TrumpTerroism #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This country is approaching politics like the Boods versus the Crips, or the New York Yankees versus the Boston red Sox. It's like they have to be freaking loyal until the ship absolutely and totally sinks &amp; we all drown.  #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If the Republicans do something stupid I'm going to not agree with it, and if the Democrats do something stupid I'm not going to agree with it. This isn't the New York Yankees versus the Boston Red Sox!  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know and I want to make this abundantly clear that I am not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat! I am 100% non-party affiliate I have my own brain and can use logic. This isn't a sports team.  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of all the states there are still in question I think the Pennsylvania might be the biggest question mark. It all dependent on those absentee ballots and the assumption that they are mostly Democratic votes.   #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys really need to stop with that thinking that Pennsylvania is actually rigging the vote if Biden turns out and wins! When the matter of the fact is they're not allowed to count the absentee ballots until the election so they're very behind!  #vote  #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump suing for a state to stop counting their freaking votes is insane it's voter suppression and it should be legal to be honest with you and some kind of fraud! #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you guys think that Donald Trump doesn't want Pennsylvania to finish counting the mail in ballots?! Because he's scared that the prediction is right and those are mostly democratic voters! Wake up!   #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also to point out that allegedly it was expected that the Democrats would vote early while the Republicans voted on November 3rd.  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is totally wrong because there's a fact that there are about a million mail ins that have not been counted. PA is not allowed to count them before the election. They're sitting there. I don't see it, but it could happen!   #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was contacted to become a collector for the elections and I don't know if that meant I had to count the votes but thank goodness I did not take that cuz it would have freaking killed me!  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 My state flip flops so much it's insane! It's all the old people from other states that come here with antiquated ideas. So idk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you can see the only real swing state in there is Florida. California and New York are Democratic states and Texas is a red state.  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the states are California, New York and Texas are tied and then Florida from what I was reading.  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden wins this is going to be the first time since like 1992 that somebody wins an election without winning Florida!! The huge swing state with a hefty electorial vote in play... The 4th most being there is a for second place.  #Election2020  #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know at very least even though my state voted red the counties that I consider personally important voted blue. At least I know that my county has their minds on the ball.  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't quote me on that math because I might be completely wrong on right numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it sounds really dramatic but there's underlying implications and those implications are not good. I don't want us to be so divided at very least in my state! He won by a good amount too. #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe how hard I cried when I found out that Florida decided to go with Trump! That broke my heart man... my state... My people. I cried a few times yesterday. Still makes me tear up. #Election #vote #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha... So according to my calculations I'm sure everybody else knows this. If the projected States actually do go to the projected winner then Biden will end up with 270 electoral votes and Trump will end up with 268.  #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are about to get real technical because I'm going to go ahead and break down the statistical possibilities on my own. Lol  #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again I'll be back to my #truecrime stuff when I'm done with the election. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this election talk has me thinking about all these elitist families and all this stuff... Sorry it's so random.  #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a fascinating topic because a lot of the families do intertwine and they have a lot of influence and impact in the United States and even around the world even today. I need to brush up on that. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only reason that I hesitate on putting Donald Trump's family on the list it's because the current incarnation is not behaving like old money. Why I want to put him on the list... His uncle.. how much influence did his family have back then? #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to dive deeper into the reason why people consider those families the top of the top of the elite. There's a difference between rich and wealthy, and a difference between old money and new money and it's world impact. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you know as crazy as this may sound now I think that maybe the Trumps might have to be on that list. Only because I think the Trumps had something to do with altering American history even before Donald Trump. Idk  #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's current interesting that Bush is in that league. I don't see a clear path, but I guess it's possible. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The elitist families of the world I know it's Rockefeller, Bush, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Rothschild, DuPont. This is the creme de la creme when it come to old money and influence. Were, are, or could the Kennedys been or be on that list?  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I was thinking about what if JFK Jr was still alive would have he ever gone into politics like his other family. Would he have been president? Would the Kennedys today be considered one of the most powerful families in the world the top of the top?  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this is really odd but for some reason these past few days I've been thinking about JFK Jr... Why?! I was a preteen when he died, so I never was really familiar with him until the day that they were searching for him when his helicopter crashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized the only thing I ate the entire day was freaking three Oreos!  It is now 7:30ish where I live! I've been up since 4:00 a.m... I eat when I am sad, happy, anxious, you name it... But this is very odd. I wonder if it was from the stress last night. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I want a Ruger 10/22 since January. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden  https://t.co/yQZIGGOTgq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want a gun I want a 10/22, but I have no idea how to get one I am clueless. I live alone &amp; not feeling safe in today's climate. I been wanting one since Jan. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing is regardless of everything the one thing that scares me is the racist BS &amp; dictator like moves.  #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden wins I am going to be shocked atp. I am preparing for the worst mentally. #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With this Penny is the last hope. They still have a lot of counting from what I was told last night. It's that or a loss. Unless Texas or Florida finds more ballots. Florida is more likely to screw up.  #Election #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Biden seems to have flipped 3 states so far... Arizona, Wisconsin, and maybe Delaware. That state is so tiny I cannot even make it out on this map. I don't think that's enough to get the electoral votes. Pennsylvania needs to flip it's the last hope. #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am disappointed in Florida because Trump won by a good percentage compared to other states. I thought we were better than hate here regardless of how insane we are on the daily. #Election  #ElectionNight #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's a turn of events I'd say!!! Joe Biden wins Arizona! I thought Trump was already announced the winner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pennsylvania and Michigan both say that they won't have numbers until Friday this is insane?????????!!?!!!!!!!!?! #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Donald Trump officially wins the State of Florida so what I'm basically saying is this ties it up in a bow. #DictatorTump is happening!  #Election #DonaldTrump #ElectionNight #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #ElectionDay #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to leave John King from CNN alone this is the equivalent of him being the local weatherman on your local station reporting a cat 5 hurricane.

<|startoftext|>@sapphireisle Yeah that's what I just learned their law is insane. So they have a massive backlog of votes to count.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again sorry you guys about tweeting so much about the election I'll be back to my #truecrime Twitter after this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really feel that people around my age are the lost generation. Generation Y aka millennials are the ones paying for all the mistakes previous Generations made even more than Gen Z will.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know how fustrating my life has been since I graduated college. I was the only person in my whole family that even got a GED &amp; 7 years later I am still empty handed. It is like I am being punished for it. That job interview I just got off of put me in a bad head space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly people need to get over the idea of company loyalty. It's 2020 &amp; my generation does not have it as easy as Gen X or late millennials. 40+ seems to have an easy time getting jobs after college &amp; the whole lot. On my end I regret college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS ON THAT BALLOT PLEASE VOTE!!!!!   #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are 100% more mosquitoes now than during the summer absolutely in Florida! I think they got into my bedroom! 🤯 I never had so many mosquitoes bother me since Friday it is next level! I usually never get bothered because I don't like the  sun &amp; am a home body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was trying not to call @pbcelections because I am sure they are swamped, but it's next Tuesday! I need make this vote and make it count. What the hell do I do?

<|startoftext|>I do not consider this a real supernatural encounter. I won't mind a ghost man who was nice and okay looking following me since the humans aren't biting. 🤣 #Halloween #Halloween2020  #HappyHalloween2020 #HappyHalloween<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the last one was I was at my mailbox and I felt someone follow me. I like side eyed &amp; I saw like the side front half of a white suit... I obviously knew it was a man, but... Never saw much else. I could have been a mistake on my end. #HappyHalloween #Halloween #Halloween2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone have unexplained things happen or that they saw. Just to get into #Halloween? I have 3 possible but they are so mild and possibly explained aka I was wrong! #Halloween2020 #HappyHalloween<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalicePodcast I think that is how it actually works but...very little do people look at history and think we have to stop it in modern history. This is actually the 1st time in history without getting political that individuals are looking at macro issues that Happened in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalicePodcast I think people learn from their personal history. The part of the lesson from history reg people aren't in tune with. I think a big picture works with governments or certain groups are supposed to learn from. It's very a sociological modeled... Macro &amp; micro aka sum &amp; parts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalicePodcast I hate seeing the picture when he was last alive. He looks like a monsters, but be he was just an innocent kid. The last picture of him alive. You think 55 years later people would have been taught better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalicePodcast It's between this case and Gabriel Hernandez. Hernandez was abused by his actual mother. The amount of times that they had to save this boy is ridiculous! I cried &amp; cried the entire time and even as a #truecrime enthusiast I couldn't finish the series! Just both beyond horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg this was either the most or second most horrible case of child torture besides Gabriel Hernandez! I was thinking about her a week or 2 ago. I have never cried for a case before the 70s. I feel so bad for her. She looked like she was a sweet girl too.  #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as I saw what was going down on in Whuan I was expecting an immediate American ban of Chinese travel. That didn't happen as fast as it should have. Perhaps that would have made some difference... I think all countries dropped the ball. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been following #COVID19 since January 1st or 2nd. It has come a long way! I hope this isn't like cancer &amp; hits you harder the 2nd time supposedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember when China blocked off Whaun? I remember that and I was SCARED for them even as an American. I thought they were forcing herd immunity. Yet America STILL had "open gates". We are about to take on the second wave.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet my 1st mail in ballot was totally sealed. I request another... and nothing! Y'all aren't going to stop me from voting &amp; I hope the other people in this state do the same!  #Election #DonaldTrump  #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020  #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing how nowadays you know politicians get work done during presidential elections. Face lifts, botox, &amp; fillers for everyone!  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden  https://t.co/sRYkidNPKo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe biden's facial expression man it says the whole story! 🤣 I use to say Trump gave "good face" during the debates in 2016. I think Biden's unintentional face expressions might be even better.  #Vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I  am never one to say don't let your kids watch this show or that because I wasn't raised like that &amp; I have a good moral compass with little guidance to boot. I had ZERO restrictions on TV or movies. I am just saying what I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not going to stop watching it because maybe it's just because it was the 90s they thought it was funny &amp; didn't mean harm by it &amp; they were "inside jokes" for adults... But #SisterSister has aged horrible with how inappropriate some things are for a kids show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*I met the girls are boy crazy not crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also it's not the actual twins who say the stuff. The characters are more crazy but they're pretty innocent for the most part. I really hope kids don't understand it they way adults do. Is like they're grooming our kids, man. It's wild. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hollywood really does try to like groom or prep kids unknowingly! Idk if it's this insane in other shows from the '90s. #familymatters the only sexual thing was Laura implying that Steve had a big penis after she saw him naked by accident. #SisterSister is next level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is random but I'm watching #SisterSister on @netflix &amp; the amount of sexual innuendo in this show is astonishing for a kids show! One character just made a male masturbation gesture. That's insane Roger is fresh, but Lisa take it to anyone level with that. 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do know that if you have somebody's first &amp; last name and date of birth you can see what party they're affiliated with! It's public information in the state of Florida.  #Election #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Voter intimidation really should be a crime if it's not! This is insane.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU VOTE EVEN IF YOU VOTE FOR A RAT... YOU NEED TO VOTE!  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what this is alleging is that Florida got hacked and voter information was leaked?! Wow.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my state got some of those emails. Yet y'all can shove it, because I'm non party affiliated sucker. I don't vote like this is a damn sporting events. I vote for the person I think is going to help MY people aka my Americans ALL of us.  #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not get me wrong... The FBI is to me is held in extremely high regard.  I am just... Confused.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is odd... Because I don't think the FBI has ever come out with something like this cryptic and random almost.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #Election2020 #SaveTheDream #PresidentialElection #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't they're a particular branch of government or whatever you want to call it that handles terrorism and what not? It shouldn't be the FBI unless they have special teams. Idk... This is confusing.  #Election #DonaldTrump #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020 #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the FBI was for INTERNAL investigation &amp; the CIA was for EXTERNAL. Why does it seem like FBI is doing too much international investigation. What is the CIA even up to nowadays?! I need to do research.   #Election #COVID19 #vote #vote2020 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is odd that the FBI is even in charge of voter interference. This is just odd all together. I don't know what to think right now. Should not  The CIA or another branch of Homeland Security being charged with that not the FBI? Is the CIA still around even?!  #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her brother... There is something about him. He seems like he is an jerk or slime ball. The fact that he said his sisters search was a "shit show" is an interesting way to describe things as family of a crime victim. That is a 1st. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I usually don't enjoy the internationally stories as much &amp; I don't really believe in ghosts, but the  Japan case was captivated I guess. It was something connected to a real modern day event. Some of it made me cry even if I am skeptical of the supernatural. #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh oh... I forgot the 2015 terrorist attack on Paris France over 100 killed &amp; the Charlie hebdo attack. I think both happening in 2015... I had to stop watching the news but I know on social media it was huge on TV I think so too.  #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biggest stories I know where the Indian ocean tsunami, the Fukushima Daishi disaster, MH370, &amp; It was a 7.0 earthquake in Haiti I think received days of headline coverage for international incident not involving Americans (1 American on board MH370). #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't really see headlines about other countries that don't involve us constantly playing over days as a major headline. It's rare but Fukushima daishi was one of those &amp; maybe the most in recent memory. #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The man who's two daughters &amp; wife died made me cry. Was this the same earthquake and that started the Fukushima Daishi major disaster. If so in America that was the focus we didn't hear about the aftermath of the people. A rare MAJOR international headline.  #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I so surprised that it snows in Japan? It's actually never been something I heard about or seen but why wouldn't it snow tbh. #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So from the 2011 Japan tsunami video it looks like a faster moving storm surge not really a huge wave wall. It's totally different from what I really thought it was. #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the Eubanks case I like love the US Marshal deputies face I think his 1st name was David. He looks like he belongs in a sepia 50/60s photo dressed in a white button down shirt and pleated slacks working on a case &amp; an odd mix of younger Jim Carrey's face #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lester's family is trash. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohh it the Eubanks' case was profiled on America's Most w Wanted... So I am guessing that is how maybe I recall him a little.  #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How in the hell are you going to have lifers in public w people who don't know what they did and no supervision?! The level of stupid is insane! I guess that is what reform gets you... Just punish! He killed a 14 year old girl &amp; tried to rape her! #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The name Lester Eubanks rings a bell but I don't remember ever reading this case. Dude basically killed that little girl 2 times. Wow. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The C 14 levels idea is absolutely genius. I never heard of it before! #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me although it's a completely different language does the Norwegian language have haults like Japanese when they speak? I have actually never heard anyone speak Norwegian. I thought it was German or French at 1st. I was so confused.   #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No cameras at all in the case of the Oslo woman?! #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Oslo woman she was all dressed and showered, because she wanted to look nice when she killed herself... It happens. Also maybe you cannot buy 1 bullet so she dumbed the rest in the suitcase. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the stolen kids case which was the first episode for me on my lineup I was stunned! Absolutely shocked at the very core that this case there were ZERO clues! @NYPD demolish buildings trying &amp; the whole 9 to find them! Unreal. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime @unsolved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so far the case that's really boggling my mind right now is the case of stolen kids! How in 32 year is they're zero clues; there's no clues in this case whatsoever that to me is mind boggling even as an #truecrime consumer! @Unsolved picked a really hard case.  #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people are bipolar and are going through manic episodes they make some illogical decisions. It's the same thing when someone has a other possible mental disorders like I believe Ray Rivera did &amp; kills themselves. #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to know why @Unsolved didn't address Jack Wheeler's limp? That was huge and could have explained why he took his shoe off &amp; maybe was the original trigger for the manic episode or exacerbated it. I feel he accidentally dies. #truecrime #UnsolvedMysteries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does @Unsolved show case so many suicides/accidental deaths now? Rey Rivera even though it was bizarre it was a suicide imo. The Jack Wheeler I believe that was an accident. Now watching this Oslo case now... Meh. Is there a twist here or or no? #UnsolvedMysteries #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am off tomorrow... Thank goodness... it's my birthday so tonight I need all these YouTube channels to upload a ton of #truecrime content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my gosh I took a survey on this in 2015ish about how I would feel about bringing back #SupermarketSweep ! I cannot believe they made it since it had been so long that I took the survey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the text didn't have to be in there to make the point. Lady was murdered and now the world is reading her private text about being horny... Omg. I have never said that word out loud to anyone even via text. It's my equivalent to the word moist. #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is wild #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of things were staged for freaking Facebook it feels like. #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude if she made you that miserable and you didn't want her LEAVE! I will never understand family annihilators it's such faulty logic.  #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow... Wow... The Facebook video of Chris Watts dressed as Santa. Wow. I never saw that. #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aka it wasn't just the side chick like I had thought. It was a combination of things. #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I watch this the more I keep digging into his psychological thinking here and diving deep... not an excuse, but maybe it makes more sense in a twisted way &amp; gives you a clear vision of why. I could just be over analyzing it. #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something effeminate about Chris Watts it's hardly there but it's there.... Hmm. Was he always like that or did it happen while he was in the relationship and felt emasculated? No one has even questioned that dynamic.  #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, Shannon's text to Chris seemed like she was pushy and confrontational. Even the friend said she could be bossy. Wait... Do you think it had anything to do why Chris killed her not just the side chick... like a revenge sort of thing too? #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they find anybody in the house or anything? I never knew of it either... Again so many questions.  #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have so many questions... Did they live in her house that she built? Was he EVER abusive in any way, shape, or form were there any red flags at all?! How was he growing up? #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So am I hearing this right that supposedly Scott Peterson might get another trial??! I mean what are chances of him getting another trial? Wow.  #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's really sad to see how much Chris Watts was loved by her family, her &amp; the girls... And knowing what he did for WHAT?! #truecrime #AmericanMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't know that Shannon had Lupus! That's knew so this is a pretty good documentary then if I am learning. #AmericanMurder #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I am so cynical &amp; I'm very careful what I say about being happy myself. The stuff that Shannon says in her videos &amp; the outcome is insane! Her ex husband took everything from her... Yet look at what the perfect one did. It is mind blowing! #AmericanMurder #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shannon's friend like knew something was up really fast! #AmericanMurder #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The police cam is such high resolution looks like it was filmed on like a professional camera! #AmericanMurder #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to watch this because I want to know more about Shannon Watts. I don't know much about her tbh. #AmericanMurder #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I remember when the  Peterson case happened it was like the 1st case I actually paid attention to when I was a teen. This is so similar, but maybe even worse.  Chris Watts had the addition of 2 little girls. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay I am going to attempted to watch #AmericanMurder. I am not as interested in the case and never have been... I wonder why? I started it before, but wasn't interested. I am not sure if this is a documentary or like a movie based on it? #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltergerber4 I have no idea what channels YOU watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I've been struggling extra hard with my depression and anxiety lately I'd say since August or July... I'm really trying to fight it at this point, but the only thing that I can manage to do is consume #truecrime content and watch @HomeGoods videos on YouTube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know maybe I'm not seeing it but I'm noticing that a lot of people on YouTube who do #truecrime are kind of paranoid at this point. They are also making these crimes and missing cases about them in a roundabout way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a hard time believing that anybody regardless of their race would hang themselves from a tree in public in order to commit suicide. The TREE &amp; in public are the real outs for me... I got to look more into that but apparently there's been an uptick in that? #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*LA level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 I am calling them tomorrow and/ or going either on election day or early voting but my vote will be counted I don't care how much they try to silence me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please send me a new absentee ballot; it was so insanely sealed that it ripped the front it was 100% sealed and I got that before it started raining so bad about 2 weeks ago!!! This is like voter sabotage! @pbcelections  #vote #VoteByMail #vote2020 #Election2020 #Election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is in unbelievable my absentee ballot came with a SEALED RETURN envelope!!!! @pbcelections this is unreal... I am I stupid or is this happening to other people in the state of Florida?! @pbpost @SunSentinel @WPTV @CBS12 @KVJShow  #vote #VoteByMail #vote2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 @CriminologyPod @TCATTUnsolved Where is your idea on the zodiac posted do you have YouTube or podcast? This is interesting no one has gone deep into the group idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 @CriminologyPod @TCATTUnsolved Wait so the person that you think did it his wife comes for from Arkansas? Honestly I had no clue there was even a suspect in the Texarkana moonlight murders!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlKaras2 @CriminologyPod @TCATTUnsolved I am sorry what do you mean? Can you please rephrase that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CriminologyPod @TCATTUnsolved Yeah I don't think there's been like a major case where one serial killer was also responsible for another series of serial killings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am heading to bed a little bit early tonight I've been so tired all day! I hope the gulf coast isn't getting hit so badly with this #HurricaneDelta like the fourth time they get hit this year! Also thinking about #suzannemorphew right now... I hope something breaks. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a possibility that maybe the Texarkana moonlight murders and zodiac killer have to do with each other? I've seen a few people speculate on this but it's been so little that I can't remember who they were. #truecrime I think @CriminologyPod  or @TCATTUnsolved might have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of the devil... Yeah know the more I see it the more time passes the more I believe that the 340 cipher is actually meaningless. I am pretty convicted. Also maybe there was no zodiac killer as classically known and/or they were multiple people or a group. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAISOCC @shamus4313 I don't know if assuming the worst is actually better than assuming the best in people but that's my MO. Haha on a serious note people need to trust their gut instincts on off feelings they get from people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAISOCC @shamus4313 I guess I watch too much true crime shows cuz I'm sizing up my co-workers to see if they might be killers... Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAISOCC @shamus4313 I spent whole life trying to figure out how the hell they have superpowers and don't die in the movies &amp; how the super theatrical version came to be?! Only serial killers that I remember being in a costume was the supposed zodiac killer &amp; Texarkana murder I think too. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenaePatton It's like she is getting off on the attention. Who knows she might not have anything to do with anything, but just it rubs me the wrong way. I do think she is tell half truths at very least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is this nice dude that seems pretty pleasant but I don't know when it's him because there's guys that look like him maybe three or four other guys body wise. I kinda want to talk to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SixKnock I didn't think it was going to be that insane! I had never heard of the case before. I just cried &amp; cried from the start. It's like he was meant to die as insane as that is, because there were so many opportunities to help him!!! DCF/CPS FAILED!! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't believe Morgan Gentile is saying everything. Something about her... Idk. #suzannemorphew #truecrime #barrymorphew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the first picture Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia looks very much like Maggie Gyllenhaal! Interesting she looks so different in all photos! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure because social workers are going to handle it just like they handled Gabriel Hernandez's torture! I am into #Truecrime &amp; I couldn't finish this on Netflix. Sure let him stay with his mom she just needs a class in parenting!  #DefundThePolice #AbolishPolice #truecrime  https://t.co/Dgm7oK7iHq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We knew this from the beginning that covid-19 is airborne! We also know that a sneeze can go up to 12 feet! #COVID19   "CDC updates its guidelines to acknowledge airborne transmission of COVID-19"   https://t.co/DXwfc40eLk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoseDysfunction Yeah it isn't I don't even like following cases from the UK but you know there's been at least two exceptions with this one lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monae71261342 Well thank you for letting me know. I am going to try and post what I  find this week. We all deserve justice. Like it's not hurting anyoneone to just spread the word out. #trurcrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to know more about this case! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really interesting. It's so matter of fact and almost normal sounding.  I don't really have interest in cases from other countries but I need to look into this one. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot believe Ted Bundy's kid is only is a little late less than 2 years older than I am!!! I expected her to be like 45 years old or older tbh...  why? In wonder if she actually knows who her dad is? I think was 5  when she last saw him idk. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is without a shadow of a doubt  the greatest betrayal is a husband killing a wife and she thought everything was fine! I mean that is heavy! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why but thinking about Shannon Watts &amp; Laci Peterson it really sparked that idea. I mean I am sure that this wasn't something they saw coming! When they realize my husband killed me. He KILLED me. He KILLED my girls! He took away my baby. Idk it's sad. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like could you imagine if we got a chance to view our life after we died  and pontificate on it! We went to our  crime scenes or our unfound bodies  and just thought about it?! Even more if we could see what was currently happening! #truecrime #missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this isn't possible but if the missing or murdered where able to look at their situation from out of body... What would they say...  Why hasn't anyone found me? I am right here? I wasn't ready to go like this. I thought he loved me? My kids.  #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even then I thought Laci Rocha aka Laci Peterson looked "like a teacher" &amp; was blown away she was a sub. What I mean is the stereotype of a teacher... caring, sweet, nurturing. Teachers aren't like that very few uphold the stereotype. She would've been a great mom. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People talk so little about his wife Shannon I don't even know her maiden name! I don't know when they got married. I am not sure what the girls' name were... Cece is one? The case is always about HIM! Not even Laci got overshadowed as much by Scott Peterson! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People obsessed with the Chris Watt's case. You notice how people talk about what he did instead of what happened... Right. It makes HIM the center of attention. I think some are so fascinated with this case because Chris Watts was attractive... Something is strange. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my I recall watching @ChuckWeber12 as a little girl I am 34! Dang... Time flew! Best of luck to him on this new chapter of his life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah... I love when channels I am sub to do lives! #truecrime #Halloween<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idk why but I always pushed away from looking into the Wuornos case even though she's in my home state. I decided many years ago to take it at face value. She was a prostitute getting her revenge. I really need to actually look into this, but part of me fights it. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a horrible feeling for them I don't want to even imagine... Btw this is one of my top #truecrime podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started the day fine but I am starting to fade a bit. Hopefully more sense comes out of what is going on with #SuzanneMorphew when I get home. #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennife11872858 @ohglobal_lisa Yeah I know that part @ProfilingEvil said it last night.... Insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aleian56Elie Is very confused tbh with the last 1 days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuePark34066419 @ProfilingEvil I haven't heard this anywhere. I am trying to not make errors and talk too much about thing I don't know about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AppleTartin Yeah I addressed that no one is actually sure. I am going to delete the tweet to not confuse people on my end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danner932 Yeah with all the rumors and people saying that he would that they found supposedly something at his newer property<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danner932 @ProfilingEvil We don't know yet though. Everyone is jumping back and forth now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They talked about this like 3 days ago on @ProfilingEvil with Andy himself! What is the mainstream media basically sounding essentially a false alarm since there is no body found? We knew there were 2 hits and 1 passive on at least 2 areas.  #suzannemorphew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohglobal_lisa What is there twitter or how do you get notifications from the CBI?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this what Mike means by the #5?! @ProfilingEvil on day #5 something major was going to happen in the #suzannemorphew case? My head is spinning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aleian56Elie I am even questioning now if they even found a body! I am so confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something is happening in the #suzannemorphew case rn for sure... But no one seems to know what is actually going down. Did they or did they not find a body at one of #barrymorphew property?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SixBreakfast There are some reports saying it's not yet. So I am going to calm down and wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Longduckdong991 Yeah I know conflicting reports why I tweeted what I tweet after the.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am glad that isn't something we deal with much in the east coast especially Florida surprisingly since it's so hot over here. Thank goodness... we have hurricanes, meth, &amp; the @GovRonDeSantis murder warrant to deal with via #COVID19. #CaliforniaFires #California<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wildfires are not an isolated thing only to California... But from studying this map they tend to be a lot bigger there. There is this 1 fire I looked into it has been burning for 6 weeks or more &amp; has burned almost  half a million square miles... what?!?!?!?! #CaliforniaFires  https://t.co/QX2QNzWDIy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it's not in play in the search that's what I understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @ProfilingEvil basically said the house isn't in play. So what I imagine is the police did all they could do there. I found out from @crime_it livestream that they had it for 11 days &amp; they confirmed it. #suzannemorphew #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also her little composites... Awww she looked like she was adorable! Why do people hurt little kids... Geez. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is the girl missing since 2011 and they don't get her body until 2019? She was in a batting cage area that doesn't seem very secluded for her body to be there that long. IDK I've never heard this case it's pretty interesting... I need a podcast to learn more. #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcookson3 @ProfilingEvil Yeah I don't see Barry Morphew going down so easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danner932 @ProfilingEvil *were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danner932 @ProfilingEvil I didn't get they where looking for her during the live. We will know like in every other case. Either the media will say it or police conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcookson3 @ProfilingEvil It's not cryptic they just want to keep the possibility evidence safe. I made out what they where staying I just didn't get the 2nd hit location if it was different... Have you been reading my tweets?! Lol I too have said Barry Morphew would kill himself of thing get close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So looks like there was a passive hit &amp; then either 1 or 2 full on hits? @ProfilingEvil is probably going to talk about that tomorrow I am guessing. If Andy &amp; co find #suzannemorphew this shows the real power of the people! Wow. #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a cadaver dog passively hit on the river rocks per #AndyMoorman and @ProfilingEvil. I think it was an area #barrymorphew worked on. Please let him recover #suzannemorphew soon. I just don't want Andy to be the one to find her 1st. #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty insane that I just said that #barrymorphew makes less sense than #Lorivallow... Maybe I am consuming too much on this case, but I feel like there are wayyyyyyyy more rumors. #Missing #MissingPerson #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tearza_cannon Wait so BM has friends staying with him who are helping in the search?! So now the gun story sounds more like it isn't true. Why have a guy if she isn't there or there isn't evidence she wasn't killed there. This case is makes less sense than the Lori Callow case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LookingforAnsUK Yeah I guess it will until the spring so they definitely are on a time crunch I didn't think about that at all again it's pretty much always hot where I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohglobal_lisa He said a couple of weeks. So dang it is soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops it says it right there he's a retired law enforcement detective! I didn't want to risk giving the wrong information on his title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the channel I'm talking about he's a retired police detective or police officer in Alabama. I play it at 2x speed since he has a slower pace of talking. #SuzanneMorphew #barrymorphew #MissingPerson #Missing #themissinglivestream #truecrime    https://t.co/BNPzeDV3al<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh gosh the channel on YouTube called #themissinglivestream made an awesome point about snow in Colorado stopping the search for #SuzanneMorphew soon enough! I never think about snow because I live in Florida. Oh gosh... That was a kick in the gut for me. #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So still no murder charges in the deaths of #TyleeRyan and #JJVallow for #LoriVallow &amp; #ChadDaybell?! #truecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also I know this is 100% conjecture on #barrymorphew &amp; the #SuzanneMorphew case. No one knows what is really happening, because he isn't making much sense &amp; cops are taking at all!  #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohglobal_lisa I really don't know what to think about that police department. Also #barrymorphew might have more of an influence than we think in the community. I have not heard anyone really do into that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohglobal_lisa I know the looked before, but if you look at my next tweets you will see me go deeper into this idea of mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My take on #barrymorphew &amp; the current state &amp; future for the #SuzanneMorphew case is maybe darker than other people have hypothesized... Sadly. It's just what I am thinking right now with the little we know.   #Missing #MissingPerson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyhow if things progress &amp; they find #SuzanneMorphew or #barrymorphew thinks he will get arrested I can see Barry killing himself via self-inflicted gunshot wound. I don't think he is going to come 75% or anything clean like Chris Wyatt's did at the end. #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is idea is true that makes the #SuzanneMorphew case just more disturbing &amp; really solidifies #barrymorphew as an sub-human. #missing #MissingPerson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To take it further... If my previous tweet is correct. I am inclined to believe #barrymorphew might have dug her up after he found out Andy was coming to look &amp; put #SuzanneMorphew inside his house! Why else not look for her &amp; hide behind the gun during her search?! #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is dark, but if true that #barrymorphew was guarding his home with a gun while Andy was looking for #SuzanneMorphew I am thinking her body is inside or very close outside! #MissingPerson #Missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got my new phone last night. IDK I think it's time to go ahead and get this #truecrime account going! I been wanting to do that this since like 2016!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So think this might end up being a #truecrime Twitter.... Hmm. Still thinking about it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary  https://t.co/1tblm2C0kL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure what this is going to be about. I want to have a theme I guess on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I am I am finally going to use this account more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HappyThanksgiving y'all the true ending of fall for me.<|endoftext|>
