<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I was really hoping Florida went to Biden LOL so Trump could have fired him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosie  I think Hillary Clinton should do the honor and knock on his door and say "see ya!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden congratulations to the First Lady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyNextLifeDebi @LizForTX8 Of course he would. Also smart man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMAROSA  Who's going to tell him... Hillary?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeeleyJonea The funny thing is he doesn't know what math is 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww I'm going to tag you in an Instagram post LOL  You will laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww Lol   It shouldn't be called Election day  anymore, it should be called election month 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these candidates who spew out "do what I say or take a hike" doesn't fly well with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww sorry for all the rant  But if the tables were flipped right now, the Democrats would also be throwing a fit.  The only candidate I like in 2016 was John Kasich from Ohio (GOP). He is civil, no drama, and got the job done.  He was very into "working together"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww Don't be embarrassed about staying quiet and being attacked. I know what you mean. I am actually registered as no party. I know the dirty on both sides lol  This entire election season is a crap show.  My mom and I are sick of it 😂  I guess you can say I'm like Switzerland LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww Both parties point fingers at each other lol I'm fed up with the Dems and Republicans. No offense   I I'm actually registered as no party affiliation. Yes, that is a thing. I do vote. Yes ,  I am mad about both choices lol.  This entire election is a crap show. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani Sending positive vibes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani I think the entire nation was not prepared for an overwhelming amount of voters.  I dont know what this year entails as tracking in person votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani Also if any of your friends needs to fix something on the ballot, I would have them call the recorders office and check up on that deadline.   Tell them to make sure they have all information asked for correction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani Mail ins are scanned via bar code.  If anybody sees their ballot hasn't been to received via the website, I would call the Recorder's office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani I would call the recorders office and double check.   They should have a number.  Maybe the website is so overwhelmed. Nevada got a lot of people voting.  A lot of States right now are overwhelmed because so many people turned out to vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani Those people you spoke to I encourage them to call their local election office. They have a right to ask if their vote was counted. There should be a website to check on your ballot status. Also the website will tell you if anything needs to be corrected.  Hope this helps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonRob Aww 4 little Ambers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani Not trying to come at you, but it does take a while to count votes. I used to work the election polls. Its tedious work and verification.  Also if one voted provisional ballot, those two counts at last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @RudyGiuliani I suggest calling the recorders office of your county.  They are still counting votes. Mine took a while  Just tell those people to be patient<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMAROSA  Who is going to break the news to him..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick 😂😂😂😂 The ending of the video  Wait for it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB In Arizona they are filing a lawsuit because people use a Sharpie instead of a ballpoint pen 😂.. no I'm not joking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Since when is counting ballots illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Let him leave. Heck, I will pay for his one-way ticket out of here. I'll pack his bags as a bonus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stinaknits Yup 😁😁🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB Christmas is delicious as always<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looked it up, it's TRUE  "No one who has won OTEV has then gone on to win the game. Throughout the fandom this is known as the OTEV Curse. Ryan Quicksall, Dan Gheesling, Liz Nolan and Tyler Crispen are the closest, as they all got 2nd place on the season they won OTEV."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zoom party with @EvelDick  Fun times.   Yes, I love chocolate  https://t.co/9VqKPsbxJ0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 Amen.  I think it's fair to say that Kevin is not voting for Cody in f2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 I do not think kevin is voting for Cody.  Just found the convo on feeds.   Cody is a douche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 Omg yay kevin Time stamp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SAKSBACK1919 @Catvanzyl Same That says  a lot   Christmas says she wants to take out Nicole. If she succeeds , and she get to final two, she deserves the win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl Same Enzo is a decent man who got tangled in this alliance mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB Don't we all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mrs_ARockstar  https://t.co/FBLlblHPj3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrs_ARockstar Omg Angela. Your tweets are making me laugh 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Xmas.. omg. She is delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelleykitty @EvelDick I have been saying that.  Hope Kevin wins.   Never taught I would say that as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB @BBTeamNorth Lol  You read my mind ... What does that mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearsFanJordan @LMCape @YouTube @EvelDick Also, the way he is shaking. Look at his body language  Watch it again... he is shaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick @BayleighDaily  If I were you Bailey, I would file a lawsuit  1) pull the rule book and see what it says about pregaming  2) screen shot your call log  You can file a lawsuit against Dan and Derrick personally. Just like gretchen Carlson did to Roger Ailes the CEO of fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick They should file a lawsuit against Dan and Derrick personally.  Yes, they can. Derrick probably has enough assets to sale for settlement.   @BayleighDaily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosie @MaryLTrump 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulCalafiore_ @Cody_Calafiore Who's older. Lol I forgot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allstarjanelle @bloodstonekyle Where do you live?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveReality9 Sent you a tweet lol. Check DMs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCMoonves  If Derek and Dan have a right to do a pregame Alliance, then whoever is yelling things over the wall has the same right.  To me Derek and Dan cheated.  #bb22 I think the best thing is for Big Brother to be cancelled this season.    @agrodner22   With all due respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all due respect, please hold accountable those who did a pre season alliance, said racial comments.   Pre season gaming should be strictly forgotten. Us fans are mad rightfully so.  #bb22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCMoonves I'm speaking on behalf of America big brothers fans.We are sick and tired of this season. The pre-game Alliance, and the racism commitments   I hate to say it, but the wall Yeller is  going to keep yelling over the wall until this season gets canceled #bb22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrs_ARockstar 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveReality9 What is your gut feeling lol DA went off on her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveReality9 DA probably got mad. Nicole is probably furious   Good  Let them boil in their own mud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveReality9 Lol I'm reading through Twitter, someone yelled that Nicole voted for ian  to leave. I hope this results in a fight self eviction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveReality9 I've been MIA  What's going on with the feeds? 11 hrs down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyNextLifeDebi Lol Live feeds since 11 hours ago hahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveGators4ever @LoriMoffet Wow.   I hope Da heard it  Hope this season is canceled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@normaskids @stinaknits Unfortunately lol  This season is the worst   Anyone but Cody, Nicole and Tyler   If xmas gets David to take out cody then she deserves the win-ish lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurakwhiteside @ThePerezHilton Amen  People should sign awaiver. They don't wear a mask, no coverage.  Nurses and doctors are busting  there asses every day .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinaknits He wont win   David , enzo or anyone will next to Tyler and Cody.  I as long as Cody Tyler and Nicole don't win I'm okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMe11 Thanks for the info   Unfortunately it is gaining momentum here .   This virus is terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMe11 Ask about covid-19 quarantine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMe11 Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcalique Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMe11 I figured. Thank you so much for informing me  I completely understand. Got to take drastic measures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know the easiest way to cross Canada.? A family member needs to attend a funeral.   Any advice is appropriate.   #bb22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karensreal Amen!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOviKabir Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racheym @Karensreal Oh geez!! My o my<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@modestvixen 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  Bb22 in a nutshell   Next time bigger fire so they can evacuate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain  Also, If someone gets pregnant and they don't have money.. then what.  As far as I know, there are limited Social Services for people who are single parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain  My two 2 cents  Maybe we should provide birth control for every woman for free. That way people can "go at it" &amp; not worried about an unwanted child.  You cant tell people to be abstinence. People are going to do the deed no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinaknits I hope Christmas exposes Nicole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Demetrius_Kylo @BB_Updates Throwing nicole under the bus??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2ndTierFan @SanthanamKiran @EvelDick Also his pride. It's all about his ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick This is why I I'm contemplating in leaving the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  Good.  And never ever come back on Big Brother again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick You were right all the time. You told her not to trust Nicole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 I wouldn't mind an enzo win  Or Dani or David  Anyone but Nicole,  Cody and tyler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 @mommakellogg3 DA will turn jury against him  He will regret sending her to jury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 Just remember, money doesn't buy class Even if they won,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinaknits I see a big fight coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick The reason why he keeps denying it is because of his pride. he is an undercover cop- admitting to his "undercover" shenanigans,  makes him look weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmstrongTaran Omg really??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl Yup...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney  Begging you to vote  to grant RBD wish to be replaced until a new President   I think people need to respect her wish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer So sad  Also Donald Trump should not be allowed to nominate a third Supreme Court.  If Obama could not nominate one  Same rules for Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB Same.. even enzo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  People in the Big Brother chat room are saying that it's you who is going to move in next door and shake things up LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Yeah the other night I had a dream that the big 9.0 California earthquake happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  Are you moving in next door??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMZ He needs to be expelled.   @GavinNewsom with black lives matter and all, CBS didn't expel him   This is unacceptable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GiseleBBUS @Tooms_BB He needs to be suspended   @GavinNewsom  Please suspend and cancel big brother TV show. Bunch of racist comments and the TV network does nothing   Enough is enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie Yep. If Tyler slips and says an inappropriate bad word...  Expelled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zekerchief Try national guard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB I think racist Jackson won due to his parents threatening a lawsuit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Cody is a bully And a hypocrite He complains that Janelle and Kayssar came into the house and try to play the game day 1 . Yet cody pregamed months ahead... Someone needs to call him out big time when he comes out of the house.  #bb22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl 😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatDameLana @EvelDick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@northmiami @BrandenTweetsBB Do you see it in Nicole F?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Nicole or xmas star baby? Which baby?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom13 why didn't Jenelle and Kaiser ever date<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick one of my family members asked me how big brother is so far  I responded  https://t.co/NG8la2HYc9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Gamplay 19 and 21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Lol!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB I've been telling everyone, she has narcissism disorder  Never own up to their mistakes.  It's all about whining and gaslighting and they never do wrong  I know from personal experience  And yes it is mentally exhausting dealing with a narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl I wish they dated lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie She always talks about herself.... over it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl I am convinced she's a narcissist. All about her Double standard  Victim noises She is never wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Omg !! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_daniellelickey We all are. All these white men alliances. Always<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stinaknits they are getting 40K?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieElizabethL @EvelDick Also a narcissist doesn't see the double standard.  It's a real psychological problem they have  A lot of  these narcissist grow up in an environment where everything is handed to them, and they are told they never do wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieElizabethL @EvelDick Sounds like narcissistic disorder. I have a family member who is a narcissist. The gaslighting it's unreal. It's all about them.  A narcissist doesn't care about others feelings, they are always right no matter what, and they manipulate to get what they want  L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick That's what I was thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyinRussia @EvelDick Lol!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl My Philosophy is man up and play !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl Was Derek really a wimp to play again or Nicole did him dirty ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick @clips_bb He's a wimp But please Cody, if they do have a twist to save them be my guest and walk out. Don't let the door hit you.  Janelle Should be the one opening the door and slam it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clips_bb @EvelDick have you seen this clip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agrodner22  Please do. We all love Jenelle and Kaysar. Ratings will go up if they stay long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi I think you all should enter a plea deal with Donald Trump. He can leave the country as a free man and cant ever come back. If he does, he gets arrested.  Let him go to another country and get his karma   I think this is the best option  @SenSchumer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Lamo. Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealityRobbed I don't think Cody will win  He is counting his chickens before they hatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealityRobbed Cody without Derrick.. hes nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealityRobbed I hope this will backfire on Cody big time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick ever since Big Brother 16, the game has chnaged.  Bb17 is an exeption (game wise, big moves and so on)   Bb18 = Derek influenced(told Paulie to take tiff out) Bb19=  josh won bitter jury Bb21=Kasey won bitter jury. Tyler ass to everyone  Bb22= Derek's hand, again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@innapropriate @EvelDick This is like the Trump presidency.  He is seen with someone in a pic who is at fault for committing a crime, he said he never met them..yet evidence shows that he was also complicit.  #bb22 #TrumpDerreckDan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Nicole upon seeing you walk in the house  https://t.co/2BJy9LrfCH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3 simple steps  USA  doesnt work with common sense   Good Job New Zealand  https://t.co/4RkFAocCGV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LAMO !!!  Canada doesnt want out covid  Good for them !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Agree. She (Nicole A) needs to tell people that her game life and real like are separate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Absolutely agree. That is what happens when you let someone in a game that is a loose cannon with their emotions.  I hope Nicole A goes far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets I don't like Nicole F. She is petty .  But it's unfortunate for Nicole A to be in this situation. I really like Nicole A I don't think it should be held against Nicole A Separation of personal life and game should be an unspoken rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets I don't know the whole entire story. I've heard bits and pieces here and there. But the fact is that Nicole F doesn't like Nicole's  co-host.  The beef is there. Doesn't matter the details. Getting on Nicole's F bad list is set in stone, Unfortunately...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets  https://t.co/zdxeyXUaet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Hard to believe that Nicole A doesn't know about Nicole F &amp; Eric's beef.  For 2 people to be that close, they should know everything about eachother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Did you hear Nicole F talk to Danny about Eric?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Unfortunately I think Nicole will ruin Nicole's A game because of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Agreed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who is tired of Nicole's pettiness   #BB22<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can somone tell me when live feeds start?  #bb22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgetteRain @mmpadellan @EvelDick with todays technology, they would of found something  especially with her passport records. No way she could of entered Kenya without any trace of something- let alone re enter the USA without a trace of some sort ( credit card bills, airplane purchase transactions and so on)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @EvelDick Also, Sheriff Joe Arpaio wants to reopen the case about Obama's birth certificate LOL. Sheriff Joe Arpaio said he can't go to the Grave until he knows Obama is in jail for it LOL  My message to him is to go home to his wife. He is 88 years old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @EvelDick Joe Arpaio has costed Arizona 150 million dollars in lawsuits regarding racial profiling. Many people have sued the crap out of Arizona because of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giaolson6 @MeghanMcCain That makes me sick to my stomach.  150 million could of been donated to schools and so on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain  Joe Arpaio also wants to get to the bottom of Obama's fake birth certificate. I heard this a while back.  He was already investigated. Nothing found! Move on old man.  Spend the rest of your life worrying about your family. Spend time with your wife. #Priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain  I've been told by many lawyer friends Sheriff Joe Arpaio has caused Arizona millions and millions of dollars of lawsuit for racial profiling. He is an expensive Sherrif    He was supposed to be in jail until President Trump's pardon him.  I miss your Dad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain  Yep but the president pardon him  He needs to go home.and be with his wife.   He is a sick man that costed AZ millions in lawsuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain a while back I heard that Sheriff Joe Arpaio wnats to get to the bottom of Obama having a fake birth certificate from Hawaii.  He will not be able to rest in peace until he puts Obama in jail  Give me a break. Old fat needs to go home and be with his fam!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  Meanwhile in AZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden  Pick Stacey Abrams. Trust me trust me trust me. Harris has too much dirt on herself that trump can dig.   Suan also has too much baggage.  The Benghazi situation   You need to pick someone who has a clean clean clean slate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realamberheard  "He could insult her and say he loved her in the same sentence, with equal amounts of passion," she told the court.  The mindset of a narcasictic.  I know how that statement feels.  Tell your sis I say hello<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@modestvixen You are not the first person that has told me this. I totally believe you that the coronavirus is way way way way way worse than the flu.  I am also sick and tired of people say it's like the flu.  Is not People who believe alternative can go to take a hike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@modestvixen Oh I believe you!! That this is 100 times  worse than the flu. But I'm saying that the flu bomb works great for the flu The flu is a virus.  People just say take antibiotics.  This is not a bacterial infection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@modestvixen try the flu bomb.   Works amazing  Garlic Lemon juice  Honey Ginger Cayane pepper   The flu is a virus   I took it when I started getting a scratchy throat. . Gone within hours<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick I know I get all your point I said it before. Compare the amount of Wales captured in sea world vs the slaughter..  No comparison at all  Slaughtering hundreds of wells for ritual purposes is way way way way worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick SeaWorld has as of now 20 killer whales.  This slaughtering consist of 200 or so whales a year!!!!   I think there needs to be much more awareness brought to the Whales  being slaughtered vs. SeaWorld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick I saw Blackfish I agree. But the amount of whales in captivity virus these whales being slaughtered for spiritual reasons ...I much rather see a whale in sea world.   Slaughtering Whales for Spiritual reasons is wrong and a crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick I did Many times  I know a trainer who work for SeaWorld and there are inconsistencies.  I do agree that animals should not be caged. This trainer who this trainer who I know he said there are many false information about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick Japan has this disgusting whale/dolphin slaughtering ritual   They kill hundreds of whales for spiritual purposes.😡 Again I rather see these animals locked up in SeaWorld.The lesser of two evils I'm not justifying what Sea World does. But they don't Slaughter their animals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aussie_sunset @seashepherd @EvelDick SeaWorld is the lesser than two evils of this horrific whale slaughtering   SeaWorld doesn't lose 300 whales a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seashepherd @EvelDick I rather see these whales in sea world locked up   This is disgusting!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus And by other YouTubers throwing in their  2cents via YouTube video makes it worse because   they start saying "I heard... "  "This person told me" statements Makes the situation like a telephone game.  My advice to all, hatch it out privately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus The whole situation is a he said she said..  All in all. They needs to call a meeting and hatch it out  Going on YouTube and stating the drama it makes the situation worse Because then people start throwing in their 2 cents via YouTube.   All in all, I wish the best for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus The whole situation is a mess LOL. I've been kind of following it All in all I think they all need a counselor and get into a room and hatch it out.  Also, a lot of other YouTubers are throwing in their two cents. Which is making the situation a lot more Messier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus I don't think  he can say much over YouTube When legal stuff is happening.  I was told anything that is said can be used against you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realamberheard  I am a huge fan of you!! I admire you   I know your pain  I know the exhaustion on trying to please a narcissist .   I know I am a stranger lol I promise I am always there for you   Lots of love your way  Hablo español. Me avisas amiga si nececitas algo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realamberheard  I know first hand having a relative that gaslighting and manipulates   It sucks as hell. It's the worse thing ever   Wishing you all the best.   I'm here if you ever need anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain I think someone needs to tell Kim Kardashian as a friend that Kanye needs to drop out and get some help.   @KimKardashian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Both need a counselor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Omg 🤣!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Much respect to your George !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyVBehar  He has selective amnesia. My Grandmother said  😂😂  He only remembers what he wants to remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeScherer This is horrid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorGallego  I think we need to completely shut down  everything.Except the grocery stores . People are not complying with wearing a mask. Around the United States people are getting violent when they are asked to  cordially to wear a mask. Shut down is our only safe option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorGallego @TucsonRomero @Coral4AZ @AnnaTovarAZ @dougducey I think a state shut down for 2 weeks would be the best thing. No one is complying with mask mandate. Violence is occurring when you make people wear masks. Several people have died as result of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorGallego @TucsonRomero @Coral4AZ @AnnaTovarAZ @dougducey I think those who choose to stay home and not go back to work should be compensated.  Going back to work and bringing it home to parents that are high risk is unsafe.   Companies are letting go of people who feel unsafe to go back to work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@12News @MayorGallego Read this thread..this is why we need a state shutdown for 2 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus People are crazy..   People don't like the non traditional roles<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tweetdog1776 @12News Your statement doesn't make sense   I know there is no convincing the people that Trump is a crook and a liar  He is a typical con artist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweetdog1776 @12News There are false negatives and false positives everywhere. We do not have accurate testing. We do have testing that kind of works. Trump chose not to use testing that was already put in place by previous countries that worked.  He is an egotistical maniac   With all due respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djvlad @chancetherapper Amen !!!  I said this from the beginning. He is trying to take away black boats from Trump. He probably got paid under the table pretty good chunk of money for this.   Both mentally ill! I do not like Biden much but he is our only choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweetdog1776 @12News No they are not. Maybe by Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArizonaDES tried calling just now. Tried calling you right at 7 and the clock is already full. Also it keeps saying line busy. I need to talk to someone. This is very disorganized<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niccih14 @justinbaragona @jaketapper Lol  I was thinking what in the world was she talking about no adults around. So the kids go to school without any adults and it's a free-for-all. I'm laughing on how idiot she sounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellygallaghert @justinbaragona @jaketapper Oh I hear you on mother's. I'm not a mom yet but I would be livid. Also she says that the guidelines are flexible. Excuse me?! What kind of person word say that. Putting children's life in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hojoe17 @12News Are people really comparing this to the chickenpox.Unbelievable.  We know more about the chickenpox.We don't know much about this virus.Drastic measures when we know nothing about a virus is safest precaution.Instead of having a free-for-all mindset. Look what happened in Italy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevinJaureguiz3 @ArizonaDES Oh I know. There are companies out there that still make people work even though they have symptoms. I have proof of indoor malls with customers not wearing a mask. Unsafe environment for all!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinJaureguiz3 @ArizonaDES What's complete b******* is that people are running around without a mask. And then employers expect people to go back to work in an unsafe environment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bohemiansoprano @ERICBALFOUR @KimKardashian His groping versus Trump's groping.  Trump is wayyyyyyyyy worse than Biden.  Like I said it many many times. Biden is a lesser than two evils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is colluding with Russia. Trump is not fit to be president. I have never seen Biden being disrespectful in a professional way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bohemiansoprano I said it before and you didn't listen. I don't like Biden. But I'm voting for him because he's hell of a lot better than Trump Trump has a million woman that accused him of nonsense. Also Trump has obstruction of justice like no other. Also Trump is colluding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bohemiansoprano @ERICBALFOUR @KimKardashian I'm aware of thi tara woman.Biden said he would welcome an investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tabathasays @blackcleopatruh Good for you. Spread the word that kanye west is trying to split the African American vote to help Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetynStephani @WildyPierre2 Probably not. People with low IQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bohemiansoprano @ERICBALFOUR @KimKardashian I'm voting Biden.  Lesser of 2 evils<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrs_JGplus3 @ERICBALFOUR @KimKardashian Yup  He probably paid Kanye West<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealPeteG @kanyewest Voting for Kanye West is giving a vote  to Trump.  Kanye is trying to split the African American vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie @EvelDick I hope this is true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterManwaring @AprilDRyan @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump That's what I said from the beginning. We must spread the word about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technogaijin @camperry21 @EvelDick Either one would tear Pence up Stacey Abrams is an intelligent person. I've heard her speak many times.  The thing I liked About Stacey Abrams is that she wants to end voter suppression. She wants every corner to have the polling place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camperry21 @technogaijin @EvelDick I'm praying for Joe Biden to pick kamala Harris or Stacey Abrams.  I rather like 50% of the ticket rather than dislike all 100% of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camperry21 @technogaijin @EvelDick Amen. Please spread the word to vote for Biden.  Biden is wanting to choose a color woman. And the Tramp knows he is doomed with the Black vote. Heck, wouldn't surprise me if Trump would pay kanye some cash for "him running"  Kanye and Kim are Trump supporters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camperry21 @technogaijin @EvelDick I don't like Biden, But Biden is a hell of a better choice than Trump. I'm not having another Trump for 4 years.  Biden it is for me He may pick Stacey Abrams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHMBB19 Kanye West just wants Trump to win. He is doing this to get African American votes. And make sure Biden doesn't get any I'm not too keen on Biden but he is wayyy better than Trump .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseJones_ @usweekly Lamo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHMBB19 Voting for Kanye West takes a vote away from Biden  People do not vote for Knaye. It will give Trump another 4 years<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kyrstensinema a lot of companies out there that have sick employees out. Not informing other employees about it. And still being open.  I think we need to go back into mandatory quarantine.   Lululemon had three employees tested positive for Coronavirus..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@moose_homans the Senate welcomes hearings from normal citizens. So yes I challenge you to go and present your case on why Obama should be in jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moose_homans there was nothing found negative towards Obama. Because it was nothing to be found negative towards Obama.

<|startoftext|>@moose_homans I don't want to be rude. But Mitch McConnell had the Senate majority while Obama was in office. They in fact tried to find dirt on him but did not.

<|startoftext|>@TylerHarner1 I don't know how you gather information to say that Obama was the most corrupt. If you have such information, maybe you should go present the case to the Senate so they can put him in jail.  I challenge you my friend<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HankHill_Arlen @CBLifeCoach1 Don't get me wrong yes I've seen those creepy pictures. I don't like it. But right now the only option for me is Biden. Biden was not my first choice for the Democratic candidate.    I am casting a protest vote against Trump. That's is my justification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HankHill_Arlen @CBLifeCoach1 100% investigate Biden. 100% should Trump as well. Fair trial for both of them.   Let the lesser of  2 evils "win".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HankHill_Arlen @CBLifeCoach1 I'm not justifying his allegations. He even said go ahead and investigate me.  Yes an investigation should occur. Look at Trumps allegations. He called the women pigs, liars and  people who are investigating him witch huntes.  Basically, Biden is the lesser of two evils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HankHill_Arlen @CBLifeCoach1 There's a difference. Trumps 10 mile list vs Biden's prob 1 mile list   Not to mention the sex traffic ring that Trump had with Epstein.  All those underage women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick lol follow this parody account.  Halarious!!  🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBLifeCoach1 Biden has never said he tried sleeping with a married woman.  Also, Biden said he totally open to an investigation. Means that he has nothing to hide.   Trump on the other hand.  Has a lot of counts against him. Tried to block all investigations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBLifeCoach1 Thanks!! I keep pointing out facts.   The more facts the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBLifeCoach1  https://t.co/Cvl9kxMdTe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Army1Seven I want Stacey Abrams. She targets the African Americans.   We need @KamalaHarris in the Senate for impeachment hearings.   I love Kamala, but we need every Senate seat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebekahkfreitas @Aflie_and_me @aguadog @morningmika @JoeBiden He even said bring up the records. To me that says that there is nothing to hide. Unlike someone in the White House who does everything in the power to hide records of all his shenanigans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebekahkfreitas @Aflie_and_me @aguadog @morningmika @JoeBiden Yup. Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aguadog @morningmika @JoeBiden Laurie, he said bring out the records.  Nothing to hide.. to me it implies someone is telling the truth. But when someone like Trump lies and lies and lies and tried to block out any truth to come out, that says something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus @thelohantrap I know. Another Hillary Clinton situation.   I did not like Hillary Clinton.   This election is a complete disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDivineVenus @thelohantrap I know. I hate both. I rather have Biden than Trump.  Trump is a disaster   Biden may choose a woman as a candidate. Is good. Biden is older so his VP choice may take his place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelohantrap voting for a 3rd party independent gives a vote to trump  Trust me, I don't like Biden it either but he's our only option.  Praying he will choose stacey Abrams . She is a superwoman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelohantrap @TheDivineVenus Biden can compose himself in a professional way, Trump is crazy.   I know all of those sexual harassment accusations towards Buden, I get it.   Compared to Trump.  Trump has a whole list of workplace unprofessional conduct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick back in March a man died in Arizona because he took medical orders from the Donald Trump. Donald Trump touted to take this medicine as a protection against coronavirus. The man took it, and died.  I have no sympathy for people like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishtimesvideo @EvelDick He basically told the United States to go kill themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika A man in AZ died from taking a Drug called chloroquine touted by Trump that it will protect people from the virus   There should be a public announcement- Do Not listen to the President, he is not a medical expert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika maybe he should be the Guinea pig.  Get back to us for results<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kyrstensinema  We need this! Governor of Maryland did the right thing. Purchased testing kits from a country that has the virus under control. Donald Trump said it's up to the each State. @dougducey  https://t.co/fN2eakgfHi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovLarryHogan @NatlGovsAssoc @NYGovCuomo We need accurate testing ASAP. Look at South Korea's statistics on their model on how they handled this epidemic. No excuse for the United States to do the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovLarryHogan the action that the president took for controlling this virus was not the correct one  We need Mass testing for all. We were warned the back in January about this virus. He chose to call it a hoax.   Please listen to the health experts instead of Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CathleenVCain completely agree. I also think Bernie supporters need to man up and stop boycotting elections all because . We need to come together. Believe me, Biden was not my first choice. But when it comes to saving our democracy I'm choosing Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathleenVCain @ChrisFill @justinmsilver @CovingtonFan @JoeBiden You have to ask yourself do you really want another Trump presidency? Worth it?  Not for me.  I don't want a dictator in the White House<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathleenVCain @ChrisFill @justinmsilver @CovingtonFan @JoeBiden Thank you for the article I believe it. However, the amount of damage Trump has done for our country and a professional level is beyond. Trumps list is wayyyyyyyyyy worse than Biden.  I would have rather have a trash bag lead country than Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathleenVCain @ChrisFill @justinmsilver @CovingtonFan @JoeBiden Yes Trump has gone way way way way further than that. Trump's professional and personal life.. the list is 10 miles long. That's editing it lol. Biden was not my first choice but he is when it comes to this country. I will not have another Trump presidency<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@morningmika one more tweet LOL I know exactly what game with Donald Trump is playing. He just wants to take credit for re opening the economy and not having to shut it down. Look good for his voters. .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>reopening the States lockdown  so he can say it was his idea.   All he's trying to do here is leave it up to the states for shutdowns so he won't look bad... his common catchphrase, "I didn't do it, they did..."  NO Blood on His Hands is his goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morningmika  Donald Trump said it's up to each state  governor to decide whether or not they should do a shut down. But Donald Trump said it's up to him to decide whether to reopen a state (NY) and he has authority over Governors. He just wants to look good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you know that you're staff members lie to you on purpose of a how great things are going because they are afraid you will throw a temper tantrum are you afraid that you will have a heart attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump have a heart Ivanka have a heart please tell your father to provide ventilators and medical supplies. Do your job!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougducey @kyrstensinema this is exactly why we need testing for all. This is exactly why I fear getting my emissions test done. The people can be asymptomatic without knowing. I am scared for my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With are over 65. I dont feel like exposing them. I have contacted the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicle and they are extremely rude. My 30-day pass expires April 16th why is it so hard for me to pay it online and forget about. This emission test place I do not feel comfortable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixPolice how do I get an exception for vehicle emissions test. I do not feel comfortable going out there to that place knowing that the people go in and out of different cars. I need to register my vehicle registration. I do not want to go out. My mom and dad whom I live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougducey the waiver for emissions test over 65 should also apply for those people who live with people over 65. Like me. My 30 day registration is due April 4th. I would like a waiver. I will pay the extra 9 pentaly fee. I cant afford to get the virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Get sick due to getting an emissions test<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have my money for my car registration. I do not feel like risking my life and expose myself to covid and expose my parents. I will pay the 9.50 pentaly emissions waiver. My mom drives my car a lot. The car is under my name. I'm so mad. Don't want to have to file a lawsuit if I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougducey I am very upset. I asked for where you were for emissions test. ONLY because I live with people over 65 at night risk. I feel extremely comfortable going to a place to get my emissions test knowing that that person has been in and out of hundreds of cars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet Notice how his mama said you're not racist we know honey we know. The enabling is hurting him.   Jackson's mom puts him on a throne and thinks he is King<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet The fact that he was more concerned about his reputation about the racism rather than winning the 500k shows how insecure he is. He rather be perceived as a clean-cut handsome likable guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet Absolutely true. But some people don't want to admit they have issues and unfortunately they don't work on them. I hope Jackson works on his issues and becomes a better person. He should take the money and get therapy.  Also he should work on not having his mom bailed him out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet hes more concern about his reputation than winning the 500k.  Money does not buy reputation, happiness or the approval of others. once you do something publicly, its out there, Jackson, the receipts  are there, damage is done #bb21<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @jamesrhine Ughhh i know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 exhibit B for lawsuit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 Or pay up his money due to a lawsuit..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilcatlady @EvelDick Thats what i said.  Someone should file a lawsuit towrds Jackson personally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB @EvelDick Again, I would file a lawsuit if I were a house guest. Jackson has a money I would personally file a lawsuit against Jackson. Totally doable  I once contacted a lawyer to file a lawsuit against a psycho roommate had who got me fired. She said it's worth it when they have money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB @EvelDick oh my God are you serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I rather watch the doctor poke needles and an eyeball then watch Jackson win<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie Beth is so shot up with botox is not even funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie  maybe someone should  find out when Jackson is going to Vegas and make him gamble all his money lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Jackson's Big Brother title should be Biggest Douchebag winner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandenTweetsBB @agrodner22 Someone to file a lawsuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agrodner22 I wouldn't be surprised if someone filed a lawsuit against Jackson. I would if I were in this big brother cast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you former big brother houseguests or current ones on this season. File a lawsuit against Jackson. He has the  money to pay up  Argue that his medical accommodations and eating disorder accommodations helped him win the game. He should had never been on the game #bb21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie I think someone should file a lawsuit against Jackson.  Cheeting.  His accommodations for eating disorder is just as bad as certain medications that are considered steroids in sports..  Someone sue him !!  #bb21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie Oops I meant to say guest LOL but you get the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie if I were one of these House Gifts, I would file a lawsuit against Jackson. Lots of evidence that can be provided by fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick People need to file a lawsuit towards Jackson .It is totally doable. I once inquired for a lawsuit against a psycho roommate I had and the lawyer said it's worth it if she has a lot of money..  unfortunately she was poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatdorrk @queendonatos @EvelDick Same here I've never seen someone it's so many watermelons in my entire life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I hope he ends up in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBryPie @EvelDick I hope so LOL Jackson and Adam maybe can share a jail cell. B b jail series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manndaraee @CBSBigBrother Exhibit A for a class action lawsuit from one of these class numbers directly to Holly and Jackson. I would so totally Sue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet if I were one of these cast members I would  totally file a lawsuit against Jackson. Saying why would he go on a show knowing he had all these disabilities, food disorders, and basically with a medical waiver that helped him win.  Also, lied on his app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet I want some quiet for a lawsuit against a roommate of mine who cost me my job. Long story. The lawyer said to me it's worth it when they have the money. Technically one of these cast members can sue Jackson.   I think they should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatdorrk @EvelDick I hope he does. Karma always wins. Maybe someone will file a lawsuit against him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet If I were one of the bb21 cast members I would have filed a class-action lawsuit against Jackson personally. It's worth it when they  have the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick it makes me sick that they would let Jackson get away with everything. Cheating Have Nots, cheating on everything. If you sign up for a game go by the rules, and if you can't go by the rules and don't sign up for this damn game..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedolphinpoet are you still working at the liquor store..... lmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 I know.ewwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deadskulltweets it's sick that Jackson has to have his mommy bail him out  I mean it's embarrassing who does that has a mom file a lawsuit. What is this 2rd grade " he stole my cookie" pettiness. Ridiculous!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deadskulltweets I'm sorry if you have to have a thousand accommodations because you have a eating disorder, a tick of eating endless watermelons, phobias, or whatever you call, then you need to not be in Big Brother.   If Jackson wins I would file a lawsuit against him personally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deadskulltweets I want to be surprised if someone tried to file a class action lawsuit   Its duable   Jackson's mommy did   I would  If I were former house guest. Maybe directly to Jackson if he won tje 500k. I mean is there a rule you guys can't sue each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 @RealityRecaps Lol!!! Myriam.    Yes I would not be surprised if Nick came out of the closet next three segments<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat I hope Nicole has the guts to get rid of Jackson  Holly is terrible at comps and sitting next to her during final three would be easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @BBFeedsFairy Should of kept tommy .. a shield infront of him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 @JokersBBUpdates Yes Bella my reaction as well. Jackson is a douchebag. I hope you guys see it  I can't believe they would let someone like him in the house that was arrested  for domestic violence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catvanzyl Jackson leaving the house because he punched someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaFonzeca @BellaWang21 @JokersBBUpdates Oh I know. I know I know I know. He's beyond that douchebag. Maybe he does need the money for all the lawsuits he's going to occur out of the house or already has lined up for beating women up. Yes you heard me, he's been to jail for domestic violence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana5tweets Jackson needs to go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I hope Cliff goes this week honestly!!  then he will get to jury and Tommy will be waiting for him nodding his head I told you so!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Maybe Jackson's mommy sued and they bribed Nicole and Cliff with hush money<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I think Jackson killed the entire houseguest...  #FeedsAreStillDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB21Tea @heyxpie Wouldn't be surprised of Jackson punch someone when he gets voted off.   Jackson has a temper issue.. he's been arrested for domestic violence #bb21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @heyxpie With Jackson's temper wouldn't be surprised if he punch someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BrandenTweetsBB @bigbroaccess I am beyond sick of this whole Jackson situation. But at the end of the day all the live feeders have the receipts... and it said that a mommy has to build a grown man out of everything. Maybe he does need his money for lawsuits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BrandenTweetsBB @bigbroaccess Jacksons mom law suit- Jackson may loose his tempter and mommy is protecting his persona   sick, i know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick omg... BB is censoring the house meeting production doesn't want Jackson's Mommy to file another lawsuit. Are you serious right now!?!?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Not against waterhead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I agree 100% Beth should go.  Jackson is a compass and he will always keep boring Beth in the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick It was bad.. I was disappointed because I love Beatles music. But the ending was just terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates Holly lies a lot..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates Yes last night she was thinking about this. I think DR was influencing her..n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Maybe asked his mother about the lawsuit. Reason why slop is gone is because Mommy got involved and didn't want her son suffering or be deprived from watermelons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Limaj95 I know people want Christie gone  but honestly she's playing a better game than sis. And Nick defending sis like no other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Limaj95 I know I think he exposed himself. If I were to house I would vote out Nick biggest ride and die sis  And the message to Bella to not go back to him. Nick never defended Bella the way he defends sis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Limaj95 He is afraid sis will go home. He only cares about sis because he wants to be with her.He's not even on the Block and he's freaking up as much. He's waking up because sis my go home I know you agree with this should go home. At least Christie is playing a game sis has not done<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allstarjanelle @NotoriousBB21 if I was sis I would leave Jack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 More like a tornado?? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bb21_sam Sis hasn't done anything so her leaving wouldn't hurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bb21_sam Jackson needs to go. I can't believe they let someone who has a domestic abuse record in this house. I am beyond mad. I take this very personal Sam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bb21_sam If I were sis I would not continue a relationship with Jack. He wanted Chrissy since the beginning  I would run and hide from him. She's too sweet and nice for Jack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Hes also running in everybody's bed if you know what I mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates Expose him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieChen can't believe big brother would cast someone who has been arrested before for domestic violence. Lots of fans are very mad. I take it personal. Disgusting    also Jackson needs to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamsterwatch @EARTHDOGBB perfect<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 If I were her I would have  https://t.co/yNd3b70la4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Christie did pointed out that he's getting a lot of help from production and that he cheated during have not. Good for her. I would be super pissed if I were a player  in the house right now..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickypoo01 @maximusmom22 @LAVELLEZ Well probably a mean that's all I've seen him eat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@savannahhays18 @maximusmom22 Don't make fun of his watermelon his mommy might come and sue you lamo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 @Uhtceare4 😂😂😂😂lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 @siearra_young I don't think any of us have ever seen  someone eat that much watermelon LOL as I'm saying this I am laughing so hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siearra_young @maximusmom22 Same here. I went to the grocery store and I saw watermelon and ran for my life LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick me now every time I see a watermelon.  https://t.co/AcDBY2zw2c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Holly said she is making a watermelon salad. For the entire house to eat.  my reaction  😬😬😬😬😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲  https://t.co/oHZCbi2LG6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Same Evel same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Jackson won't win the $500,000  Chrissy will do it at number injury to make sure he doesn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bad_N_Boozy @EvelDick Mommy has to bail him out at 20 something years old. That's embarrassing it's Mommy going to bail him out at 45 years old that's embarrassing. Grow up Jackson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRummans2 Make sure to wash it...dont want crabs  https://t.co/s7jLAvTvYt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 what did I miss LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 honestly I think Chrissy going to jury it a bad for Jackson's getting. She is going to make sure that jury does not vote for him. Just watch. Kat I will not vote for Jaxon. So goes for Jack  I rather see Christie win than the racist homophobic privileged white guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 I rather see Jackson go. I'm tired of his cocky attitude on him getting away with the Have Nots. His mother Lawyering  up to hide his homophobic racist comments. I'm sorry but that doesn't mesh well with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realitla4 @InMeghanWeTrust @BB_Updates Yep on Have Nots. Did not receive one penalty nomination. When Audrey ate one apple she did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates Sis may go home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InMeghanWeTrust @BB_Updates also the fact that he cheated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InMeghanWeTrust @BB_Updates Yep and his mommy filed a lawsuit because they were portraying that. Disgusting. I want it Chrissy to stay home because Jackson is a poor man of excuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBSuperFan04 Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates Omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Maybe some people in the house do need  an exorcism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick 16 was so boring. None of these people was smart enough to catch on Derricks game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat Apparently not because he keeps cutting up to Tommy and sis. He slept in the same bed as sis and cuddle up with her all night. That is cheating I'm sorry but it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat And the only reason Nick wants to take sis off and go against her will it's because he wants to get into her pants. He has a big crush on her  Sis wants to stay up to ensure the other person leaves if Chrissy comes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattH1105 @BB_Updates This is code I want to get into your pants sis..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates Nick just wants to get into her pants y'all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathiboerio @NJKrissy76 Well evidently with Jackson cheating during Have Nots. This is the only reason why I want Chrissy to stay a big karma for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@picklethicc1 @jsiIver @BB_Updates @Kassting Well when they recruit them they have them watch certain seasons. Bb16 they make them watch LOL I don't know why because that season was so boring and people didn't catch on to Derek's game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeCameAsToTo @BB_Updates I rather see her than Jackson.  I'm sorry but Jackson's mom filing a lawsuit because they were portraying him as a bad guy. And the fact that he cheated during have-nots and didn't receive a punishment or a penalty Nom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @EvelDick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick yeah and the guy who eats a 1000 watermelons a day tries to speak reason.  #DontEatWaterMelonKidsItMakesYouCocoooHead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @JokersBBUpdates Well if your diet consists of just eating watermelons I'm sure your brain can't comprehend what that word means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @JokersBBUpdates And Mommy cleaning up his mess with a lawyer. Grow up Jackson!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Yeah with his mommy doing damage control having to hire a lawyer portrayed Jackson is a clean-cut person is unbelievable.  But with us live feeders we have the receipts and he's in for a rude awakening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_curtiecue_ @tbeaverh @vincentpeone @Delta Omg lol  my that's exactly LOL is he single hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAstroShell Mars in Gemini won't propose to his Mars in Leo girlfriend Venus in Scorpio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kallenoh @BB_Updates Nick just want to save Annalisa get in her pants there I said it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Ames1 @SICRICK @EvelDick The preview of my tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Ames1 @EvelDick The only crabs Jackson produces if you ask me..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates Yeah sending Kristy to jury is a bad idea for Jackson's game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  https://t.co/FYG26SSzJp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejessicagraf @BB_Updates  https://t.co/mqVKhdItNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsiIver @picklethicc1 @BB_Updates @Kassting Hell no. She is  Definitely a recruit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsiIver @BB_Updates @Kassting Also no more recruits that will file lawsuits, cheat on Have Nots and don't get a penalty nom, and is racist.    Please cast people that know the game and play the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 LOL be careful Jackson's mommy file a lawsuit. She got lawyers involved with big brother production to portray Jackson as a king lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arizona_DPS Can one sign up for this workout even though they are not going to be a cop LOL I need some kicking in my butt workout hahha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arizona_DPS I can spot someone using their phone while driving  from a mile away LOL do you guys need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arizona_DPS like I said many times cell phone companies must have a drive mode setting that disables phone calls and text( make this mandatory).Only thing that works would be GPS via satellite. Uber and Lyft drivers must carry a cell phone mount.  Find people$1,000 first offence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arizona_DPS  can you follow me I need to send something. Via DM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannaDemarcoXO @BB_Updates Well Christie and Tommy at the end  at least Christie played a game.. not just sitting around and do nothing and putting makeup on and taking out split ends from your hair...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannaDemarcoXO @BB_Updates I meant to say Mitchy and Holly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannaDemarcoXO @BB_Updates Make you and Holly final to omigosh I rather vote for a dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Chrissy  right now is like okay send me to Jury Jackson I will run your name like no other.   Hes dumb....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf aslo.  Chrissy going to jury  ruin Jackson's chance of winning.  Also keeping her   It's a double-edged sword if you ask me. Jackson's an idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf But he would be the one to leave her because Jackson is a kind of man who wants to call the shots. He leaves a girl in five seconds but when a girl tries to leave him he probably goes bonkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Dear Jackson, you signed up for a reality show that requires 24/7 live feeds. You signed up for the wrong show if you expect people not to know anything about your personal life or your big brother life. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Oh if I were Holly and found out about the domestic abuse I would run and hide change my name and all that. Because I guarantee you if Holly tries to leave him he will probably hit her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf I can tell why he was arrested for domestic violence. His mom probably bails his ass out of jail all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf What the heck LOL he thinks that the life eaters are not going to find out about this oh my gosh what is delusional oh my gosh he signed up for the wrong show. He's going to go Bonkers when people find out everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Just wait until Holly finds out Jackson was arrested for domestic abuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf So I miss that when he threatened cat what happened. I heard about it briefly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHerren @SissyWarf I hope Jackson's HOH backfires big time only because he cheated bedtime during Have Nots and the not receive a penalty nomination. And yes, his Mom can sue all she wants. But karma is wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf honestly if I were Jackson I would not vote out  of Christy. Because she will go to jurry  votes against him. Now that's what's keeping him from 500k. LOL. He's talking about her being the reason for not getting the 500k. Just sent her to Jury Jackson and you'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf but at the end of the day I believe in karma. It doesn't matter how many lawsuits or threats you can give out. Karma karma karma. Even if Christie leaves, Jackson is not winning this game. Chrissy will for sure do a number in Jury to to make sure Jackson doesn't win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf oh with no question. The amount he ate I think was about equal to 20 penalty noms. Enough to double ecivt him. Audrey just ate one apple and a sandwich and got one penalty Non .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf His mom probably has filed a lawsuit if Johnson doesn't win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Jackson is not going to win this game he's delusional. Him sitting next to Nicole, Jessica or cliff... he will loose    unless it's Holly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates I meant to say Cliff. Chrissy could split the vote and have Cliff gone. Jessica will vote him off , prob nicole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates But Chrissy could switch to vote to get clip it off. She is very manipulative I'm smart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf I think Chrissy and Tommy are each other's right and die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates then who's going to pet it be put up Holly, cliff, Nick, Jessica, Nicole all people who he promised safety too LOL I almost want this to happen just so he could see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf Honestly I I hope this backfires big time for him cheating...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates Yeah and then who would be replaced ... Holly, Nichole, Jess, cliff. People who he promised safety to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates Yup... he's going to take Chrissy down and that's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WESH @EvelDick Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf do you think the Jackson's plan will backfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @Quote_me_on_it @BB_Updates I hope this backfires on Jackson karma for cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bkrton2 @grizzlymike718 @EvelDick Oh wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates I bet Jackson's mom is lawyering up so he can win a half a million  Sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates It's his mom going to sell to make sure he wants to half a million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grizzlymike718 @EvelDick So Aaryn got help??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates Sick!! What do you expect  signing up for a reality show and being a national TV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamsterwatch @SissyWarf Is this the only thing she has done the entire season lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 check your DMs I have something to tell you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates I wasn't too fond of Audrey the way she cried and everything but the fact that she ate one apple and got a penalty Nom... yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_livetweets @BB_Updates Apparently the lawyer fix everything with him getting away with Have Nots, threatening cat and so   you heard a lawyer got involved. What's next making him win the game because they're going to sue. Unbelievable where do they find these people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates And you know what I believe in karma 1000%. I bet if Jackson doesn't win this the mom is going to sue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates I heard about the lawyer fucking BS excuse my French. This is unbelievable... I had no idea the lawyer went that far wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannaDemarcoXO @BellaWang21 Jackson has no clue on how to Play Big Brother. I hope his plan will backfire big-time only because he cheated on Have Nots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_livetweets @BB_Updates I'm spreading Karma I hope he gets karma for cheating during Have Nots. If I were formal houseguest I would be really mad. The fact that Jackson did not get a penalty no more punishment for cheating makes me mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@em_livetweets @BB_Updates are you serious lol. He's such a white privilege man it's disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates I'm still pretty mad that Jackson cheated during Have Nots. He clearly had food. Audrey from Big Brother 17 had an apple and she got a penalty nom..hate these white men who think they are privileged everywhere they go and rule the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SissyWarf @BB_Updates I hope it backfires on him only because he cheated on Have Nots. I've never played Big Brother game but I've heard from past players they are pissed as hell that Jackson cheated and did not get a penalty Nom or anything!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carolinabbfan @OneLuckyGay She's not playing the game that's why she is useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay Also I wouldn't pick Chrissy up. She will win POV or Tommy will win POV and then what..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay For the sake of Live feeders Christie don't go up LOL she will be crying 24/7 hahaha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat well I hope that Texas will get a strong Democratic candidate for the 2020 senate race. Maybe Beto will realize that. As of now the Senate is way more important than the presidency. We need to stop Donald Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC @mjhegar Wow.  Biden is beating Trump in Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC @mjhegar I just followed her thank you. But I still wonder who would beat the Republican Senate. Beto or her?  I will move to Texas to vote lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC @mjhegar Great!! Yes.  We need to flip the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC I mean cornyn lol.. I'm still half-asleep hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC Also there is already a senate Democrat that can challenge Comryn the GOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>POLL!! What do you vote for Beto O'Rourke to be senator in Texas?  #Beto2020 #BetoORourke #Senate #decision2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke I really like you but I'm not voting for you for the Democratic ticket. I'm voting for another candidate who has more experience. If you gain experience in the Senate that will be much better for presidency in 2024    listen to your constituents!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke Senate!!! Please.. Texan  people are begging you. So that should be a sign. Taking the Senate back is probably more important than the presidency. With a Dem control Senate you can push Donald Trump  out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke Run for Senate.!! Please please please. A lot of people are begging you and you have a great chance. We need the majority in Senate for Democrats.  Thats would be a slap in the face for Donald Trump. At least get the majority in the Senate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke run for Senator. There are there great candidates for the US Presidency. I'm not saying you're not a great candidate but you need more experience.  You almost beat Ted Cruz in the Senate run. Listen to your constituents. A lot of people are telling you to run for Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@escott_chris @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC I totally agree. He needs to run for Senate I guess maybe y'all textan people can start a campaign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat @TheAPJournalist @MSNBC I know I keep saying he needs to run for Senate. He has no shot for president. I keep tweeting that to him. Maybe if you allcTexan people can start a campaign that he needs to run for Senate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 Oh Lord no no no no no no no no no<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 Well she's crying in the Have Nots room I don't know why  Makes me sad  I can't believe a domestic violent guy is in the house. I find it disgusting by production to Cast someone  like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 He has to go I don't like him because he cheated during Have Nots and did not receive one penalty nom!!    I'm sorry but that really ticked me off!!  I know everybody is about getting Chrissy out but I don't support cheaters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Nicole crying #bb21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Nicole crying???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agrodner22 Christie is playing an excellent game. She must win !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bb21_sam @BellaWang21 Maybe they need a house meeting AKA prayer circle lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Kat got mad that Cliff made deals and she says you can't make deals in this game and that is cheating lol  That is the only thing I got from the whole fighting last night. I know very confusing don't even try to understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Girl were all confused LOL  I tried to understand what was happening last night I could not follow. The gist of it I gathered is that Kat things that making a deal is sneaky and not playing the game lol...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KAT BLEW UP HER GAME #BB21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay Cat doesn't know what making a deal is LOL she confuses that with making an alliance. She was casted for the wrong game show TV show. Kat  needs to go. I'm over her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLadyKat Like I said it before and I'll say it again she was casted in the wrong show. They need to start casting people who know how to play Big Brother. She clearly doesn't know what a deal is LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay Kat and sis are terrible at this game. What happens when people who don't know how to play Big Brother..    They need to fire  the  casting director.  Enough with recruites!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay She is. She thinks she's a great player what she is not. She needs to be casted in  the real world challenge<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21  Proverbs 12:19 Truthful words stand the test of time, but lies are soon exposed.  Go to a bible study group, find yourself a hot Christian man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Proverbs 10:9  Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy -Proverbs 12:22  ‘Do not steal. “Do not lie.“Do not deceive one another.-Leviticus 19:11 "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them." James 4:17<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 I repeat you are worth more than this. You're not going to talk about this and make him come back to you. You don't deserve this. He wanted someone else at the beginningv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21  you are worth way more than this. You will find a man that loves you and only loves you. You deserve to be with someone who doesn't cheat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 it's not worth discussing this. He will learn you back in and do it all over again. Once a cheater always a cheater. You are not I repeat you're not going to let yourself be used. Tell him cordially it's over I'm sorry I don't want to argue over and out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21  yes I'm going to bombard you with tweets. You're not going to give Nick a second chance. Don't even try to argue with him. You're worth more than that. Clearly he wants this and that is that. So<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Bella dumped him. Don't do second chances are you trust me you don't want to be used like a rag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BellaWang21 Just break up with him. My girlfriend says that's cheating. So I would not even argue with him just cordially tell him there's no more us and leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick I heard apparently that sis cooked 40 eggs this past day. Between her and Jackson they will finish the watermelon and egg supply lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thejessicagraf I like had a lot as well but I think she needs to keep her motions down. I'm not hoping her mouth too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay Kat needs to go.. she's emotional and and doesn't keep her mouth shut. I like her a lot...her  emotions are too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGay Honestly keeping Christie in the house is a shield for Nicole. Christy is always a target for people...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jilliannicoleww @BB_Updates Part of me thinks that Holly is trying to kiss up to Jackson's ass so he won't get mad. But part of me is saying that she really agrees with Jackson. I think once he get on Jackson's bad side it's not pretty. The best stay on his good side.. At least pretend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 @EvelDick Kat needs to go...shes too emotional<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kallenoh @BBSuperFan04 @BB_Updates That's what I've been saying. I don't care who leaves as long as Nicole is safe. Honestly Kat will eventually ruin Nicole's game...she can leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexshay1 I don't like Jackson because he cheated during Have Nots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think Nicole needs  to vote out k a t Kat opens her mouth too much and it puts Nicole in jeopardy #bb21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_Updates If Nicole was smart she would take out cat because cat opens her mouth too much..  Kat needs to go in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneW619 She is the one who asked him as well to sleep with her. She "needed a body next to her" lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Holly shouldn't have one the past HOH. She should have thrown it to Sis who would have taken out Jackson or Nick.. resulting in Sam's staying #bb21  Sam leaving is Holly's fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 in my opinion Holly shouldn't have won hoh. She messed things up for Sam. She should have thrown it to says who would have taken out Nick or someone else( backdoor Jackson). Holly is a floater who doesn't do anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShintouGenesis @thedolphinpoet they erase that oh no<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Yes it was. Did you know that he used chocolate syrup for the fake blood. Mainly because it looked more intense as black and white. Chocolate syrup has a thicker look<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@modestvixen @TheBryPie @EvelDick I think Christie  would just laugh about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Christie just said that 8 was her favorite season. #bb8TheBest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick  Christie just said she respects you 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Christie's talking about you right now Lol. In a good way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealityRobbed @Limaj95 I agree but I think people dig their own Graves. I think getting involved and Reporting him is unnecessary. Yeah it said that he's a mental counselor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Limaj95 My suggestion, I know you won't like this but oh, I would just let it be. People dig their own Graves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Limaj95 I agree but people losing their jobs that's a big big issue. For me you would have to do something really really bad like punch someone or rape someone. I wouldn't report him. Sometimes you have to sit back and let Karma takes its course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EARTHDOGBB omg !!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBLifeCoach1 Yes they would go that far to put Isis on the bombs and blame it on Isis. Anyone can write the word Isis on anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBLifeCoach1 This is not true. This is probably set up by the Russians to offset the election. They are putting Isis as a stamp. Vladimir Putin is known for doing malicious things . Wouldn't be surprised if the Russians or Trump people set this guy up to do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelDick Anna really had to ask this oh my gosh!!   The other day a man groped a woman on a plane. He cited that Donald Trump said it was okay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FBI_Washington what if the Russians sent these packages. Discreetly. Citing Isis. Just so that Trump uses this as propaganda for political campaign. I would not be surprised. Investigate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro what if those explosive devices sent to CNN Obama and the clintons are from the Russians. This seems very fishy. Then Trump can uses as propaganda. ISIS attack. Can you please send this idea to CNN thank you. Isis was written in these bombs<|endoftext|>
