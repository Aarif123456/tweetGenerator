<|startoftext|>Ahmed Khan declared that no choreographer could have managed to get the top most beautiful, successful actresses to dance to such an elaborate, synced, grandiloquent, pumped up Indian dance song.  That exactly what #SarojKhan ji did her entire career. ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chai2kul @cmdbeml @BHEL_India Oh yes that Konkan Railway project, it looked fab in that trial run. Oh well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@filmfare How is it 20 years in the Film industry? She started getting film offers in 2002, the Tamil film Tamizhan and Humraaz (later which Amisha Patel did)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>July rains are the one of the beautiful things #Mumbai offers.  #MumbaiRains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SarojKhan ji made every Maar Daala unique. Sanjay said Sarojji would choreograph on the slightest change of tune rhythm after Kavitaji uttered Maar Daala.  Madhuri's beauty, SLB's scale was the highlight alright but it was Sarojji who made you me understand Chandramukhi's ethos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my favourite less popular dances of Madhuri by #SarojKhan ji.  She had hardly attempted Tandav dance form before. I had seen Meenakshi Sheshadri and Sridevi excel in this dance form and had always wanted Madhuri to attempt this. She tried a modern Tandav in Yaarana too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how a brillliant choreographer harnesses a talented dancer's potential and utilise it to deliver maximum output.  Only #SarojKhan ji could manage to do that with Madhuri  Undoubtedly this sequence from Yaarana is the most underrated bit of Madhuri's dances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Voted as the Most Popular Indian Dance Song of All Time by a UK poll -The Most Expensive song made then at a cost of $ 1 million when adjusted for inflation -Had the Most Views on YouTube at a point of time -Combined the 2 most popular &amp; Top 2 most beautiful heroines of the era<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chai2kul @zurakoutaro And SS does its part in riling up the backward Kokan janata.

<|startoftext|>#SarojKhan ji's last choreographed swan song #TabaahHoGaye was truncated, edited in a exasperating manner &amp; served to the public.

<|startoftext|>#Sridevi ji, gave chartbuster songs with #SarojKhan ji with Nagina, Mr. India in 1986 and 1987 and was so enamoured with her that she convinced Yash Chopra to change his frequent choreographer Sureshji for this 1989 popular song from Chandni #MereHaathoMeinNauNauChudiyaan  https://t.co/gqlSPNmBTY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Filmfare started Best Choreography award after this iconic #EkDoTeen song in 1989.  #MadhuriDixit developed cold feet during the ceremony and refused to dance after seeing the crowds. #SarojKhan ji then stepped in at the last minute &amp; performed the song herself  https://t.co/FvM0U0qSVa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SarojKhan ji choreographed the massive #DolaReDola song of Devdas in 15 days while in bed, sick as! When Bhansali Aishwarya went her to meet in the ICU after the film released, she asked Sanjay only one thing "Dola Re Dola pe seeti baji ki nahi?"  It won her the NATIONAL AWARD  https://t.co/4SIjGAzMzp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SarojKhan ji asked her to walk in the heels she was wearing and retorted "look you are shaking your hips deliberately now whether you like it or not...and how I am supposed to show heartbeat without showing heartbeat movement?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SarojKhan ji was instrumental in clearing the iconic #DhakDhak song from the Censor Board.

<|startoftext|>@Divyalakshmii I was 10 then and my mother worked at a movie theater then and I spent my after school time there until Momma got us home.

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/AT63lfx7qw  One of #SAROJKHAN ji's underrated yet National Award winning song in 2007's Tamil period drama #Sringaram about a Devadasi from 1920s. Despite not being a trained Bharatnatyam dancer, she made AdityaRaoHydari dance to pure classical steps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The amount she demanded for the #EkDoTeen set a fruitful career for others in choreography. She created the award category for Best Choreography. If she hadn‚Äôt been the force that she was, choreographers who came later would have continued to be footnotes in the credit titles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She was definitely the grandmother of choreography in Hindi cinema. Before she came there were great choreographers. But none got their due recognition. #SarojKhan ji paved the way for all choreographers. She was the 1st one who demanded valued payment for her hit songs.   1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A career spannning 40 years, 2000 songs, 3 National Awards, 8 Filmfare awards and no PADMA awards!  RIP #SarojKhan ji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asjadnazir @Abhinav_MadzFan Agree! If it wasn't for Madhuri, Sarojji wouldn't have finished without her swan song featuring her favourite muse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 1st song choreographed by #SarojKhan ji featuring #Nutan ji here #NigaheinMilaneKOJeeChahtaHai is from the 1963 #DilHiToHai &amp; the last song #TabaahHoGaye she choreographed is for #MadhuriDixit ji for 2019 movie #Kalank   FYI Sarojji choreographed almost 110 songs for MADHURI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoopluvsMadhuri @Muskan10sharma I never compared their acting matey. Chill. I said they are both seeing the same success and Indians are enjoying them. Where did I even compare their skills? She is a untouchable legend. He is mediocre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AyushmannKhurrana and his non-stop success reminds of #MadhuriDixit of the 90s  People went to see whatever Madhuri did and it's happening again with Khurana.  If she was termed India's model daughter then Ayushman is the poster model son today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>735 crores! And more to unearth!  #BMC #MCGM's contractors pardaafaash! They need to be languished in jails and this has to go viral to reach every #Mumbai household.   https://t.co/8pGGJtmpGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG I totally forgot how Grandiloquent would be #MadhuriDixit's Sheeshmahal set and how elaborately magnificent would she look as Anarkali. It would also call for another #SarojKhanMadhuriDixit chartbuster. Goosebumps only! üòçüòç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorNene Indeed! You and Madhuri are so similar in many ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cutest thing you will see on Twitter today üòç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barring #MadhuriDixit's movies, I have a rule not to watch movies with unnecessary songs/commercial elements.  It's time I make a rule not to watch #Netflix or #PrimeVideo stuff which have unnecessary gay characters in them. They've become like frickin coriander; tots fed up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoopluvsMadhuri She is fine. I think her niece updated her progress on her twitter handle yesterday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LovePConly agree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took years until tonight to finally figure it out...I always thought #NickJonas resembled some 90s actor. I was watching Anjaam and it finally dawned upon me his lower face structure matches that of #DeepakTijori of the 90s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PratikSaransh I remember one of the first cultural shocks was realising that the combined population of just the cities of Delhi and Mumbai (read Not NCR &amp; MMR) Was more than the Australia's population THEN ..and of course TODAY MMR's and certainly NCR's population has zoomed past it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GautamGambhir Why is India's map outdated? AP split into 2 quite a long time ago now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnlegend @people You deserve it. I did have a long crush on you when you released "All of me"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhaiyyajispeaks The woman and the man have the same charm, innocence and passion as PREM and Suman. Incredibly sweet to watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicksdmehta Agree! He has no screen presence; supporting players like Bahl, Kolhapure shine more.   Everything seems already seen in other movies. If the film lacks historical accuracy or is long or if Gowariker's content lacks fizz, this is definitely doomed. I'm more excited about #Tanaji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicksdmehta Any period Maratha female possessed vigor, radiated sunlike energy facially and "Thaat" in her gait &amp; dances, has distinct curvy physical attributes and moreover looked like a warrior's wife... None, absolutely none of these were seen in Ms Sanon in #MardMaratha song in #Panipat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@im_kapoor @RoopluvsMadhuri 1942 was robbed away from her. It wasn't a rejection from her. But I can understand rejecting Veer Zaara as Arin was barely a year old then. Her dates were blocked for Prem Granth for Khamoshi but she wanted to be one of RK heroines. Damini could have been done, it was powerful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theskindoctor13 Indeed! Because many wannabe millenials flaunt it so abashingly and proudly wear on their sleeves, the baby boomers/elder generations toss this illness away like its nothing; deeming it to be a cool quotient &amp; insignificant, which in turn, hampers the recovery of those suffering!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good foe declaring President's rule! These power hungry gluttons don't deserve to rule this mighty State!

<|startoftext|>Though Kareena Kapoor Khan seems like a plausible casting taking into account her association with the director, one must not forget the umpteen similarities between #MadhuriDixit &amp; #Madhubala ji. Right since the 90s people have said that and that's the choice audience wants.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SambitviIIa Agree! The story could have been told in many ways. She did it in an emotive exemplary way in 2.29 mins without feeling stretched.
