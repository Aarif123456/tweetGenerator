<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter @wojespn Idiot. You joined a team was somehow worse than the cavaliers this season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, and I thought the East was trash this year, now that @KingJames is gone...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ Even if they did get kawhi it still wouldn’t be enough, not to mention they would prolly have to give up Kuzma and or Lonzo just to get kawhi. No matter the case they don’t stand a chance against the warriors anyways.🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ dubs shoulda lost this game. Any chance the Cavs had is over. Tonight was their night and JR blew it. Warriors never gon play this bad again. KD gon drop 40+ next game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ 51 points tn puts LeBron in top 5 for most points scored in a final. The difference? Lebron the only one to lose the game out of those 5 guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel terrible for LeBron. He deserves this game. Absolutely nothing more he can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JR smith really took this game from @KingJames . How you gon play the King like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What more can LeBron do? How he supposed to win the finals with this stuff  https://t.co/93uQzAFxo7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ @KingJames @warriors He can switch between South Beach and Cleveland just like that so he must have the space stone, that’s 5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ @KingJames @warriors 😂that’s facts and he’s already the most powerful in the league so he got the power stone. And he’s playing better the OLDER he gets so he must have the time stone too. So he’s already got 3🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way @KingJames beats the @warriors is if he gets the infinity gauntlet and all 6 infinity stones tbh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@302Cade @_heed23_ I know, this finals matchup seems really forced, this Cavs team should not be in the finals. Nba needs to stop seeding the playoffs by conference and start going by record<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@302Cade Now there’s some blazing hot takes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ Word but it’s a shame cuz if he loses ppl gon @ him for another finals loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NBA is rigged👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_heed23_ Broke NBA record for most consecutive misses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @KingJames somehow wins a game in this finals with THIS cavs team, it’ll basically count as a finals win in my book tbh🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
