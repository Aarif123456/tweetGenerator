<|startoftext|>So it is clear, that a community which became militarily significant post 1700s can't claim to be saviours of Hindus &amp; Hindus to be Traitors.

<|startoftext|>8.

<|startoftext|>6.

<|startoftext|>4. Bangla Sahab Gurudwara was a gift of Sawai Jai Singh to Sikhs, they don't have 1 photo of Jai Singh there but have proudly put pictures of Bhindrawale.  5. Ramgarh, raipur rani, Chamba, Raikot are places where Sikhs got protection from Mughals, all were Hindu Rajput ruled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. Sawai Jai Singh supported Tegbahadur to be the head of Sikhs, otherwise sikh groups themselves were against him.  3. Most ferocious fighter of Sikhs Banda Vairagi was a Hindu Rajput of Jammu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In Hinduo ne Guruo ke saath Gaddari ki"  That's how an average Khalisi thinks, why? Because of over compensation and appeasement by RWers.  Now Fact Check:  1. Sawai Jai Singh &amp; Ram Singh saved Guru Tegbahadur from Aurangzeb.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>8. But in recent past we see the basis for protest is not the policy decision but doubts &amp; rumours.

<|startoftext|>7. Our track record will prove the truth.  We have brought micro irrigation to 47 lakh hectares land.

<|startoftext|>6. Big schemes such Loan Waivers were announced. The very same people who themselves claimed that only 15 paise of every ₹1 spent reached farmers, announced such big loan waivers too.

<|startoftext|>5. It is but natural, that there are doubts in the minds of some farmers. History of decades is behind this doubt. Earlier MSPs were announced but actual procurement was insignificant. MSP based procurement was only an excuse of an announcement. It was deceit. #FarmLaws<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My thread 👇on horrific #JungleRaj that became synonymous with  Lalu-Rabri duo,made Bihar, #BIMARU&amp;i explain,how  @narendramodi govt's centrally sponsored schemes,played a key role in uplifting #Bihar,which saw GDP growth of 11.3%,Fiscal deficit of 2.68%&amp;Revenue surplus of 1.4%💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst&amp;utterly shameful remnant of #JungleRaj under #LaluRabri,was #RangdariTax  Rangdari meant that every time a person started new business or bought property or car,it was mandatory to pay a certain amount to local goons  If someone refused to pay #Rangdari punishment was death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to Bihar Police site, number of murders during 2001-2005,before #NitishKumar took charge as CM,were 18189;One can imagine how many murders must have been committed during 1990 to 2000,when about 20000 murders were committed in just 5 yrs,under #JungleRaj of #LaluRabri<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was the time when people were scared to leave their homes after sunset;they were afraid of either getting kidnapped or murdered  During Lalu's #JungleRaj,another menace was,clashes between Ranveer Sena(upper caste) &amp;MCC(lower-caste group),in which hundreds lost their lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under #Lalu,#Shahabuddin,gangster turned politician from Siwan,reached peak of his powers;It is alleged that he was guilty of numerous murders but Lalu's support for him was so strong that even State police were scared to file cases against him  Another gangster was #ReetlalYadav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly,sometimes these innocent people were killed,even after  ransom money was received  Survey done by Times of India had shown that in #Bihar,from 1992 to 2004,total number of reported kidnapping cases were 32085  Political murders were order of the day,under #JungleRaj of Lalu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is said,during #LaluRabri era,only industry which flourished was that of 'kidnapping'  #LaluYadav put Bihar 30yrs back in terms of development Vs other States  Gangs used to kidnap doctors, engineers&amp;businessmen in broad daylight&amp;were released only after huge ransoms were paid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notorious Sadhu Yadav&amp;Subhash Yadav,Lalu's brother-in-laws,were referred as S2 during this time&amp;their names became synonymous with hooliganism;Lalu used brutal muscle power to remain in power;his muscle men Shahabuddin&amp;Surajbhan Singh wreaked havoc on aam janta,with vile thuggery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upswing of Lalu Prasad Yadav started after death of veteran socialist leader Karpuri Thakur;Lalu became leader of Opposition in  Bihar assembly in 1989&amp;became  chief minister,the same yr  Rise of Lalu saw enormous rise in criminal activities in the State,with rule of law,crushed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JungleRaj under @yadavtejashwi 's father,#LaluYadav refers to  criminal nexus of politicians,govt officials, businessmen&amp;law makers,prior to 2005  The criminal nexus was responsible for illegal activities that thrived openly,under State patronage,with use of violent intimidation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note:Fact that #Maruti sold over 1.66 lakh units domestically,in Oct 2020,means,it sold over 4 cars every single minute--If that is not a surge in #demand,nothing is!  #GST collections of Rs 1.05 lakh Cr in Oct,after 95480 Cr in Sep,is a big proof of #EconomicRecovery,yet again💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MarutiSuzuki with sales at 1,82,448 units in Oct2020,saw 18.9% growth over Oct2019  Total domestic sales were 1,66,825 units&amp;6037 units for OEMs  Exports,9586 units  Note:just in 9 days of #Navratri Maruti sold 95000 units  #Economy under @narendramodi govt,is gaining traction💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure,rise in net profit of ICICI Bank,was aided by low base,as it incurred tax of Rs 3712Cr in Sep 2019 qtr,due to one-time additional charge   Profit was also aided by 305Cr worth of stake sale by in ICICI Securities; That said,400%+ rise in Consol profit,is hugely commendable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thread 👇on #Economy  analyses results of #HdfcBank&amp; #ICICIBank  Despite #COVID19 provisions,a huge 600% rise in ICICIBank's profit,with mortgage disbursements at record levels&amp;Credit card spends at 85% of pre Covid levels,show momentum under @narendramodi gov,is building up💪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In Hl-2021,#ICICIBank did not utilise #Covid_19 provision made in earlier periods;Bank held aggregate Covid-19 provision of 8772Cr at Sep end  On consolidated basis,ICICI Bank's net profit up over 400%,at 4882Cr in Q2 FY21  ICICIBank's numbers point to strong economic momentum💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AssetQuality improved,with gross non-performing assets falling to 38989Cr in Sep qtr,Vs 45638Cr YoY💪  #GNPA as percentage of total assets fell to 5.17%,from 6 36% YoY  #NetNPAs fell from 1.23%,to 1%  #Deposits rose 20%,with #CASA deposits up 17%&amp;term deposits up 26%  #Economy💪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If vast majority of people do not have money to buy goods,can you explain this👇  How did #HeroMotoCorp sell 7.16 lakh bikes in just a single month in Sep'20?  How did #MarutiSuzuki record 32% sales growth in Sep?  How did M&amp;M sell 42361 tractors in Sep,a 77% growth,MoM? Wake Up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thread 👇 on #Economy,analyses    superb results of Colgate&amp; Ultratech,which show,economic recovery,gaining momentum  Yield on 10yr bond closed at 5.91% y'day,despite 10000Cr OMO in SDLs,which bodes well for borrowing programme of Centre  @narendramodi govt,doing all it should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMO in SDLs will help States to minimise bond issues&amp;club  borrowing needs by re-issuing papers used earlier;This helps in secondary market trading  RBI y'day announced 20000Cr of OMO of govt bonds,too,for papers maturing between 2025-2032   @narendramodi govt doing all it can💪!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMO in SDLs will lower borrowing cost of States&amp;free up some of the bank balance sheets in favour of RBI’s  Usually,Central Bank does not hold SDLs in its balance sheets,other than for accepting sub-national papers for daily liquidity operations  Hence OMO y'day,was one of a kind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lowest cut-off yield was offered for Karnataka’s 9yr bond@ 6.47%,while highest cut-off was for Jammu and Kashmir’s 10yr SDL@ 6.68%  Overall,2 papers each,of 15 states were purchased in the OMO  #OMO in #SDLs is good news,as it aligns borrowing cost of States with Centre #economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big news is,RBI conducted 1st first successful open market operation, #OMO, in state development loans,#SDLs,yesterday,buying Rs 10000Cr of securities   SDL holders offered 15475Cr of bonds against OMO size of Rs 10000Cr 💪  OMOs in SDLs could become the norm going fwd  #economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recovery,pervasive💪  After superb results by #ACC which saw PAT&amp;EBITDA rise 20%,#Cement major #Ultratech posted great results  Ultratech's ConsolProfit rose 113% to 1235Cr,while EBITDA rose 30% &amp;margins expanded 480bps to 26%  Cement is a lead indicator,so bodes well for economy<|endoftext|>
