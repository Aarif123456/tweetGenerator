<|startoftext|>@DifendiRoma @repubblica Wow sei troppo forte! Vorrei essere figo come te! Hai anche una vita oltre fare il pagliaccio su Twitter con quella foto profilo da bigotto beota? In questa quarantena ti consiglio di impiegare il tempo imparando le tabelline, visto che probabilmente non hai fatto le elementari.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DifendiRoma @repubblica Purtroppo siete così ritardati che per voi chiunque sia contro il KapiCoglione è rosso. Ti svelo un segreto, siamo solo persone intelligenti. Tanti puntini (...) e bacioni a te 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DifendiRoma @repubblica Tranquillo, con quelle teste da cazzo che avete piene di idee interessantissime come l’ultima perla del KapiCoglione, ci metterete poco a farvi fuori da soli. Bacioni 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DifendiRoma @repubblica Vacci a messa con quel coglione, magari io virus fa un po’ di pulizia 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repubblica Speriamo che il coglione vada a messa e si becchi il virus in modo potente<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Almost time to get this workout done 🏋🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyTG24 E quindi? Con tutto il rispetto per le persone decedute ma che notizia è? Da noi sono almeno quindici giorni che ne muoiono quasi il doppio ogni giorno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I only need to figure out how to play it properly 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ordered new guitar picks and a new Fender guitar strap 🎸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett I’m doing all that but I’m an active person so I usually burn a lot 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last week I’ve burnt 3400 active calories only. That’s the amount of calories I usually burn in 3 days. Damn quarantine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Coronavirustruth You all could die so stay the fuck home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now it's time to follow some new interesting people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I mean... look at that! It’s stunning.  https://t.co/xAumsk9T5s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus I’m starving. Can’t wait to have dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What you can do with an iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil is crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should stop watching reviews online. Now I wanna buy the new iPad Pro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These webcams have become expensive! Haven’t looked for one since 2005 probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about getting a webcam 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will touch it for sure if y’all don’t lock in the house. Prayers are not stopping it. Self isolation is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve always played it with 4 fingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out that you can play the G chord with both 3 or 4 fingers 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Boris! Keep shaking them!! We are with you 🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t say! Trump saying bullshit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, how y’all doing at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m the only one who’s happy about the quarantine 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ma come cazzo si fa ad avere ancora 4500 casi al giorno dopo 15 giorni che siamo stati “rinchiusi in casa”? Ah, ve lo dico io perché! PERCHÉ SIAMO UN POPOLO DI FOTUTTI RITARDATI #coronavirus #coronarvirusitalia #COVID2019 #COVID19italia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti Diciamo che non ne sento il bisogno 🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti Ho dovuto prestare assistenza da remoto al computer di mio zio dalle ore 9.00 alle ore 13.00. Ora per svagarmi leggo il vocabolario.  https://t.co/RKNsK3PqIg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to change my plans 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti È stata primavera fino ad oggi 🤩🤩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg I’ve just read that we had 793 deaths in the last 24h here in Italy. This numbers are crazy. Can’t wait for all this to be over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg the tip of my fingers hurt so bad from playing guitar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/xMPv7qHDIc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Relaxed rusks 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebatgur I’ll try to convince him today, it would be cool spending some time building a pc while quarantining 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebatgur He definitely needs an update for his desk pc at the office lol the one he’s using is like 10 years old 😂 I’m a geek and I cry every time I have to deal with that pc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna build a new pc for my dad but I’m not sure he wants to upgrade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Windows is going on the right way. Love the new #edge and I’m excited about the new #windows10 design coming soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out on the balcony trying to get a tan while quarantining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My eyes hurt for too much “smartphoning” 😩😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks god I’m not like that and maybe that’s why I’m the only one of my friends enjoying being at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see a lot of my contacts are joining #Telegram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dai che dopo 1 mese ce l’abbiamo fatta a capirlo, bravi! Se aveste avuto i coglioni 20 giorni fa, a st’ora saremmo un bel pezzo avanti. #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cari @matteosalvinimi e @GiorgiaMeloni , non ve fate un po’ schifo?  https://t.co/vcWIn834FS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This damn #COVID19 reached Greenland!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Responsible move 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/6HQ5fErvzQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Yes there are also them. And actually on a no symptom person the test could give a false negative so they are even worse. But actually they showed how a no symptom person is also less infective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker I know I’m not saying you guys are not taking this stuff seriously. I’m just saying that it’s not enough. Look at us, look at Spain, France, Germany. Don’t you feel like there’s something strange about UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker We’ve all been locked 8 days ago and the number of infected people keeps raising dramatically day after day. It’s impossible that UK has a low number of cases as the official one. They’re just not testing people in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And US as well I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s funny to see how UK officially have less than 2000 cases when unofficially they could have at least 10 times that number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women 🤷🏽‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really needed some days like these. I’m doing a lot of stuff i didn’t have time to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Me. Fucking dumb people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Poor Boris, he can’t do what he wanna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Ahahahah nope! I’ll wait a few months at least 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best thing about #coronavirus is the drop of pollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just bought three books set in New York. I definitely need to take another trip there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if #coronaVirus wasn't enough 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett I'll try to do it! 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett I’ve hided all the people that I can’t delete (because I know them in real life) and my newsfeed is still full of dumb comments under posts from pages I like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett Nah they’re not at all 😄😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Oh god there are hundreds and hundreds, and they always feel the right to talk about everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett I’m sick of dumb people on fb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna I’ll try to do the same 🙄😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna I hate reading dumb posts of dumb people. And it’s not only friends who I can hide from my newsfeed. It’s also about a lot of comments I read under posts from my liked pages 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m really taking into consideration deleting my Facebook account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott Gotcha, try to stay at home as much as possible, and avoid crowded places! The wave is coming, be ready and stay safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott I know, but they still didn’t locked you, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott We’re doing good, still at home at least until next Monday (not tomorrow), what about there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Oh wow congrats bro! Give me some more info and I’ll consider for sure! When are you gettin married?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Not as the main photographer but I’ve shot a couple of them 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda fake. The clip is 6 months old but it’s still cool af.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveMyCulture Did he say that’s he’s sorry tho?! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s take some pictures  https://t.co/rmaaJ0f6a5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/LwTYqcQiem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bolsonaro tested positive for Coronavirus days after meeting Trump! Finally a good news about corona #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @madtwalker happy birthday 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being locked at home feels good actually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott And btw I appreciate a lot! Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott It’s going well for me and my family, I’m a lil scared because hospitals are getting full and looks like this fuckin virus is more aggressive than it was before... but we’re all in quarantine so I hope we won’t catch it 🤞 stay safe there in the US! Don listen to Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Lmao thank you! We’re so used to standard bidets over here that we didn’t think of a “lite” version 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott Smh that’s why this fuckin virus is spreading so fast! People suck!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Wow I didn’t even know they existed! Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnCott I think y’all need to get covered with masks, gloves and all from now on! It’s not safe anymore out there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Wow that’s crazy 😄 do people know that they have to connect it to the water sistem? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna We have tons of toilet paper lol maybe also because we have bidets so in an emergency we’re not afraid to run out of toilet paper 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually it’s not boring for me. I love being at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quarantine is boring but I’m blessed to be at home and to have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People can’t even wear a damn mask 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyskkvinna Thanks god I’m my city the people are acting normal 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Well, don’t believe what the media tell about the number of the cases. They’ll get worse soon. Actually to say it’s coronavirus they should do a tampon and I think they’re not looking for it enough in the rest of Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Not the best time to take a trip 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madtwalker Are you in Spain?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti Ritardo mentale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @Twitter , during this quarantine please work on a #edit option. Thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@S_Riccetti @GiuseppeConteIT @Viminale @nzingaretti Eh si perché durante le centinaia di migliaia colazione tipiche italiane, il virus è ancora addormentato e ha sonno, quindi non attacca! #repubblicadellebanane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cari @GiuseppeConteIT @Viminale @nzingaretti e co. Mi spiegate che cazzo di provvedimento è chiudere tutto ma non ristoranti e simili? Sono i luoghi dove le probabilità di contagio sono maggiori visto che ci sono migliaia di persone a contatto con IL CIBO. #coronvirusitalia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett @Twitter Change your trends options from US to Worldwide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett @hgtv Yep, the landlord told us he’s gonna think about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett Nah the gym is fine, I workout at lunch time and there are only 5-6 people at that time. I don’t touch my face with my hands while I workout so it’s ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikdbarrett I wish I could do it! Anyway I’m planning to go outside the least possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow you’re really tall. Do you play basketball?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LebDemarcus @Magsy89 Non lo so, voti lega e hai le bandiere francesi e americane.  28% di analfabeti funzionali in italia, poco meno dei voti che ha preso la lega. Non saranno sicuramente tutti elettori del Kapitano ma scommetto che li in mezzo ce ne sono tantissimi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LebDemarcus @Magsy89 You don't even live in italy and you're reporting the bs the media tell you. We have less immigrates than France and Germany. Immigrants are  not the real problem of this country.  https://t.co/0yHUWJglnQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LebDemarcus @Magsy89 Democracy is good as long as people have the ability to read and write. In Italy the majority of the people that voted for the right is illiterate and that's the result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes you’re right, but the better the government the better the choices for the country. Better choices means more money for the people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr gotcha, the best way to use it is with some water :) try it at the Big Ben at sunset with the river in the composition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr not bad but u don't need the ND filter in the night, it's already dark enough :) 30" are enough to catch the trails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check this out: Portonovo Startrail  https://t.co/hKoyrvmUWv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr great! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr great! They both look good. Did you already get the adapters?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking for a flash to start doing some light painting works. I think I'll go for the Nikon SB-28.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna go for a run but my knee hurts as fuck 😡😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downloaded "iDont" but then I figured out that I don't need it because I don't spend that much time on my phone and I deleted it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>New Timer Remote is finally home! #Startrail &amp; #Timelapse season (aka #Summer) is coming! #NikonD7100…  http://t.co/CBYfYDAazN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look for a timer remote control (don't spend more than 15£).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr yep you can have some fun with those, and you also need a cable remote (the D3100 doesn't have the IR)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr get at least a ND 1000 to get that soft water look in daylight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr wait let me see lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr cool Did you get the ND?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr other tip: UV filter are useless expecially the cheap ones. The only useful filters for digital photography r ND and CPL filters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr Get this  http://t.co/Q9eXgU5jnO and a 77mm filter ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr check the lens cap it should be marked there. My advice is get a 77mm with adapters so it will fit new lenses in the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr i think it does but it's the most useless kit of filters. :) All you need is an ND Filter and nothing else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Plus I can't stand this faculty anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's taking too long to graduate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously need to start studying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr cool, as an advice: never get huge memory cards such as 32 or 64Gb because if they get broken ull lose a lot of pics ;) 16 is ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lexar Professional 400X SDHC Secure Digital Class 10 UHS-I 16GB 16384 MB di Lexar  http://t.co/EDsvKPFKbf @nnadozienr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr yeah I got the 16gb Lexar professional. I paid 19€ for it on Amazon, go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr it'd be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr yeah north England and Scotland got some beautiful landscapes. They are like the Mecca of the landscape photographer lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr lol just kidding but actually I'm planning a photography trip as soon as I get some money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr awesome! U need to learn quickly because I'm ready to come there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr Great! Now set it on M mode and start shooting :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr Thanks for sharing bro! Did you get your camera?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean I wish I have a real job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I had the money to follow technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally enabled my wifi printer. No more cables around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to hurry up and buy my phone lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even a reply for my Note 3. I want that Red Nexus 5 so bad. 😕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wanna go to Iceland or Nordkapp or northern England. #landscapephotographer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A sunny Sunday #finally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr now u need to figure out what kind of photography u like, if u'll ever go into landscape photography we need to go to Scotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr great, now learn how to use it and then I'll get there and we go to shoot together lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr yeah wise choice :) there's not so much difference between the 2 anyway, the D7xxx are another level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr that's a 3100 not 5100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr get this  http://t.co/6k1L3kZDmF And this  http://t.co/9HnRPsSlqK It's refurbished with 1 year warranty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr and only the 5100 body?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr what about Amazon UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr i think because I've sent u the italian link<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr the 18-105 I've sent to u is cheaper, 129£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr i don't know check for reviews on Google. Don't buy from Hong Kong because u won't have any warranty in Europe, try on ebay too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr check this out  http://t.co/XYs6JZiOnC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr its convenient in terms of usability but for the same price Id go for a used 18-105. A lot if stores have warranty on used items<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr yes they are nice to start, check if u spend the same with only the body and a 18-105, that's better than both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr nikon's better than canon cause they use the same mount since they was born so u can use a 30yrs-old lens and they are cheaper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr way better than the 3 we talked about earlier.With that body &amp; the right lenses u can do nice things,look for a D90 even better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr they are both better than the standard 18-55<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr lol go for the new one hands down, to me it's better to get only the body and then a used 18-105 (nikon) or 18-135 (canon)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr lol well me neither actually :D check for something online, usually they are way cheaper.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr here u go  http://t.co/MtN7hLHNJ7 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr if I lived in London I would never stop shooting ☺ take in consideration an used Nikon D3100, it should be a lil better for iso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing better than a #Chromecast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll get one with a financing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need to get an iMac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a beautiful day! Almost 9am and 70° already. #WelcomeSummer ☀️🌴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr check this out to understand what I'm talking about  http://t.co/tvD3dNv5X0  And what's your budget?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nnadozienr actually they are not so different, between the 2 I'd get the latest model because of the less noise at high ISO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TIM_Official Simon regini<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIM_Official già fatto da ieri mattina!!!! Eppure non rispondete. O forse non leggete proprio e rispondete frasi fatte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIM_Official Ho fatto delle domande BEN PRECISE tramite messaggio nella vostra pagina Fb, avete dato risposte VAGHISSIME. Controllate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIM_Official come al solito vi riconfermate pessimi a livello di assistenza clienti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want the Galaxy Gear Fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm about to throw this fuckin laptop out of the window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the sky creates an awesome photographic scenario I usually don't have the car to go take some pics 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate the rain and a covered sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes me feel stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the reasons why I love spring is that the sun always come out after a storm ✌☀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still can't use them on my laptop. It's too complex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need a faster auto refresh though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually I like how they implemented them on #Windows81<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Windows have a lot of work to do to be competitive. Their apps are still "old"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just updated Windows to 8.1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hand bag is more handy tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switched from my hand camera bag to the Lowepro 400 AW. I have to say that it's a lot more spacious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more you're stupid the better you look to society. #Wearefuckedup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to turn the lights on. Damn storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's T-Mobile on the East Coast?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett Lmao ok it can work :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett here they won't let you do it. America is better for that lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett lol yeah I need a job too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett yeah this stuff is expensive as fuck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett since I got into photography I understood that the less u spend the more u'll spend later,  a flash under 100 is not a big deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett i got 3 lenses and I'm trying to get a flash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett damn u have all those lenses?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett gotcha, yeah that's big and Tamrac is good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett i know i paid mine 110€, the flipside 500 is bigger anyway, Tamrac is good too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett what did u get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett I think B&amp;H is more expensive than Amazon. I suggest you to get a Flipside that is more safe as it opens on the back side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett Just bought a Lowepro Flipside 400 AW from Amazon, one of the best bags for cameras and lenses. Check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbarrett Lol u know..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ yes every-fuckin-thing smh i need to buy some clothes when I come over there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ wow then I'm wrong lol and think that we found it way cheaper than italy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ really? I thought LA area was cheaper than the east coast, not downtown obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ what about Cali? Life is cheaper isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ oh well actually idk, but i think it's not too far from the city center, I think there is something within 1 hour from there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ Yes looks really quiet but full of life at the same time, then there's the beach that is the most important thing lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ wow that's great! I think it's the perfect city, not too big and not too dangerous, it should be the less dangerous American city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ damn.. for the Boston Marathon, we go to Boston then NYC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ lol if you don't try u'll never know! Do u think can u make it to come to nyc in april? :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ those are not good reasons lol I'm sure you would speak another language if u wanted to and engineering is just a school :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ that's not true lol why u say that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ because they are the most difficult exams of my course, I've already done the easiest lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ I think 1 year and a half.. I really hope I made it but idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ within June 2014 but I have 10 more exams to do smh only 20 people outta almost 100 of my course made it in time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ no, actually they are 50€ more because I didn't graduate in time 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ actually now i can do exams until i graduate.I just need to pay fees every year to stay in.I can also go to old classes if i want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ classes are over for me. Now I only have to do the exams and it's gonna be a long long way to the graduation lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yoboi_TJ gotcha we are on the same boat lol<|endoftext|>
