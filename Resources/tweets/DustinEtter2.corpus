<|startoftext|>@pattiknits1 @MattWalshBlog @LisaMarieBoothe Rethinking the American Union for the Twenty-First Century  https://t.co/AdtgiBwIUY  Takes a pretty good crack at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @LisaMarieBoothe Two groups of people, each totaling larger than the population of the UK, just voted for a different person to lead 325 million people.   We control land 40 time larger than the UK.  I think we can split it up and separate amicably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnheretohelp Do we have any proof that they’re marked this way?  I’ve read that each state prints it’s own ballots under DHS guidelines.  Not that the DHS send them ballots to use.  Do they provide the paper?  Or where the markings mandatory? Somebody has to have a mail n ballot we can test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joecaradine @TN_SillyMan @FBI @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @marklevinshow Are there ways to run simulations of data through the coding, if you had it of course, and see if its rigged?  If you ran a million hypothetical votes to every candidate and ended up with different numbers wouldn't that do that trick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpenn109 @tracybeanz According to these guys it was.  They could perform queries and populate a list of IPs.  @We_Have_Risen @Johnheretohelp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz @LizRNC Nothing to see here citizen, move along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gscarp12 @TheKingDude @breakdradio @BarrettBrief   Can Greg explain what this is on Monday??  What are we seeing here.  This is beyond my comprehension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlxThomp @KatiePavlich So so so well said.  Exactly right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boobiejohnson1 @kylenabecker Here in Texas we gotta be printed, digitally, for our conceal and carry license.  Just doesn’t feel all that intrusive.  We need some sort of voter ID.  It’s got to be honest.   If it’s not honest it can’t be fair. For anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker BODY CAMERAS.  YES.    And what’s so hard about a thumb print???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto We talking about new votes or the 6k reported yesterday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #MAGA2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bgbolger @SelimSeesYou @Barnes_Law The idea of a “bellwether” is that it indicates what we can expect.  Those sorts of things degrade over time.  Not instantly.  In one election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKingDude This seems like “fixing” ballots.  Don’t know if that is illegal or not.   I think the fraud will be found either in the software or during a hand recount.  Too many mail ins with only the presidential race filled in.  Gotta hand count’m all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WellingMichael Don’t know the legality of any of this, but it does look like one is reading out  and the other filling out.  Again, don’t know if this is legal, but it seems like what they’re doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast The AP, WaPo, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, Quinnipiac, FOX News and NYT called the race for biden months ago.  That's the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Rage will make you do crazy shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec If the purple finger ink worked in Iraq, why not do that at our polls? If we have the finger print to get CHL, why not to vote?  The ambiguity and confusion in the mail-in, ID less, signature less, postmark illegible ballots system are planned features.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrettBrief She's Kylosian, like Drax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicheleFeile @ZoomerOps @Timcast I've been down this rabbit hole for most of that day.  I was understanding that the fed set the date and made sure that states comply with civil rights legislation to make sure there is no unfair treatment or voter suppression, but that the state legislature decide how to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NVGOP @seanmdav They're pulling a Hannibal on us.    They think we are in shock and will just go with it.    NOPE.  https://t.co/nlRmKvp9Uu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandyComedy @Daveforthelawl @stillgray Are you a hobbit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@independentabe @TomFitton DEBUNKED DEBUNKED DEBUNKED.   I see how we play now.     I win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFitton Is there anyway we can isolate ballots that only voted for the presidential race and didn't have down ballot selections?  Seems, at least initially, those would be the most likely to be a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@independentabe @BreitbartNews Already been there.   The thread deals with he easy part and dismisses the hard parts.  Claims poll watcher were intact allowed in-yes.  Claims they could "watch"-yes.  Did it refute the fact that they were 30-100' away and couldn't see shit?-NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews So what exactly does hard evidence looks like to these people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hammtweezy2192 @TaylorRMarshall @OANN @FoxNews @newsmax Wonder where Carlson and Ingraham head in the 6-12 months?  Unless they're ties to long term contracts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker Does this pull anything from the official total? How will they know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bourgeoisalien @antisoc_bfly First paragraph is shit, but I’m mesmerized by those cheese saltines.  I having that tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoomerOps @Timcast Article 1 section 4 gives state legislatures the right to set up each states elections.  I’m sure I requires a court interpretation, but it seems like a state legislature could invalidate an election and order a redo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer @MattWalshBlog Because most are eunuchs.  They embrace the cuck.  Hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toure 😂😂😂   Even when you (might) win we Trump supporters still take up your feeble brain space!    I love it.    You’ll never find peace because you can’t change last four years!  😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBevanRCP #ACB is not fat.  She's quite fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@florbosagbag @Timcast No joke.  Seems egregious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidboxenhorn @Timcast This is the ONLY WAY the people will accept the outcome.  2 weeks to request and return absentee ballots, then a two day in person vote.  Add'm up.    Any other outcome will be rejected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Any way that this shit show goes from here, people will deem it illegitimate.  And unlike the 2016 election, they'll be right.  No matter who wins.   There is a tough road ahead for the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen This seems dismissive.  He gets around the Detroit issue by giving the number of poll watchers who were allowed to "watch".  That wasn't and isn't the rub.  The problem isn't that they aren't in the room, but that they are 30'-150' away!!!!  This is 2020 debunking at its best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerseveranceIs @Gregmaeser @timotheeology And he never condemned white supremacism either, right???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The troops are rallying.   @LindseyGrahamSC  @tedcruz   #2020Elections #MAGA2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beefalo123 @ViktoriiaUAH @JackPosobiec @RaheemKassam You are right 96k is a lot.  I think its fraud.  No doubt, but I do believe some could be a dislike of the candidate.  A quick search shows Qasim wasn't well liked locally and Wittman was.  That may account for some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @LizRNC #MAKEELECTIONSHONESTAGAIN  70 million people behind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViktoriiaUAH @JackPosobiec @RaheemKassam In all Fairness Wittman was the incumbent.  That may explain some.  Definitely not all, but some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaWDelano @BarrettBrief @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I really want to know what "hard evidence" looks like at this point?  There are 100s of individual cases, in the twitterverse, of people posting that their dead relatives voted this year!  Long dead in many cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBevanRCP @seanmdav There are instances of fraud that are easily found. People are posting, little by little, instances of their own deceased family members voting.  The same people claiming there is no evidence of fraud are the same people who claim President Trump won't denounce white supremacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav This isn't the worst thing, but a #SupremeCourt decision to either override the PA SC &amp; give it to Trump, or not override and let it go to Biden could be.  We really do need an in person revote for #Pennsylvania2020.  Could all depend on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrettBrief @JoeBiden Not all of them, just enough of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKingDude @AndrewCMcCarthy I wonder, KD, if we can get @gscarp12 to find a PA State death certificate registry and run those through the PAvoterservice website.  Should be able to see how many dead folks voted.  Seems easy!  For Gregory I mean.  😬<|endoftext|>
