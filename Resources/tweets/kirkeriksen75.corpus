<|startoftext|>@marcorubio What’s your point, Marco?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolfVanHalen @billieeilish @VanHalen Well done, sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristySwansonXO Have you EVER lived in a neighborhood that WASN’T predominately white?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristySwansonXO Again, way to demonstrate how you were raised to love everybody. All implants; no heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Please stop pretending you’re a Christian; it’s almost as transparent as your pretending to be straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr If by “savage” you mean uncivilized, I completely agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Given the concerns you’ve voiced, why won’t you testify in the impeachment hearings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristySwansonXO What part of loving everyone is calling people crazy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billmaher Which talking points do you suggest the Dems get behind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Your unwillingness to testify is protecting the greatest threat to our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Marco, please stop pretending to be a Christian. The facade is almost as transparent as your attempts to seem heterosexual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if a beat cop shoots a black kid, because he says he felt threatened, it's 100% support for him from the right. But if two FBI employees out of more than 35,000 express a strong dislike for Trump (via private text) the entire agency is corrupt and untrustworthy. #PutinsPuppet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your comma usage is truly terrible. #NeverTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor But you're the original short-fingered vulgarian, so of course you don't see it. #NeverTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @ScottBaio But he can't even differentiate between weather and climate. #nottrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @politico Well, at least they don't work for the "Department of Environmental"! #nottrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio You don't know the difference between climate and weather! This is the dumbest tweet ever! #IdiotsforTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ezraklein You're missing the point. Many of Bernie's supporters are independents who registered as dems. #Bernie2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter So what? Donnie Trump once assaulted a music teacher because he doubted the man's knowledge of music.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarlyFiorina @tedcruz But you endorsed Cruz? How is he not a Washington insider? Because he's despised? #Trump2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Who cares? Stop covering this person's every thought as though they were of any consequence to anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico How could she? She's staying neutral to secure herself a cabinet position. Like Dante said; special places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lol! Every intelligent person in America knows you're the biggest liar in this race, indeed the history of primaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Then why on earth are they voting for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter ... or policies, experience, ability, temperament, etcetera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter Right, and if Trump weren't a pathological liar you might have a point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KimKardashian @BetteMidler Ageism? You're not exactly a spring chicken! So try showing a little less ass and a little more class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBenCarson Care to offer any specifics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 34% of your war chest has come from outside sources, so you've self-financed 66% of your campaign.<|endoftext|>
