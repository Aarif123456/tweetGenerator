<|startoftext|>@Corrville Don’t forget the 200,000 cotes in Florida. Lol. Trump is a tool. He’s the biggest fraud with elections and his bumbling elves are truly from the Island if Misfit Toys.  https://t.co/e39xRaSVkA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@o0Ravnos0o @4_judgement @Sand628Sandy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP He did that as well. He wanted the chaos. Yet he also wanted dead people. He wanted their SS and he did move the funds to another source to get corporate votes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here’s where he claims he was responsible for Middle East. This was the most outrageous time every for this to be allowed. When asking for Press Credentials was told by his staff Powe was transiting. When asked by top officials they say it was outrageous she was allowed there  https://t.co/P2TIAA45q9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump not only lied framed Biden in the Hunter scandal he also had Tucker Carlson in on it too.  The Gateway Pundit History is shown.  Trumps got Alessandra Powe to ask about the Middle East as well. He’s a tool. Has these insiders ask questions and look how he responds. Lol.  https://t.co/JfxoLentO6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was the Gateway Pundit and it was all part of Trumps fraud. Jim Hoyt pictured below is part of the conspiracy from 2016  Election Fraud    The “writer” is pictured in WH giving the Okay sign along with Lucian W who Trump never knew? Pic shows why Trump held Bible after riots.  https://t.co/PTUJiaV6RF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad this was allowed for 4 years. They impeached this guy for a reason. That right there was the downfall of Democracy.

<|startoftext|>@thecjpearson You don’t need to worry about that. It’s all going to work out just fine. Your gang are all very fine people. You did write that story on your blog about Trump correct?

<|startoftext|>@CharliiamMay @thecjpearson This is so true. I felt bad for him in the beginning but now he’s a Hitler to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This didn’t work out so well. Trump had a comfort zone of manipulation. He spun things beyond. He’s never been anyone. His dad was just as big a thief.

<|startoftext|>@gabbinggeek @NufocusfromBham @thecjpearson I thought so too but learned he’s actually soulless. I thought the same at first. This guy is a a threat to our country.

<|startoftext|>@NufocusfromBham @thecjpearson Your so right. He’s a sellout for Trump. He’s also a bit more involved than any other “electoral voter” I’ve ever known of.

<|startoftext|>@DemocracyInn @realDonaldTrump That’s cause Tucker knows he’s next..he played big in the Trump ties to throw out shady news.

There’s way more yet blows my@mind how Trump claims fraud?  https://t.co/qSOllqiKiJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goldwater campaign had riots and police backings. They began same timeline as Trump.  There was a young boy killed and police were not responsible.  Looting began.

<|startoftext|>This is why Trump held the Bible that day.  Note of two “reporters” Lucian and Jim Hoyt.

<|startoftext|>This isn’t going well for Trump. Looks like the only loyal ones are his Proud Boys and Patriots. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s the biggest fraud out there. It really takes a audacity to run for President having all his past. I would be afraid they’d find a speeding ticket.  Yet if you knew how he rigged this election and want an investigation? He’s the devil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why did they open?  Why did they open?  Was it because they were getting deprived of free lunch? There are so many dead children now. Makes no sense. Just makes no sense.

<|startoftext|>@wallisweaver Why is this so tragic. What is wrong with this country to allow this? The POS should not have been given special treatment and allowed back out to spread more.

<|startoftext|>This is news Why is this country still allowing this outrage. Go tap his ties to China banking, demand records anything.

<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i Tucker is member of OANN. This is one of 30 emails showing his ties with Trumps election. Read about Cerno. He’s one linked to the Q stories and he’s one of 4 “reporters” doing okay symbol in WH. @FBI outrageous that OUR WH has had these conspiracy ties and internally allowed.  https://t.co/oYppyklhmN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gail5677Gail @polarsprite Does everyone really think he cares what his legacy is?  He cares about the checkbook America had delivered him to finagle his accounts that are being demanded back.  He cares nothing about being a loser it’s about his power to have people perform; he wants control the panel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@higdon_toni @polarsprite Time to go Trumpatubby. Sadly he’s much more devious than we expect.  I hope they have a plan for that day and the following. His supporters are haters. They are sending scary signals.  https://t.co/WnUyRiiCAn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@branka_jovic @polarsprite He doesn’t follow the norms because he is a White Supremacy, Patriot, Proud Boy ect DANGER to America.  He wouldn’t hang Obama’s portrait because of that.  He needs to be gone yesterday..he’s capable of so much more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonni_rabbit @Natalie83049 @RockyMountViews @polarsprite Amen! He’s truly not human. He’s Hitler and should have been removed long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump I wish I could message you..lol. I don’t want to sound like a know it all. The antibody testing was hopeful until someone got reinfected using antibodies.  People can’t assume this is anything except a distant Hope. How all his staff is catching it and doing fine is very suspect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump I worked in media when we fact checked and reported unbiased.  Sickening now. I did study at John Hopkins medical “fingerprint” The studies must be “humane” They must test on all ethnicities and all else.  Look up Kenrad Nelson with Time/Ebola. He warned US and Obama listened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm that’s interesting🤔 Rememebr when I said news stations were ignoring me?  Check this out because they now are on to them.   I can only put one picture. This is Patriot guy Fox let’s endorse.  OANN and Netmax are inside sites. Tucker Carlson gets Patriot thanks to OANN @  https://t.co/vvzguiNCv2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep in mind the “reporters” allowed into OUR WH!  Russia’s own reporter from Sputnik? The Gateway Pundit Jim Hoyt is responsible for 2016 election interference and Trump rigged the election yet FBI Director was fired?  He feared for his@life. This is all being watched now. @FBI  https://t.co/zwd6RJK7YK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The two posts below show the Oregon rally and Trump will not denounce White Supremacy because his followers are all parts of here crowds. Those included. That is why he won’t hang Obama’s portrait. This is why he is a threat to America along with the hate groups. @FBI @sprincas  https://t.co/ffibqDvaM5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald Trump Poses with a Bible at Church Photo Op After Police Clear His Path Using... https://t.co/Z0sAGcYouh The reason Trump stood in church with a Bible wrong side?

<|startoftext|>@GaryDeVaan @ResisterForever Exactly. They are all trumps terror groups. Notice Tucker Carlson ties? .  Tucker getting thanked by Patriot Kyle Glover ?  Dalton stating Trump doesn’t support WS?  Code for Super Necessary where he got 200,000 White Supremacy voters.  Trump won’t denounce due to loyalty  https://t.co/csDjTtmriv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been the most bizarre, tragic 4-years. They are beyond stupid. Here she’s going back to work st her dads car wash.

<|startoftext|>You set them up. Don’t think we buy it. The Portland Deal where Trump holds up Bible? Right after setting the stage to make it look like BLM were looting. Odd isn’t it?

<|startoftext|>@isenkonsanti @donkhanswaylo @MrAndyNgo @realDonaldTrump You have to read my story I’m writing. It is beyond strange the similarities of Goldwater and Trump.  I’m beyond convinced George Floyd’s death was no accident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump makes me wonder if these were available sooner. Fauci finally spoke up against him when he lost. 🤔 I don’t think Fauci was worried about his job by keeping quiet  I believe he was protecting us by not going against Trump. Look how trump already told NY they wouldn’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump That’s so weird you would say that. Russia had lots of vaccines that Trump claims wouldn’t #give him “ I’m sorting his out in my head because your right. I was with wondering how so many of his followers didn’t get Covid.  They have a rally sheet for each group and low numbers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh...that’s beyond true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isenkonsanti @donkhanswaylo @MrAndyNgo He’s also setting the stage to make it look like they were there. Notice the “hint” from his inside page. Framing it to make it look like they were there and what they were wearing?  Ironically that’s what everyone is saying now so they can “identify them?”  #BLM @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/fjN9fqTl23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#4 The Proud Boys that Trump never heard of.  Here’s a scary post from one. Remember the okay symbol. Here’s the Proud Boy and Gateway Pundits ( the conspiracy writer..🤔 Keep the Bible@in mind.  Jim Hoyt is pictured with Lucian in OUR Whitehouse flashing White Supremacy okay  https://t.co/gOeeZm0jfV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is about the inside hate groups setting up the BLM and Antifa.  Here’s the first inside look. This was setting up the inside code of how Trump operates.  Remember he never heard of the Patriots. This guy is Patriot boy and he’s in an interview with Steve Bannon.  https://t.co/w4UyyvkAVQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part 3 Burning down cities. This will transition into the real story if just how corrupt Trump and his followers are.  Shooting and@looting when George Floyd was killed.  This will be factual and bit by bit.  Goldwater campaign, Bible, sic the dogs, and MLK Letter from Birmingham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apathetic_NY He’s not the best there either. He gets upset and they have to change his pants.  Mommy never took the time to transition to big boy pants.  https://t.co/MeE0kImOgo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump No he’s outright telling them to get violent. He’s using the CJ Parsons page to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump Gotcha. I don’t see his posts as he blocked me. I was talking about his followers that are posting the loyalty threats.  That’s outrageous that he’s posting anything. Your 💯 right  I didn’t know he was stupid enough but not surprised. I was viewing the loyalty post as his code<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinaUSAblue The protestors have been instructed to fo mask free to show loyalty.  If he’s not taken out now we will lose this war.  This is getting worse by the seconds.  Top hospitals are now running out of equipment and this was Trumps plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter works on Covid floor.  She is all of 24 and will be forever changed. The frontline workers are our heroes.  When Trump has all the followers didn’t understand why. They are hate groups. They are swarming in storms to get people sick. His loyalists post about mask free  https://t.co/74vO3BDZRy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump Here’s an example of what’s going on. Twitter acts on it but they have so many scary people that’s it’s a needle in a haystack. It is happening tho.  They also get a heads up at the place where these punks are nothing compared to real life🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump Donny won’t let me@tag him anymore. Lol. The reason we tag names are so the authorities look into  https://t.co/kruz3p1qFW which they are yet we do send Twitter posts where they incite danger and I’m guessing they are having a hard time keeping up.  Always report violence tweets  https://t.co/YVvxrZVHtl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an outrageous lie. The group this candidate is in is part of the all the hate groups Trump never heard of. 🤔 Here’s the internal tweet that sets it up to look like they were there. Also ask why this woman is friends with CJ Parsons group that is led by Patriots and more?  https://t.co/1EQ2LKD3UT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trumps boys doing their job. Trump never knew about Patriots, Proud Boys, Antifa ect.? Why the Patriot Loyalty?  Read the tweets from his followers and don’t think he’s not 1000% dangerous. This is the locality of a bunch if degenerate losers and keep turning in the names!!🤫  https://t.co/HIimVvIjys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is kidding. Since she is one of the followers on the CJ Parsons page.  Proud Boy #1 We are standing by.  2. The plans of getting militant that on CJ Parsons GA electoral voter page. Trump never heard of Patriots but Patriot leader Brandon being endorsed as Walk Away. Code  https://t.co/GBfsmOyUTi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecjpearson Why are you speaking out about it taking it? Is it possible that you are inciting hate and violence? That’s not your job as a electoral voter to  your site to promote rioting? @FBI @CNN @davenewworld_2 @BrandonStraka @mcspocky @sknpatriots @VickiLD2 @realDonaldTrump @Acosta  https://t.co/o33H5eVIAe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBI Why is this kid speaking out on Instagram still. There is proof beyond proof that these hate groups are using IG to “code”  This is an electoral voter and he’s promoting violence?  He is shown with Patriots and Trumps only supporters are hate groups? Patriots is code  https://t.co/Xvy4MBM2g6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy is the electoral candidate in Georgia. This kid is DaNGEROUS. He’s working for Trumps Hate Groups.  Trump is telling these “supporters” to prove their locality by rioting and going mask less.  He is speaking out as an electoral candidate? HELLO ?  Read the pictures  https://t.co/oozfmBBGwk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @realDonaldTrump That’s questionable to me as well. Facebook has even taken down Trumps label as President of the United States and he’s just a “political candidate “  Maybe the codes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyMcInturff1 @KazePlays_JC Thank you for your dedication during this horrific time ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patkatj @rosieogrady53 @GeeGeeAkili @IAmDawnM There you go. No health insurance as well as no more Walter Reed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump never heard of Proud Boys but Brandon Struka is huge into it?  Not only that but he does a Fox shout out for Trump and Gingrich endorsed him as “Walk Away” so names don’t fool you.  Then Struka is doing a pod with Steve Bannons. Trump won’t denounce because of loyalty  https://t.co/xERdwa7uL7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McEnany: Trump has ‘condemned’ white supremacy, but 'shameful' media won't cover it  https://t.co/iGvPqs9bUE  At the time of this statement Brandon Struka of Proud Boys did a Fox clip and Gingrich endorsed Struka as part of the “walk away” founder.  Trumps support is hate groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is too funny. Donald Trump “shop now”. They removed his label. 😂😂👋🏼👋🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼⚖️👐👐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @Geoffyoungrepub Why would that be? I’m wondering if Trumps cowboys all our honoring his mask free request. So you all can purposely kill people. That makes a sore loser and murderer. The intentional act of indicting harm on someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 I wrote an@obit for a mom who lost her 5-year old the night Trump was dancing around Covid free. She sent me her picture sitting on Santa’s lap and told her “Mommy I won’t be afraid to sit on Santa’s lap this year. I’m a big girl now. “ I’m numb to how this was allowed. 😢😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 Lol.. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is definitely a Trump logic. They were “very,very small hands..I mean vans..😂👐👐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder He’s having his loyalists spitting and not wearing masks as sign of loyalty.  This is what he wanted. He HAS TO BE STOPPED now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more screenshots the better. He’s deleted many. Next check out “Walk Away” being endorsed. Brandon Straka is huge Patriot. Look for “Stop the Steal” tags and you can find the loyalists  Fox in big. Neut endorsed him as Walk Away is a code to Patriots.  https://t.co/U0gtlU25Bp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet of the day: Trump having son tweet watching the election making sure it goes his way.  Also tweet is him asking a loyalist about the FBI conversation.  This was his rigging and he had a militia of loyalists. Note his note “Fight Back”.That night was protest at ballots.  https://t.co/w59DNFYfBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 Oh my gosh how this page is awesome. 😂😂🤔 Twitter is gonna be the downfall of trump and his hate games. Lol  Here’s a fun one.

<|startoftext|>His group of loyalists are going mask less and spitting. This is what he’s promoting and loyalty shows they are anti-maskers.

<|startoftext|>@stimpy4964 @RandiB1 @ossoff @Acosta @FBIChicago @thecjpearson Your not being dumb silly. Trump thrives on creating confusion. This means Whit Supremacy. That’s the call out for White Supremacists to meet to vote and get paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is huge reason for overseas concern. There is a lawsuit right now for Korea /China sanctions violations.  No President is allowed overseas banking. Trump denied banking there? He went to China when this was being discovered.  Barr didn’t hand over documents to protect trump.  https://t.co/IbORIMYpqE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @jack @TwitterSupport Let me help add from his “insiders” He rigged Fox to do the surge. He had his son kid tweeting when things were going his way. I also shared his post where 200,000 “voters” went to Florida. Payday and “super necessary” means “”White Supremacy”. This has to stop. Cerno rigged Fox.  https://t.co/kbgCvcZuxv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandiB1 @stimpy4964 @ossoff @Acosta @FBIChicago @thecjpearson He also relocated the Latinos who were displaced and he had a Latino Proud Boys speaker at his rallies. This is interesting since they knew what was turning red?  https://t.co/uA1X24Kgpw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Endurance97 That’s why I shared,shared, shared and shared. This was the closest we have ever become to a Hitler regime.  Trump operates beyond a hate capacity.

<|startoftext|>@GreggHoush Kyle Glover is the head of the Patriots. I noticed Trump appointee a Ga electoral college voter a week back.

<|startoftext|>@BuzzFeedNews He’s done what he wants and it’s outrageous. His campaign waivers regarding Covid are under the Trump Campaign yet he’s using the WH for immunity? He never added a bipartisan for the Campaign Finance Act so it was inactive since June 2020? #TrumpCampaign #TrumpTaxReturns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosie0424 There is no reason he’s not stopped by Homeland Security. He is not only a threat for his Russia/Iran involvement. Which in itself is getting very dangerous.  He is a threat to our country with his knowing this virus is dangerous and being allowed to spread it.  https://t.co/dUyusuEbmH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miriam2626 It never should have even been close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bannerite Oh he did something. He spread the virus personally. Encouraged no masks, created division by name@calling responsible people with his heartless trolls.  He opened schools, took away states authority and rallies in states begging to be allowed to lock down?  Wisconsin example. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosie0424 @funder LOVE THIS!!! The panic he wanted to avoid is here. Thanks to him and his trolls.  It’s beyond me how America allowed this.  He blames Governors for initial spread.  He rallies in NJ where state has mask mandate? WiscGov can’t shut state down.Unconstitional?  Trump rallies there ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosie0424 Isn’t it amazing? I felt so safe last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattNegrin Amen! Trump thrives on deflection The allowed that along with allowing him to tell people to take whatever.  I have always said this. I worked in field 35-years. First time I met Trump was when TVs had to put disclaimers in ads.  At the least.that should have been done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattNegrin My 24-year old daughter wanted to be a nurse to find a cue for cancer. Instead she works in Covid floor at Mayo.

<|startoftext|>@juanc_102 @mmpadellan Look up Alicia Powe- She was at WH in August 2020 and worked for Gateway Pundit. She had no press credentials.

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan shared this months ago. Trump is a liar as we know. The top paragraph states he was watching them back in 2019. The other picture is if two “reporters” doing symbol in WH.

<|startoftext|>@RoxieBelle2 @fun_timeeee @SenatorDurbin I think that’s what’s going on now. Our Supreme Court has let us down these past 4-years.

<|startoftext|>@JulchenMuller @robreiner Where is New Jersey Attorney General? Trump said blame was on governors for spread. NJ mandates mask wearing? His rally included the Governor and the neck to neck crowds? Where was the Governors liability? Trumps immunity is gone at Federal Level. It’s now State Level !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunTsu @robreiner They are doing fine...it’s the rest of America that’s dying. His disclaimers say he’s not liable. That would mean his government immunity is not applicable. As well as his being protected by not valid immunity. To be immune means you also have no awareness of the danger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heavenlee81 @robreiner He wanted dead people. He transferred SS to lure payroll tax incentive for rich. He said “If you vote for me”...and used the dead’s dollar and our dollar to campaign basically. This is beyond outrageous. There are more than 200 legal reasons he shouldn’t be in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoweVT2 @robreiner Why wasn’t Jared around to speak or even be part of his medical team?  His duty would include updating and letting us know precautionary measure. Why wasn’t WH Task Force Penske mandating mask wearing? He refused to after all testing positive. Why are we being killed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Essentialworker @robreiner Please help us. Find a lawyer who will file a First Amendment Class Action Lawsuit due to our right of Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness. We have lost all of those. Our Liberty is gone we live in fear. The lives he led to slaughter is going to go up beyond hospital capacity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Can you find any lawyer that can help us out? This virus is doubling and he’s speaking on Monday in Florida? This is outrageous and we need help filing a Federal Lawsuit. His disclaimers say he personally is not liable. That removes his government immunity<|endoftext|>
