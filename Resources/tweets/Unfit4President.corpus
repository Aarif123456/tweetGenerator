<|startoftext|>@TheScelata @patrickmadrid @DioceseofGallup @BishopWall You want answers about traditions. Respect for the Eucharist is vital. However - to reference pre Vatican II elements &amp; Benedict At the same time are signals to orthodox Catholics and an embrace of Burke like tendencies who frequently oppose Francis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheScelata @patrickmadrid @BishopWall @Pontifex You must not have read Benedict’s most recent letter...anyone who finds fault with Francis management should be careful to not forget this sadly implicates multiple Popes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheScelata @patrickmadrid @DioceseofGallup @BishopWall Good questions. Catholics may disagree but #Christ is not limited.  He is found within &amp; beyond the sacraments.

<|startoftext|>@ShadowSeven50 @MassimoFaggioli If you ask Bishop Barron or others you are likely to see that abuse isn’t about homosexuality but about the misuse of power behind a collar.  Any cleric that abuses power or commits a crime against children is not a servant of Christ or his Church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Catholic5Me @patrickmadrid I am committed to the Truth. Vigano undermines Francis while ignoring the failures of Benedict &amp; others.

<|startoftext|>@3Catholic5Me @patrickmadrid Not mad.  Just seems unjust to accuse Francis without also naming Benedict’s failures and the certain knowledge of St John Paul.  Vigano is not to be trusted until he has the courage to identify all of those with knowledge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadowSeven50 @MassimoFaggioli It’s simple.  Excommunicate or at least remove from the priesthood those priests found to have been abusers.  Why hasn’t this occurred?  One word.  Clericism which places priests above those they are called to serve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Catholic5Me @patrickmadrid Claiming that Pope Francis is dishonest while not also identifying the failures of Benedict to address the issue is just one if many. I beg you be suspicious of Vigano &amp; give credit to Francis who deserves credit for many reforms including the corruption of the Vatican bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadowSeven50 @MassimoFaggioli Clericism is the problem.  If you have not confronted a Bishop before about the truth of a pastors misconduct then you have no idea how large the problem is.  Don’t be misled - sex is just one sin and only be abuse of power within the Church<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadowSeven50 @MassimoFaggioli If you believe Bishop Barron there is no evidence to what you claim about sexuality.  This is about the failure of Vigano, Benedict and sadly St John Paul to treat sins as crimes just as they would had priests stolen from the Church.  Vigano has excommunicated himself.<|endoftext|>
