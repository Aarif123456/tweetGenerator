<|startoftext|>@JJGass @greg_doucette I agree but as I say, something doesn't have to be illegal to be wildly inappropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJGass @greg_doucette Surely it falls into defamation of character? Either way, something doesn't have to be illegal to be inappropriate I suppose it just comes down to tact at the end of the day. Is this why Americans still think using "retard" as an insult is still acceptable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJGass @greg_doucette I appreciate there was more to Musk's case but there's still a big difference between an insult and a slur.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JJGass @greg_doucette I know Elon Musk got off after he was sued for a similar situation but it was enough to get him a few days in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_doucette I just didn't want you to get sued is all. Would you be ok calling one of your politicians a "murderer" or a "rapist"? Calling someone a name is one thing but once that name is a criminal act wouldn't it fall into libel/slander territory?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greg_doucette True. But I bet you wouldn't have called him a Paedo and calling him a nonce is exactly that. Don't get me wrong I despise the man and there's many names I'd happily call him but your close to doing an Elon Musk here and I wager Farage is quite litigious. Just call him a twat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell @jacobsoboroff @jolingkent @mattgutmanABC The image isn't perfect so if it's tricky to read...let me direct your eyes to the half green circle with 1/2 in it.

<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell @jacobsoboroff @jolingkent @mattgutmanABC It says that a ballot was posted out &amp; waiting at the post office to be picked up. So it hasn't been sent or used.

<|startoftext|>@suechadwick999 @Cameron_1993_ @BBCBreakfast Cornwall, whose main income comes from tourism? How's that going to work then? We need a circuit breaker lockdown and we need National parity and guarantees that jobs and homes won't be lost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@suechadwick999 @Cameron_1993_ @BBCBreakfast He's doing it for Manchester provisionally (as he's the Mayor and that's his job) but if the Government concedes they'll have to do so o  a national level.

<|startoftext|>That's why I won't be playing any of his music on my radio show. As a rinky dink community radio DJ I know that's not going to damage him in any way, but maybe if others followed suit then we can make it clear that abuse has no place in any industry. #MuteManson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They got together when she was 18 and he was 36.

<|startoftext|>I know wrestling is ultimately soap opera with muscley people in their pants messing about, but I think this is something to keep an eye on for the future ramifications for other industries within entertainment.  https://t.co/lDV32maGov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The APPG has been formed to look into these matters and the British Wrestling industry as a whole. To see if a Governing body needs to be established and even if it's officially a sport or theatre. Could be a great blueprint for other entertainment industries such as Stand Up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possibly a bit niche or not of interest to the general Yappostle audience but I found this quite interesting. The Speaking Out movement called out improprieties in the British wrestling scene by Promoters &amp; wrestlers. Some discriminatory some accusations of abuse assault etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrestlemepod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisagifford I'd assume the two MP's named on the account share the running of the account itself. Or aides within their respective offices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope this is going to benefit British Wrestling rather than hamper it.

<|startoftext|>@lizzycoe @TimesRadio @AasmahMir @StigAbell @kitmalthouse Apparently that doesn't matter according to my Son's party provider. Families social distance, but the kids can run wild...then return to there families üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod He did a lot for Actors union's (he started Universal Artists) but he was a mucky bugger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HJackRose @DavidEarltweets Bad form. Looks like it was a bad day to ask that question as I think he's deleted his account (or muted/blocked me for asking the question)  https://t.co/kptTbbLuIr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod My "character" on the podcast was a serial killer who reviewed horror films. I say "character" as I've not been caught yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless this is part of a separate "Most Dangerous Game" law. I'm against it...otherwise, the hunt is on!  https://t.co/rCiOD5t7d7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod It was a great podcast if I do say so myself.  https://t.co/abo3SUXNoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod Here's a link to the only 2 episodes of "Food To Watch Films By" still available. I think the subscription ran out or one of the other guys got embarrassed &amp; removed the rest.

<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod Is the Killer Rabbit in anyway connected to the Vampire Rabbit of Newcastle?  https://t.co/1AAqa224kd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod Will do. The podcast is if and when I get an interview so not regular. Although I'm hoping it will be monthly at least once I get some more interviews in the back pocket.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KillerRabbitPod I know what you mean, used to do a podcast a few years back &amp; I'd always say "start with episode 2" as we were just finding our feet to start. Currently I'm more Radio based but have a few podcast episodes out of interviews I've done with Jake Yapp, Alex Lowe &amp; 2 peeps from Host<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Obviously absolutely no worries if not. Just thought that your and @DavidAult's content would be perfect. If so, anything under an hour would suffice...ideally half an hour ish if possible. No need for new content, can be from an old ep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadowsatDoor how do. I was wondering if I could use one of your stories on my radio show "Pablo's Vault of Horror"? It'd be as a plug for the podcast but I also like to play radio friendly ghost stories on the show at the moment and am starting to run out of material.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michaellegge It's almost like the world's gone crazy. How am I, a professional gambler who bets solely on the possibility of world events, supposed to earn my crust? HOW?!? In the 80's this shit was a piece of piss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaellegge Oh yeah. Deffo, I'd bet the house on it if I hadn't already lost it on a similar sure thing three years ago. I'd bet the car but I lost that on a Brexit bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamHappyToast I'd pay money to hear Swan say that in his questioning Australian accent. "Grab 'em by the pussy?"  https://t.co/oo9jhwaQsb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't you got disabled people to murder or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaellegge Obviously this is the straw that broke the camel's back. This time...definitely this one. This one's the nail in the coffin...this one...not that there haven't been others, but this time! Oh boy! This time it's different. Pack your bags Trumpo, you're off...for definite this time  https://t.co/aMHYBtXhGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace Maybe he cut his face off with those thumb knives and that's what was underneath?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotTodayPod We still haven't got Avocados up north yet. We only just got Parsley last August...and that was just down to the popularity of the new show on TyneTees.  https://t.co/OCt5gphsKg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think there's a route to do so. But the companies may have to pay for the privilege if they're found to not yield results(?). Which would be the case if any care provider show appropriate levels of caution. Purposefully done by the government so they can blame the care sector.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst I appreciate that testing at the point of displaying symptoms makes sense. We are out going house to house, shop to shop meeting up to 4 different clients a day. Putting us at a high risk of potentially contracting and infecting "high risk" people. It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I work in outreach support for people with Learning Disabilities and we have to wear a mask at work now at all times. Whether in an indoor (helping around the client's house) or outdoor (accessing local community). But we still can't get tests without 1st displaying symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanNorthridge It doesn't work if you share a name with a really famous person though. Only real drawback to an otherwise flawless PMA mantra. üòÑ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blacksheeplad @carolecadwalla You'd think so. But they've left that little caveat in so companies are scared that if they make sure everyone is tested regularly and found free and clear. Then they might have to pay for those tests. I can't really blame the providers. It's a purposeful tactic by the Government<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@i124nk8 Think I watched most of them and it was a decent stab at it (though still not Scouse!). Think he's a regular on Legends of Tomorrow but haven't really watched that.

<|startoftext|>@i124nk8 The issue for me is that they're too different. An Occult John Wick or a concept like that (which is sort of what it is) could be done on it's own merit without being linked to an existing property. Because of that film it meant a more faithful version couldn't come to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanSPeterson It looked like an EXTREME sport so only EXTREME cowardice can combat such an EXTREME experience. Then I think I have to drink a load of energy drinks or something.  https://t.co/z0A6SSlVg6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i124nk8 A bit like World War Z. I LOVE the book and quite like the film, but there's no real reason why that film should be tied to the book. It should've gone with the general "zombie" concept and have been done as a completely separate project. Same with Consantine. Just do spooky a PI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i124nk8 Constantine's a tricky one for me. As it isn't that bad a film (first time Director too) but being a fan of the Hellblazer comic they really didn't do justice to the character or the source material.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@awarmann @90minfilmfest For a moment I was thinking "Public Enemies" and "Apocalypse" were the only Superman/Batman animated movies. "World's Finest" totally slipped my mind. Time to revisit it methinks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awarmann @90minfilmfest Great list. I'd forgotten about "world's finest". That is an excellent animated movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awarmann @90minfilmfest Would you class the Superman/Batman films as  in that list? I think Public Enemies is pretty darn cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awarmann @90minfilmfest Yay! Hope you do, I think it's very underrated and I'd put it on a par with "Batman of the Future Return of the Joker".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@awarmann @90minfilmfest Yeah, I know the relevance of using this story with the reader vote back in '88. I just think repurposing an existing cartoon movie and putting it out as new, but with a gimmick and a few extra scenes, is a bit cheeky. They don't even reference it in the ad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like for those using TikTok in the US, time is running out (bet nobody else in the world thought of that one...well, other than anybody with a basic grasp of language and puns anyway) #TickTockTikTok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To clarify, I love Batman Under the Red Hood and think it doesn't get the credit it deserves. I even think Joe Demaggio does a pretty good Joker. It just irks me that they haven't done the whole thing as new content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awarmann How do, sorry to bother you but I know you're a fan of DC's Animated output from your appearance on @90minfilmfest (great ep BTW). What do you think of this‚¨áÔ∏è? I think it's a great idea, albeit it a bit gimmicky, but feel it's a bit off of them recycling old work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they've repackaged "Batman: Red Hood" with some added extras and are putting it out as a "new" interactive story "Batman: Death In The Family"? I like the idea but when the majority of it is just recycled content it's a bit cheeky isn't it?  #Batman #DC  https://t.co/rds6DPldhW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why's everyone been sleeping on "Tag"? I just watched it yesterday &amp; it's better than most of the generic comedies that are churned out these days.

<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens I think they'd just give you a quizzical look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens Admittedly I have no interest in sport what so ever and I can appreciate that any change could be upsetting for fans of a particular club taking such steps. Ultimately though, they're all just games right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens I think any move by any organisation that's taken or used another cultures identity or symbolism to make a profit to address that is a positive one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens However well intentioned the naming and logo was originally I think it's a good move if they're rebounding now. That and I don't think you can have positive culture appropriation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens I'm sure that if there was a team called "The Rochdale Rabis" which had nothing to do with Judaism it'd be much the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens Ultimately if the team themselves want to change it. It's down to them, whether you see it as over the top or not it's being done with the right intentions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dogs_Dad @ExeterChiefs @Saracens Whilst not necessarily racist like the "Washington Red Skins" it is cultural appropriation. As for the Saracens, I think that technically is racist as it was a term Europeans coined for Arab/Muslim people during the Crusades. Although I'm no historian so not be 100% on that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBhoyPrime Thanks for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBhoyPrime No, I grew up with Henson, but was aware of that guy getting fired in 2017. The guy they had replace him still sounded like Kermit though. Maybe he just had a cold today or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrashFan03 @CraigShitpeas I don't know. Has he had some of vocal chord transplant recently? Because he didn't sound right at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigShitpeas I just don't get it. A decent Kermit impression is usually in the repertoire of even thr most basic of impressionists. I know the Kermit guy got fired a few years ago, but his replacement still sounded like Kermit.  https://t.co/ssakyi67Hk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dr_Giallo have you seen "Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girlie"(1969)? Think it was just called "Girlie" in the US. Superbly weird film.  https://t.co/glJbraeblg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pat_galloway @Dr_Giallo @FrancineKirschn Well obviously they aren't interchangeable. But there weren't many films that dealt with that sort of subject matter at the time. I wasn't around then but from what I've read there's potential merit for the theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metallicageek @Dr_Giallo I might just watch it again now after all this. It'll be for the millionth time...but I do love it so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kushner_the @Dr_Giallo @FrancineKirschn It's one of Scorsese's favourite films. I'm paraphrasing but he says something along the lines of "Everything you need to know about film making, is in Peeping Tom"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiviasHunter District 9 all the way. Love the other two (that I've seen) but if I had to watch one of the three right now. It's District 9.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pat_galloway @Dr_Giallo @FrancineKirschn I'm not sure. If the release dates were reversed, it could all have been very different. I think Peeping Tom prepped the cultural zeitgeist so the public were ready for Psycho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancineKirschn @Dr_Giallo Especially as they're so (technically) similar. I often wonder if it would have been different if Pyscho came out first and Peeping Tom second. Powell was a well respected Director but didn't really do horror, just think of the horror films he could have made!  https://t.co/SLz80MGXlp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiviasHunter Ashamed to say it...but I still haven't watched Blade Runner 2049.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingGary I'd never considered it before,.but was the Hardcore belt a busted up version of another title? Possibly the European title? Or was that still about then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancineKirschn @Dr_Giallo Peeping Tom was released first and it was mauled by the critics for its subject matter and pretty much ended Michael Powell's career in the UK. Then Psycho came out  and everyone praised it and Hitchcock. Very sad, as Peeping Tom is legitimately one of the best films ever made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hjaltshul @TFeatherlord @EmmaKennedy Yes to the first part but Kubrick actually hated it as he'd never seen the Tonight Show (as he lived in England at the time) so didn't get the reference. He actually wanted to remove it but was convinced otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew Clem Fandango went on to be in Star Trek Discovery, but I missed this first time round...although that's probably down to the fact she hadn't been in Star Wars at that point.  https://t.co/d8jFXbXhfd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@i_am_mill_i_am "Yes, it's a tricky one..." he said whilst looking wistfully out the window. He turned his head in the young Lieutenant's direction with a smile creeping across his face"...I suppose you could call it a Catch 22 situation"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yup, that's about right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulDPeters44 @antovolk @FreddyInSpace Exactly. So why pay even more to watch it at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulDPeters44 @antovolk @FreddyInSpace The building, seat, aircon etc. They're all factored into the ticket price, as they aren't a part of home viewing that should be cheaper or equivalent to a normal cinema ticket.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abhorrently_urs His role in Hapiness was understated excellence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great transcription of AOC from earlier. The quicker she's in charge the better for us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intelswitch @FreddyInSpace Which is fine. I can understand them charging a premium initially, but charging more than a cinema ticket to watch it at home is just pure profiteering on their part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to say, Frozen 2 really is the superior film of the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intelswitch @FreddyInSpace All that hinges on "I can afford it, so it's ok". If that price point is at a premium it excludes people who can't.  You're right that charging twice the price to watch something at home is a luxury. But the difinition of luxury is quality with expense. Movies are for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was taking the mick out of something he was on and he was very gracious about it.  https://t.co/ysBOdPIGeE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intelswitch @FreddyInSpace I disagree. Any luxury would be what you've made of your own viewing experience at home, at your own expense. That same reason is why the cinema charge you more. To pay more for less is ultimately just bowing to capitalism.  https://t.co/ZEeYOTmqBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upherises @FreddyInSpace Maybe a Studio subscription service? Pay x amount for whatever films you want to watch in the next 6mths?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upherises @FreddyInSpace I just feel like they're the ones that should be over a barrel but we're the ones that'll be taking it and apparently doing it with a smile on our face and thanking them for the privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace @ThatJoeMeyers Maybe it's just a British thing. We're famously tight fisted.  https://t.co/PxI2fcvpJz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace @ThatJoeMeyers They made the films, they need us to watch them. I just don't see why we should pay more for that. Surely we as consumers should have the power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace @ThatJoeMeyers It's like computer games and DLC. People were against it initially but because others just went along with it, it's now an industry standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatJoeMeyers @FreddyInSpace It's like DLC all over again. People were against it but people paid so it's an industry standard now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatJoeMeyers @FreddyInSpace I appreciate that some will but there's a reason booze costs more in a bar than it does at an off-licence. It's just not justifiable in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badwolfhorror @hoaxeye The link helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antovolk @FreddyInSpace But the price of cinema tickets is based on you watching it n a cinema with all the extras that provides. Without that it should cost less as the overheads aren't there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badwolfhorror @hoaxeye Not at all. I wanted it to be true, just not much to clarify it in your original post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace I just don't see why it should be more at home. They need us to watch them at home due to the lack of people going to the cinema. Why pay more for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRossGeller_ @FreddyInSpace Exactly. That and I don't see how the an international pandemic can give the movie industry the ability to charge us more for less. Surely offering home viewing at a discounted rate would maximise viewing and numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace I appreciate that. But most people outside of the industry will not be willing to pay more to watch a movie at home. Unless they own it outright<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deep_Cut_Films @FreddyInSpace As is the case with the rental market<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace I can't see people going for that. Why pay more for having it at home. It's like a takeaway vs a restaurant meal. That and torrents etc will mean it'll push more people to get films illegally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace They need to work on the price point. The Scoob movie s ¬£16 on VOD. It can't be comparable to cinema prices as part of that payment is for the building, seats etc.<|endoftext|>
