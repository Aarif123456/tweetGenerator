<|startoftext|>@shyamanuja @itnext_ @AnandGenx @reflect10ns Thanks for a very insightful discussion. Interesting indeed .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shubhlime Perhaps that the only practical use case all org are trying hand on. Blame it on lack of skills and will to experiment beyond std frameworks @itnext_ @cioandleader #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RGiridhar @itnext_ @cioandleader tech skills is primarily. Only few frameworks offer easy deployment of technology, faster and more agile #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shubhlime @ChampMeetali @AnandGenx @reflect10ns Yes it does and depends on 2 factors a) risk appetite of top management to embrace new technology b) maturity of user base to accept it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itnext_ @AnandGenx @ChampMeetali @reflect10ns Org openness to utilize open source platform to be used owing to current relationship with proprietory companies #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itnext_ @AnandGenx @ChampMeetali @reflect10ns Couple of one's, while org eye for enhancing user experience , user on other hand might get overwhelmed by multiple platform interactions leading to dilusion . #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RGiridhar @cioandleader Most use cases are for proprietory. @Microsoft seems to be having a good framework in place #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shyamanuja @ChampMeetali @AnandGenx @reflect10ns @Microsoft chatbot framework #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shyamanuja @itnext_ @cioandleader in our case it was other way round : by building up a business use  case for #ai and doing a small proof of concept and then demonstrating it to top management #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shyamanuja @ChampMeetali @reflect10ns @itnext_ @archie_jackson @ashokjade @keydesai @chandreshd @farhan0110 @AnandGenx In some organization it is connected to bottom line. Top-line revenue models Ard embedding #AI will require time/ maturity to evolve. #AIandbeyond<|endoftext|>
