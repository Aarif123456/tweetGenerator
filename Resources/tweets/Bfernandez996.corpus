<|startoftext|>The actions that happened yesterday at @MomijiSeattle is plain out disgusting. During a time like #BlackLivesMatter someone still decides to swoop low to say the #Nword.

<|startoftext|>She then takes out her phone on camera mode. She kept side eyeing me to see if I was paying attention, jokes on her I had my sunglasses on the whole time and decided to put her phone away. As it was my turn I finally said my first word to the cashier; this is the funny part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also another person (won‚Äôt mention race) felt and looked very uncomfortable. She deliberately wouldn‚Äôt let me put my food down until she was able to move forward more. She also purposely pushed all of her fresh produce furtherest away. That‚Äôs not all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BENBALLER I‚Äôm laying in bed with my lady &amp; we are worried about the same shit. A lot of people are fucking arrogant to think this is a joke. Look at Seattle, 2 weeks ago everything was fine. A month ago Italy was worried about pasta shortage, now they are on lockdown. Ben has solid points.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BENBALLER To answer your question though you‚Äôd need to have Verizon home WiFi to access hotspots; kind of like what xfinity does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BENBALLER Only if you get unlimited data which I have. Comes in clutch for when I‚Äôm out in the field meeting prospects; use my iPhone to connect to my laptop. However, using it a lot does slow your data speed after 15gb of usuage.<|endoftext|>
