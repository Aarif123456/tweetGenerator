<|startoftext|>@AlufKwabenaBey @Fresh_Flames1 I would agree if there were such a thing as a Global "Baseball" League. He's talking about the "Business" Leagues and how many AfAms focus their businesses on the small market size of AfAms and not the World<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackGirlsCode Hope to finally meet you if I'm in the area<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackenterprise Why would readers confuse Negro League with baseball? Is there a Global League of baseball I haven't heard about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackenterprise What he's saying is that so many AfAms will sell themselves short  saying "My target market is AfAms", when they should say "My target market is the world". Most new AfAm business plan to sell only to the Negro League, not the Global League<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackenterprise Why limit your market when you do not have to<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cspanwj I am always surprised that the hate narrative against AfAm sustains and now international, even after 300 years, even tho the evidence does not support the narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cspanwj Too many AfAms when they get a job have to be over qualified. Myself and others needed a Master's degree for jobs that require Assoc degree.  And we were paid less!<|endoftext|>
