<|startoftext|>@Todaysopinionis @MrStephenHowson And before you say, why have the children if you can‚Äôt afford? Individual circumstances change, not everyone is a scrounger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Todaysopinionis @MrStephenHowson No, an individual wage doesn‚Äôt increase during holidays, but that adds to the point around the difficulty to budget whether you‚Äôre in employment or not. Those in the bottom 20% do not have the disposable income to be able to budget for this additional cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Todaysopinionis @MrStephenHowson That is the point. It‚Äôs the same universal static amount each month wherever you live. So, when your child is at home, you now need to make a choice between feeding them and another necessary expense.<|endoftext|>
