<|startoftext|>@TheRealLoriJ @JBarnha32410807 @no_silenced Well I haven't as it happens, but even those prats who were saying 'not my president' and objecting a bit were a long way from actively conspiring to overturn the democratic result.

<|startoftext|>So what's that #moron #trump fucked up today?  I haven't looked at the news, but I just know he'll have done something bloody #stupid, like he does every other day.  #Trump2020  #POTUS is a #plonker #phewwhataloony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP Noel's career then. Right now there are plenty of tossers who probably think he's being cool, but give it a couple of months and things will look very different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones @ashopson @LASDHQ At first glance, but if you look closely, particularly at the bottom of the frame, you'll see that the original is moving too and slightly follows the shooter.   So this probably WAS planned, the poster almost certainly knew the original cameraman and by extension the shooter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peter_vanwychen @perlmutations Neither China nor US made #COVID19; nature did that.  #China dealt with it effectively, but #Trump's idiotic response has done far more harm than good, to his own people!  Still, he's put US right at the top of another list; I guess you're proud of that hey?  Moron!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Smart_Reads Jolly good show that!  Looks like I'll be sharing a novel or two with the original actually, (allbeit in a slightly different reality) and that awkward sod Joe Whitworth too, worst luck. Though knocking around with Her Ladyship makes up for it!  So what are you writing then eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth That's a very impressive high-tech poking stick; a joy to wield and should last!  I used to have a very precious stick-of-poking (as opposed to a ~levering ~twatting etc). I had it 20yrs until a mate used it as fuel while I wasn't looking. It had burned a bit short by then mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zombie_JDM43 Stepping a little outside your own body of work there Jim?  Personally I'll "... hide 'neath the wings, of the bluebird as she sings...."  .....and hope tommorow's six o'clock alarm never does ring.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don't worry Donny-boy; keep doing what you're doing and you'll soon put America right back at the top of the rankings again.  That'll teach China for trying to steal your thunder eh!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CAPAction Well he does have a thing about putting America first, doesn't he ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Oddly enough I was commenting on that to Young Marcus just the other day.  I think #COVID19 gives the world something REAL to worry about for a change, &amp; nobody to hate and point fingers at. Compared to death, other issues seem a bit less important.  A maturing experience maybe?<|endoftext|>

Though of course he's not accept the medal as that would be unfairly elitist. Can't celebrate just cos you won can you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TennysonViterbi @PhillipTkm421 @ThisIsGwyneth Gosh! Been off a few hours and missed all the excitement here!   So he's down on the Welsh eh? Probably doesn't like the Scots either at a guess; no wonder the SNP did do well if Labour is full of his sort!  Socialism used to be about tolerance and inclusiveness didn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth What's the Friday thing suddenly? Do you mean that "harrassing someone on the left" would be allright on a Wednesday, or at the weekend? Golly, I'll bear that I'm mind.  And your macho, mysogonistic view of women is far more of a trump-voting, bullying, right-wing thing you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth No she didn't, I checked!  Besides; our nation is "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" which hasn't an equivalent of Australia day, and even if it did it wouldn't be St George's, as that's just England' saint.  Now go and wash your thumbs with soap and water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth Did I? Gosh! I don't think so Sir, but have it your own way if you wish!  Please clarify for me btw; you say you "get women" &amp; imply that makes you superior to me in that I "don't get laid". By that I assume you believe "getting laid" is the only way you consider women valuable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth What an illogical person you are. YOU began by butting insults into a conversation, then went banging on and on about St George for some reason (who neither Tennyson nor Gwyneth had even mentioned). As for "spreading lies"; I'm not the one bandying "incel" about now, am I?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth Also what's "alt right" got to do with anything? Makes no sense to me!  On my new-fangled laptop thingy it seems to mean "insert tab" (I tested it on Word just to be sure) but somehow I suspect that may not be what you have in mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth Golly Sir! Ain't you the big man!  No, I'll stick to "white knighting" thank you; if that's what you call sticking up for victims of ignorant, intolerant, small-minded trolls with no manners, who don't get ladies so butt into their conversations &amp; bully them online instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipTkm421 @TennysonViterbi @ThisIsGwyneth Gosh, how rude! You, Sir, appear to be both a Cad and a Bounder, and if I ever heard you talk to a lady in that manner inside somewhere.....well..... I should jolly well have to ask you to step outside it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Fair point, and he's a jolly good chap (though don't tell him I said so eh!), but it seems of late that he's maybe not quite as fictional as he used to be. ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Gosh!  I do love to see a picture of a gorgeous girl first thing in the morning!

I mean all the pushing and shoving, feet stood on, a fortune for the last turkey in Tesco and not getting what you set out for anyway<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#God that #DonaldTrump fellow truly is an #idiot   Even #America at its #redneck worst doesn't deserve a #MoronPresident like him !  I haven't heard of any particular new idiocy today, but I'm sure he hasn't got any better since yesterday. Besides, I just felt like saying it.  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Planet_Simon @Chimeraish Gosh, mine feels remarkably like that already, but personally I'd go for a very last scene where they all fall down a big canyon that suddenly opens up in front of them, while I sit in a bar on the far side, raise a G+T to them and have a quiet chuckle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pat_be001 @TennysonViterbi @marcustbrook I should jolly well think so, I do it all the time!  Mind you, I told the truth once but nobody believed me.  Exactly what is my age anyway? Do 130 years frozen in an Antarctic glacier count or not? If I was "alive" all the time I'll be owed a bus pass and whole load of back pay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Yes Gwyneth, definitely yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one thing I most dislike about that idiot #MarkCarney's latest speech is that it forces me to agree with that other idiot #jacobreesmogg for once.  Give it up the pair of you, my sense of personal integrity won't stand much more of this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Tosh, of course they were real!  Shows what can be done if you throw an infinite amount of money about; a pricey solution you didn't need, that leaves you wishing you'd not bothered.  Mind you; doesn't forgive the "first men" rubbish. Everybody knows that was Cavor dash it all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Golly, that #Trump chappie is a #nincompoop and no mistake!   I haven't heard of anything particular he's done today, but an idiot doesn't stop being an #idiot just because I haven't heard the news so I thought it needed saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zombie_JDM43 Good choices Jimbo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth @mvmsdazza @TiffanyChamp7 Not without freezing your.... toes off (toes Barrington, always say toes) that's for certain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth It has advantages, but its not all rosy.  Just yesterday I really fancied a pie and a pint in the pub but Marcus gave me camel's milk and a bowl of sheep's eyes in rice. And made me eat it! All just because "the scene's set in Arabia"!  "Artistic necessity" pah! Is that fair?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth One huge advantage of being fictional; I have adventures all over the world, which I enjoy, without having to pack, which I hate. Oddly enough it saves on going to the lavatory too, apart from that time in Jakarta that young Marcus felt obliged to describe in excruciating detail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Life, all things being equal, is what you make it ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth Never be afraid to close the book and put it firmly back on the shelf,  so you can concentrate properly on the new one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CambConsultants @wintonsauto @Forbes @greenhouseai @ForbesTech I bloody well hope not!  Apart from the carnage on the roads, the whole idea is de-humanizing.  Try watching Pixar's "Wall-e" and, if that lifestyle seems appealing to you, please live it within the bounds of your own habitation module and leave the real world to us real humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth That's really sweet if you Gwyneth, thank you in return!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zombie_JDM43 Gosh, sorry to hear that old chap!  I suggest you send her to bed with a thick duvet, a hot water bottle, and a jolly strong hot toddy, and please pass on my best wishes for a fast recovery.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth That's certainly true, but I was thinking more of the acquisition of a cushy billett for life under false pretenses. I mean, put the boot on the other foot and it would be called something else.....  .... 'rape' for instance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crassusmedia Going to be a series, six at least.  Yes I've got visions of graphic novels, but don't know any good artists who'll be prepared to speculate their time.   I'm just putting snippetts here for the feedback, with a view to publishing initially on kindle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crassusmedia Why thank you again!  I'm working on a series of memoires covering my time with Her Ladyship in the age of Flyornclads.  "A tale of courage and risk; of secrets and spies; and a desparate war fought in secret, beneath the waves, and above the clouds."  Think it will go down well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crassusmedia Why thank you sir! Do you mean the tweets, the artwork, or the writing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth @marcustbrook Are all Mexicans like that then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isambardogen can be pretty hairy stuff at times. Why d'you think the lift-tanks are wrought iron? Wouldn't fly otherwise would it!  Duh!  https://t.co/ISStv4yjGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcustbrook @ThisIsGwyneth Well? Go on then, explain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth @marcustbrook Sounds like a very bad idea; I remember those 'propulsions' and I assure you they'd be better behind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? We haven't even got America back yet? Someone has been sleeping on the job! Surprised Vicky didn't sort them out years ago! #steampunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HNTurtledove @realDonaldTrump 200 words? That's more than I expected. Has a long history of exageraring his numbers doesn't he!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcustbrook @ThisIsGwyneth What's so funny? I got the chewy prize out of the bottle didn't I?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth @marcustbrook He told me that too, but for some reason he was a bit upset when I filled up the tank on his Audi with water. Honestly, I was just trying to help; I wonder why I bother some times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2MtBottles @ThisIsGwyneth @marcustbrook Oh its just my nephiew Marcus banging on about his "modern technology" again. He keeps trying to 'educate' me, but until he shows me how the gears work in his "laptop" I'm not about to take anything on faith.  Anyhow, I'm happy with steam power. What's wrong with that I ask you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsGwyneth @marcustbrook That's how Marcus described jet propulsion. We'd been out for Mexican, with several of those beers with the bit of fruit in, and that stuff with the chewy thing in the bottle (I got that! Marcus laughed for some reason.) I can confirm the effect was continuous, and lasted days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to put my date-of-birth into this thing, but it won't go before 1897. For heavens sake is nothing made properly today? #steampunk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Daren_J_Lahey Agreed! Though come to think about it, some of thebstuff was about before I left. Thin end of the wedge I'll warrant, maybe we'd better go back a bit further to be on the safe side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daren_J_Lahey Too right, something's gone seriously wrong with the future hasn't it! Where are the steam engines, the dirigibles, and how come nobody seems to wear a top hat anymore?

<|startoftext|>@Daren_J_Lahey Hmmm.... not sure its going to be big enough but worth a try. As for mentioning it, well, if it was the price of getting home I'd walk round Trafalgar square naked again. Really must do something about the rotating doodad though or it'll shake itself to bits.

<|startoftext|>@Daren_J_Lahey If I knew that I'd be a lot smarter than I am, but I can see where it fits so that'll have to do. Do you have a ruby rod or two anywhere about your person? Dare I? I'm a bit concerned about the rotating doodad ; buckled on landing. I'd hit it with a hammer if I can find one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Daren_J_Lahey Well I can't say you don't have a point there sir. But do you know where to get the parts? I think I spotted a couple of bits in the Science Museum, but the curator looked at me a bit funny when I tried to lever the display case open so I'll have to get them another time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mecantyping Actually I'm not even remotely afraid of guns; wouldn't have been a very effective Royal Marine if I was, would I?

<|startoftext|>@mecantyping Just don't KILL as the first recourse you tit.  Jealousy no! The rest of the world thinks you're spoiled brats. Rich brats, and childishly naive so worth flattering for a handout or two, but no less spoiled brats for all that. Nobody /admires/ America, but you're useful at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gosh! I just found out its #internationalginandtonicday. Have Indian tonic and lemon ready, but which #gin should I start with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mecantyping Threatening isn't the same. Very few people will just kill, most knife wounds aren't fatal anyway, but a point-blank gunshot to the chest, such as your hero probably delivered, almost always is. They say a nation is known by its heros. No wonder the world despairs of America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mecantyping So the guy pulled a gun and, rather than threaten or wound the robber, killed him, and you think thats ok? For all anyone knew he may have been desparate to feed his family, but his kids will never see him again. Do you really consider death a fair price for a few lousy dollars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@According2Robyn @PrinceJvstin Why thank you Robyn, I'll add you to my CV ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@According2Robyn @PrinceJvstin You're not doing too badly.

<|startoftext|>No I am not obsessed with #steampunk . I have been known to unfurl a sail and use the wind on occasion. Its just MACHINES that need steam!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zombie_JDM43 They do seem jolly good in some ways I must say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mecantyping You say you carry a gun: if its not to defend yourself from a crime you aren't afraid of,  you must intend to commit one! I merely point out that, in the event someone wants to assault or rob me or mine, I don't feel the need to big myself up like Dirty Harry to deal with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello? Helloooo? Anybody there? Blast! Is this thing even working? #amwriting #writing #steampunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mecantyping I don't need to hide behind a gun, especially in a nation where very few attackers are likely to have one. I'm no coward to shoot from a distance like you, if attacked I step forward, look the assailant in the eye and lay my own hands on them.  I have done.  Have you, big man?<|endoftext|>
