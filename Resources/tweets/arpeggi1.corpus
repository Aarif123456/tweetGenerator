<|startoftext|>@doctorwhogeek13 @BorisJohnson I’m in Salford and it has been high but it’s dropped loads, hospital admissions down too which is the important part. How long did we get out of lockdown? About 10 days in July 🤬🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger Pondering Jorginho - JWP? Any stars for the later for me please :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Swe Is it cancelo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 over achieved expectations at 81! C - Jota magic! +8 for Taylor who made it off the bench for Jorginho. Will wait to hear about Salah as late as poss this week before considering a free transfer. Would like to roll if poss. OR 182,991, wow!! #GW9 #FPLCommunity  https://t.co/hJcvbm5BeW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GW9, Rule 1 was no knee jerks! I made it 9 weeks without making a middle of the night not fully thought out transfer. Jiminez ↪️Jesus, then -4 Saiss ↪️ Cresswell. Transfers were made early so had to hold Salah! Only available bench player was Dallas 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Jurgen on a -4, so I had to bench Salah. Going into the week only had Dallas available on bench. Captain Jota magic! Totally overachieved this week on 81, got lucky with Taylor’s 8 points in for Jorginho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taylor being first on bench with a flag, gained me +8 with Jorginho not playing. 81 points FAR exceeded my expectations his week #GW9 #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Steve should think about WHY he’s staring at children in skirts and thinking about their knickers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Jurgen Yassss me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMancUK @Geordie2004 @brian_weegie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger @OfficialFPL Historically I’ve made some terrible drunk decisions 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger @OfficialFPL I promised no knee jerks this season, this was the first and hopefully only! I did jimi to Jesus at daft o’clock after a beer 🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger @OfficialFPL KDB has the fixtures but not the form, I’d go Salah and keep a eye it’s a easy swap to KDB if he starts firing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger @OfficialFPL Looking good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger @OfficialFPL OR currently at 184,669 😵😵 I’ve definitely peaked! +5 for Dallas in for Jorginho  https://t.co/wnZwtMnsSB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrgarethbrooks That is a BIG coat lad #northern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Banger 😂😂😂 you asked for it haha I’m straight into number 2 in your league aswell get in! Totally peaked this week I have haha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drgarethroberts I didn’t think the tories could shock me any further.... then they go and release this. The pressure on emergency services will be insane! The public will go Beserk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL__Raptor I have overachieved my expectations this week! Used transfers too early!! -4 then had to hold Salah. 78 total! 5 from Dallas who’ll come in for Jorginho my only player on the bench available!  https://t.co/G2LYpY4j8T<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also couldn’t decide C this week was tempted by Son but talked self out of it when he played full 90 in the cup game. So when in doubt C salah. My gut said Bruno but my gut has proven unreliable in the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GW3 team, made 2 FT this week as planned. Auba and Soucek out, Foden and Bruno in. Also took a -4 following Egan’s red direct swap to James. Justified hit, but I just be careful with then this season got hit happy after restart and spoilt my run. #FPL #GW3  https://t.co/NtX20DldSW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>GW2, 73 points all in. Really pleased with that. Especially made up I held son and didn’t knee jerk to Rashy! 3 hat tricks in 2 game weeks is a record for me in FPL onto next week. 2 FT and 0.5 ITB to play with #FPL #GW2 #PeakedTooSoon  https://t.co/toHFIkQnEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>73 points all in for GW1 decent start. Long way to go, annoyed I switched James out but that’s FPL life. Plan to roll transfer till next week so not expecting to score too highly in GW2 #FPLCommunity #FPl #GW1 #TheUnbearables  https://t.co/jV276xYdQO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StefEPoh Designed by fans apaz 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20BnHAndABrew @BuckAngel Yes!! This is exactly it. It’s not trans people, it’s men abusing the T label and that’s detrimental to women &amp; transwomen alike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20BnHAndABrew @BuckAngel Best at putting my thoughts into words. But my point was women and girls can’t identify out of these things they happen because their sex is female. So if sex becomes irrelevant and penises can be female then how do we protect women and girls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20BnHAndABrew @BuckAngel I think anything related to sex based oppression is related to trans debate atm. As we are no longer just being kind and inclusive, we are being asked to believe that men can physically change their sex (not gender) And are truly women in every sense of the word. I’m not the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20BnHAndABrew @BuckAngel It’s about so much more than who we sleep with.1000s of women+ girls are put through things they can’t identify out of FGM, banished from communities for having periods,l. I could go on. Call yourself what you like, wear what you like. But a human being can not change sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20BnHAndABrew @BuckAngel It is a dick. If a man identifies as a women we are supposed to believe his dick is suddenly and magically a female dick 🤬😳 and to say otherwise is “bigoted” and transphobic (it isn’t transphobic to state biological facts!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of these things is not like the other..... penises are not female genitalia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@7jyaaron @BigmanFpl @OfficialFPL I pretty much am, for now at least 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7jyaaron @BigmanFpl @OfficialFPL in my opinion saving at least 1 mil to allow for price changes and rolling 2 transfers rather than take a points hit or wild card so early in the season is preferable. I don’t have auba in my current draft, but it’ll change 100 time’s before season starts anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigmanFpl @FPL_JACK_ He’s defo someone I’m considering, played full 90 mins in both preseason games so far<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@7jyaaron @BigmanFpl @OfficialFPL Not Necessarily for United / city players but to get a sense of how Chelsea will set up with ziyench, Werner and spurs set up, I’m not convinced by Bruno so many of his points came from penalty’s so he’s another watch and wait. Satisfied with my plan (for now 🤣)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@codnoobftw1 @OfficialFPL Always get blank game weeks in the season though. It’s a strategy game 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigmanFpl @OfficialFPL Yes i also have 2.5 ITB and saving till GW3 it’s the only way forward<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FPLFanatix I’ve had him in and out a few times  already 🤣 let’s see if he makes the final cut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPLFanatix After GW1 is what’s putting me off him at the minute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying not to think about FPL for at least a week! So here’s a pic of 2 of my cats Optimus prime and batman #CatsOfTwitter #blackandwhitecats  https://t.co/QDimIVLNA0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Anon @TheEyeTestFPL thanks mate, food for thought. My defence is looking a bit shaky especially if Doherty is potentially not going to get the mins in 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vsrsus @Sanchooo10 @NandosUK @nikefootball @susiep1981 @yin_yan1 it’s not even a joke 😂🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEyeTestFPL @FPL_Anon Who would go for instead up to 7.5 ? I’ve currently got him but more as a place holder and 1.5 ITB,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FplMode @FPLDuck Seems to be the favoured LB for now at least last couple games but who the feck knows with pep !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FplMode @FPLDuck More interested in cancelo at 5.5 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner You can also just set it as a song from your music library 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPLGOAT7 Current draft! It changes daily 😂😂 Kane is mostly there for a money holder can easily become a city / united player  https://t.co/DlUkak5JiA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCRunner unfortunately it is very true. Makes my stomach turn 😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see if these calm me down then @Scouse_ma says I won’t want to batter everyone anymore 😂 #CBD #gummybears  https://t.co/Gaxz51T92m<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Plans to rape a baby, gets 4 years in prison. What the fuck is that?? lock him up forever and chop his balls off with a rusty spoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fpl_sam_ I’m going with Kane and auba for first two weeks, then with 2 FT do either auba - son / KDB / Bruno and Kane - martial / vardy. Definitely don’t want to be using my chips too early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlitzFpl Spurs have favourable fixtures, I’ve never picked him for my team but am considering for first time ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>on my list of things not to do 1. Rage transfers, 2. Hits, whilst some of them did pay off last season once the games resumed I panicked loads and got hit happy. This saw me finish 4th in mimi league when I was 1st going into the Covid induced break<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Really hope we keep gini. He’s the sort of player most only notice when he doesn’t play, but if you watch him he’s quick he’s clever. Yes he scores more for Holland but he plays a different role / position there. #LFC #wijnaldum #fuckoffbarca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashMcB88 Also the English game is superb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb And cut a small but few cut near the rod and pulled it out my self cleaned it and steri stripped it, all those extra hormones! And they put me on citalopram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb God is forgotten the implant got so bad with the bleeding and the hormones I was constantly crying anxious horrific, they gave me the pill on top of the rod?? Supposedly to stop the bleeding?? Refused to take it out till 6 months, I ended up getting so desperate I used a scalpel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb Had a power point presentation prepared the lot 😂😂😂 so I was pleasantly surprised. All those years of pain and distress though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb Northwest england , Liverpool, Manchester, and then Salford health eventually it was the dr at Salford royal who was like yep yep no probs! I’ll put you in the list. I was in an out in 10 mins, pre op same day blood tests etc I’d gone with the idea it’s be a fight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb This wasn’t one GP either it was at least 4 in 3 different cities over a period of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb ) age 37 I was referred by my GP. Once at the gynaecologist she didn’t even question me about reasons, just said yes we can do that no problem. GPS shouldn’t be gatekeepers to women’s wombs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pi_Kira_Chu @Telibarb I asked for 15 + years but because was single kept getting told no. I might change my mind. So I had to try all the reversible stuff. Implant, both types of coil, pills. Years of daily bleeding, pain and hormone induced meltdowns. Finally (and only because all the others failed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Swe My latest draft 😀  https://t.co/tHY1Uyhru8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GlenS378 @FplMode I just changed my goose from a 5.5 meaning I had the extra to get Ings in. Definitely makes better sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FplMode Fixtures *<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoyGeorge I’ve seen it on dvd it so bizarre!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FplMode Lallana and Willian are on my watch list atm depends on pre season and fixtures now for me! Got my 3 locked in for season barring injuries. Now wait for fistirez for further decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StJohnHandclap @YNWAlfcnews_ 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fpl_Sledge I’ve gone for Patricio at same price, purely because he served me well last season. Pope was my other consideration definitely set and forget, gets a lot of bonus points aswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard_Lyd31 @anfieldste @HughWoozencroft Peps biggest failure! Not winning the CL. Especially with all the money they’ve thrown at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just want to watch this and laugh all day 🤣🤣 hahah @sterling7 🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peps biggest failure,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Saw Maggie the milk snatcher trending, little panic! But don’t worry she’s still dead #MargaretThatcher #StillDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TescoTierney_3 @utdjordon It doesn’t you get unlimited transfers until 90 mins before KO on GW1. All depends on your strategy for me there’s certain players I’ll keep all season barring injury so can lock them in now. Good to get a look at prices and players new FPL positions too, loads have changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First transfer completed @OfficialFPL wonder how many of this super early draft will make it to GW1 #FPLCommunity #fpllaunch #earlypick #theunbearables  https://t.co/y2VtsELtXP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So much for this announcement about Manchester lockdown! or is it going to be dropped on twitter at midnight again @MattHancock @AndyBurnhamGM #manchesterlockdown #useless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiveMeSpace3 @JasonGood It really. Is like I could travel to another city and go to bars and restaurants but I can’t sit in my friends garden down the road 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGood @GiveMeSpace3 I stand corrected. Apologies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGood @GiveMeSpace3 Only in Manchester though, which is my point really. If they’re going to impose restrictions when needed then they need to be proper. For example Aberdeen residents aren’t allowed to travel further than 5 miles. No such restriction here 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGood @GiveMeSpace3 I’m not legally prohibited from leaving Manchester,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGood @GiveMeSpace3 By there I meant the city, there’s no rules to stop me. I’m not saying I’m going to do it, but the rules are illogical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiveMeSpace3 it’s stupid I live in manc, but I can’t have my family from Liverpool round but it’s perfectly fine for me to go there or anywhere else I please? Makes little / no sense!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And they wonder why women aren’t believed. This is why, blaming a women because she “deserved the slap” is pure misogynistic abuse #IStandWithJKRowling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyStemSell @Spunjji @betsvigi9 @JonathanPKT @jk_rowling blocked me before I could even reply 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onelastread @betsvigi9 @Spunjji @JonathanPKT @jk_rowling Exactly this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@betsvigi9 @Spunjji @JonathanPKT @jk_rowling I’ve been involved in this debate for a few years now. In my experience it hasn’t been genuine trans people who just want to live their lives giving out abuse. It’s horrific violent misogynistic men abusing the T label &amp; these same men that make TW and natal women feel unsafe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even going to look at the scums front page. Whether you agree with JK or not the stream of vile misogynistic abuse she’s receiving is disgraceful and sickening. #dontbuythesun #IStandWithJKRowling #insolidarity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulBlack5 @officialbarnesy oh I totally agree with you, been saying this myself. Tory’s have never and will never give a shit about anyone who isn’t in the elite classes. Us Scousers know exactly what they’re like and what devastation they cause. it’s ok lad 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBlack5 @officialbarnesy I know he is an opportunist c*!t that’s what I mean about it being a messed up world when I’m finding my self agreeing with him. I fully understand who and what he is. Also I’m a woman 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoelHarrison94 @AngeKDouglas @LordSadio Yes, he got greedy and that made it dangerous for all. “I am the one who knocks”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoelHarrison94 @AngeKDouglas @LordSadio This is the thing about good tv, so many different perspectives. I’ve watched it through a couple of times and notice different things about the characters every time. It’s good to have a discussion like this :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoelHarrison94 @AngeKDouglas @LordSadio Protecting the kids isnt about keeping the family together. It’s about keeping them safe. People broke in her house multiple times, tried to burn it down. Of course told remove the kids from that situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngeKDouglas @CoelHarrison94 @LordSadio I’m a feminist myself, hence why I’d rather not describe the violence against a women x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngeKDouglas @CoelHarrison94 @LordSadio she hated him for it in the end though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngeKDouglas @CoelHarrison94 @LordSadio I think she was basically abused and trapped for a long time. She was a desperate women, trying to protect her kids. The Marilyn scene and the kitchen scene made me feel more uncomfortable than any of the bloody violence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@prh304 @mathewhbenham @adlynch @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika I have been for the last 3 weeks. Not comfortable at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adlynch @shanbomb @markydh @Pumpkinz16 @mathewhbenham @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika No that’s fair. It just seems like an incredible amount of money on top of the 26k they already get for office costs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanbomb @adlynch @markydh @Pumpkinz16 @mathewhbenham @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika Especially when they already get 26k a year for office costs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanbomb @adlynch @markydh @Pumpkinz16 @mathewhbenham @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika It still doesn’t cost 10k for equipment. Yes people need stuff to work. But I’m not having in this technological age that they didn’t already have laptops / a tablet and WiFi af home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jpick2012 @Pumpkinz16 @adlynch @mathewhbenham @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika I don’t see how not having 10k renders a office useless. It does not cost 10k for laptops / WiFi / electricity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticoMatt @TVKev @adlynch @mathewhbenham @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika The money could be used better elsewhere. No way it costs 10k per MP to set up WiFi and a laptop (and I’m not having it they don’t have WiFi at home already!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adlynch @markydh @Pumpkinz16 @mathewhbenham @TVKev @wesstreeting @ayeshahazarika I’m sure majority of MPS have laptops and WiFi in their homes. whilst our nurses / doctors / bus drivers are dying due to lack of PPE. It’s morally and ethically wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Brettreece1 @Roadwarrior29 @gigiglasgo @JacobiteJen It isn’t.

<|startoftext|>@Roadwarrior29 @gigiglasgo @JacobiteJen The issue with gloves is if the virus is on them it is then passed on to any other item touched with the gloves.

<|startoftext|>@blueyonder1974 Whatever gets you through a night shift I say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker @FFPundits I keep benching martial then mahrez then back again 😂 50/50 on Laporte starting apparently he’s fatigued but bench options to cover not bad so I’ll wing it on that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wildcard played this week. Egan to cover sheff defence, still toying with mahrez or not? @Fantasy_Plonker @FFPundits #fpl #wildcard #GW25  https://t.co/aqMJOOqJVA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker Martial or grealish?? On verge of flipping a coin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker from the horses mouth so to speak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_nobbs @FFPundits Perez is a better option check his recent returns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Maddison is a excellent player but not a good FPL pointsnscore look at his last 4 returns. Perez takes penaltys and his returns in last 4 much higher than mads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Maddison - Perez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker @OfficialFPL @FFPundits I had 6 mil in the bank somehow!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>would love to see @TranmereRovers get a win today! used to go a lot in my late teens. Mainly to see aldo in the players lounge mind 😃 #TRAMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faycebuk joker, or if specifically 2020 knives out is excellent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redgirl2019 I just said that aswell, if that was anfield there would easily be 100 people wanting each individual seat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fantastic service from the @DWP phone line. A mere 45 minutes to get through, and then met with the response “how longs a piece of string?” When enquiring about a timescale for a claimant started TWELVE weeks ago 🤬 #sarcasm #disgrace #DWP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClydeMisfit @BBCPolitics @OwenJones84 @bbclaurak Basically yup.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Knew wolves would give us a game tonight, hendo has been incredible surely no one can criticise him anymore?? good win #lfc #hendo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Realaldo474 Si senor 😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mv_jenkins mad how people still doubt klopp! Look at Fabinho, learnt at Melwood the team ethos and style before getting more and more game. Before cementing his place and now being the best defensive midfielder we’ve had in years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCAlexBlack @LFC Love that top! I’m just in the red tonight 👊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL  https://t.co/BBcU1hOwJ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henrywinter @premierleague Totally agree, I rarely get to go to games anymore due to finances. I always feel for the fans on a Tuesday night doing 150 miles or more! Boxing Day was another PRIME example 8pm KO in Leicester from Liverpool wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuncanCastles @TransferPodcast @garbosj @ManUtd @LFC @premierleague Never scored the easy ones 😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleIsla @ralirali Get a baseball bat / rounders bat but Make sure you have the ball to go with it. If it comes down to it an hour had to use it you can say it was just to hand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker No minutes in last 2 prem games, though, did do well in the cup. 🤞🤞 for a good week overall #FPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bradley43837907 @FFPundits 2 but bench Reid for the lfc game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Fallout He wouldn’t score at anfield this week anyway tbf I’d have benched him anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XSManchester Photocopier, I may or may not have lost my temper at yet another paper jam though 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smtm__LFC75 @endgame1968 My gramps passed 2 years yesterday too. I was the same dad rang at 630am an the first thing I said was “granddads died hasn’t he” weird!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElmMcO @juniperbury Same as my niece too! She had some you could j defat and as a toddler then nothing. Phonics and the use of picture boards helped her hugely<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElmMcO Yes my niece, eventually when she was 5!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LFCynwa04 I am groot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smtm__LFC75 Necos defo one for the future, learning from Trent can see it already in his game he’s going to be boss. Think we’ll be seeing a lot more of him next season in cup games etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shrewsweb @LFC hey Shrewsbury!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPLmeta @MJHarfoush @OfficialFPL I know that, however it’s no coincidence that having Gomez back has finally given lfc clean sheets. He defo won’t be dropped against utd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPLmeta @MJHarfoush @OfficialFPL Gomez isn’t getting dropped anytime soon,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exfatalist I thought stop, drop and roll would be more of a thing. But hurtling towards 40 I’m yet to set myself on fire!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Firmino<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fantasy_Plonker I’ve had vvd, mane , taa for a while, gone mane - KDB and rashford - firmino. Away form for bobby is outstanding. captain for me this week aswell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LucyRimmer5 @irishredlaa I get it, I’ve been a few away games and the travelling kop are immense! Out sing any home crowd anywhere, that energy bounces onto the pitch. Ofc we would all love to go every game but for the majority it’s neigh on impossible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@felo_besozzi @FFPundits More likely to get a return off grealish than a ev clean sheet imo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FPLneerd @CyphKodakBlack1 Gomez will keep his starting place no question. It’s no coincidence we keep clean sheets with him and vvd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Being extra productive today with my volunteer role @FiLiA_charity searching for grant applications. Excited to see what we can achieve this year #filia #charity #volunteering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for technicality it has to be mo v Spurs, defenders left lying in his wake. But for sheer audacity and cementing history corner taken quickly TAA to origi..., what a night that was #YNWA #GoalOfTheDecade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>amazing to see women’s football finally getting more exposure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if it’s that tight the goal should be given, it’s far too forensic and taking the joy out of the game. Sick of the phrase clear and obvious as it clearly and obviously means jack shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThatRexGuy I think crashing the air traffic website that time was immense too 😂 scouse twitter is the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldPress Worst - borini Best - A Becker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Turner_LFC I wasn’t really referring to the cost more then absurdity of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love @SarahMillican75 she has me crying laughing every time. Best female comedian since the ledgend Victoria wood #comedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Turner_LFC Ricky lambert to replace Suarez was worse 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VAR is terrible, but it’s terrible for all teams! #varout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaydenHewitt @Mr_Jimbob @espn Agree, if any part of the forwards body is inside then the goa should stand imo all this little toe offside is nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jimbob @HaydenHewitt @espn Cheers jim, everyone’s in the same boat with these close calls. For me the length of time decisions take is the worst! Celebrate , dont celebrate wtf am I doing 😂 there’s definitely no conspiracy though we are just that good this season!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StanleyHouseLFC Nah am norrarsed that game was a shit game every utd player on the floor injured. That’s all they’ll be able to celebrate come May whilst we are swimming in silverware<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Squeaky bum time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anfield_road96 I think klopps been priming him for a role change. The whole team isn’t the heavy metal football of 2 years ago, we’ve evolved and become more intelligent as a team IMO anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anfield_road96 More central position today. Job of a striker rather than a winger,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikesonkofans @ArditiMadrid @OfficialFPL this week was pure luck for me!  I’ve had some shocking weeks wrong captain choices etc watching MOTD and following tip accounts on here helps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mv_jenkins VAR is getting ridiculous, if it’s a armpit or nostril offside let it go all those wasted minutes spoiling the game. Clear and obvious 🙄😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@limerance Just listen to that noise 😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r_hjoel @ArditiMadrid @OfficialFPL lucky week! 56 so far 4 playing today 🤞🤞<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jimbob As does firmino<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jimbob VAR is ruining football, it wasn’t brought in for such tiny decisions. They keep repeating clear and obvious and then deciding a armpit was offside 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbencorrie @Mr_Jimbob I’ve blocked some of our “fans” when they start saying stupid shit like klopp out 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Ssshhhh stop telling everyone 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL @CalvertLewin14 Brought him in 3 weeks ago 🙌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbencorrie @Mr_Jimbob I regularly block on here, love a bit of banter with rival fans but some are just out to troll. Some of the kids need to realise real life isn’t fifa, criticising managers for team selection etc like they could do better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker @LFC Football didn’t start in 1992 Gary, we already have 18 league titles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPL_Tekkz I think mane will be rested today at least for the first half<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbencorrie @Mr_Jimbob they’re the ones who only started supporting last 5 years. divvys kicking off on twitter from their mums spare room never been a game on thier life. FIFA’s the closest they’ve got to actually playing 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FiLiA_charity @Mizmog How do you pre book the talks please as I’ve just seen on FB one I wanted to attend is sold out TIA x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at the agenda for @FiLiA_charity this weekend and I’m going to need a time turner! So many amazing interesting talks to go to. Spoilt for choice @Mizmog #filia #feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dralangrayson @Judyannne and that’s what needs to change, this whole boys clothes, girls toys etc show kids role models like Bowie an boy George who don’t fit gender norms, but also aren’t trying to be something they’re not. Infact erase gender “norms” altogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsjillgardner @IronHeaver Couldn’t agree more I actually said pretty much the same at work today I hated when my boobs grew, I hated my weird female body an wanted to be like my friend and brothers. I’m so glad it was never suggested to me I was really a boy. You grow into your mind and body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judyannne I know it doesn’t change the fact some people genuinely have dysporia. But what got me was that not one person in Max’s family said to him it’s ok for boys to like pink / dresses etc I think it was a bit one dimensional and wanted it to be so much more if that makes sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At school the girls in my year fought hard to wear trousers it didn’t suddenly mean we were all boys we just wanted the option of trousers. boys can wear skirts, girls can wear trousers #butterfly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@O2 no phone signal for 24 hours in Salford but the online status checker says no issues is it up to date?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>International breaks are just shit. #truestory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KVDK97 What about mr reliable? Milner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allthingsFoust @robjessel . Just today a man was resentenced to a Male prison as whilst claiming to be trans and moved to a women’s prison he sexually assaulted women and said he used his trans ID to get closer to women. So it does happen naive to think otherwise it’s not about transwomen it’s about men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoebe_Greggor @hacksolot @MetroUK But this is the point of the consultation and gender critical people trying to start a dialogue. The new GRA proposal will allow a man to declare himself a woman at any time without any social transition medical intervention etc so it will come down to a feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK thanks for the advert yesterday the public need to be made aware of the proposed changes to the GRA #ChooseReality #thinkaboutit #Handsoffmyrights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ahumanfemale I was treated the same as my brothers, we were all brought up to respect elders, to be independent, we all broke the rules at times an we all received the same kind of punishments. What is this girl hood they speak of? Is it the film version of a girl pillow fights and make up??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2_SecondComing Probably the same ones who were moaning about hendo and Sturridge starting before a ball had even been kicked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2_SecondComing So if you watch the thing he does celebrate the goal and then chucks the bottle in relief coz he was pissed with himself he thought his error had cost us the win. Just whiny little nob Ed’s but not necessarily people I follow as it shows tweets liked by followers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2_SecondComing I’ve seen a few saying he’s selfish and should’ve passed to mane in spurs game, and then since last night going on because he threw his bottle after bobby scored saying he thinks he’s bigger than the team an pissed off coz he didn’t get the winner. Only they cropped the video,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these bellends ripping salah will be wanking thereselves silly when he scores next. Social media is vile at times. Making issues when there isn’t any<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzyl I wasn’t there, I was 7 vividly remember the ambulance on the pitch, how the city was never the same again and how we fought tooth an nail for the truth now we await the justice ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzyl Yes it’s haunted me for years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrgarethbrooks Try @smtm_LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I was at anfield tonight! My first ever match day experience was a European night against PSG age about 13! #memories #lfc #ynwa #ucl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>please can people have a go at filling in this consultation, for your mothers, sisters, daughters, wives #womenmatter #handsoffmyrights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntergalacticQ He could say he went on it because he heard she was on it 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeChels Should be close  one if youse us an city  keeps form<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenormalone011 oh I know am to think few seasons ago I’d have happily took him at LFC mind this was when we relying on borini upfront!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mizmog I really like the Liverpool gk pink one, are we allowed to like pink though? 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to PSG Tuesday, my 1st time at anfield age 13 ish was a PSG game under the lights @Robbie9Fowler scored from the spot it was magic #footballmad #ucl #lfc #1sthomegame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PilgrimTucker 🙄🙄 of course they do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telibarb @symmo1969 @lizzieMendes3 @boxofbudgies @EVAWuk I’ve had to mute him cannot bear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>reckon our defence will keep spurs out today, more fancy footwork from Allison and a nice 3 points #lfc #ynwa #premierleagueisback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwelsh1987 Anyone can be a sperm donor takes a proper man to be a father<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telibarb @lizzieMendes3 @symmo1969 @boxofbudgies @EVAWuk Yes! I know kids play dr nurses etc we all did it. But this whole scenario is just sinister, kids exposed to violent porn at younger and younger ages I worry for both girls and boys thinking that’s normal sex. Also the teachers response is frightening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EMACo_O @TheRedmenTV Same the shame 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiverpoolFF Your ma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvertonianJamie @Lee_D_J @JHenderson @trentaa98 She be ok for 20 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikolaDesigns87 @symmo1969 @jolowicz @boxofbudgies @EVAWuk Well said, here’s a huge difference between playing dr an nurse and hurting another child sexually. As I said earlier kids are exposed to porn at younger and younger ages. The whole thing is wrong on so many levels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 @boxofbudgies @MJ__xl @jolowicz @EVAWuk It really is typical Male behaviour across ALL societies, and yes we know not all men, but all women have at least one story of sexual assault, violent behaviour from a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helen_Wood86 Eyes from heaven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 @EVAWuk I see your point, but the young girl is clearly distressed. Also kids aren’t as innocent as they were when I was one these days. Too easy to access porn etc on many devices, it certainly shouldn’t be happening in a school yard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 @EVAWuk Rape doesn’t just have to invole a penis, it’s any unwanted penetration fingers, objects etc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sonicdeb @SCJohnston again that’s what the media want you to think, being on benefits is nothing like the papers and tv shows want you to think.

<|startoftext|>@sonicdeb @SCJohnston if I’m homeless and am in a b&amp;b accom with only a microwave I can’t use a hob so ready meals or beans tinned soups are the only option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeChels Seems I was wrong so wrong 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmic3 @sonicdeb You have no idea. You try living on 70 per fortnight pay your gas elec water food bills and see what you have left don’t buy into poverty porn on ch5 making out people on benefits are all piss pots with big screen tellies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCJohnston @sonicdeb It might not be nutritious but it often cheaper when you can’t afford the electric to cook a meal from scratch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoryGreenfield @limerance It’s his mental fitness that needs to stay tip top too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAnfieldTalk Throwing his toys again is he?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vegan_Apfit  https://t.co/OpyUgDTLpC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegan_Apfit  https://t.co/2v9iWlWHsd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegan_Apfit You obviously don’t know anything about palliative end of life care. When life support is withdrawn it can take minutes, hours or even days for the person to pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegan_Apfit No one is killing Alfie except his illness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomRog1621 @RoyalFamily Alfie can’t be saved it’s tragic but he is in the final stages of his life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeWill24 Tom gave a statement asking people to stand down and go back to thier lives and give the family the privacy they need so Alfie can go with dignity. Reality has set in and they now realise he is dying and want to spend time with him quietly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taykerwin Have you watched Friday night dinner?? It’s HILARIOUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jimbob Front left, though I usually put the pan on the left one and turn the right one on an come back 10 mins later to stone cold food still and a glowing hob 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsMacAvoy Bullshit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samanthajanexc and you’re basing that on what? Medics dramas? The drs worldwide are basing it on medical tests his brain has eroded so much it’s mainly water and cerebral fluid. What you’re seeing is just muscle spasms it’s tragic but true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@counterpower5 @nomepatterson It’s only the machine keeping him alive and even taking him to Italy wouldn’t have done anything all the drs said treatment is futile even the Italian ones all they will have done is palliative end of life care which is what he’s getting at alder hey #ImWithAlderHey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To ALL Alderhey staff from volunteers to the CEO I’m sorry for what the minority have put you through recently you are NOT murderers, you’re all amazing #ImWithAlderHey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Treatment is futile. It stopped being about Alfie’s rights long ago and is just a media circus now. Standing round in your pjs drinking ale isn’t helping anyone go home and let Alfie go with some dignity and his family around him #imwithalderhey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GarBreeninhoLfc Not forgetting bobby! Real work horse and gets better every week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThoseScouseLads OMG you all need to calm down we’ve won the last 3 without him. Held on an fought for a win in circumstances a couple of months back would’ve seen us collapse and lose 3-1 give the other lads the respect they deserve we aren’t a one man team<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@R_Keane00 @AkoiPharoe @GraemeKelly1 You’re all blaming klopp a selection. If mane had scored you wouldn’t be. Watch the re run it was never a penalty anyway he barged into Lovren an then fell down<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>line up out, all the moaning gets are out to! Klopp knows what he’s doing so shut it and get behind the team #lfcvefc #derbyday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnfieldPress keep him till summer, but we will be fine without him Keita coming in and the rest of the squad is ace. More important to keep bobby IMO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MamaMoose_Be @GMcycling also why are you having a go at me? All I started off saying was I'd never get on my bike without a helmet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaMoose_Be @GMcycling and the studies that "prove" no helmet are small and controlled groups. There is no proof either way actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaMoose_Be @GMcycling yes and people survived without anaesthesia at one stage. It's my opinion based on what I've seen Injury wise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BikeCommuter2 @GMcycling @GMPRadcliffe  https://t.co/mdmlN02owK this is a good one with further links and opinions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaMoose_Be @GMcycling I'm not victim blaming. But why take unnecessary risk to yourself? I'd rather not end up with bad concussion thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMcycling I cycle everday all weathers. I've slipped on ice an banged my head not always drivers at fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMcycling yes I see what dangerous driving does. But it just makes sense to protect yourself. You can't predict what may happen on the road<|endoftext|>
