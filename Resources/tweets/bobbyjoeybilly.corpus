<|startoftext|>@ShaunaBurbary @MISenate @GovWhitmer So why not shut those businesses down if it's not enough? Like you said, requiring those employees to wear PPE will seriously strain resources to healthcare workers. Either everyone fights over PPE, or all businesses can adapt like the ones open already have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaunaBurbary @MISenate @GovWhitmer Then hospitals are screwed, bc I haven't seen one grocer, convenience store attendant, anyone "essential" (other than first responders) wearing PPE. If that's going to be enforced, there's going to be a massive shortage on top of whatever shortage we already have.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FaceTheNation @amyklobuchar @realDonaldTrump So what's her plan, let millions of illegals in then give massive amnesty? Rinse and repeat every decade or so? We need structural changes to immigration. No Dem has proposed that, other than decriminalizing border crossings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A #TaxCut for the middle class to offset #tariffs is a great idea. Tariffs won't always be there.
