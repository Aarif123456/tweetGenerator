<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats I was supposed to go to this game and ended up not. Glad I didn’t cause the Preds lost and my perfect record of them winning when I attend a game would’ve been foiled<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LET’S. GO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>freakin’ nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IN. LOVE. 😍🥵 #ReverseRetro @PredsNHL   Thanks @NSHLockerRoom for getting this shipped so quick, I was impressed! Go #Preds!  https://t.co/blisaU3wQ6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPredsFan I think the stache makes him play better 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sara_jean16 Pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobDeveral @TSN_Sports @BrdgstoneArena I am glad to die on this hill with every other Predators fan. That was highway robbery at its finest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sissons scored. I will die on this hill.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom @PredsNHL Ugh right before payday tomorrow 🥴😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govertime I’ve had my iPhone since February and I’ve been happy with it. It operates much smoother and faster than any if my Androids<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indisputable Fact  Soda tastes better from the fountain than from a bottle or can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarDown Chris Neil hits Chris Drury up high, line brawl and Emery vs Biron follows and Lindy Ruff almost knocks the glass over between the benches  I also played between periods for this game 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrancisM2H @NHL @NHLdotcom Rinne has also been eliminated by Arizona in the past...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all dogging her for only kicking a squibber to the 35 (which is kind of the point of a squib) yet she can do something like this.  I want to see Sarah nail a field goal to quiet the insecure men on here<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>this tweet is a roller coaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmUltimatePred @joerexrode Garuantee I probably couldn’t kick a squib more than 20 yards myself in that situation. Most of these Twitter warriors probably can’t either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brittanyyyyyh Wings should not be dipped in ranch or bleu cheese.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wings shall not be dipped in ranch or bleu cheese.  Don’t dip your wings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom @PredsNHL @BrdgstoneArena Assuming jerseys aren’t included?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerexrode @IAmUltimatePred I never played college but I played soccer for three years at the varsity level and there’s a stark difference between kicking a soccer ball and football...  Really wish she had the chance to kick a FG so all the insecure Twitter men could become even more insecure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarDown Now it’s definitely Filip Forsberg and Colton Sissons  Growing up, Ryan Callahan and ah, Sean Avery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice  https://t.co/O3ESrhIE7W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BehrendSpeedway Watkins Glen’s turn 1 creates some fun moments, definitely would be a good one to have.  The Boot too.  Side note, why won’t NASCAR run The Boot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom 30% off eh?!  https://t.co/Tnnew6VHFH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andlalune The only way the NHL can come back in January is if they do the bubble again (have some sort of rotation). I highly doubt we’ll see fans allowed back until the vaccine is able to be distributed. Of course, don’t think anyone wants to play it safe at this point 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinandJuuse @FlyersPuckSauce Probably Sissons. Solid bottom six forward that can play top six minutes as well. Not very good at faceoffs though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>INDY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will never not be awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fantasy team thanks the best RB in the NFL for coming up clutch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Niceigami<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFL_Scorigami Nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do they know something we don’t? 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Nashville’s future and I’m excited for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fellas, look out for each other. Don’t be afraid to discuss any problem you might have because society thinks you’re weak. Society expects so much out of us and sometimes we hit that breaking point.  Check on your boys. Make sure they’re doing okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The replies to this are just disappointing. Men’s mental health among anything is not taken seriously enough and that’s why our suicide rates are higher.  We’re supposed to have it all together and reality is, we don’t. And it’s disappointing that society expects us to be perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean I’ll just buy more guns with that money but I’m also an essential worker so idk how you expect me to stay home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tavares91 The Leafs one is just nice because it was the Predators that beat them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully we’ll be seeing more of this come January 🤞🏻 #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am for sure going to Watkins Glen now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinbbradford Might need to watch the highlights tonight since I have nothing better to do<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom @PredsNHL Forsberg 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olivia_gren I mean if it’s like Eric Church or Luke Combs then I really don’t see what the problem is 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErieOtters Laces 🥵🥵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish trades were as strongly encouraged as college is. The trades are hurting for jobs right now and some will even pay for your vocational training and you get a good paying job out of it.  College isn’t for everyone but the trades should be just as encouraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Oh it definitely is art<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamousGoalHorns Holiday returns at the Canucks goal song too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BringHockeyBack Preds Navy yesssssss thank you guys 👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsNHL @Gnash00 @adidashockey Seeing it on Gnash now makes it look better than I expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats @IAmUltimatePred I’m not either cause the entire fan base would probably have me skinned alive on Broadway but it could have been worse.  You could have been Detroit and gone basic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmUltimatePred @NSHHousecats why does everyone have to hate on Wild Wing though. I hate the Ducks but the Wild Wing jersey is sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don’t see the hate for the Ducks jersey. Wild Wing is freakin’ sick. #ReverseRetro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alemire26 @BringHockeyBack How can you hate Wild Wing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BringHockeyBack Detroit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsNHL Wasn’t even born 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom @PredsNHL @adidashockey Too bad I’m not a season ticket holder, but definitely gonna get one preordered Thursday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom @PredsNHL @adidashockey Do we have to pay full price at pre-order or do we pay when the jerseys come in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats @adidashockey can y’all please just make one minor change for us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andlalune I don’t hate the Preds one as much as I wish they did Navy. Had they gone with the triangle logo, I think the Preds one would’ve been one of the nicer ones.  I’m just happy the Rangers brought back Lady Liberty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Why not navy though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats It’s not the triangle but that logo is hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHLockerRoom When are they available? A Forsberg one is calling my name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waking up to see my undefeated fantasy football season is no more.  https://t.co/8rBhfF80W7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Literally in the middle of no where...  https://t.co/obmS6Bd3I8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHL Had a defender on my back, made a sudden turn to the left to power around another defender and squeezed the shot between the goalie’s shoulder and the crossbar and went bardown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Use that $5M to recreate the Killdozer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats if this is it then sign me up for a Forsberg and Sissons one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats If they switch the Preds logo to the triangle then it’s a yes for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haleynstorer Troopers 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andlalune bold of them to assume the Rangers are going to make it that far in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamVingan If they’re going to have a legit second line they’re going to need him to. In theory, playing with Duchene should be beneficial for both Duchene and Tolvanen...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sheesh guys I didn’t think you’d take a page out of JGR’s book. The worst possible race to start in the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the election didn’t go the way I expected, I will withhold judgement until Biden starts his term. Actions speak louder than words, so I’d like to see if he follows through. I wish him the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gobiden2020_ @FBALLSZNBBY Biden won’t do much better. Not with a Republican controlled Senate especially<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gobiden2020_ @FBALLSZNBBY A course correction with someone who’s been in government for 47 years and hasn’t done jack squat?  Lesser of two evils voting is why we’re in the position we’re at. If people realized just how beneficial third parties would be, there wouldn’t be so much division<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gobiden2020_ @FBALLSZNBBY I’d rather vote for personal freedoms than vote for one of the two “dictatorships”. Both the Dems and Reps have their followers brainwashed and won’t let you think for yourself.  The duopoly is what’s corrupting the country and this is a classic example why. Stay classy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gobiden2020_ @FBALLSZNBBY Not my fault you can’t read between the lines. A lot of us saw it a mile away and don’t be surprised when it happens.  Also, classic to resort to name calling. Not much better than those on the right either. Perhaps I could interest you in Libertarianism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBALLSZNBBY In all honesty even if Biden wins we all know he won’t be president. They’ll render him unfit to serve, force him out, and then Harris steps in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emileyfaithe @ziyatong It certainly is a nice distraction from the circus that’s going on right now😂 At this point I just want a winner announced so we can just move on with our lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emileyfaithe @ziyatong Haha thanks for the quick lesson! Never hurts to learn something new!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emileyfaithe @ziyatong To be fair I haven’t heard of Nunavut but I guess I did alright 🤷😂 I can thank being a hockey fan for knowing the ones I know at least<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andlalune @_carterhart I don’t disagree, I don’t know how you got tagged in this but I certainly don’t disagree.  Just that there’s no point in giving him unwanted attention. Let him be senile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_carterhart @andlalune I mean all I see is people obsessing over a guy who has a different viewpoint. Like sheesh if you don’t like the guy don’t give him attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_carterhart @andlalune Not really cause I don’t pay too much attention to this app but from what I’ve seen in the last few days, y’all are letting him live rent free in your head and giving him the attention he wants.

<|startoftext|>@blazermaniac @WNYAthletics @JHSRedRaiders @OleanHuskies Same situation we had last week with Fred/Jamestown, muddy field at Fredonia led to the game being moved to the turf at Strider<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking back at old Preds highlights make me wish Garry Glitter never did what he did.  Rock and Roll Part 2 was such a hype goal song but his past came back to bite him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaliskes @andlalune @Jorgensen4POTUS The fact that people say there isn’t any other option but look over the third parties is just disappointing.  Sure, they’re not mainstream, but they don’t have a narrative. It’d be nice if they got more attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats She’d be right from where I live.  Ironically enough, she has the same birthday as me.  Thank goodness Kenny Chesney and Steven Tyler also share a birthday so that all hope isn’t lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBALLSZNBBY Co<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOrangeCone Back to the old Chase format with 16 drivers but none of the stages. Bonus points for leading a lap and the most laps. Top 10 gets bonus points (10 for the win, 9 for 2nd, 8 for 3rd, etc) on top of whatever points they get for their finish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Maybe Forsberg? Idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Someone else on the Preds is gonna lose if Arvy doesn’t I guess with the way things are going<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bradm14 @NHL @Skillsy75 Buffalo just seems like a morgue everytime I go (probably correlates to the product on the ice). Amenities could be better too, the common complaint is cramped seating and overcrowded restrooms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@govertime It’ll definitely be interesting to watch him develop through training camp and eventually the regular season. The potential is there, it’s time to see what he’s got. I really hope to see him do well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govertime Tolvanen hasn’t quite been up to the standard in his development, but that comes with playing in the KHL vs North America. I do too think having two talented linemates certainly might be the boost the Preds are looking for out of him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thomas61537783 @Paulintoronto47 @FriedgeHNIC They had a chance to end the game and they didn’t, which led to this call eventually.  Dallas ends the game when they have a prime chance to and this conversation isn’t happening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@finn_passmore @MujtabaMadad @dirtbag_daddi @contribute_ee @CapFriendly If there’s one thing I learned from the Preds’ 2017 run is that you need depth scoring.  No doubt you’ve got talented guys but you need the depth to support it.   Adding Pietrangelo means any depth you do have would have to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finn_passmore @MujtabaMadad @dirtbag_daddi @contribute_ee @CapFriendly The team that lost to Arizona 💀   In fairness I expected it cause the Predators had underachieved in every facet this season and hiring John Hynes was a mistake.  Any sensible Preds fan saw that loss coming.  But at least four guys don’t own 50% of our cap 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finn_passmore @MujtabaMadad @dirtbag_daddi @contribute_ee @CapFriendly They’re proven winners though.  This iteration the Leafs is about as much of a “success” as my own squad is, and news flash, my squad also did not make it out of the qualifiers.  Until the Leafs start winning Cups, having these guys doesn’t mean jack squat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finn_passmore @MujtabaMadad @dirtbag_daddi @contribute_ee @CapFriendly But yet they couldn’t make it out of the qualifiers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeshvs I knew this already, I didn’t need it to be reiterated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Connor_779 Wild to think Forsberg was taken 11th overall and all the Predators had to do was give up Erat and Latta.  Kinda liking how that trade worked out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter I’d rather hope for the first overall pick than have a false sense of hope that the Preds can pull a deep playoff run out of their ass.   Or by some stupid luck, it’ll be Pittsburgh or something that gets the 1st overall<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnderAndreev It’s an award that’s supposed to honor the most well rounded defenseman. Carlson is not a well rounded defenseman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnderAndreev The only reason he’s gotten any recogniztion at all is because he scored more than any other defensemen. His defensive game is no where near the level of anyone else that’s eligible for the Norris this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine thinking John Carlson deserves the Norris when he isn’t even that impactful of a defenseman. Overrated player. #Josi4Norris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordancicchelli Guys gets a fat L for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoahSweet7 Must be not, I was always under the impression that it was against the code and companies chose to ignore it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoahSweet7 Isn’t it against the Flag Code to use the flag for branding and stuff like that though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel like the Preds never replaced him and if he can return to form, I’d ship it #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSNBobMcKenzie Josi for Norris, I hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SissonsScored #Preds  https://t.co/HrdrjlTEFu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govertime It’s just insulting to see the Caps fans say Carlson should win and use goals as their main argument. Yes he scored more goals than Josi but that fact that Josi has been such a valuable part in keeping the Preds afloat, it would be extremely disappointing to see Carlson win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be absolutely criminal if Roman Josi does not win the Norris this year. His overall play is much better than Carlson’s. The Norris isn’t supposed to be a highest scoring d-man trophy. Josi has basically been carrying the Preds on his back. #Josi4Norris #Preds #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilbssmart @HHSbobCotter @ovi8 I’d like whatever your drugs you’re smoking to make such a statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DROYJohnson - The Predators have been inconsistent since their 2017 run - The Colts ruined Andrew Luck’s career - Detroit won’t be good at baseball again until Cabrera’s contract is up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Oh this?  https://t.co/CfrqML5d9j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Now that I think of it I think it was Aberg on that line with Forsberg and Sissons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Wasn’t 9-10-19 a line for the 17 run?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Maybe it’s because they’re high on Vasilevsky and think he’ll last a while, I don’t know. But you don’t want to burn your goalie out and that’s probably what led to them getting swept last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats To think we got Ingram for next to nothing still amazes me. Shame Milwaukee didn’t even get a shot to play their playoffs, easily a contender for the Calder Cup with how good MKE was a whole was this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Exactly. Juuse has every right to that starting spot, he’s by far been the best goalie this year. Hate to see Pekka on the decline but if the Preds want to go deep, definitely gotta have Juuse in net.  I’d even consider keeping Ingram close. Just in case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats I was too. With the way the season was going some sort of change was needed. Hope he keeps starting once the 24 team playoff starts, albeit GMDP wants him to earn that right again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSHHousecats Most of us probably forgot the fact that he started I think the last six games before corona happened?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@81Celly They have meaning but if you were born after those Cups were won - which a majority of fans today weren’t even alive for those - you have no right to use that as an argument. If you’ve seen your team win a Cup then you can use it as an argument.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanLeahy19 @TwoGuysOneCup A suspension is a bit harsh for a first offense, especially since Josi is not one to make a play like this.  Not to mention the repeat offenders like Perry get off light. Perry only got 5 games while Ellis missed 20. The system is broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanLeahy19 @TwoGuysOneCup Chara did the same thing and didn’t get suspended for it. The NHLPA set the max penalty as a $5K fine.   If they’re going to make punishments they’re gonna have to be consistent.  Plus this is Josi’s first offense...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth every penny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwoGuysOneCup Simple. Arvidsson is half Bortuzzo’s size, Bortz took a second shot and that sent Arvy to the IR for an extended period.  Perry instigated, as he’s done his whole career. Josi deserved at least a fine for it but Perry definitely deserved that cross check 🤷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheErich101 Maybe they need both, idk. But like you said, stuff like this will still happen no matter what they do to improve safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheErich101 For the super speedways especially, they need to cut down the horsepower dramatically.  I don’t recall the removal of the restrictor plate, but if they were removed, bring them back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the love of God, please let Newman be okay 😣🙏🏻 That was the most brutal wreck I’ve seen #Daytona500<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbyymmiles That was some sick hand eye coordination 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamVingan They’re going to lose tomorrow and we’ll go right back to this tweet when that happens 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter Shame, I'm starting to like Granlund too.   I'm still puzzled as to why they gave Watson that contract. That's already a regrettable decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NHLonNBCSports YES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostykonecny It really puzzles me. Me personally, I grew up in a Rangers household but I've been a Predators fan since I was 8. I still root for the Rangers, and I have a soft spot for Arizona.  Liking more than one team shouldn't be a "sin"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@501Broadway I'm gonna roll with a no barring a miracle. Hopefully having Sissons back will help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FivePointsVids Sports will no longer be the same. This one stings and it's gonna sting for a long time.  Stop the world, I want to get off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In honor of Craig Smith's game winner, I will be keeping this for the bye week. #CraigNog #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly the little a--hole didn't learn his lesson. Throw the book at him. This is unacceptable.  @NHLPlayerSafety will probably turn away or give him another pat on the wrist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackEichGOAT @tnsteelerfan86 @jjmid04 Bad coaching has what's been holding them back. On paper, yes. Laviolette's ineffectiveness is why they're 6 points out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackEichGOAT @tnsteelerfan86 @jjmid04 Because the Predators have depth, something you need in the playoffs. Jack does it all by himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackEichGOAT @tnsteelerfan86 @jjmid04 Where was Eichel the whole game bud? Dude was a ghost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinbbradford  https://t.co/QBZymgeyxM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another reason why player safety in all sports need to be considered, especially concerning concussions.  Yes, they make millions. They don't ask to have their heads damaged as badly as they are.  It's sad the NFL and NHL don't take it seriously enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't have happened to a better guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1025TheGame Thanks guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okayyy is there somewhere with the @1025TheGame call of Rinne's goal last night?? #Preds #goaliegoal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHL @KendallCoyne @SchoBlue75 So she's got wheels and hops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter @PorthGame I mean one of them probably goes back to MKE if/when Sissons comes off IR.  I love Sissons, heck he's one of my favorites, but Trenin and Blackwell have played phenomenal and deserve to play.  Trade Turris off and have Sissons slide in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2GoodRightNow @FivePointsVids @UrinatingTree I wish I could save this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbyymmiles Really odd to not have Kane on this list. Karlsson, Bergeron, Kopitar, and Chara don't really belong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanVinson99 @govertime @IAmUltimatePred @1025TheGame First SCF win at home in G3, Colton Sissons' Hat Trick in Game 6 vs ANA should be on that list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeekmanRob @HouseStill @AdamVingan Doesn't excuse the fact that he plays cheap and dirty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsandStuff Big yes! Better candidate than any of the available coaches right now.  Plus with a lot of homegrown talent on the Preds roster, he'll be able to better utilize the skillsets that these guys bring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay you play like garbage then all of the sudden pull two big dubs like this? Did y'all wake up finally? #Preds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@501Broadway That 3rd goal by the Sabres lit a fire under their rears. Gotta keep that energy that Forsberg, Johansen, and Jarnkrok brought right after. Sabres killing us in our D Zone too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smh, every coach is about to be fired now. I mean I know #Preds fans want Laviolette gone but please not because of this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinbbradford @PenaltyBoxRadio Do the Predators have the pieces to make a run and they just need better coaching, or could a talent like Hall take them over the top?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Matt Irwin just dropped the gloves, am I seeing things? #Preds #STLvsNSH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Try some @ChickfilA then please retract that statement 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Laviolette gets fired by the Preds and the Preds hire Babcock. Calling it right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cellblock303 Laviolette gone? 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we're not going to talk about @ChaseRiceMusic dropping a remix of "Eyes on You" today and how 🔥 it is? Yes? No?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes it's only preseason, but I can still laugh at the #Sabres for blowing a 4-1 lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter The fact that Salomaki even put the puck in the net period should be applauded. Can't remember the last time he even scored an ENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeannot only needed an assist for a Gordie Howe hatty in a preseason game. That's one way to make a first impression. #Preds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter I was about to add Grimaldi but I'd rather give him another go round before I can make a concrete argument. I bought into the Freddy G hype after the Cup Final and now look at where he is. I don't want the same to happen to Rocco because he's got potential.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abbyymmiles Of every Predators playoff game I've been lucky enough to watch, that certainly was the most painful.  The worst part is that the game was scoreless until I finally turned the TV on in the 3rd.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Only in Nashville 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@501Broadway @NHLonNBCSports Better be tears of joy there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Went out to enjoy some time doing my hobby outside of hockey. After a rough few days, it was nice to get out and do something that makes me happy  https://t.co/28jh2Zq133<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattdracing 5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been a week and my number neighbor hasn't texted me. I feel disincluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TreyMagathan @jessbelmosto I agree that it was due to coaching. You don't take a roster as deep as the Preds and be so inept on special teams.  Hopefully the new assistant that was hired will fix that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian @SwampRabbits The OHL team close to me, the Erie Otters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessbelmosto The Predators would no doubt have won the Cup if their power play wasn't ineffective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Filip Forsberg making defensemen look silly. Beer league too lol  https://t.co/A2zW96XCAI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrinatingTree Detroit giving up their only good bullpen arm and giving up Castellanos. I want to roll into a ball and cry myself to sleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter Donno what else we could go with cause nobody wants the mustsrd jerseys. I was thinking along the lines of the home jersey the Preds used before the switch to gold. Those were my favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter As long as it's Navy Blue I'll be happy. I swear if we get mustard imma riot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yaboiMarkGarcia @UrinatingTree Lolcow for the Preds if they don't manage to get a Cup in the next couple years. Can't really have a legacy of failure yet going into their 21st or 22nd season.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cellblock303 Can you pre-order it online for those of us Preds fans who live out of state?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Matt Duchene's Preds debut and hopefully a much improved power play<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just putting this out there.  Posting TikTok videos doesn't make you cool. #UnpopularOpinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this day in 1996, Captain Steven Hiller helped save the world by taking down the alien invaders.  "We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight!  We’re going to live on! We’re going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapFriendly Would be nice if Gardiner signed on with Nashville for a year. Give Fabbro some cushion so that Fabbro gets another year to gel into a Top 4 defenseman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excuse me no, that's just unfair.   Who am I kidding, that's amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hqsports @ChickfilA Nuggets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darcangel21 @hayyyshayyy Celebrating a goal/touchdown/scoring play is part of the game. We never have this conversation in hockey.  Celebrations shouldn't be an issue. If I score a goal I'm going to celebrate. Easy as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter If you get rid of one problem, then the other won't happen.  But that's too logical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter Pretty sure its been disinfected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik The best part was Alex Morgan sippin' that tea after she scored the go ahead goal #savage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian Save of the tournament right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was definitely a make up call for England. There was no contact there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian This is like the offside reviews in the NHL almost, lol.  I'll gladly take that call though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statsrespecter Shouldn't have let the striker be that open though. That's risky in soccer cause nine times out of ten that's a goal if timed right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericanOutlaws Or naw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrdgstoneArena @TimHortons Hot Chocolate 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ofarrelltalent @atDavidHoffman @todd_keller @realDonaldTrump You can say that all you want but with businesses and companies leaving NY due to high taxes and the fact the governor doesn't care about anything outside of NYC, there's a definite problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atDavidHoffman @todd_keller @realDonaldTrump And NYC unfairly controls NYS politics. NYC needs to be split because what you mooks down there say shouldn't apply to the rest of us that don't live in the city.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinbbradford @statsrespecter @FDBort Foresburg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govertime Fabbro should be paired with Hamhuis at least the first half of the season. I can't see Irwin or Weber playing Top 4 D minutes though so one may have to go to get a stand in.  The bottom six isn't terrible on paper. Just that certain parts need to perform better. Looking @ Turris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLonNBCSports 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbyymmiles I initially wanted a Forsberg jersey for my first adidas jersey, now I think my mind has been changed 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookevillewxguy @TomAWillis @PredsNHL I do follow the Preds on Twitter, I've just been impatient for the announcement all day 2😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I'll have to buy a Duchene jersey now. #Preds #FreeAgentFrenzy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy camoli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomAWillis Delaying the inevitable smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsNHL GIVE US DUCHENE GOSH DANG IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cam_TC13 @FisherJillian I do too. I thought it was going to be more than that. That still leaves cap room too.  How dangerous this team could be if everyone played at full potential...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cam_TC13 @FisherJillian That tweet aged well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbyymmiles Not saying I expect him to carry the team but hopefully it puts the Preds over the top and we can win the Cup finally. That's a scoring touch we've been missing for a while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CEO_Kehoe @501Broadway @Matt9Duchene And you can still run with Sissons and Watson at center if needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredFanFromIA @501Broadway They extended qualifying offers to both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's actually reasonable. GMDP must've had Morgan Wallen at the meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenhll555 @govertime Unless your name is Filip Forsberg or Viktor Arvidsson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cam_TC13 @FisherJillian But yes the chaos would be great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cam_TC13 @FisherJillian I'd rather overpay for Marner than Duchene. Marner is younger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cam_TC13 @FisherJillian I actually would be okay with this. Marner is younger too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear if I don't wake up to a notification that the #Preds signed Duchene I'm going to be very disappointed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nlill @justinbbradford Duchene is a UFA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FisherJillian No salary retention means that we have cap space. Meaning we can give a warm Southern welcome to Matt Duchene.  Now if only we could get rid of Turris that easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HempsteadPeter @goaltending3131 @FriedgeHNIC They have Dante Fabbro to replace him. They'll be fine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OH HECK NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chr1sterfer Because I've followed soccer my entire life. I've played the game. It's insulting when you have people who don't pay any attention to the game and bash it half the time all of the sudden care about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leahflame Kenny Chesney and Steven Tyler<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@usahockey That is some serious sauce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik Stuff like this shouldn't be a political issue imho. If they didn't politicize it, it wouldn't blow up into a big issue.  I could go on about big government but I can't fit it in 160 chatacters 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@olivia_gren A Chick-fil-A in Jamestown would save the drive. Plus then I could work there too 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how when #Preds fans chant "Ref you suck", we're seen as low class and disrespectful. Other teams' fans do it and it's perfectly fine. #STLvsDAL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hqsports The overtime goal for sure. A 3 goal comeback in the 3rd period of Game 7 then the dagger in overtime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't be opposed to it if it means Turris goes.  Keep Grandlund but move him down to the 3rd line and put Sissons on the 2nd.  #Preds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Preds and Pens tonight. Lest we forget. #Preds #Smashville #NSHvsPIT  https://t.co/NyaznCkDeV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we buy a Rubik's cube if it's already solved? Doesn't that defeat the purpose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik I'm just glad you didn't say Chick-fil-A or else I would've been salty 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik I'm with you on Chipotle but Oreos???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chIorinevesseI Where's my Benji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let today, March 13, 2019, be known as the day that the internet was actually broken.  #FacebookDown #instagramdown #WeWillRebuild<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik What has this world come to? 🤦🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cut4 @MLB Johnny Damon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHortons I don't ask for much, but going 0 for 11 on roll up the rim when I go at least 3 times a week is pretty disappointing. Logic says I shouod have won twice by now if I really have a 1 in 6 shot 🤦🏻🤷🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reporterchris @CapFriendly Gearing up for a 2nd Round exit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hqsports DeflateGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay someone here can't be sticking around much longer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisLA14 New York sucks though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik Neither. Reese's &gt; Twix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePeterson335 I'm glad that they do. Cause Pepsi is better than Coke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePeterson335 What, your opinion? Definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePeterson335  https://t.co/SbwpB2TosE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Filbruary! #Preds #Smashville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsNHL finally getting an outdoor game makes my heart happy. 1300 miles from Jamestown to Dallas? Worth every mile. Count me in. #Smashville #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinbbradford Provide me with tickets and I'll do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would rather stand with God and be condemned by the world, then to stand with the world and be condemned by God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EkholmForNorris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten That's an entire mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mattias Ekholm for the Norris. Dude is on another level. #Preds #NSHvsCBJ @PredsNHL #EkholmForNorris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of silence from Alabama and Maple Leafs fans this morning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesss!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Now don't you forget to... Make mistakes, lose your way Get some dirt on your boots Call your mom, write your friends Was that worth it for you? Remember all of them people When your dreams come true Now don't you forget your roots"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PredsNHL You bet!  https://t.co/yeHATwkLhV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sign me to a contract! I'll play! @PredsNHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christian_dolce Finally someone had the courage to say it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten Yay...more injuries 😐🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slowly but surely...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iihf_wjc Starts in almost two weeks and I'm unusually excited for it this year. #IIHF #WorldJuniors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycejackson__3 Dang 😂 That's sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The kid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivalorieG Would be nice to have Subban back for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I didn't have to worry. #Preds #CHIvsNSH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You gotta be joking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!! #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhh. No. Stop. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pekka. Freaking. Rinne. Give the man the Vezina again. #Preds #COLvsNSH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We suffer not because we sinned, but because we are alive."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @BuffaloSabres fans.  You don't want to win the President's Trophy. It's a curse, not a blessing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With a release like this, safe to say Forsberg is the best pure shooter in the @NHL. #Preds  https://t.co/GOjKfCdOIw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten Someone get the Jack, this is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaStinson1979 @brooksbratten If I were 21 I'd probably be pouring a glass of Jack Daniels right now tbh 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten Nearly tripling them in shots and one weak goal is the difference...good gosh that's frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still find it weird the @PredsNHL have the best record in the league but have the most pathetic power play. #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is a sad day.  Rest in Peace Stan Lee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when I walk through fire I won't be burned I'll set my feet upon Your word I know Your love will never fail This I know now Deep down, deep, deep down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olivia_gren We should organize a protest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik Garlic bread is great, don't complain 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad has had Facebook for almost 10 years. He just uploaded a profile picture for the first time. #ProudSon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skillsy75 Good thing I wore my Sissons shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten Definetly hit his stick on the way in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update, the man has a hat trick. Maybe he can gift us Frosties next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wore my Colton Sissons shirt tonight and he has two goals.  Guess I'm lucky. #Preds #Smashville #NSHvsCOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concussions suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get it, y'all are excited abour Christmas.  You forgot about Thanksgiving. Quit skipping Thanksgiving.  #MakeThanksgivingGreatAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THE ABSOLUTE SHADE. THIS IS GENIUS. #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't trust stairs because they're always up to something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My name is Alex Kolstee, I'm 18 years old, and I'm addicted to @ChickfilA Chicken Sandwiches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>15 #Preds players have scored in 10 games. Gosh I can't get over how much depth the Preds have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaitMarieox @peta  https://t.co/6DZ8bEXV6n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't rest 'til I find my rest in You.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is all @UrinatingTree's fault. Guess Rinne isn't too good right now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanWhisner Chick-fil-A blows both of them out of the water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who Tracy Mitrano is but if she thinks I'm going to vote for her in November just because I saw a bunch of her ads on YouTube, she's wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I dare you to move. I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We can never reach tomorrow because it becomes today."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrinatingTree This can only be the work of Spanos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Winnipeg, just wanted to make sure you guys knew that we won't forget May. Y'all are going down tonight. #Preds #Smashville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarioSonicFanXD @UrinatingTree We were already blessed with No Cubs No though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preds opening up the season at home tonight. The @Cellblock303 awakens from its 5 month slumber...#Smashville #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olivia_gren Heck yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CompleteHkyNews Surprised Ekholm is in over Forsberg or Subban. Of course, goal fests everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brooksbratten I almost read that as Frosties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryvofficial Actually I'm from Western New York, don't let my profile picture decieve you ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryvofficial I agree on that. That was not a dive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryvofficial High sticks occur all the time, just a matter of the severity. That was a light grazing if I've seen one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryvofficial The embellishment was questionable, but that high stick was definitely accidental. Fiala was in the process of falling, not much he can do there when he's losing an edge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preds are playing pretty good. Haven't seen them set the pace like this in a while.   Oh yeah, Forsberg and Subban have goals 🔥 #Preds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theatfish @UrinatingTree I cared more for the Hater's Guide for the NHL 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been waiting since May to say these words...  IT'S @PredsNHL HOCKEY TIME! #Smashville #Preds #LetsGoPreds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People thought I was crazy by saying that the Coyotes will make the playoffs.  Then @UrinatingTree goes and picks (or jinxes?) them for the playoffs too. L  Raanta better not be too good right now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait? You thought I would keep trains off of Twitter?  Hah! You thought wrong!  https://t.co/fMKF08uGHo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickelPlate765 @gtrailfan I forgot how to math 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrailfan @NickelPlate765 There were 80 Berkshires built for the NKP though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be nice if @sunyjcc knew the concept of a pencil sharpener. Can't find any on this campus 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please help this man!! He's being deprived!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Super_Jarren @jaronmyers @BlimeyCow So much yes to this! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing the new @NHLFlyers mascot makes me love @Gnash00 even more. Gnash isn't terrifyingly creepy. #smashville @PredsNHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrinatingTree Were we supposed to be surprised? Seems like NE gobbles up players like this all the time 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gosh that could be a lethal regular season line...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skillsy75 @1025TheGame @PredsNHL Haha, glad I was able to listen! Always enjoy listening to you and @PeteWeberSports! Keep up the good work guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So since the @PredsNHL won both games today, and scored 5 in each, do I get two Frosties tomorrow? 🤔   @Wendys What would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care if it's preseason. Hockey is hockey. You bet I'm going to be listening to @1025TheGame for the @PredsNHL preseason opener.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 15 minute rule isn't a thing at JCC and I feel like I've been lied to my whole life. #StudentProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PUBG and Fortnite are both trash. Change my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaronmyers Y'all we need to make this happen. Don't let this man get deprived of God's chicken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HELP THIS MAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrinatingTree The Rangers players could go back to New York for that "rebuild" they're doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurricane Florence is about to hit NC and all these people can think about is whether Bojangles will be open. Glad y'all have your priorities straight. #florence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda sad that football games have to end in ties. Should keep playing until someone scores...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatupdoe_mik It was easier than having to do adult things though 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess Twitter locked out my old account. Needed a fresh start anyway 🙂<|endoftext|>
