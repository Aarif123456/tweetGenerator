<|startoftext|>@NickdeSemlyen Totes agree. Really miss Jackson's films.

<|startoftext|>I'll take it.  https://t.co/5OtDHZx7Sf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer That's fair. Everyone needs to give everyone as much space as possible. If you're walking a dog and there's limited room, probably best to keep it on a short leash until there's more room. If you're a runner, move as far away was possible. Kinda easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Are you blocking runners from getting past? Or being considerate and giving as much space as you can?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I like #Nioh (and #Nioh2) but the grind is real. Each new mission expects you to level up between 5-10 times. I've just killed the main boss in an area which gives less than half the points needed to level up once; this means having to replay missions over and over. Tedious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, I've been hammering Nioh 2, but that's like a 100 hour game... need a break for a bit. I think Animal Crossing works in real time, so I think it probably works to spend a little bit of time on it each day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManCityCouncil I've just found the concierge of the my apartment block removing a lot of items out of the recycling as he'd heard that the council refuse to recycle anything in a batch (even if it says it's recyclable), ie. yoghurt pots. Is this true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost got run over by an ambulance on the cycle home. They looked through me (my illuminous jacket and flashing light) and pulled out in front of me. This happens all the time. I'd hoped Ambulance drivers would be better than other drivers and wouldn't try to kill cyclists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@primevideouk why does your app have misleading titles such as 'Rent or Buy' where some are items are just 'Buy'? Can't you rent or buy *any* film/show? Same with 'Movies from 99p' which include *all* prices above 99p? I.e. any film/TV show ever?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm glad the new Terminator film is getting (at least a little) love. It goes to show that if you don't succeed, try, try, try, try, try again to make more money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark Oh and Happy Birthday!  https://t.co/7fAHa9ikhE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark I hope you got all the clingfilm you ever wanted. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope Rise of Skywalker works on its own, and not just lean too heavily on nostalgia like Force Awakens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaws is absolutely one of the finest damn films ever made. I know the focus is usually on the shark, but there's so many great character interactions and just great writing, acting, cinematography, oh and the score obviously. 🦈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Bloody kids. Hope you had yourselves a good time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Really?! He's amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Ha. I didn't hate it, though I think 'You Were Never Really Here' is a much better film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it probably would have worked better without the 'Joker' tag. I think that character works better as a kinda madcap foil to a super serious Batman - rather than a victim of mental illness and abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caught up with Joker this week. I'm not entirely sure what I thought of it. Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job, but I felt like the film thought it had more to say than it actually does. Mainly... it's just a painful watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer The Exorcist? Forever amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign @redlettermedia I've only seen the 3rd one (it was...  ok). I've heard the 2nd one is terrrrrible. Actually they made prequels! I remember them (the two versions) being equally unwatchable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign @redlettermedia Ha, I watched that yesterday! Did you watch the documentary they mention: Fear of God? Pretty interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually I watched Psycho last night... is that really a horror? Great film but not at all scary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want to go see the new Spider-Man but that means being in a public place where there are people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yes and it's glorious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad @LegionFX is back for a final season. It has more ideas in an episode than other shows have in an entire run. Majorly underappreciated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, it was that awkward situation where it might have been rude to *not* hold it, but still a slight distance. They said: "PLEASE DO NOT HOLD THE DOOR I CAN DO IT." in a loud, annoyed tone. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got asked fairly abruptly to *not* hold a door open for someone in my apartment block.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This week's Game of Thrones was a massive improvement. They're still doing everything they can to kill the fantasy side of the show, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doubledherin @sadydoyle Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign There's been a couple of posts I've seen on FB where people have directly shared 'Tommy Robinson' videos and made out like he's the victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanJolin Oh I hope so.... But that would likely mean they've put up with him for about 10 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanJolin Season 3 with Hearst was so tense. One of the biggest bullies ever put on the screen. Killed me that we didn't really see his comeuppance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can tell my neighbor is a Man Utd fan as the "Yeeeaaah"s I hear align with Utd scoring and just now "OH NOOO" (Liverpool just scored to go to the top of the league).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing people on Facebook speaking of 'Tommy Robinson' as a victim just reminds me why I wanted to leave Warrington so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, *please* keep throwing milkshakes at "Tommy Robinson".  https://t.co/GgGDLAFWIy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished @knockdownmovie on @NetflixUK. It's so encouraging that people like @AOC are smart enough, strong enough, and passionate enough to challenge the establishment and keep fighting for what's right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lukewilletts @computerlovers @Toy_Fight Nice! Love their work. I'm sure you'll be a splendid addition to the team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lukewilletts @computerlovers Where are you off to next, Luke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matty_Wickham @NetflixUK It's a Orwellian sci-fi film with Chris Evans. Really good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawavedesign did you guys get @sftoc tickets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched Snowpiercer on @NetflixUK last night. I've been waiting to watch it since 2014. Did not disappoint!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurableStretch Ha, I quite like American Gods... I'm a few episodes behind though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have folks been watching 'I Think You Should Leave' on @NetflixUK? It's mental and very, very funny.  https://t.co/hagZ2L2Or6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alibakes I'm happy to join.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helloxheather @HannahHaken  https://t.co/lI5GjKk8Uo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeardedGenius Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara Arya is great, and happy for her to kill the big bad, but personally I thought the ending was all too anticlimactic... Felt a bit too easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurableStretch What's the matter with YOU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It was the right move.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Sekiro vs. True Corrupted Monk #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Nah, LOST is still the absolute worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if the Night King was only reaching for his umbrella though? #GameofThrones #BattleOfWinterfell  https://t.co/XCE2hEuH1m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HBO_UK Still squinting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I think of Game of Thrones the more disappointed I get. I need to stop getting emotionally involved in TV shows. I'll still physically fight anyone who claims the LOST ending wasn't the absolute worst thing to ever happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My reaction to *that* Game of Thrones moment was: "Oh fuck off." Serves me right from expecting too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think there's any possible way anyone in Europe is going to avoid #GAMEOFTHRONES spoilers today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just got back from Avengers: Endgame. (No spoilers). I really, really enjoyed it. Inevitably sentimental, but really funny and frequently surprising. The Russo Brothers have done an amazing job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched the Suspiria remake. I really liked it. Strange and unsettling is how I like my horror.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lucyjamesgames @ryanerikp @IrregularDave @tamoorh @GSUniverse I must say tho... FELLOWSHIP 'TIL I DIE, bruh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurableStretch Puppy's tend to melt though and ice-cream just chews up all your shoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn't it have been interesting if in that scene in The Last Jedi where Kylo's AT-ATs all fire on Luke... he's just splatted to bits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrregularDave If anyone watches this and doesn't shout "MORTAL KOMBAT!" then they're already dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyjamesgames @ryanerikp @IrregularDave @tamoorh @GSUniverse I do enjoy the coverage. I tend to be a bit full on with my enthusiasm for Thrones (and LotR!) so this made that feel normal. :thumbs:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booked an IMAX ticket for #AvengersEndgame this weekend. I'm genuinely excited as I loved Infinity War, though it can't possibly live up to the hype, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I managed about 75k on my #brompton today. Surprising comfortable. 👍  https://t.co/MytLyKSUuu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a_rose1983 I've just completed Sekrio for the 2nd time, but I know what you mean. The game asks way too much and I quit a few times (but pretty quickly went back). I do miss being able to team up and p0wn annoying bosses though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hells yeah! Just beat Emma, Isshin Ashina and #Sekiro New Game+. I can probably play something else now. #PS4share  https://t.co/KQyfwbMIMs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bank holiday Thrones! I imagine there's going to be some impatience with this week's episode, but it was definitely the right choice to play it out that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I'm a sucker for punishment, I'm on #Sekiro's final boss on a NG+. Look at this shit.  https://t.co/myoNPoUagn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawavedesign Well played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawavedesign good to see you folks yesterday, hope you're feeling better than I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco meeting a friend at 6 at Victoria, but we'll head over to Blackjack after... 6:10?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Behold the power of #skybroadband. @SkyHelpTeam may I enquire, wtf?  https://t.co/hheftwwwrY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just went for a run and it almost killed me. Don't do it, folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone is thinking of playing Sekiro, this is what it feels like:  https://t.co/yeozcPqTZI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm just going to *deflect* that comment and follow up with a *Ichimonji: Double*.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well fudge me, I've finally beaten #Isshin and become a man. #Sekiro #FinalBoss #PS4share  https://t.co/kb2rRZMB0e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign @racco According to FB yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawavedesign Yeah! 6-10 tomorrow. I'm good from 6?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only the #Isshin fight ended after the first couple of phases, I'd be a badass. #Sekiro   https://t.co/4pvS5gt41c  https://t.co/kW7x9vbDuq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sichiu I got crowned King of Westeros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex Yeah, I baited him over to the edge, ran past (while staying close to the side of the arena) the n ran to the tower. Usually traps him in the corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>:(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign @racco Friday would work for me. When are you moving back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex It took me some time. I think you have to approach from the same angle I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawavedesign Either of you guys heading to Blackjack's open weekend this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new Game of Thrones was GREAT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jondharvey Honestly didn't know that was possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TESOnline I miss playing ESO, please can you provide more hours in the day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'd forgotten the miracle of paying for things with your phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurableStretch Live your own life Charles! Stop copying mine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Dark times indeed. I also can't eat as I haven't brought food. Maybe I can pick at the office fruit delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in work and I've forgotten to bring both my wallet and my headphones. Woe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Good shout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sichiu Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley you certainly know how to bargain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley Bloody developers... always with the excuses. I'll give you until Weds to fix this Tristan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley /adapt-or-die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley What happens when you've retweeted something and then that original tweet is deleted? Does the RT get deleted too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley I've heard it's because if people retweet you and you change the context of the tweet, it could cause problems. I would suggest a RT would only show the original tweet, and then link to tweet itself (the latest version).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley /shrug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tawashley Does this just apply to Twitter? How come you edit the content of pretty much every other social media?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, why the fuck can't you edit tweets yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Manchester #Cyclists, can you recommend a nice non-life threatening route out of or around the city centre? Need ideas of where to head to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sekiro Demon of Hatred (majorly cheesed). Feels good. #PS4share   https://t.co/4pvS5gt41c  https://t.co/J9amyMmTr5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex I just don't think I'm going to be able to win without spending days and days trying and I'm not willing to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex It just annoys me at this point that boss has 4 different sets of moves that are almost relentless and can come from close and at distance and usually in a combo. He only has to hit you once to stagger or one-shot you, but you have to hit him a fucking shit ton...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex *phase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex In 30 attempts I haven't got past past 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex Sorry, 4 phase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex I'm not sure I have the patience to die 100+ times to learn all the moves of a 5 phase fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the new Halloween film. It's not very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First try!  #PS4share   https://t.co/4pvS5gt41c  https://t.co/5fqzwknPZZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Powehi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly don't think I'm capable of beating Sekiro's final boss (Isshin, The Sword Saint) so I'm quitting the game for now. Maybe I'll come back when I have a spare few days (or a week?) to frustrate myself further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FUCK_SLUG ¿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rianjohnson I loved The Last Jedi. If this gets anywhere near it I'll be happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabegundacker That's science, folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Euron Greyjoy is definitely the worst character on HBO's Game of Thrones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bgrey62253 @VirginTrains @CrossCountryUK Ha, I just spotted that. 🤦‍♂️@crosscountryuk ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains Manchester to Bournemouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains On the outside of the train and inside above the seats all and display boards all are turned off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains can you maybe consider putting some info on your trains? Every person boarding has no idea if they're on the right train as all of your displays are turned off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Is Infinity War worth a watch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign God I hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This took about 400000 tries. Was it worth it? No, no it wasn't. #Sekiro #PS4share   https://t.co/4pvS5gt41c  https://t.co/HEzdc9OANs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, fuck Owl, that ponytailed Great Shinobi prick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sekiro is causing me to have a full-on existential gaming crisis. How many hours is acceptable to spend repeatedly trying to take down a boss before you realise none of the effort is worth anything even if you do eventually succeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex Good shout, thanks. Not tried that yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sekiro pros, is there a way to avoid Owl's firecracker swipe? (He's killed me with it about 40 times) #PS4share  https://t.co/vxYbzxJW0U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex Ah, didn't try the oil! I was focusing on deflecting and then using the spear to pull out the creepy centipede thing. It's odd how you forget things when you're busy dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex About 10? Maybe more. I didn't struggle anywhere near as much as with Genichiro Ashina.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danclarke Ah right, I think the selling point is it allows designers to use different variations on fonts without it causing bloat to the user (i.e. one font doing everything instead of 5) (if we're talking about the same thing).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_abramov CS = Counter Strike I'm guessing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danclarke You mean like a variable font example?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@code I don't know why I added an extra 'a' there. I sound like Mario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know why VSCode (@code)'s intelliSense stops working every a few mins? How do I get it working again without closing down VSCode each time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hadn't listened to @sigurros's Ágætis byrjun for ages but it still delivers *all* the chills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mynamesnotdave Amazing stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matty_Wickham It's a different type of combat overall, a lot more purposeful. So far I've found Sekiro more difficult than the Souls games. I miss having others to help out on tough bosses! Amazing game though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_rockeralex The lightning phase? Yeah that's where I die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sekiro's Genichiro Ashina has become the most infuriating boss fight I've ever tried. I've died maybe 40+ times now. Got him down to his final stage a few times but got destroyed seconds later. I'll have to come back later, else my neighbors will complain about the swearing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawavedesign Yeah the Knox documentary was better, haven't seen the Abducted one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been watching the Madeline McCann documentary on Netflix. It's reminiscent of the Amanda Knox doc. in that its focus veers towards how the media; claiming to be pursuing the truth, blatantly lie, accuse and destroy people's lives for the sake of profit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I need to get into The Expanse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Season 1 was amazing. Season 2... not amazing. Season 3 a bit better than 2 so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think True Detective Season 3 suffers from the same thing as Westworld. Too many time jumps and not enough reason to care.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DomBarnfather I follow him on Instagram! Yeah, he's pretty amazing eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyfjoshua Well handled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Depends where you're stood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Game of Thrones again for like the 50th time. I know the whole series is based around awful things happening to good(?) people, but season 1 has to be most painful to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a dream where I found myself in the early 1990s scheduled to fight Mike Tyson. I felt it was in my best interest to weasel out of it, while trying to maintain some dignity... I woke up at the point where I was screaming "Are you INSANE?!" at a promoter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weejulietots 10000000 times yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer 💴💵💶💷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched that Aladdin trailer. Wow. 🤨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dom_conlon @LuWrites I just need a cuddle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dom_conlon @LuWrites Don't mind brewski as much! But that's beer, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuWrites @dom_conlon It does, but it irks me... just say 'tea'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Checking out Russian Doll on Netflix. It's good. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lukewilletts Also a fave. Ace Jonny Greenwood soundtrack to boot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I bought it on Amazon Prime today, yeah. I'm sure you'll dig it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought First Man was brilliant when I first saw it at the cinema and now I'm watching it again and it's still brilliant so there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm in a spot of bother. #ResidentEvil2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoZwift I almost punctuated this tweet like @realDonaldTrump. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just given @GoZwift a try for the first time. It does help make indoor cycling fun, but it's waaay overpriced (£13 a month) for casual folk like me. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just completed Resident Evil 1. It took me 23 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvisLives Yep, but with Chris, both item boxes are behind locked doors which you can't get to without picking up another item... D'oh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm playing Resident Evil 1. I need to pick up an item to continue, but I can't because my item storage is full. You can't drop items and you can't progress without dropping items. I'll have to restart the game. Amazingly stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the Running For Good documentary about marathon / endurance runner @Marathonfiend. After winning the North Pole marathon, she was asked to appear on @BBCBreakfast, but only if she didn't mention that she's a #vegan. Pretty disappointed in the BBC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tawashley Depends, I think there's some middle ground where my wimpiness isn't enough to stop me from completing a section or two, and if I could just pay for only that at least the Devs gets some wimp money, and everyone's a winner baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Well shut my mouth, I've totally found it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Can I subscribe on Spotify? Can't seem to find it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Resident Evil 2 remake does look amazing, though I'm a wimp with that series and rarely finish any of them. There should be a wimp discount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just spent ages trying to get @flowtype working with a @reactjs CRA I'm working on. It breaks my VSCode setup, my components, my tests, elint, and even Flow itself (server won't start), which is exactly what I was going for. I'll stick with PropTypes for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Christmas. @ Manchester, United Kingdom  https://t.co/Gzx8ngjGFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking of getting a Brompton. Should I get a Brompton? I rarely cycle anywhere outside the city and being able to always get on a train with it sounds useful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've really, really missed Game of Thrones. I should probably have more going on in my life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AoifeLockhart These people are the mousey-voiced people. Very pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danhett I probably should, even if I'm not all that excited about it. But any new idea is always more seductive...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi twitter. I started making a #puzzle #game recently and I've got it to a basic working stage, but now I kinda think it's generally not a strong enough idea to begin with... Should I finish the game, or start on another (hopefully better) idea I've had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco  https://t.co/v2dD5U9t4N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Cool, have a look over your PS+ back-catalogue to see if there's anything else you fancied co-oping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawavedesign Or I might give  https://t.co/FeJQOtukL7 a go as it looks less grind-y.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawavedesign I dunno if everyone is on PS+, but I might give Portal Knights a play later as it's free (and online co-op):  https://t.co/MJIX79nBea<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco @peatreebojangle Classy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I use the towel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What the hell have you done to that game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Alien 3 for the first time in ages. I'm not why it got so much flack, it's actually very decent. Especially compared to the shitshow that was Alien: Resurrection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Aw man, he even goes back to my WWF days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @BBC But you love EastEnders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I really like talking to myself in weird voices to entertain myself at home. If I shared my flat I'd probably be deemed insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty bored of this flu now.  Going to offer a blood sacrifice to the Gods later to see if that helps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt 2019 is the year of the 91aissance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Cool, I'm sure I'll be on later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sichiu Ha! Cheers man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ah, can't really as I'm flu-ed up. 🤒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperButterBuns (o )( o)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Solid choices, but I would have liked to have seen 91 get some attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco He was younger too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got Xmas/NY flu for the 3rd time in 4 years. Next year I'm not leaving the flat at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco are you working today? Just going to give RD another whirl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ssxio Oh. God. No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so ready for 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's over a year since this Death Stranding trailer came out, but it has to be the best thing since, like, forever.  https://t.co/8bcI7XMAhD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyjamesgames @netflix I love their soundtracks (like, A LOT) but I couldn't get into Bird Box. Just... didn't work for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Successful horse swap with @racco #PS4share   https://t.co/YsmWNsJu05  https://t.co/NgVTyogHfk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Pub crawl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Fancy saddling up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @NetflixUK's #Bandersnatch is pretty interesting. I got the Scooby-Doo ending.  https://t.co/WZAguiI1h8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ghost Stories was really great. Way more interesting than your usual garden variety horror.  https://t.co/RfAuf4l9R1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, it comes with Red Dead Online, but the single player campaign is huuuge (and awesome).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Ah, I think Last of Us is a PlayStation exclusive. Red Dead 2 should be there though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I can say that both Last of Us and Red Dead 2 are pretty much perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer You didn't play Red Dead 2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Sadly not always invisible, but still a great show (as is Parks and Rec.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwrite The Incredibles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally insane, but amazing. (Also the best use of 360 video I've seen. Looking forward to seeing the documentary).  https://t.co/f4glH84GvV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelstein Yeah, didn't know anything about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperButterBuns Sure, why not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Homecoming on Amazon Prime, is really good. The marketing made it look like nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got shot to pieces by an entire town in Red Dead Online because I waved at the sheriff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Cheers dude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@photonstorm The first couple of hours (maybe less) seem to be mainly introducing the characters and mechanics, then it opens open everything to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still looking for a recommendation for a reasonably chilled place in the city centre (Manchester) to watch the #United match later. I'm pretty clueless. Bierkeller maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Huzzah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Ah give it another whirl, I'm sure you'll really dig it. (Very weird tho - which is great, obvs).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFoofinator Half baked idea make it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You got any time for RDOnline today? Was playing it again last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimZub @zdarsky Thank you. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I do dig that guy. You've been watching Legion, right? So good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I managed about 5 mins of @netflix's Bird Box. It's just The Happening, right? Wasn't the first one enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any suggestions on decent places in the city centre to watch the United match tomorrow? I'm kinda clueless about many things, but particularly football and good places to watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I feel terrible today. Those 10% stouts strike again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the elvish word for 'friend'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why haven't they made a Dark Souls or Bloodborne film yet? I mean, I realise they'd probably make a mess of it, but if they gave it to someone capable it'd be a pretty significant source of awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's that magical time of year where I can legit say 'spend 8 seconds playing this thing I made':  https://t.co/05a56UAYi7 #Xmas #Santa #Krampus #Deathmatch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alokrsaboo I could... But wouldn't that just be *all* notes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_abramov It's how I keep my windows so clean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Nightbreed for the first time. It's brilliant. It's got a whimsical Danny Elfman score juxtaposed with OTT Clive Barker gore (which rhymes) - plus David Cronenberg as a serial killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really love the stuff @SupergiantGames make (and the @DarrenKorb soundtracks). I'm looking forward to Hades.  https://t.co/ER0uBezvs0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DomBarnfather Wow, she's great eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palmerama Looks interesting! Haven't done much PHP in a while though (or really in any depth). Digging a lot different JS stuff tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also my website is pretty old now, I should do something about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RTs welcomed, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Twitter, how are you? I'm going to be applying for a new #FrontEndDeveloper or #SoftwareEngineer role in early 2019.

<|startoftext|>@racco I did try to register a gang called the Insane Clown Posse, but I didn't have enough gold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ha, my character is called Betsy. She's missing quite a few teeth and is likely in her 60s. We'll have to saddle up!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Ha yeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Totally. I've watched a bunch of videos just about the lore of all the characters. It's nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth There's probably no way I would have completed any of them without YouTube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Also I just cheesed that Demon's Souls boss. I have no regrets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Did you have to parry a lot? He just annihilates me at the minute even with a high level and top armour. It's probably all about the dodge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm one boss away from beating Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2 &amp; 3 and Bloodborne - but I've no idea how to beat Gywn Lord of Cinder (DS1). Apparently you need to be awesome at parrying and I not that. #TopDarkSoulsTweet2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Is such a thing possible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like @fortitude. It's that level of nuts that makes you wonder how they're getting away with it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Ha, I totally forgot how to open his journal! Also kept forgetting to look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm really starting to like Red Dead Online now. There's more emphasis on exploring, rather than going mission to mission. Plus teaming up with a crew is pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had an idea for a game I'd like to build in @phaser_ and @SocketIO. It's Red Dead Redemption 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomBarnfather @joelstein @computerlovers May he rest in peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharpfives I love this. The music and art style work so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomBarnfather @computerlovers @joelstein #rip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@computerlovers Did everyone make it back in one piece?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, I think my favourite parts of the game were me just exploring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @RockstarGames I finished it yesterday. Really enjoyed it all. Been trying out Online a bit. Seems quiet at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reddit Note: It just has a counter now (i.e. it counts the seconds it took to complete) - no game over screen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I posted  https://t.co/hznjAJLZVv to @reddit and they shouted at me because it had a countdown timer which stressed everyone out. Can anyone who has played it before try the link again (refresh a few times) and see if it works? I.e. no error/blank screen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_abramov Just had a discussion about this very thing yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally finished Red Dead 2. It was as huge as it was impressive. I can't begin to fathom the hours and effort it must have taken to bring it all together. Now for Red Dead Online!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was my last day at @computerlovers today. They're a really good bunch of people. That said, they're all off to Amsterdam for the weekend and many may not survive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I just got a spam / phishing email from Steve Worsley (though not your email). It's after I posted something in LinkedIn? A bot might just be scraping names or something, but just in case in case your LinkedIn had been hacked...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftEdge True to form with your browsers; Edge is unusable, plus Edge DevTools just shows as a useless grey block. As Win10 don't allow uninstall/reinstall for Edge, what can I do?  https://t.co/j7GQEtPibS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@p_maloney @computerlovers Good work! If you get 00:00 you win a jet ski.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HI INTERNET. I made a quick (and probably annoying) game at @computerlovers. Anyone want to test it out?  https://t.co/GGUUL3u138<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the greatest gifts life can give you is waking up before your alarm clock and getting to go back to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I watched Hereditary. It started off really well and then got more and more stupid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>England 4-0 up before 40mins in the #WorldCup I'm probably not going to get to tweet that very often.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm at Code Computerlove. Yeah, regular income is handy, but I'm discovering all the stuff I should have been learning whilst I was freelance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm not, no. Back to the grind of full-time employment. It's not all bad though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, you know, struggling on. Things good with you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer That was a fun little thing to make!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#asktwitter Does anyone know of a good way of getting from #ManchesterCityCentre to #LiverpoolAirport? There used to be a Terravision coach, but that got cancelled and it seems nothing has replaced it. Trains and buses require multiple annoying changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fine not going to a gig, right? I like the band, but it means leaving my flat and then standing and waiting in a sweaty room and then coming home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Oh, I'm a regular server whizz. 🤨 (I was on the phone with AWS for about an hour and half last night). There's still some things outstanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurableStretch @HigherLowerGame Just for now... It's a very early alpha kinda deal. Might take a fair bit of effort to work well on mobile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonymcbeth Best of luck today (if it's your first day). Just make a strong impression by fighting the biggest guy in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Thanks again dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Shit. So, I'm screwed? :/ If I move the  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM domain to AWS would that work? So confusing. Sorry to ask all these questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Google Domains. Just looking at this about CNames:  https://t.co/oaxJQSjnNp Can't create a Cname at the 'Apex' apparently?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Yep, deleted the A record. Still got NS and SOA details in there. Just get "RRSet of type CNAME with DNS name  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM. is not permitted at apex in zone  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Wha? The site works for you? Is it cached? Thanks for your help btw. I'm way out of my depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey "RRSet of type CNAME with DNS name  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM. is not permitted at apex in zone  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM." I hate this shit so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey I can view that yeah, I'll try a CName<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey Doesn't use a LB apparently... "This configuration does not contain a load balancer."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey I'll try to find that config. Thanks, I fucking hate AWS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey It's using Elastic Beanstalk which I *think* auto handles load balancing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryBailey 52... IP is the correct (Elastic) IP. I have an A record to point  https://t.co/NIjgFDxWWM to that IP. Do you think I need to look into ports?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone with DNS/domain name knowledge help me figure out why  https://t.co/HjHoI3dY7e is down? I moved it over @awscloud and now it doesn't work. Been down for about 12 hours. #DNS #Hosting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @awscloud is the most frustratingly complicated thing I've tried to use in a while. Want to do something simple? Here's 4000 words of jargon for you. Want to save a setting? We'll let you make a change and then disable all save buttons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey #Guitar players. I'm making a web app to help people learn their #scales and #arpeggios. Does anyone have a minute to check whether the 'Play' button gives audio here? (obvs make sure you've got your volume turned on):  https://t.co/D369tZwczR #PWA #music #learning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because I'm a sucker for punishment I'm playing through @nioh_game again (NG+). Umi Bozu insta-killed me 20 times in a row...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@h3h3productions @HilaKleinH3  Congrats on the court case win you guys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VirginRadioUK @jamieeast ... I was too ill to attend work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really great to have @GameOfThrones back finally! On the flip side, this week's Twin Peaks was the worst of the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tauologist @zanelowe Thanks man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KingScooty @MobikeUK Yeah, nothing in the city centre, @MobikeUK ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernardohulsman Yeah. It's usually the case that you're asked to provide a cost estimate for a website that hasn't yet been designed or thought through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #WebDevelopers and #ProjectManagers. Do you know of a good way to accurate plan and estimate times for a website build?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco True.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting job spec here on @authenticjobs. Perfectionists not welcome, it seems.  https://t.co/Bn4fosCRHz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I remember liking Running Man as a kid. I wonder if it's aged better than Commando.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, but there's camp... then there's Commando. 80s brought some classics though, i.e. Terminator, Predator, Die Hard, Aliens...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer That's the best bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Ha, I did! We used to kick the ball over as a kid, and we'd have to go and ask for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kyle_MacLachlan @DAVID_LYNCH @davidduchovny Hey there! I made a website to celebrate the return of #TwinPeaks  https://t.co/Xj2qCzgEVf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco "I mean, if I've got time to call people all day, they've obviously got time to answer calls all day."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Instead of "hmm, I think I'll just keep calling this person all day, regardless of whether they're answering."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and not leaving a message, not thinking "maybe i'll drop them an email instead."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be great if people used email as their first method of communication; maybe to arrange a call... rather than calling repeatedly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve right-o, see you in a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve still 10, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a lot of annoyed people, I guess.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LucPestille ah thanks, wasn't sure if I still needed the declaration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer crazy! Is it possible to port or does it need to be rebuilt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm afraid not, I'm a Wordpress guy :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Maybe your eyes are too big.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPestille Think I've sorted that now, ta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPestille Yeah, the transition from The Info section to another Character transitions up the page ... I should look at that. Thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@welovetheweb Pretty f**king useless so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp Great, how?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then they tell you to email them with all the tech info. You do, then they respond 3 hours later asking for the info you already gave...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then that new person says: "I can't help. Please try the same form again that you had a problem with in another browser."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or if a customer has a problem, don't just tell them: "I can't help. Ring another number."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like reading emails. They haven't quite mastered that yet. Or making online forms that work, or, if fail, anticipate it and provide help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It always amazes (really, really frustrates) me that companies as big as Barclays can be so, so bad at basic internet-age things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...the information I had provided them in the email they were replying to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a full day trying to get @BarclaysUKHelp to fix their website, I received a email saying they couldn't help me until I give them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/BkUc0XexEp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...another number. Other number says can't help as you're not registered for online banking. Twitter help says try previous phone number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I've been trying all morning to sign up for Barclays Online Banking. The online form is broken. Says call number. Number says call...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp I then tried another number and they said their system is down. Try again later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp Firstly I got through to someone who asked for a sort-code. I don't have one. They said they couldn't help....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp Yeah, thanks. I got that exact message from your website after your system failed. I called it, they couldn't help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarclaysUKHelp I'm a mortgage customer, but can't check my balance without registering for online banking. That was the o/banking form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to use @BarclaysUKHelp website. Filled in the form with all my details, hit send, and get this. #awful  https://t.co/rkErxUKQdk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody know any good #quotes? Go ahead and add them here:  https://t.co/Ty3bMY5MES - or just vote for the ones you like and stuff. Thanks!  https://t.co/kE7PwU1Fer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown I'd maybe take umbrage at criticising 'certain generations' in this way too, but hey ho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown I doubt their thought process was: "Hey, the murder and the persecution of millions would make a great selfie."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown ..it's possible these people are just seeing it as 'modern art or something'. Not purposely disrespectful, at least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown As I mentioned, I'm pretty sure the memorial isn't marked and isn't explicit about it being a memorial at all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown If people, for example, went to Auschwitz and took selfies, etc, then I'd think the site would be fairer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown ...and doesn't mention the Holocaust. I'd like to believe they're unaware or it's not meant as disrespect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyLander @Upskydown Seems unfair to superimpose those people over those images. The memorial itself  is purposely abstract...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I think you'll find it was Rocco who made that strike. Credit where credit's due.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @SophMarketing yeah, I was really expecting (hoping) for LSH to show up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SophMarketing @Steve_Worsley yeah, probs worst of the season. I liked Edmure ripping Jaime's character to bits, but then instantly caved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @SophMarketing "A man needs some salt, a man or woman should pass it to him." It's a bit long winded.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryFord Agreed. I'm not liking all the computery shit. Hopefully the final film will be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But then again everyone loved #Pixels which so seamlessly married 80s nostalgia and the latest CGI. 0_o<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco do you also avoid reviews? How will you know what to watch and what to avoid? Posters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCClick @AppleSupport Only took 10 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinebray I call Legerdemain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Does his 24 inch Pythons usually have cracks in them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That's a wax Hogan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nightmares in Wax:  https://t.co/4WCLXYilI8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bates Motel TV show genuinely creeps me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco @Steve_Worsley sounds good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave @Steve_Worsley Broforce tonight or this week? Remote download, innit.  https://t.co/3v3sYDiSm8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap ha, most of my tweets mean pretty much nothing.  https://t.co/2NLLZgyZQ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you're wondering I'm back at it again with the white Vans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drinking is fine until you stop drinking. Won't we ever learn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give this a listen and then do some pledging.  https://t.co/GhRQFSknnm #MusicMonday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah haha, noted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah I'm so out of the loop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah dammit, just ordered 10,000 Nonbeliever vests as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah the first one to become a billionaire rockstar wears the one's merched t-shirts and then we both become billionaires. Deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Hopefully your new EPs will sell loads and you can get your own set up and be unstoppable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah yeah, but I've got a bunch of drum samples so I program those. Lots of plugins to help get the sounds you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Thanks! Yeah, DIY is where it's at! It's not that difficult to get it all going, then it's just matter of experimenting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UMO it's bad to be rad. Not sure if that's a good thing either though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I've watched enough movies in my life to get an #Oscars invite if not an #Oscar itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Ha, yeah, I've got Pro Tools and some minor kit set up at home, keeping it cheap. But I should play live, you're right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah I'm just really bad at marketing / promotion. Easier to write more stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Thanks for listening! I'd love to collaborate. You mean the 'Maybe It's Strange' album? Yus, out 'properly' 7th March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SummerRay  https://t.co/Ku4pmewBoq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The X-Files should have just come back with a bunch of comedy episodes and left it like that. They work much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karliemc Nice. Hands websites are so hot right now.  https://t.co/YEvtcmGQLG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco sweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco no probs, are you online tonight per chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco you around for GTA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell not tried those, though I'm a big fan of Cauldron falafel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Linda McCartney sausages are the best. Long live Linda McCartney sausages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please.  https://t.co/x8PvB6LhY5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I learned how to play The Killing Moon by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen today. It's one of the best songs, like, ever.  https://t.co/dO7gspa2FO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Sweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dearpariah Thanks! Looking forward to hearing yours. When's it out again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Think I've still got Killzone. Cool, I'd be up for Sunday. I'll see if my bro is free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched the first episode of Love on @NetflixUK. I'm in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Fair dos, you should get those though! Lots of good stuff comes with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco GTA races this weekend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara Can't they all just... get along?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gamespot @lucyjamesgames Genuinely learned a lot from that! Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmegannnolan @FUGOSLAVIA You certainly look like a viable couple from the profile photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really looking forward to seeing @TheWitchMovie. Seems the most interesting horror to come along for a while.  https://t.co/vkHfMyFmwn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_danicharlton You seem v.difficult to please with Movies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobek_balinek But orally, though, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobek_balinek How, exactly, are they 'taking' these chips?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I really enjoyed it! Really pleased for @VancityReynolds that it's doing so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What did you think of Deadpool?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey @GameOfThrones best male decapitated head in a TV drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching through all of @GameOfThrones again before Season 6. I think everything is going to turn out fine for #HouseStark this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@altclassic @TheRyanAdams Still my fave I think. Or HoH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeardedGenius The guy from Farcry 4 does too:  https://t.co/oMMqxe1EaI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orbette I haven't, but looking forward to season 4. Season 3 was a bit odd, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been playing Banks of the Ohio (or my version of it) for the past few nights. Really nice,…  https://t.co/f32C1LwnAZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickdeSemlyen Probably the right move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickdeSemlyen Why didn't you use this gif, though?  https://t.co/7FQ9bmZtoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Street Fighter V still coming out tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NME @GameOfThrones Could just be an interesting way to recap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZombyMusic They're just great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farawayfromthis You're missing #hashtags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pitchfork bit of both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@activemelody I'm learning lots from your latest solo jazz lesson. So many lovely voicings and chords. Good work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately I've just learned about this and grew up on the next street to one of the guys. Such a shame.  https://t.co/mAm9K1MHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Valentine's Day everyone. May Cupid fire his arrows and destroy all your enemies on this day. #Valentines #Destroy #Enemies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco @rideawave if you've got PS+ you can get Helldivers for free. That's a good multiplayer we can all do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @nonbeliever @racco @rideawave bummer, I thought it was in your bundle deal thing. It's worth buying though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco @rideawave just gimme a shout whenever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A missed opportunity. (via @ClickHole)  https://t.co/qKD6omjmTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave You guys got any time over the weekend for some romantic PS4ing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmegannnolan It's how you know he's a true artist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@authenticjobs Good work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catie_wahwah just sitting through 14 mins of your @MarikaHackman video. What a wonderfully considered and thorough review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco @rideawave not played Firewatch but IGN loved it. Last of Us is even better on PS4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave I was playing my brother online the other day and kicked his butt on the races. Just FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave The GTA crew is finally happening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Smart. Just don't let him steal your ideas or force you out of the earnings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Cool, well have a splendid time away from it all. You should invent something and become a zillionaire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Will you be back in Manchester in the future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley is it your last day tomorrow? Or today? Do you know you're doing next yet? Or are you taking some time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brazly It's exactly that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snuck out and watched @deadpoolmovie this afternoon and it's pretty glorious. Really enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin Right-o. Take a bit of time to reach me on that for some reason, but I'll get back to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin Cool ta, which email address?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin Sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin So it's design / front-end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin @CoopDigital What is it you're looking for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco cheers ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool, my album is on the front-page 'Featured...' bit on @BitTorrent. It's #freemusic so you should download it yes.  https://t.co/EVCYKlTnxo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BitTorrent Huzzah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BitTorrent Please feel free to add it to the front-page. :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco poignant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamRutherford It's always tempting, but you should try to avoid doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark @BitTorrent Cheers dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new #album is #free on @BitTorrent "Maybe It's Strange" by Nonbeliever  https://t.co/uqZdNLbGah #BitTorrentBundle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heatherlime they're pretty great, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching The Martian again. Still convinced that the rock on the right is a profile of a Prometheus / Engineer head.  https://t.co/CB22cDwUiv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonAHolmes It's nice to see you giving some love to @kulashaker. Do you have time to consider this?:  https://t.co/MBkBoMKesf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chesha @levymarket 1-2 hours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waking up with a hangover like...  https://t.co/xTXve5ApPf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got an email from a company on @Bandcamp asking me to pay them, so they can sell my music and keep the money themselves. Pretty sweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrismurray00 Wasn't that the 2nd?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco yeah boii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco  https://t.co/wv3A03Y7Sm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally getting around to listening to @kendricklamar's To Pimp A Butterfly. It is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theneedledrop :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell @Chesha I can along for a bit if others fancy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chesha @I_amNell I'm not sure getting punched in the face sounds all that fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my new album in 30 seconds because I know you're busy.   https://t.co/yLwdgpUTuJ  #NewMusicFriday #I'llshutupnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you like music sometimes? Probably not. But you should still listen to my album playlist:  https://t.co/WXvFkdZX8v #album #stream #wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the behest of literally nobody, I've written and recorded another album. It took me about 8…  https://t.co/j0ycT3W6CK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chesha @racco @I_amNell @OliverTapple @etc Perhaps! Though I do tend to get drunk and argue, should probably try to not do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ilft5cAUkA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave cools, give it a download and play the first couple of missions, they're nice and quick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave have either of you tried Helldiver's yet? It's good! And apparently much better with a team. #freedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themonsterist How's he doing? That ol' scamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I had a look through some of those. Doesn't help when your version looks nothing like theirs and they're so smug about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Didn't get me to the point of crying, but it felt the force of some colourful language and spittle. Think I've sorted it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: "Hi, I'm trying to do some really basic things here."  Adobe Premiere: "Well, I'm going to have to make that extremely difficult."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt big cricket fan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #album is written, mixed, mastered and done. Only took 7 months or so. Now I need to figure out how to get people to listen to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco just be gentle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Get some Helldivers in you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I just made myself the best coffee in the world. Please #retweet this, it is very important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched @SicarioMovie again. Still awesome. I think it's made 80% better by the @JohannJohannss soundtrack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanston_ That's really the question, isn't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't drink a pint of Bovril.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlucky @andy_murray. Next year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave Also  https://t.co/q5255lLTHF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave you guys online today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Attack on Titan again as it's the greatest thing in the universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthernSoho Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney Ha, I suppose I do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Splendid work @andy_murray, he's made it to yet another Grand Slam final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got tickets to see Brian Wilson perform Pet Sounds at the Apollo. Anyone else going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAMKATEHERRON On Netflix? I watched it too, I had forgotten the ending :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanston_ Yeah, but I suppose Christoph Waltz can't get all the eccentric european psychopath roles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chanston_ Works on so many levels. Or maybe just the one. Did you like the film? I wasn't very keen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco I'm online now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco sure is! I can do that, yeah. Gimme a shout when you're free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco right-o.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave you guys free for some online action later or are you busy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>New short film (5 mins) from the guy who did The Raid (@ghuwevans).  https://t.co/6nNCj2wATt (cc @racco)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell I still haven't seen that. Is it a good 'un?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachaelkearney Confused. I added you to a Web Designer list. That RT was ironic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco that works for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave Is there a night this week that would be best for an hour or so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco We'll protect you if you're not as butch as we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got an email from Touche Pussy Sensei. Haven't heard from them for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco Cool, I think I'm a big bad lvl40.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how Kanye West is never afraid to underplay things.  https://t.co/ktC2Sb6JR1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave fancy trying out Destiny this week one night?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best "It's Always Sunny..." episodes are the ones with Charlie's songs in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're looking for a new #acoustic #guitar you should consider a @MartinGuitar Dreadnought Junior as they're kinda perfect and magical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco put this into your brain:  https://t.co/Y3mPdrOCoZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at The Smithfield Hotel and Tavern in Manchester, Greater Manchester  https://t.co/CxXSwdM9yg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @I_amNell @racco I've grabbed a big table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Cool, I'll be there for 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Are you around yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoxtonradio @CharlDeCarle My weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @i_amnell @racco Where's that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell @Steve_Worsley @racco said he finishes at 4, but I'll be along at 5 maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell @Steve_Worsley Just heading to Smithfield / Blackjack for a few of those drinks with alcohol in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell @Steve_Worsley Either of you around after work for a couple of drinks with alcohol in them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Noice. we should a 4-way PS4 + beer-a-thon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco probably better that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to figure out how to make things that very few people like that makes three squallion dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know Avatar 1 made three squallion dollars, but I still don't think I've met anyone who liked it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NME How embarrassing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Space pong.  https://t.co/Q1ELUeMWr8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched The Aviator again. Such an amazingly splendid film. One of Scorsese's best I think, and maybe DiCaprio's best performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Though might be out of stock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Mortal Kombat X £16.99  https://t.co/nzhNU0uSXf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave Might not interested, but Diablo 3 would be good smash-the-shit-out-of-things-online kinda game.  https://t.co/fjXQCDOY5O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peteholmes @CollegeHumor I'm always a full-pump kinda guy. Lavish? Certainly, but I'm worth it - plus my hands are filthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco he's been reborn? Sweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco because you need a telescope to see it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone thought up a name for the 9th planet yet? I think something humble like 'Frank' would be a nice change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/gtAUnW4tET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems too good to be true... but I'll shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to ring the accountant twice to confirm, but I still don't really believe it. Kinda like someone handing you a wad of cash...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been doing some accounting and apparently I'm owed money from my company and it seems too good to be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco? When did Marble come into it?  https://t.co/CtYfSKpMXw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley haha, where did I get Smithfield from? Good job I bought a half!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley here now, I've grabbed a table.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco There's plenty of places! We'll find something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco I'm open to suggestions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneSamuels I used to listen to that song over and over again when it came out. Just, like... ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Right-o.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley What time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww yeah.  https://t.co/TFhAn7O74T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could honestly cut half of The Hateful Eight and it would be a better film. But still only an average film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Groupon I just purchased a deal, but it just keeps saying 'Processing' which is meaningless. Did it work or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyjamesgames From Fellowship? I could never make out whether that was a man or a woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia I heard it's quite hard work to get through, considering the subject matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Seems someone has started an account with just that.  https://t.co/NtgQj1mLHK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Really? You've never  seen that? I'm sure you'll notice it soon (or hopefully not).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me.  https://t.co/Jwvq9JQ6mE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else find it a tad uncomfortable when people quote / RT things and add: "Me." with it? Please don't be someone who does that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really kinda annoying that I haven't been winning any of the lotteries lately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one mentioned Lemmy's third arm at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen so many tributes to Bowie today and his 'different coloured eyes'. His eyes were the same fucking colour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davey Cameron is a pie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Sounds like you've found your niche.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley ...but like anything, it doesn't hold your attention forever, it's just good clean escapism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley No probs! But you shouldn't ever feel bad about gaming! I always feel revitalised after a couple of hours 'hooked in'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RIPDavidBowie Pretty shocked. He left behind a huge collection of amazing music (and films). Thanks, Dave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark @Steve_Worsley ...for more tests and an ultrasound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark @Steve_Worsley seems a bit chirpier today! The vet called and said he hopefully won't need surgery, but need to take him back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley he's had xrays and has had a few injections to help, but they're not sure what's going on. I'll have to take him back tomoz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#catwatch I'm at the vets waiting for test results from X-ray. Poor lad has a blockage, and they're not sure what it is. Might need surgery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneSamuels still in bed? Think of the circadian rhythm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark I really, really hope he snaps out of it. Did you take him to the vets? How old was your cat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#catwatch he's just vomited again. :( fucking hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By 'do it' I mean not throw it up all over my floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cat watch update: he hasn't vomited in a while and he ate some food and stuff. You can do it, bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like it when I eat pizza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap @Steve_Worsley I'm not sure how he could haven't eaten something bad though, as a house cat.  :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @doolallytap they said it might not be too bad, but they're not sure. Argh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @doolallytap He's been vomiting every few hours since yesterday. Not sure why. Just got off the phone with a vet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a poorly cat :( going to have to take him to the emergency vets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave @racco not over Xmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Agreed. I liked Kylo Ren, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Phasma pretty much had nothing to do, same with a few other characters, but overall, besides clunky dialogue, I liked it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmegannnolan roast pepper, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huzzah! I get to see Star Wars today. I'm more excited than I expected to be. I hope it's as good as the Phantom Menace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara Super, I might give it another shot then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara Agreed, maybe it's a bit more subtle than JJ emo-ness. Does JJ get past the tutting and eye-rolling further into the season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara He's maybe a little more stoic in his teenage angsty-ness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara So far (6 episodes) into JJ I've just seen her be rude to everyone and throw things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara Can you give me some examples on where they're similar? Character wise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara I think Batman is more moody / broody than stroppy, but I'll give it another go some time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I really loved Casino Royale, liked QoS, hated Skyfall, so I'm not sure what I'll think of Spectre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Shit then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Is it any good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia nope just by me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia nice! I want to get back to recording more stuff. I'm always up for a jam btw!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManMadeMoon RUN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched Black Christmas (1974 version). Always thought it might be hokey, but it's great! One of the best horrors of that era.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 yeah, worth a rewatch, see if your opinion changes at all. Not sure if I want to see Spectre after Skyfall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 ... Next scene he's just drinking Heineken in a bar. So many stupid bits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 and yeah, Moneypenny shoots Bond with a high powered rifled, he falls about 70 feet into the river below...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 completely the other way around for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 in Skyfall? The plot, the action, the characters all seemed weak. Bardem's character was just kinda silly. "Mother" indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 Skyfall is, for me, pretty dire. Honestly don't understand what people like about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 but yeah, Casino Royale is by far the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 ...ie, not killing the guy who was responsible for Vesper's death. Skyfall was kinda pantomime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 I can't think of anything decent about Skyfall. At least QoS has Bond actually kinda 'growing' as a character...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really don't know why people seem to dislike Quantum of Solace, but seem to love Skyfall.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom If they're that kind of company, I don't want anything to do with them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timharbour ...appears in the browser as always. *REALLY* annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour Hmm, well it worked once. It's my css file that refused to be refreshed. I've even deleted the file off the server, but still...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour adding the cachebuster to the css url seems to have fixed it. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour Cheers! I'll look into that. Really confusing me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, web folks. Does anyone know why my web server and/or browser just loads old cached files and not the latest? Ctrl+F5 does nothing :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm playing Words with Friends with @racco who has used the words "gay", " nonce" and "queer" so far. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazingradio Thanks for the write-up! Much appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eschmalf It didn't look like the most comfortable ride, though :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just posted a photo  https://t.co/8xExGveT03<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems Jurassic World is getting some pretty positive reviews. That's encouraging after the awful trailers. I may have to go see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhian__ Howdy. Is there any chance you would review a Lo-fi/DIY-guy's latest album?  https://t.co/s1MxgmEF0X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Aw yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'll go for the Freemium option as I'm a bit broke at the minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Interesting...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@s10wen A man of unquestionable taste ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would you like to listen to my new #album on @YouTube? It's a bit sad, a bit weird &amp; also quite poppy in parts:  https://t.co/9qOBVhhCB6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hello Twitter. I'm releasing my 2nd album in July and am looking for #music #bloggers who might want to #review it. Anyone know of any?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inthejunkyardmc Would you be interested in reviewing this album? Out in July:  https://t.co/o5E1a2Q8N6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empiremagazine I'm going to melt the polar ice caps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom is The Hound dead? I predict The Viper will be back, just without a skull. Total bad ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom well, I'm just guessing! Usually *something* big happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would predict a lot of people will give up on Game of Thrones after this season's finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leianivey Sacrificing hasn't actually helped anything, has it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit late on this, but what the fuck Stannis? You were my guy. #GoT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickminers @stan_chow Buying it directly from them is the best way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...so I'm not doing that this time. It's done. I'll release it pretty soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, today I finished mixing my 2nd album. Mixing &amp; mastering (particularly when you're kinda clueless about it, like me) can go on forever..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure it's obvious what happens tonight on Game of Thrones due to so many posts about 'the unthinkable'. Dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olly_richards Haven't read much about the story, hopefully it's better than Interstellar, I wasn't a fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just went for a run along the riverside &amp; watched a guy taking in the view before casually tossing his drink bottle in the water, as you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olly_richards All seems very Interstellar though? Minus the corn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hjbme You have to wonder how many people stop and wave as it goes past. The drivers must feel pretty popular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...I say 'kissing' but obviously there's more than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The kissing scene between Sharon Stone &amp; Joe Pesci in Casino always freaks me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hopelarson Can you recommend a good way of hitting on people? I tend to use the 'be too self-conscious to even make eye-contact' approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco ok, thank you for your help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco just DM'd it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco I've DM'd the details. 5 items missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesco I've already emailed the orders@tesco address. Just very annoying. Keeps happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, @tesco are getting good at charging me for items and not delivering them. I wonder how many other deliveries have had items missing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, I've given up on trying to watch Community on Yahoo. Nothing seems to work. Links and images broken, 'play' button does nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@primagames is there an index so I have a chance of finding the quests?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ideasbymusic Would you get to listen to Scott Walker, or would we just need to name the albums? Or is this a numeracy test?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, I just booked tickets to go to another country like on a flight and stuff yeah so shut it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ANewBandADay Dunno. Really like the stuff I've heard so far though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mad Max: Fury Road was awesome! Here's my review:  http://t.co/31V4c2sIQH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chesha my cat isn't even that smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full of treats, cat too stupid to understand how to get them. Walks off.  https://t.co/B5Dt1I55py<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empiremagazine Crimsoned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebrainroom yep, it worked for a while but it's useless now. I'll have to turn it off and pause it manually for traffic. Annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Strava android app is shockingly bad at recording running data. Just randomly pauses itself mid-run. Loads of my run data has been lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping it will save me time in the long run... rather than slowing me down by confusing me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been trying out Sage theme (gulp, bower, bootstrap, sass, etc) for this latest WordPress build. Bit of a headscratcher so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Umezushi_M31PJ ok thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halfsilk Never a bad time for pizza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halfsilk Boo. You'll have to treat yourself to something. Hope the tour went well though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Umezushi_M31PJ Can I order online and collect? Or do I have to pay for delivery? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like I'll be buying The Witcher III then. I haven't even completed Dragon Age: Inquisition yet :/  http://t.co/AQloEwZfQy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop slowly killing yourself guys! Hire a personal trainer and live forever.  https://t.co/oXxXso0u4S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia fine, thanks. Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever happened to Updog?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This song always kicks me in the gut when I hear it. ♫  http://t.co/8ASMj7Bhnw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Totally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, seemed a bit odd. She wasn't even sure those guys had any involvement with the Harpies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @GameOfThrones I'm sure the dead guy and his family understand that it's for the greater good and all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap There's probably a goat or two around though, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scrabble_Girl @GameOfThrones Yeah, it was great! I've always been a Stannis fan, but he's becoming my fave... which means he'll die soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scrabble_Girl @GameOfThrones Bit of a mixed message, then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, yeah, on last night's @GameOfThrones did Daenerys just make her dragons burn and rip apart an innocent guy, just for, like, fun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell No rush, innit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Mine aren't too bad, I was thinking of going for another little run today perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @I_amNell Most likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell  http://t.co/qwkNGcdl54 - there wasn't a single pic of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara @HelenLOLHarder would be even better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I called Nigel Farage a dick and a Ukip member tried to recruit me. Is that how it works?  http://t.co/fe0frXtQMs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisingram41 @Channel4News Um, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha, "fewer". #stannis #pedant #badass #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco bummer, let me know if you find a better alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Did you try  https://t.co/vqSMlAEPhg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News Dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenLOHara @ChrisHewitt @sambaintv Can I suggest a change to "@helenLOLhara"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 I've really enjoyed Hannibal. Very much looking forward to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched The Summit on Netflix. Fascinating and quite harrowing stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ravestab @MissParky86 @beauo I only ran 10k :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Managed the #manchester #10k today despite being ill this week. I really am amazing, eh? @ Deansgate  https://t.co/IWMcshwuLq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p @guillorybe I've enjoyed it, I'm on the final episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Fortitude and now I'm in love with @guillorybe which is nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell yep ok see you then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Sounds good. Should I meet you outside the CC? What time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell yeah, I'm just gonna take it easy as I've been Ill this week. We could meet you before? I'll obviously lose you once we start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Yeah I'm Orange too! Are you running with other people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Hey, what colour group are you in for the run tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @meghanbeesley won her event and my heart there. #manchester #GreatCityGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold on to your butts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Jurassic Park for the first time since my brother had it on VHS in the 90s. If anything it's only gotten Jurassic Parkier.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pasteyh2g2 It could all be avoided, they're just the worst kind of client. Unfortunately you have to deal with them occasionally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebysheppard They have been super dodgy and difficult right from the start. Shows how important it is to have a contract in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasteyh2g2 yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebysheppard Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had to use my  http://t.co/Nl7oW158um theme on a client's site as they're refusing to pay what they owe. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't watch any more #GE2015 results. Very depressing. Let's hope the exit polls were very wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jazz. @ The Fitzgerald  https://t.co/B29PC5AUXA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner Was it UKIP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco oh go on then. I'll be 10 mins or so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco How long are you staying there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Indeed. Really leaves a bad taste in your mouth after working hard for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork UGH. See my recent tweet-rant for these kinds of clients.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I created him a free logo, as he's trying to get his business started and has little budget. I'm never being nice again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember an alarm bell ringing when he said: "I've had some problems with Web Designers in the past." - perhaps the problem is you, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they'll be more pleasant now, but I'm done working for unpleasant, over-demanding clients with no budget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've reminded them of the contract terms we agreed on, and pointed out how they're breaking the contract in several ways...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've tried to reason with them and meet their demands at my own expense, but they're even being quite rude now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that they can't use WordPress as they're "not very good with IT".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The latest complaint is that they're annoyed that they will have to provide their own content for the website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've worked into the evenings (for free) to reach their deadlines and even threw in some free extras, but they still complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They later came back and said - right can you finish now and do loads more than we agreed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They contacted me half way though the job to tell me to stop as they had "legal issues"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently dealing with one of the worst clients I've ever had. I've done well over what I agreed to do for them and they still complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally nailed that vote. Slam dunk, y'all. #GE2015 @ Park Inn Hotel, Manchester Victoria  https://t.co/KDNbOTSKDT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsnicethat @rebeccamock they're maing my day, also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark Yeah I was thinking that, hopefully I'll feel better in the next couple of days and just do my best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Does sound more fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure whether I just cough and sneeze my way to finish line or just stay home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm supposed to be running the Manchester 10k this weekend but I'm currently quite 'blugh'. Cough, sore throat, phlegm all over the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellzenner I would agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really good at eating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want.  https://t.co/8G8Vyh2Y6S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley yeah! Loads of fighting this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @danjdavies he plaits it like a boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies @Steve_Worsley I did think that he may have had dementia 'cause of all the stuff he forgot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Wookea furniture is very affordable though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies @Steve_Worsley ha! How old is Luke supposed to be in IV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley ha, did you Google that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty handy how all the planets in the Star Wars universe have breathable atmospheres and identical gravity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyjamesgames It's an encouraging message though. Sometimes it's nice to be encouraged when pooping.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@I_amNell I can come along to Shebeen. Where should I meet you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell He was awesome, really impressive to watch with all the visuals and awesome music. Didn't come on until 11:20 or something tho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@I_amNell I'm fucking headlining, yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Did you get a ticket for Flying Lotus later? Seem to remember you mentioning you might.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@I_amNell I could do unless you want to give your ticket to someone who may be around longer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Sounds good, but I'd have to be back at mine for 3ish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell What time is it and stuff? I'm heading to my brothers place quite early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Thought as much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@ClickHole always provide the best Radiohead coverage:  http://t.co/hPNoNss6Px<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...but to listen to it in entirety and for it to not be dog-shit awful is really encouraging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It takes a long time to make an album, so months and months of trying to write stuff and then thinking it's shit can be tough...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an indulgent tweet, but I've just listened through a rough mix of my 2nd album for the first time and I actually liked it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@en_cohen Eep. The production gets a kicking in that Jackson Scott review. I'm surely guilty of losing perspective when self-producing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 I thought I'd love Guardians after watching the trailer, but didn't find it funny or engaging. Everything felt a bit forced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 But you're right, I'm sure other viewings will make it more coherent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85  There was some really cool moments in Ultron, and  Whedon's dialogue is always great, but felt a bit mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCarpenter85 I liked Cap 2, but felt let down by Guardians - thought the script was really lacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched Avengers: Age of Ultron last night. I liked it, but it didn't feel as satisfying as the first one. Also:  http://t.co/mvf1fCJh1v<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh hey.  http://t.co/j7yOEcZMXl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap ...because of all the green screen. It affected the Hobbit a bit too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap yeah, there's some horrific dialogue, but there's loads in the original too. The actors do often look bewildered in I-III...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm watching Sweet and Lowdown. Samantha Morton breaks my heart in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Cool, lemme know the deal and I'll meet you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ok cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Could do, £5 though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Are you going to the Record Store Day tomorrow at the Mill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt I'm sure the 'proper' trailer will be online shortly. Odd how they didn't add it immediately after the leak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt I would guess they would be quite pleased. The 'leaked' tag seems to add another level of interest for people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt Do you think the studio would even mind? It's promoting their film, after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theneedledrop Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day, there'll be no more need for language and we'll all communicate via animated gifs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave Thought so. I just wondered if they were a super famous company (that I hadn't heard of) or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebysheppard I did think of the MOT symbol, but it's only similar in that it uses triangles and straight lines. Might be ok there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Do you actually know of monogram coffee or did you google image search?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshyftw Yep. those are quite similar. Hmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ol_taylor_ @MrRamsbottom Maybe a little. Mine says "non" so, it has a purpose innit. There might be loads of kinda-similar things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Right... but what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I just designed this, but it reminds me of something. Does it remind anyone of anything else? #logo  http://t.co/90aAEcyCj3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@p_maloney yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp That's the only thing you have. Last year there were multiple problems streaming it, too, meaning the first 5-10 mins were lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp In summary, I can't believe you're still in business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp Plus Netflix has series/shows you can actually start from the beginning on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp You cost £6.99 a month and have next to nothing worth watching, and Netflix is £5.99 and has a huge selection. Why use NowTV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp Most of your other content 'box sets' (i.e. start from the start of a season) have been the same since 12 months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowtvhelp ...I would only have the chance to watch episides 8, 9, 10 of season 4 (for 2 days). Why would I want to start there?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You wonder how they manage to get all this funding and talent behind the films when the script is so poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah, pretty disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you're aware of Nolan's fondness for plot callbacks you'll know exactly where the film is heading from the first 5 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, there was only one or two standout shots in the film. The rest is a rehash of 2001 or other Nolan films.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chanston_ I would but my Goldfish would probably eat them. He refuses to die and he craves the taste of Sci-Fi, which is a killa rhyme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiesol If you want it enough, and you believe in yourself, there's no limits to what you can achieve. In Gmail.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just wanna hug your mama in her Subaru hatchback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Yeah, the trailer looked fun and it had a great cast, but it was a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CultVultures @peatreebojangle I saw it at the weekend at Grimmfest. It was awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBradshaw1 Why did they do that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Yeah, I'm going to see if I can stuff my travel guitar in my large travel rucksack thingy and wrap it with clothes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Really? You can go 2 weeks with just hand luggage? Yeah I'm checking my bag and bringing a small backpack for hand luggage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Yeah, I got some but they ran out at the Market Street one, I'm sure they have more now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell Sure! I'm going to try and book that wifi thing to pick up at the airport. I'm sure it'll save our bacon once or twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell I saw them in Drive but didn't look. Did it make sense with our rail pass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_amNell need to check out that pocket router!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TNLUK the problem seems to be that my limit was £5, and the website won't let me add money at any amount. It says it's too little or over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner does that mean I can stay in?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive I'll do that, thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Yeah, the tracks I've recorded always seem too quiet and half the sound seems washed away in the compression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Yup. It would be great to be able to mix myself, but I suppose that might take a long time to learn to do properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Wowzer :/ Yeah, I'm sure it's worth it, but it would be pretty costly for a whole album I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Cool, ta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Is it expensive? I really have no idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Where do you record? I just record at home (badly). If I eventually get enough good songs I might get them properly mixed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@p_maloney Ideally all busy roads should have a separate cycle lane away from the main traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney The common sense is that as a cyclist, in any accident, you're coming off much worse. So it pays to be vigilant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney I haven't seen much of that as a driver or cyclist, but most of those can be applied more often to drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney I've sat in a car before when the driver beeped and shouted at a cyclist for cycling in the green cycle lane! Idiot driver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney In your experience, what do cyclists do that is wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney I drive and cycle, it's so much easier for dips in concentration in a comfy car. Cyclists are constantly aware of everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney I'm not saying cyclists don't cause problems, but the vast majority of the time cyclists are more aware because they have to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney @andyburnhammp In my experience it's mostly fault of a driver in an accident. There needs 2b many more (and better) cycle paths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney @andyburnhammp I love cycling, but constantly feel like I'm risking serious injury to do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaraWritesStuff Me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It's asking me to download a huge TF2 update :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I can play shortly if you're still playing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I might be, but I wouldn't go over to a neighbour and ask for money for something that isn't their fault (or problem).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's more her attitude that I was doing wrong, or that it's only fair to pay half [of something that's nothing to do with me].<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said no. I'd pay some towards it to help out, but it's really nothing to with me, and nothing I'm doing personally. Was I wrong?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Haha. I guess that's it. So many shit action films are only 30 mins long without the slo-mo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Can you remember the last time super slow mo was used that was done well? Other than in The Matrix movies?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bentopliss yeah! I went from joint 1st, then 3rd, then got knocked out of the playoffs! I was not pleased.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heavy gaming over the weekend. My brother came over for drinking and head-to-head PS3-ness then Elder Scrolls Online for the rest. Magical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia @racco I never got into The Libertines. He's better off trying to be a smart-arse, eating sandwiches than making music,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@palmerama Yeah, I was in high school but it was EVERYWHERE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Yeah, it's great. One of my faves off that album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia I heard that, but I doubt it as there's a progression in the songwriting, he would keep writing anyhoo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia They had so many great songs at that point. What happened? Ego? Cocaine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Oh yeah. Reminds me of school discos and my first proper girl crush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickdeSemlyen yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Roll With It was a bit shit, but the rest are great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap *hi five* yeah, shame Oasis gradually got shitter after that, but it's great! Listening to it for the first time in an age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Definitely Maybe is still great, but the songs are better on WTS, which is what counts I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(What's the Story) Morning Glory is still a great album.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom shame he's just too smarmy in the action hero role. Hopefully he'll just start doing more 'acty' roles as he's 50+ now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom I agree, he needs to play more against the Tom Cruise-types.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tom Cruise in Collateral is my favourite movie psychopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom They're not a patch on Terminator: Salvation though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Die Hard is amazing. I loved 2 and 3 also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Die Hard 4 was bad enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom I haven't seen Die Hard 5, but only because it looks and supposedly is fucking awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Look very similar though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Nah, that was this guy:  http://t.co/54UFrBiK7D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom I don't think he was in Die Hard. Can't blame him for that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Yeah. I'm not sure who will want to see them really? Avatar made money because of the hype around the new 3Dness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Yeah, he said that ages ago right? Shame Avatar was terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneSamuels It's mouthwateringly delicious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha, yes, there is. Bit of an old one. There's been plenty more examples.  https://t.co/yzznxWqX9G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must a supercut somewhere of Tom Cruise sprinting towards camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Hopefully that's not spoiling it for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Also, I think Peter Jackson (in cameo) is pretty much the first guy on screen (playing the same guy from Bree).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap There's like 100 scenes in it I was like: WHAAAAA? Even Legolas was awesome! I fell in love with Evangeline Lilly again too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@empiremagazine Just did! It's the film I'm most excited about next year. I think Gareth Edwards can produce the goods. Awesome cast too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MovieJay It's a great film, great performances, but sooo upsetting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched The Broken Circle Breakdown. Totally recommended if you want to throw yourself into the blackest of depressions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennynovels Really? I thought early 20s. I didn't think she was old enough to remember Pacman or the original Mario games.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@p_maloney Yup, I'm watching the Gaming doc. on channel 4 and there was a journalist who looks maybe 22 talking about Pacman :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How old must you be to remember pacman the first time around? Slightly dubious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JaneSamuels Thank you. I would say I'll look forward to it, but looking forward to your death might be a tad villainous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feminism #MancTwester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels Sure, but then they may be doing more damage than good. If you associate 'being a feminist' to 'preaching to the choir'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels @Steve_Worsley It's not a question of better, it's more is it worth mentioning? Of course you believe in equality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels @Steve_Worsley and because it's pretty redundant? Unless you're an arsehole, you're against sexism and inequality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels @Steve_Worsley Why did you take 'feminist' off your profile?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels If I knew nothing about you, and read your bio without 'feminist', I would not presume you are against feminism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennynovels @Steve_Worsley My only point is that, if you believe in equality as nearly everyone does, we're all feminists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley  http://t.co/NKE1cPERzu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley ... or would that be kind of pointless? As people would already think that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley If you're at a gig, &amp; you have the band's t-shirt, do you need to point out to everyone without one that you like the band?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley ...if I was against equality, or if I'm an activist, it would be worth mentioning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley You're missing the point, I think. I'm not against equality, I'm for it, that's the status quo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Kinda, it's not like someone goes: "Heh, no sign!" and lights up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @madebysheppard @oneowlplease ...if you do something more proactive, i.e. are the leader of a feminist group, mention it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @madebysheppard @oneowlplease My point is, unless otherwise specified, I believe a person would be pro-feminism / equality...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebysheppard @Steve_Worsley @oneowlplease ...it's worthy of note. Glibly writing 'feminist' on a bio is redundant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebysheppard @Steve_Worsley @oneowlplease If someone pro-actively writes books on feminism, go organised feminist rallies, then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @oneowlplease Feminism and web design are pretty different. Web design is more niche. Believing in equality is the norm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley Neither of you have 'feminist' in your bios, can I assume you don't care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley Then I would need one HELL of a huge twitter bio to make sure people know I'm against bad things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley And if I DIDN'T put that on my profile, would you presume I'm for it? Or that I don't care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @oneowlplease "I am against abuse against children." Or is that redundant and irrelevant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I think 99% of people believe children should not be abused. 1% are arseholes. Should I put on my twitter bio...:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Just believing in equality is enough, which I think 99% of people do anyway? I just think it's a bit redundant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley That implies that only ,men are capable of saying stuff like that, which is wrong, and kind of anti-men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley what label should people use in their description to show that they pro-actively promote men's rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helloimtom So close...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/3pFcpPLHWk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @oneowlplease ? So you're saying some feminists don't believe transexuals should have equal rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Couldn't this just of easily been reversed, gender-wise? Is it only guys who msg girls?  http://t.co/o6sIDsgp9Z #sexist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley My wink there was aimed at you guys, in case you missed that, have another ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley It's women who are the problem, clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley ... enough to write about it and include it as one of the things that 'defines' them as a person?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley I don't see what the negative stigma was. Are people really against equal rights for women these days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley ...it's kind of a given. If i wrote: "I believe murder is wrong." on my bio, it would be a bit redundant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease @Steve_Worsley My point is, do people really need to make it clear or be 'proud' that they think women are equal to men?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It shouldn't mean different things, though, right? There's a pretty clear, simple definition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Possibly. I would just presume all the women I stalk would be feminists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Ha, ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw you don't believe in equal rights for women?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I don't write 'equalist' on my bio, would everyone presume I'm male chauvinist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a reason why a lot of women write 'feminist' on their bio? Wouldn't people assume they are anyway?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Indeed! There's a single yellow outside which you can park on from 6pm. I think @simonowendesign may be over a bit later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia @simonowendesign Drive over to my gaff tonight and play. You obviously aren't the type to have plans already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simonowendesign @hereinthehive It's a digital piano, but key-weighted, full length, etc. I've just started learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonowendesign @hereinthehive I have some guitars and a piano at my place (near the Arena), you should head over some time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonowendesign @hereinthehive I can get by on guitar, really, but would love to get together. Bit tired of playing alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Awesome. You're a guitar player, right? It's always fun to jam and learn new stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_maloney Perfect. Shame you're in Liverpool though :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They should also make more one-word Sci-Fi films. Moon is another...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley  http://t.co/PiGv5iOQ1D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there an embargo on #GTAV reviews until 3pm? It probably doesn't matter as I'm sure everyone has already bought it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching The Place Beyond the Pines. Couldn't they have made some effort to make the actors look older if it's '15 years later'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is too amazing:  http://t.co/cFcuOEDDDv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like other stuff too though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamming is fun. I like to jam. #jam<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewdeaners obviously there's no good way to kill... but there are less horrific ways. I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewdeaners I think it's because it's a horrific way to die and it usually kills more than the intended target, i.e. more innocents.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Well, we're both past it. I was hoping to a rockstar by 25.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Ha, must have been early to mid 20s. 30 next month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRamsbottom Ha. I'm hoping that when I hit 30 I can grow a proper one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @ottomancer ...unless you can cross-platform with PS4 and PC online. Not sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyHelpTeam Got an email through eventually so it seems to be going ahead. Will I need to be at the property for engineer? bbnd via phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia If one employee is telling me you can't and another is telling me maybe, I don't think that reflects well on the company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia Why is it not the case? The person who I spoke to was very clear that IS the case, despite my protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease They're all such bastards, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia Clearly you can't think much of your own service if you think people can easily go without it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sky give you 'Technical Problems' to stop you for opting out for Marketing emails, phonecalls, etc. Sneaky sh**s.  http://t.co/Ot175BdGTn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia I called a week ago and they told me there would be a minimum downtime of 10 days which is why I'm leaving Virgin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That's why I'm trying to use another service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I've used Virgin for 5 years and each time I move they fuck up monumentally. Including a 10 day (minimum) down-time for moving home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I've had exactly the same with Virgin. They're all fucking terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, me too. The only thing is I don't know if I've been charged or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried to sign-up for #SkyBroadband. Gave payment. They've immediately lost the order and can't track it. Currently on hold. Utter shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, I'm exactly the same on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I like the lens flare! On the blu ray on the first one they showed the ships without the LF and it looked rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I think Snyder is a perfect director for a superhero movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia if I move house will I have to wait 10 days to transfer my broadband or should I use another provider and avoid downtime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, but obviously they're going for 'gritty' this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Lex was in Superman Returns and a lot of people didn't like him. He is a bit of a camp villain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, looks pretty interesting! I'll wait for the reviews though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR ...to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies Yeah, it was kinda shrugged off in IM3. I think if there's aliens you can bring the boys (and girl) in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies Yeah, I really liked Thor. I hope Thor 2 measures up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies I think Avengers *should* have been a huge mess considering all the characters and story, but it worked really well I thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies ... while still keeping the characters interesting. IM3 just felt quite over-egged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies I meant in that Avengers was just a lot better all around and Joss Whedon is particularly great at balancing story with action..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, we stayed for that. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched Iron Man 3. Felt a bit messy to me. I think Avengers has spoiled us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got an odd number for Iron Man 3 at 7:20 at the Odeon. Anyone else want in - in a 2-4-1 Orange Weds?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bmds ... thing is, it will take weeks for HMRC to send the form, which will have the same information as they already have.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I'm not saying he did things *just* for the money. But he did do things *for* money. He'd happily sue the pants off anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco It's also kinda like saying: "I love my job, I'd work for free! But you'll need to pay me. Billions."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Bullshit. He should've given the money away like Gates if it meant nothing to him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bridesmaids: "Don't worry girls, if your best friend leaves you to get married, you too can find a man and be happy." Touching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecolouringbox I think women are probably capable of not being so lame, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecolouringbox Also, if life is getting tough, they'll go and put their nice cosy pyjamas on and hug a pillow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecolouringbox Yeah, but it seems about 95.26% of films with a female lead is about needing a man and marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah! I was starting to warm to him because he was good to Arya, but yeah... you can see why Jaime and Cersei are such shits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap ...I hope the giant gets his own spin off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah! And that Jaime fella. There's so many characters now that some are gonna go quiet for an episode...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah. Food poisoning is hilarrrious. Did you like GoT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecolouringbox Am I?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I trust women aren't like that in real life, but I've never met one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Bridesmaids. How come all women in these types of films seem obsessed with marriage? IS IT CUZ OF OTHER FILMS?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I tried to write a song tonight, I've been playing the same chord progression and melody over and over and I never want to hear it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boagworld Don't think so. You can change the alpha on the element, but not just the background. You'll need a .png with transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After about a million years I've gotten around to learning the solo from The Beatles' Something. Which is my fave Beatles song innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Cheers. I'll remember that. I've been passive-aggressive and put a domestic violence print off in their mailbox. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke Nice one. Didn't know about 101.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixelenvy Hmm. It's a tough one. They go at it often, screaming and crying and thudding around, really full on. They've stopped again now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartySchwartz Hey Marty. This week I've made a free little web app that helps people master their guitar scales:  http://t.co/fWJIuJAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik Surprisingly well. I've never had a problem with it runningly slowly, even when I've had big files and/or loads of apps open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik Yeah, bit of a pain! Hopefully it'll be useful for some people though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik I don't actually, still use 5.5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark @katiemoffat The Ford Bumweasel is the choice of Dentists everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik I still have a Macbook Air, yeah. Main PC is still the workhorse though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik I did think that, yeah. On the smaller screens the headstock is hidden, but there is a lot of it... cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik I think there should have been a full stop or comma there: "I didn't!. Gave up!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik Also, I'm just testing out this guitar fretboard app thingy I've made this week:  http://t.co/LKVdWrLV - any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popmatik I didn't gave up! I was probably too tired. Set up all up nicely on PC, just couldn't get it going on Mac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave I've fixed that mobile header thingy as best as I could. Have a look if you get a chance and let me know. Cheerz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrybailey There's time for that when I'm dead! Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Homebrew says Node is not installed, but I can't install Node because it's already installed. Great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skiphubley Sweet. It's this thing:  http://t.co/LKVdWrLV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Ah right, yeah. I've noticed that myself. I'll see if I can fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Yeah? Nice. :D I got told to add some more scales so trying that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Cheers for looking. Shame I can't test it on all devices :/ Can you send a screenshot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia And cheers for checking it out also!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Ah, ok. The background isn't important really, I noticed it's not great on phones. Do you think folks might find it useful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark cool, ta. I’ll add them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark @SoundTechnique @gazwheeler cheers folks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark super. Can you think of a particular scale that would be useful to have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark It's this thing here:  http://t.co/fWJIuJAX - Does it make sense? Do you think it would be useful to folk? Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fullstopnewpara No need to be awesome! I'm certainly not. It's a note interactive fretboard jobby:  http://t.co/fWJIuJAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Ta dude. It's this:  http://t.co/beIUTgfz - does it makes sense, as a general user and as a guitar player?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, any #guitar players out there want to help test a little web app I've made? (cc @madebymagnolia and/or anyone else interested?)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt I've sent you an FB invite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9avin Yup. Doesn't make any sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But general freelance work is: "guaranteed income"? Banks are stupid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Agreed! I never finished Fringe though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I think is the 'show creator' he sets them up and starts them off, but usually moves on to other things, hence the dip.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, it's v. good! I wasn't sure about the Chris Rock casting, but he doesn't ruin it, which is nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Films watched tonight: 2 Days in New York (relationships, death), Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (romance, apocalypse). Pattern?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my biggest vice has got to be either my insatiable lust for Tesco's Finest Nut Granola or my addiction to Mexican black-tar heroin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco How about some Francis Bacon, cheer the place up a bit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You could get around that by burning your fingertips with acid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Started using Chrome Canary for my front-end dev stuff. The dev tools are much better than standard Chrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found this:  http://t.co/4ckS0vbQ Most amusing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I think the 'Strawberry Fields' character was stupid. But I DO think she's hot, so I let it off. The other did have a story tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR In Skyfall Bond gets shot twice, falls off a 200 foot bridge and is seemingly drowning, but he's fine. Not even an issue?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, that would have been better. Also, I liked QoS because Bond is still on a revenge mission because of Vesper...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I agree. Though I never thought the relationship between Bond and M was strong enough to build the film around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR 2/5 for me. I didn't believe that either Bond or Silva would care so much about M. It was never explaining why they would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, that's the excuse. They should have just made a documentary rather than filling the film with annoying nods and winks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR It didn't have any smug self-referencing or nostalgia that Skyfall was riddled with. What was your fave bit of Skyfall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I preferred QoS. It was a bit over the top, but less smug and more exciting than Skyfall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I've still not completed Arkham City either :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR ...As both TDK and Skyfall had much better films before it, but people went crazy for them. I didn't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, but I'm not the only one who dislikes them both. We're an elite force, us naysayers. I think I was particularly annoyed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I don't think it's that difficult to make big films that take huge money. It's all marketing. I just get annoyed when it's poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Maybe. That was rubbish too, as you know ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I think wasn't convinced with Silva at all. Seemed too pantomime and the lack of an actual Bond face-off was weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @Steve_Worsley Sounds good to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley You playing it on Steam? I think I'm going to get Black Ops II when that comes out (on Steam).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I'm glad you enjoyed it more than I did. I'll watch it again in 6 months or so and see if I still want to slap it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Oh yeah? What did you think overall then?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco you didn't like the film?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm not sure actually. I guess there's a lot of story to take in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who watches The Watchmen? Me. I still think it’s great and that Zack Snyder did an amazing job with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneliesemack Nice one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I think it felt a bit rushed. It wasn't terrible, but a little disappointing. The Magneto revenge bits were probs the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, he'd be a great Bond. X-Men First Class as a bit pants. And was he in Jonah Hex?? Didn't see it tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR For all it's problems, I enjoyed Prometheus more than Skyfall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR *facepalm*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR ...but then again I remember you liking Hellboy 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Ha! I need to watch that again. I enjoyed it a lot more than Skyfall :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I know! We're due an argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR You do that! I'm sure you'll love it :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissJayneLouise Eww. With the raisins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @racco I think I'm just gonna stay in tonight. Sorry to be boring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to this week's @wittertainment podcast. Comforting that there are others disappointed with #skyfall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJasonHearne @FlashBackFans me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork oh god no! You realise I'll never take your movie comments seriously again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer much better title!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think The Big Bang Theory summarizes all that's wrong with the world. I know it hasn't killed anyone or anything, but still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, "you cannot see the eyes of the demon until he come callin'."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you come home drunk and need a film to watch half-way through, I recommend Predator 2. Doesn't take much awareness of anything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The dude in NoES is wearing a Joy Division t-shirt. He must be a sensitive outcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe because Rooney Mara is in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. Not. Sure. Why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah. GoT is the best thing on TV at the moment. Long may it reign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR GOOD GOD MAN LotR IS INCREDIBLE. As is GoT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sandrajpk I thought Avatar was too indulgent. The story was lacking, but the effects were good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never realised before but dogs were the first earthly creatures in space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, but his character is dead :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave I know, right? Not sure I believe it yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR but then again it's easy to butcher a script.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR You could be right. Unless there's already a script written, which would make sense if it will be released in 2015.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empiremagazine This true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the Marble Hornets / Slenderman thingy. I think you'd perhaps say something if you're being stalked by a mythical creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave You should man, the quiz starts at 7/7:30 or something. It'll probably finish before the other thing starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching The Blair Witch Project. I've always quite liked it. I think more films should be made for 0 budget as it makes folk more inventive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Coolio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave where you going for Halloween? You should come to Common for the dress-up quiz! I'm going as Stay Puft.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Pretty good idea that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should stop watching films with girls in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching The Five Year Engagement. Chris Pratt is the best thing in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe girls go for likeable and rich actors or something. Weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is Jason Segel or John Krasinski secret in that they get to marry and/or date Emily Blunt and Michelle Williams?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, and I'm a big fan of his, which is probably a big reason why I was so disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Then you might like Skyfall. It just smacks of the old Bond which I found lame. I liked the gritty new Bond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR probably true. I'm really puzzled why so many critics seem to dig it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Ha, I was with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Agreed! Now it's all back! Complete with caricature villain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark I would agree, but Casino Royale did a good job of modernising the franchise and explaining why Bond is such a dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I would probably agree. Skyfall just felt so slow and boring. All the old cliches are back that i found so annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Maybe, it was so uneventful I've forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I was hearing that too. Really liked CS and even QoS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark I really liked the new Daniel Craig Bond films. With Skyfall they've gone back to the tired old (shitty) formula.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a shame as I really like everyone involved in the film. Only took them 2 films to ruin what made Casino Royale so engaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw #Skyfall. I'll be in the minority but I thought it a slow, trite, clichéd and just a dull film served with sickly Bond nostalgia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're interested in what my 'gym glasses' look like, they're something similar to this:  http://t.co/r4ymJMvh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to the gym but forgot my 'gym glasses', had to do without. I may have been jogging on the rowing machines. No-one said anything tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer, my friend, is probably about 4 or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many roads must a man walk down, before he admits he's lost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched Take Shelter. Really impressed with it. Michael Shannon manages to restrain himself for most of the film. He's great in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I've added you. TF2 is free and on Mac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What's your Steam username?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork How long can Bruce Willis keep pedalling the old-man action hero thing? Die Hard 5 looks awwwful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fun night tonight! But clearly way too debauched as it's 4am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah? I could ask, cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies :target too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I would like that, thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley A splendid idea... does it also work for Twitter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the word 'band' denote some kind of musical ability of its members? I thought if you're singers or dancers you're more of a 'group'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I guess that's actually rubbish as you wouldn't taste it. Maybe you could install the taste too. WHO HAS TIME TO CHEW?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Or with food. Would you like to install burgers and fries?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco What bus do I get from Piccadilly Gardens to Manchester Academy? It's so fucking difficult to find out on the net.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco LotRO is free... but PC / Steam only! You need a mac crossover or whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You need to join the LotRO guild that I'm started with @Steve_Worsley et al.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco ALSO. Halloween party next Friday. Be there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah? I could... it's cold in the living room though. I should stop playing games and do other stuff. Or finish the games I've got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheShA Not on Steam! MW:2 (2009) is still £20!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit much that MW:3 is still the same price on Steam now as it was a year ago when it came out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I quite like the new pixie girl who the dude is dating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I quite like Oregon. She seems nice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katie_khan He verbally agreed to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucPestille I only started watching them recently, up to date now though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm oddly invested in the Fresh Meat characters. The cute blonde one who was supposed to be nice is actually a huge, huge evil crazy person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gomark I cannot confirm or deny the torrent question *they're watching us* but not started MF yet. Maybe be going as a zombie :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark Yeah, Daniels is good value. Sorkin's shows seem convinced of their own amazingness... still a lot smarter than 90% of shows, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched the first episode of The Newsroom. I do find Aaron Sorkin's TV stuff very smug... I'm sure i'll get into it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Do some sweet talking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not feeling great today. Can't use my left arm as my shoulder is killing me and after a shower I can't hear anything out of my right ear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CheShA Well they should have all died on the plane and spared us 6 years of build up and no pay off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheShA don't get me started on LOST...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty scary watching The Plane Crash. I chose a seat that would have killed me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm watching Magical Mystery Tour for the first time. From the drubbing it got on release I expected it to be a bit pants. Lots of fun tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave I think people will usually do both. If they like a band, they won't be put off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Have they actually done that? The review is only one person's view, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Pitchfork have given them pretty favourable reviews in the past. I wasn't too impressed with their recent EP.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Good findz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia @rideawave I think most of Ridley Scott's films are better looking than they are actually good films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Yeah, still doesn't make it better tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lommination The Blade Runner thing? It was mentioned when the film was released. Doesn't make it any better though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Prometheus again. There really is some stupid stuff in it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap As you're 8 hours ahead or something, maybe we're looping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Yeah! The folk in the cinema liked that too. "I'm from the future!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Poor guy hammering on the door with his stumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Ah! I just typed that same thing a second before you said the same!  http://t.co/HUfePrnW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants I really liked that he's the good guy and the bad guy. My fave bit was the first Looper to escape who er... went to pieces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Just wasn't really needed. Bit distracting. Loved everything else though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Yeah, it made me salivate which watching, which all my favourite films do. Still not sure about JGL's make-up tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus I'm ridiculously in love with Emily Blunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen #Looper. I totally boned it. Felt like it was 3 different films. Really kept me guessing until the end, which is a rarity, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'm not sure I fancy seeing Ill Manors, there's a horror film fest on in Manchester this week... I might check that out possibly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Ta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington ok cool, just gimme a shout then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington See you at the cinema at 8? If not before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really doubt The Smiths will be playing Glastonbury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks You probs need your get your best friend to bang your g/f to get the full experience. And then dance around all emo jazz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Like Spider-man did in the film?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenOakes I personally feel a little embarrassed for not seeing the connections before now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington I can do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington 18:20, 20:10, 21:10?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have an Odeon 2-for-1 voucher. Anyone fancy seeing Looper tonight? @Steve_Worsley @thesophiew @racco @markbebbington ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenOakes That's some pretty impressive work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barely_original Ha! That's great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HEY EVERYONE:  https://t.co/5otCgiZC (I've shared this before but it's worth doing every hour or so).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave ...just a couple of freelancers on the road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave you should come on a Far East trip with me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it was a year ago today I started my trip across America. Need to go on another adventure soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at North Tea Power (Manchester, Greater Manchester)  http://t.co/WnN2lHPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork I liked Spanglish. Seems not many others did though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stoker trailer looks pretty interesting:  http://t.co/60cBlAkc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRichardKelly True. It makes everything work though. Sums out everything about the characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Indeed he does! I didn't watch the last film he directed though, with Paul Rudd, etc? He needs to make more films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also just noticed that Shane Black is in As Good As It Gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoeyes Yeah! It's awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How do you write women so well?" "I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticed that Avon Barksdale is in As Good As It Gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybuchan I've signed up for The Gym at Piccadilly. I just need the basic running machines and stuff. Pretty cheap too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would have been embarrassing if I got off the treadmill and ran face-first into a wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just been on a treadmill for an extended period for the first time. The ground still feels like its moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneowlplease It looks more affordable, I was just wondering if it would be really busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew What are the peak times?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else use The Gym, in City Tower Piccadilly Plaza? Wondering is it's always busy or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheShA Cheers dude! Do you go there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking of joining a gym in Manchester City Centre. Anyone recommend any?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think when people boast about how hot their boyfriend / girlfriend is, it's always quite funny to let them know you agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking to my gay friend in Australia about girls. Yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss Yeah :/ I need to get a proper fitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This bra is killing me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I've probably had worse, maybe I was too drunk to stuff my face with bad food when I got home, which helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ye gods! This is a hangover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave UNBLOCKABLE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems i'm drunk. Go f*ck yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Realised that girls are as mental as guys tonight. It was a little disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Bah, I'll just head to Tesco now and grab something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco On Church Street? When will you be there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Should we meet at the shop? Which / when / what / why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Are you going to the shop? I need to buy alcohol. I'm not sure hungry tho, so I might just grab a sandvarge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Bring doughnuts too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You can bring the iPad and we'll jam on GarageBand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hopelarson How dare you! I would NEVER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco que es correcta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Made perfect sense to me because my Spanish is asombroso.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco Si usted trae la pizza, lo haré bocado en tus bolas de carne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Come around after work if you'd like, I can meet you for food or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst (best?) movie death scene ever:  http://t.co/cECs9vtc (via @empiremagazine)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Then no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley yes, why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You fancy coming around tonight for some drinks and card games and maybe Underachievers later? (cc @jonnohopkins)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really digging the Melody's Echo Chamber album:  http://t.co/A6KkH7eI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yeah, I'm pretty busy today too. Next time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I might be along later this aft if you're still around.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley YES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Lizzy Caplan is busy being married to Chandler or whatever. Loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I think that girl who I mentioned is moving in. She's just sorting it out with the letting agent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lizzy Caplan is New Girl which makes it 300% better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Everyone else in it is pretty likeable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithio At least she's the 'bad buy' in 500 Days. In New Girl she's a producer and is so trying so desperately be be 'quirky cute/cool'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope no real girl is as annoying as Zooey Deschanel in The New Girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Common Bar (Manchester, Greater Manchester)  http://t.co/aiz03lgX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys don't have to give birth though so I guess it evens out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How come in films and probably life it's always the dudes chasing the girls? We're gluttons for punishment, perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer you'll end up on a qwack handle again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer clarky cat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching In The Mood For Love. I've been meaning to watching it for maybe 5 years or something. I've been busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Apparently somewhere there's a tree with 'Jesus woz ere' carved into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco If you fancy a few shop-bought drinks and some playing cards you should head to mine. Going to the Roadhouse later on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @racco Cool. I think Robbie &amp; Steve might be heading to mine earlier for cheap booze and MAGIC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @racco Sure, I'll go along. There's the Underachievers night on this Friday... not sure if it's your thing tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I remember you saying, yeah! Talented chap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, kick-ass:  http://t.co/Cutp27Wz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching a film with Steve Martin in it... you know, the banjo player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew He's a good looking chap, I've no idea if he's single.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Very, very tender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth He seems pretty stereotypical in his Frenchness, he was v interested in the kitchen. He also said he never uses microwaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Oh crap, maybe you're right. I need a flatmate who's going to make me look cool, not like a dweeb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a nice French chap come look around my flat. He's pretty good at guitar, apparently, which goes in his favour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlashBackFans It wasn't the start of a joke. I was actually wondering what they snack on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah! I'm used to the Director's cuts now, so it was interesting to see the original theatrical versions again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rideawave Thanks for coming along tonight chaps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also @FlashBackFans what do Aliens / facehuggers eat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet Alien / Aliens double-bill tonight @FlashBackFans. I think Ellen Ripley is my fave action hero and Alien Queen my fave movie monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aliens! With Steve Worsley and Robbie Douglas. (@ ODEON for Aliens w/ 5 others)  http://t.co/o0akhu37<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave @Steve_Worsley Steve, you still coming for Alien? If so, what time will you be around?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekin Absolute not. That was the terms of our relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>* think that should have been @FlashBackFans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just picked up tickets for the Alien / Aliens double-bill tonight @flahbackfans - who's in?  http://t.co/8zc04gAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palmerama She promised me she never was. She could have been lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Must have been!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Just glad I did get to sleep, couldn't sleep the night before. Eventually nodded off about 4:30am :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley No, she made me feel older as she was about 4 years younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ex girlfriend wasn't 10, I might add.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had all sorts of crazy dreams last night. One involved finding out an old girlfriend was going out with a ten year old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianjamescox @ryankent Ta! Yeah I've got a spare room as my current flatmate is leaving early Nov. It's 12 Thomas Street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark ... so COME BE MY FLATMATE AND LISTEN TO POSSIBLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. Shoulda ended with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The couple upstairs are stomping around and screaming at each other. She keeps screaming she's going to kill herself? :/ :/ :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FionaGales Yeah, it looked like a total macho borefest, but it was really affecting and emotional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FionaGales It's great innit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, saw Lawless before. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Not perfect, but absorbing and pretty brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/WcGgUJ5k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katie_khan It should be splendid! Hopefully. I do like Daniel Craig. Hated old Bond though. Bourne FTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan Vesper was the only decent Bond girl, I think. I'm looking forward to Sam Mendes' Bond though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan Is that true? Huh. QoS wasn't as good, when you compare it with Die Another Day, it's pretty incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan Did that not happen in CR? I get confused. Also Eve Green is so utterly stupidly hot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan She already had a boyfriend! #slut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had fun tonight. Ta to everyone I chatted to!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, but without money Twitter doesn't exist, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @twitter They're probably also trying to make money, which can be excused to an extent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Letting Agents have it pretty sweet. I wish I could get away with not doing what I say I will 99 times out of 100 and still get paid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Yeah, but he's 7'6" wide. He's like those weeble dudes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Me and Tom Hardy could team up and take you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Especially after I beat him up and stuff. He'd probably lose all his confidence with the ladies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour @RyanDownie Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Can I be in it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap He's like, 5'9" or something!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I haven't watched The 'Burbs since I was about 8. I didn't know Tom Hanks was married to Princess Leia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinybiscuit You can't manage £5K a month rent? Pfft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching The 'Burbs. YEAH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lauren_PeachTea Is that you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foymania Howdy. I think I might be moving out myself also, so it would be up on Rightmove or something pretty soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One look at you and I can't disguise, I've got hungry eyes, I feel the magic between you and I. You're welcome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MancCakeClub @The_Lady_Sybil It's £600 including bills and stuff (other than Electric which is quarterly).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinybiscuit Excluding. I think it comes to about £600 a month with everything expect electricity which is quarterly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinybiscuit Your rent would be £465 before billz. I'm not sure if I'm going to stay or move out though, but the flat is ace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Was thinking about it, but it's just too expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GLARB. Been looking at flats in London the last couple of days. I'd need space as I work from home and I just don't know if I can afford it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, just finished watching Threads. I'll now need 3 weeks of comedy to balance me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Threads. Because Sundays aren't gloomy enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@talesofwhatever one of the best I've been to, I think! Much fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yup, people just need to have to balls to be honest with people, rather than take the easier option and string them along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Rather than: "... I'm really busy this week, next week?" and never speak to them again. Just harsh and a bit selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap But, if you're not interesting in someone, you need to be a decent person and say: "You're great, but it's not going to work"..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Opposites attract, babycakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I think people should just be honest, it's a myth that dude are the unthoughtful ones, women are just as bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco But you're already in a relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dating is horrible. People should either be in relationships or be single. No middle ground; it's littered with barbed wire and explosives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw @jonnohopkins do a talk at @talesofwhatever of whatever. He was really good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins OK, I'll be over shortly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Ta dude! Very useful :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Thanks again, I should really get myself in gear and go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz It would be nice to live alone again, but I doubt I'd be able to afford it. I'll have a look tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz I'll have to do some searching! How did you get your flat? Are you sharing or on your own?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Cheers, I can see me moving there sooner or later. You liking it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz True. Where abouts should I move and stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz I do like London, but I'm guessing it would be pretty expensive &amp; difficult as a Freelancer with no guarantee of income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies Cheers dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies I'm a Freelance Web Designer / Developer! I'd like to go to America, but they're not letting people in, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danjdavies Ha YES. And also it might be nice to do something new, I've lived here or hereabouts all my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I reckon I need to leave Manchester and do something different pretty soonish. I'm thinking of moving to Sunnydale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Kurt &amp; Courtney. It's almost a spoof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carrie_l_hall Still terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Yup. Recruitment agencies are paid on commission, so just throw people at a company until they hire someone. Not great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of question digital agencies who have to hire recruitment agencies to get staff. There are better ways, right? I.e. @authenticjobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Cool, I'll head over then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I'm sure I could be tempted, yeah. What time you heading there?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork He's great in it. It's also Tom Hanks' last good film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, but he's already James Bond, so it's hard to be bad after that. He should though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Road to Perdition. I don't think it gets the props it deserves as it's pretty great. Also, Daniel Craig should play more bad guys.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The music is pretty awesome in @common_bar tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisryan sonos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurajehane It's the Manchester Marathon I'm doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurajehane Yeah. I ran about 15 miles the other week and it was the boredom that was the worst, that was about 2 hours :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurajehane I've signed up for the marathon next year (which I've never done) need to sign up for some half marathons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurajehane I got 45:31. I was pretty happy as I was walking the first few minutes as it was so cramped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some more DVDs here if you're interested:  http://t.co/NUVd0K12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurajehane Not happy with that? What's your 10k PB?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Cheers dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad I finished the run before it started peeing down. That wouldn't have been fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco bits of it are rather pretty in the sunshine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welcomebrand Loads less people than the Manchester 10k, but they just set everyone off at once, so there's queues to get over bridges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Much nicer run around Salford's watery bits than Manchester's streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss ta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, got 45:31 for my #salford10k time. Happy with that! Especially as I had to walk for the first few minutes to due to crowds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are always good value, also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw The Bourne Legacy. Wasn't expecting much but was impressed. Lacks the energy &amp; finesse of the others but still a decent thriller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke That would have been better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eye of the storm.  http://t.co/diX090RX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamsamfreeman Thanks dude! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yo. I've got some stuff to sort out at home today, I'm sure I'll be around another day though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yup. Just seems way over the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/RbAUWc5w It's very nice, but is it really, like... needed? Be better without the parallax perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrangeHelpers No, I'm in Manchester. This has happened before. The text never arrived. Can't you just give me a code?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shyamagolden quite welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shyamagolden awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrangeHelpers I've DM'd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orangehelpers I've texted 'FILM' to 241 and tried calling 241 (and selecting option 1) but still I'm not receiving my code. Waited 3 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orangefilm I've texted 'FILM' to 241 and tried calling 241 (and selecting option 1) but still I'm not receiving my code. Waited 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something unsavoury going on in the flat above. Lots of screaming and stomping about. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I've had loads of women leave me because I'm too awesome at blues guitar. it's kind of chicken-and-egg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carrie_l_hall Wow, that does like a pretty impressive adventure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been checking out Garage Band's blues guitar lessons the last couple of nights. I'm so awesome now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katie_khan That IS odd. Are we replicants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, if Deckard was a replicant designed to hunt other replicants, then he'd probably be designed to not get his arse kicked all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few thoughts on Blade Runner: It's easy to see who the replicants are as they all have light discs in their eyes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Blade Runner. I think I always liked the production / set design more than the actual film. Also, Sean Young is super hot in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjharrop I'm just gonna carry a briefcase any time I visit the bathroom or the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour I'll make a note of that, cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And cufflinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could also get one of those things with my name on it to stick on my desk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It can also be quite expensive... all the trips to coffee shops to prevent cabin fever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Well, it's ambiguous, but people are probably reading too much into it after Inception.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, all the characters had a much better story / arc this time around. And an emotional impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Well Alfred does say in the film he has a fantasy about seeing Bruce in that cafe all happy and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Bane was an animal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, there's the theory that the ending is just Alfred imagining it. There problems in the film, but overall, very awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR We agree then eh? I was really blown away. Going to see it again next week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryFord Yeah, well there's loads of LotR appendices and Silmarillion and CoH stuff they could film. I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds as it should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It's harder to design for widths for Macs as they vary a lot more than PC users as you can't maximise as easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss cheers dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer cheers! You drag to the end of the screen then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryFord Yeah! Way more simple than any of the LotR books. Apparently they're saying they want to film some of the meatier appendices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez. How they possibly stretch The Hobbit into three films?  http://t.co/BtTGxWWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheShA I always pull the edge to the full width, but I presume most people don't do that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap that was a slightly better twist, but you see several close ups of the 'twin' and even Michael Caine points out its a lookalike<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork @palmerama I would pretty much agree there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palmerama Perhaps Fight Club, but not Zodiac (although I really like it). Panic Room is one of his worst, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliandoesstuff Another almost perfect film, but I think Seven might just sneak it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redswish Yes, thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@empiremagazine One of the highlights of my week is catching up with your Podcasts. Should I be worried?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Wow, a Terence Malick Superman film... "What does it mean to be a Super... Man?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisryan Bit late! I've read a few reviews which didn't provide a warning :/ still plenty I don't know though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisryan I was tempted to go as I'm very impatient, I'll have to wait until tomorrow night though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisryan Tea? You saw it then? Worth the early morning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the people who went to the 5am screening of Batman enjoy their coffees today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eve_Barlow What did you think in 5 words or less?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markbebbington You coming out tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington I did indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco coolz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Bring her along!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @markbebbington @racco we still meeting tonight at 6pm for some food then to Big Hands?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimTheGuest I'm on a contract with this one for another year I think :/ I can pay to upgrade, but it's not bad other than shutting down(!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Galaxy SII is getting really good at just shutting itself down without warning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington probably working and gaming. Gonna force myself to go for a run shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @thesophiew @markbebbington Everything involves Marks balls in one way or another. Sure ur welcome! Just heading to Big Hands at 7ish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukesBeard Pretty good isn't it? Usually Steam are really stingy with their offers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @markbebbington You should come out tomorrow Mark, you big ballbag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @thesophiew I might stay in now and play Batman to save cash if I'm out tomorrow night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmoitie @rideawave Catchy, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Yeah, I knew they were playing. I saw them when they did their Alopecia tour at the Roadhouse. Was pretty ace. Might come, maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @thesophiew Yeah, what time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @markbebbington I can do that. We'll see about the crunking, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @thesophiew Ooh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @markbebbington Not sure about the time but a curry might be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @markbebbington Not sure about the afternoon as I'm heading out to Big Hands in the eve. Fancy that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @thesophiew @steve_worsley I'm up for that. Not sure Steve is checking his twitter though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @markbebbington yeah, I'm gonna join Mark for a drink later and out for Dan's birthday tomorrow at Big Hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey I think The Beatles toured from '57 to '66. And The Beatles were the resaso the Rolling Stones became successful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey I'm not sure if 'living the rock and roll lifestyle' makes you an influential band, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey The Beatles toured a huge amount both before and after they were huge... and still toured until Sgt. Pepper, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey BEATLES FTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FionaGales Yeah, I don't have long hair either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco @jonnohopkins Nah, it's ok. We have a front-room booth as well. Likeabosses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @jonnohopkins I'm in Common now with @gablaxian welcome to join!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charltonbrooker What if you're tweeting about an event? Hashtags do still have a point at times. It's a tad annoying when they're overused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK why is Tweetbot for Mac better than TweetDeck? Keep in mind I don't like TweetDeck all that much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mofgimmers Fake boobs to make up for lack of brainz?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall This current one is called: "Batman Drives Around in His Cape For a Bit" - probable spoiler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Cool, me also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Cool, well we'll have to meet up this week if fancied some social coding-ness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Are you back in the real world now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually listening to it quite loudly. It's AWESOME.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to the Dark Knight Rises Soundtrack. Hans Zimmer knows how to make things sound HUGE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Hmm. I thought it was interesting, but far from perfect. I kinda wanted to see it again, but I'll wait for the blu ray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yup. Probably true. It's not all bad though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah, I went to see the new Spiderman film the other day. It's not bad, just... not really needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHewitt @jamescdyer I'll come along, if you'd like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR *they're<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR They might, yeah. There already saying it's the end. They'll just reboot again in 5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Let's hope so! It would be a dramatic ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I shall reserve judgement until after. I do think I like Bane more than the Joker (from the trailer) so, we'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Likely will be. I hope there's a better story this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if I wasn't already excited, this last Batman trailer really nails it:  http://t.co/D701m0m1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Was he being sarcastic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds oh, AREN'T I? Nice 'tache btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That's probably it, yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmoitie Oh, you mean, when is the new bassline ARRIVING? Thursday, hopefully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But that's probably because I'm not cool and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think people sound a bit silly when they say (without irony) that something is 'dropping'. I.e. "When's the new [something] dropping?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting little article. I've learned a lot:  http://t.co/u9kgdpVx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_ward ...but only in The Innkeepers. She looks pretty boring other than in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_ward Ha, fair enough. I call dibs on Sara Paxton though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_ward It's probably best we think of her this way -  http://t.co/Ht5BH0jc In a car boot or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_ward Alison Pill? I discovered that recently too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Katie Holmes if he's not interested. I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Tom Cruise will marry me now?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh Thanks for help anyway dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I tried that before, didn't work though :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I see what you mean... Infinite Scroll has a pathParse option (to hopefully decrement the urls) but I don't know how :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh in Net? It does seem to be incrementing upwards, but I'm not sure how to change that, Infinite Scroll has a pathParse option..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If any super-mega developers (particularly #InfiniteScroll users) could help here it would be super appreciated!  http://t.co/vUTXYiEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I conditioned my beard. It's like wearing a dream on my face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning. Have a super moon walk:  http://t.co/HUkOxl2Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingScooty @markbebbington @tim_brook No probs dude! Next time then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingScooty @markbebbington @tim_brook Cool, if you fancied it we're meeting at 8 as there's usually a queue for Imax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else around want to join @markbebbington @tim_brook and myself for the new Spiderman in Imax at 8:30pm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @tim_brook Should I meet you at 8 then? Usually a queue for IMAX ness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've heard Murray do quite a few final speeches after losing out. I really admire his honesty, it's difficult not to feel bad for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose that's in his contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that Roger Federer puts on all his merch before picking up his trophy and being papped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next year Murray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @tim_brook Sounds good to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @tim_brook I think IMAX is about £12ish. I don't mind which.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @tim_brook Sure... lemme know when's best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Should Andy Murray be aggressively offensive?" - Probably not, there are kids watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope Federer bottles it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseHigham84 Ha, I meant every word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice one Murray.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Muhaha:  http://t.co/JSw87eao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a redundant tweet, but best of luck Murray, really hope you stuff him. #gomurray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charltonbrooker It's about making history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they playing a Bagpiped version of a Coldplay song for the Scottish section?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw 2pm probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sports coverage important questions: "Will Andy Murray be excited / nervous to be in the final of a massive Grand Slam?" - I would say yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Were they trying to chat you up? I've used that line before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Shooting aliens is pretty awesome though, granted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I think Tennis is pretty exciting... one on one... best players in the world. It's not Cricket. Or Golf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Miserable bugger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseHigham84 That might have been Sam! I think he was a big soap fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseHigham84 ...probably something to do with sex also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseHigham84 Ha! What did I write? Something amazing no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinely really pleased Murray has reached the final. Hope he keeps his cool today and beats Federer (who always seems smug to me).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lawless could be pretty interesting. And a screenplay by Nick Cave, no less.  http://t.co/9g9iLDRt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Why tha-hank you! Has Prometheus landed in NZ yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trickeedickee Ta dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annefgreaves Thanks again :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry to pester about this but after the DNS problems yesterday could y'all have a quick check that this site loads ok?  http://t.co/498fIaQe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is my 4 year Twitter anniversary, apparently. I wish me all the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @snoozywoo Does she know it's supposed to be taken orally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sandrajpk Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The prompted @BRINGUPUSERNAME is useless in TweetDeck. Brings up about 2% of the people I follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts The worst thing about it is that it can take about 24 hours to try and correct something. Grr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts Thanks, it's an annoying DNS issue it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It's an odd one. Something to do with the DNS propagation I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It works fine for me, but doesn't work here:  http://t.co/ha60pqEI but does here:  http://t.co/h9l6DNpi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz I shall. Tarz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz I bought it a couple of weeks ago, strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjharrop Possibly, yeah :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Ha, yeah! It's a double edged sword. The page SHOULD actually load tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone smarter than me got any idea why a website will load for some people and not others? is it a #DNS thing or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annefgreaves Superb! Thanks :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ricfurness Ta. Very odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunian Cheers for that, really odd tho :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can y'all check if this website is working (ie. the page loads up) for them? Seems to work for some and not others:  http://t.co/Qan3Y5gj ta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HEALTH's soundtrack for Max Payne 3 is pretty awesome. #np<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @ottomancer Ha, true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermodeMovie Alien3?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, ace job @KingScooty! #digitalheroes2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah... it was very going to live up to those two. Though I would like James Cameron to come back and direct the next Prom movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, reviews seem to say it's falling into the trap of having incredibly impressive visuals but little drama or suspense. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, Paranormal Activity 3 is far more scary that you'd think it'd be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, my expectations for Prometheus are dwindling as there seems to be quite a few average-y reviews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Youbetcha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm going to see it on Saturday night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielrclark I'd eat all their cereal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenlaverne AMAZING isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Paranormal Activity 3. I think if I were a ghost / demon I'd think of more exciting things to do than sway ceiling lights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah! I got an eyeful and switched back. Something about bodies... I guess that hasn't spoiled anything though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave You having fun dude? Make sure you're lotioned up... just how I like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap If it isn't I'm going to have you scourged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eh? Seems there's a full plot write up on Wikipedia for Prometheus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall @someofmywork I've still got my IMAX ticket, so I'll be seeing it anyhoo. Interesting to hear what others makes of it, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall @someofmywork I'm waiting for the Empire review, I mostly agree with them. MOSTLY. *said in Newt voice*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh, The Guardian have only given Prometheus 3/5 stars when I was expecting 12/5 from the promotional stuffz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using Google Docs' Drawing tool to layout a site wireframe. Nice and simple to use, easy to share and comment on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm totally drinking a cold beer right now. Up yours non cold beer drinkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Just tried the old method and it works... :/ very odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Should be the same thing though, really... only the class names have changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Yeah. BAH. Ta though. Must be something simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz they've changed it now so it's: &lt;!--[if IE 8]&gt;    &lt;html class="no-js lt-ie9" lang="en"&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Yup, just used the default HTML5BP set up. The modernizr classes are showing up, just no conditional IE classes for IE7 &amp; 8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz It's kinda top secret :/ but I'm just using the usual heading, but my .lt-ie9 styles are doing nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thathurtabit #H5BP, even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any devs got any idea why the conditional classes for older IE on my &lt;html&gt; tag aren't working? Using latest #H5BL with Modernizr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithio Ex-hactly. *cries*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, Snowtown is one of those films that you can appreciate and at the same time never want to put yourself through again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snowtown is pretty brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I haven't already warned people enough, JustHost are the worst company in the entire world. Avoid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah! Watched it this morning. Totally :0000<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It'll be upsetting for people who make websites, anyhoo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's upsetting when you see advertisements for IE9 when it's already so horribly out of date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellzenner @Savagesband Husbands is ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Yeah, that's what I just watched. It's HUGE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got up early this morning to watch the latest Game of Thrones episode. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think watching Gordon Ramsay get floored by half the England team is well worth the £5 donation. #SoccerAid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! Sweet shot there Kasabian tool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"They've got Ron Burgundy and Austin Powers up front..." #SoccerAid is quite entertaining so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia You watching Soccer Aid? It's a little surreal looking at the line-up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap A lot of people didn't like the 2nd, I thought it was ok, not as good as the first, but didn't hate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap BECAUSE IT'S ACE. Quite excited about the Sam Mendes Bond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to seeing @BearInHeaven at @SoupKitchen_Mcr on Sunday. Their new album is possibly my fave of the year so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Need a photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think I'm alone on this, but I'd really like to go for a drink and a steak with Ron Swanson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Tupperwareaway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Dude, you haven't seen Alien or Aliens? I have them. Get 'em watched!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @ottomancer It brings an extra dimension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @ottomancer I think I'm willing to go all out for Prometheus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer 3D IMAX might be pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody want to have sex with Vincent Gallo?  http://t.co/XTvtt9ja via @wefail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Prometheus viral:  http://t.co/wnWJnXu0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_alex_fisher Ah, I hadn't seen that, ta :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamthomasbishop I agree. But they do a pretty good opener on all. Maybe 15 Step or You from Pablo Honey is a little gem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the message 'this video is too small' YouTube's way of moving people away from watching their content on Facebook?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a face in my coffee. #skillz  http://t.co/4ktooPTK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer The new Beach House? Their stuff usually grows, the hooks are there, just needs a bit of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap yeah! CHOP HIS HANDS OFF ALREADY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley I liked the first, the 2nd doesn't seem to have the same angsty surfy pop. Or only too obviously so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap The guard was all... woah! The dangerous guy has just killed the other! Better go in with the key and be an easy target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ogvidius and it is awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, like: "Pssh, who cares?". I get really annoyed that they don't chop Jamie's hands off. He's still alive, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I think Theon's pirate scamps went and roasted that farmer's children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I said Best Coast was a bit rubbish, Beach House's new album (Bloom) is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap My initial thought was: "OH SWEET BJNFIWF" but yeah, don't think it was them. Better not be! Awesome as usual though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkiosk @msimpsonian Pretty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cathryn_Ellis You will, I'm sure. It's worth playing a few times to let it unfold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Beach House, your new album is amazing. #np<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. Just killed the big boss Dragon in Skyrim and didn't even capture his soul. #FantasyWorldProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good GODS of Westeros! I really, REALLY hope the ending to the latest episode is not what it seems. #gameofthrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia ...only not as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia I really liked the last album. Seems she doesn't really know what to sing about this time and rehashes the first...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must say, not terribly impressed with the new Best Coast album on first listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke Well, more being able to use &lt;?php bloginfo('url'); ?&gt; rather than a hard-coded URL, but I can see the problem you're pointing out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know a nice way of using PHP inside a #WordPress Custom Field value?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Jean-Ralphio:  http://t.co/hG1nRQBj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia She's OK, but Beyoncé had one of the greatest videos of all time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsLRCooper Splendid, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Very, very true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do kind of love all the Parks and Recreation characters now. Even Jerry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Deftones is such the right choice sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stripeyflowers Thought so. As you were!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts @rideawave GAH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stripeyflowers Where is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave There's just no comedy at all. It's one joke, that isn't funny. OVER AND OVER - that the dudes are geeky?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia Not hot enough to put with watching it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco That IS handy, nice one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I realise that you can get pizza delivered, but can they also let themselves into my flat and bring it to my bed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irpetedotcom @tmoitie @madebysheppard UGH. Thanks, but I'm never touching alcohol again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's only one thing that can cure a hangover this huge, and that thing is crying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive WHAT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Well giz a text when you're nearly there and I'll head over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah sure, what time will you be there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What time are you around later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Went to Common for a Maple and bacon burger! And then went home and cried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I'm super late in pointing this out, but the Google+ redesign does make everything loads better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley You always did have a voluptuous figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Much like this, I'd imagine:  https://t.co/grTQvmfg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley They wouldn't let you in, eh? Wise of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @jonnohopkins I'm going to eat at home but I can meet you whatever time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley how was your BoozeDog experience? Worth a visit? You hungover?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @jonnohopkins I'll join you chaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @rideawave I would have done but I'm hearing it's not very good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Ha, you'll hate it :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah I have! Really, really enjoyed it. Joss Whedon did such an amazing job as by rights it should be awful. Awesome instead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone should make a YouTube montage of cars exploding and flipping over in mid-air. This has to happen at least once in every action film.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>PS. Hollywood execs, stop giving jobs to Michael Bay and let someone with intelligence write &amp; direct. #teamwhedon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rideawave Yes! I don't mind 2D or 3D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, was genuinely one of the biggest shocks / upsets I've seen. Films can't really do that, I don't think. Or rarely.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markbebbington @thesophiew Ah I see, you're not together! Well, I've just opened a beer at mine now, was going to just say hi in Common.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember kids, where possible always use that :first-child selector rather than the :last-child to prevent IE stupidness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Nice! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pingonawin Might give you heartburn though. Horse meat be tough. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yes! And pretty much everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kris_jeary :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how film featurettes always accompanies a mention of a 'visionary' director with a picture of them pointing and looking serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I have a Mac you pleb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco To moan more about Apple?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Doesn't for me, annoyingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I agree, but I want to watch film trailers on the stupid f**king Apple site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QuickTime just does not work on PCs. I've installed in multiple times and always get 'Please install QuickTime'. #shit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Live_for_Films @hereinthehive I'll have to see it next week... but they'll all be dead by then. :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've purchased a #sftoc12 ticket. You should too.  http://t.co/UEoSPRUc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cssgareth For freez? :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I agree... but: "I like to laugh?" No shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoeyes ha, you knows it! I'll check out Alabama Shakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoeyes I've been listening to Slave Ambient a lot, good album!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoeyes Rails eh? I've never messed with any Rails stuff. Music wise you should check out Bear in Heaven's new album if you haven't already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoeyes Hey! I like Crowd.fm, can I ask what you built it with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Manchester Thursday has been raining and windy all day though. Am I trapped?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareomahoney Yeah, probably best not to live in it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareomahoney But can you, like... live in it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap It's Friday in New Zealand? #witchcraft<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, no-one else for "Show Roy Cropper Your Mate's Chopper?" #ShowCropperYourMatesChopper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camera_obscura_ I miss you. Can you release another album soon? Maybe come play Manchester too? Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork There's always a shortage of genuinely good Action or Horror films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Ah, I thought I read it was partly American financed or something. Looking forward to it though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Yeah, that is odd... an American financed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to seeing this when it comes out:  http://t.co/2mpNSbdh Looks pretty kick ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ev4n81 Thanks man :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke True, it makes more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ev4n81 I hated that song! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley He has a daughter?! Rufus is the gayest man alive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenOakes I thought the same about Prague. I wasn't sure whether I should be thinking it's cool and edgy or a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Rufus Wainwright's new album. Used to listen to him loads, he still has a oddly soothing singing voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke So does punching yourself in the face, but I very rarely do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Kind of! They extend whichever leg their hand - hip combo is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do so many girls put their hand on their hip when someone points a camera at them? Is it genetically predetermined?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @Steve_Worsley Ha! The 70s version looks amazing... Next Weds sounds fine though, I suppose I can wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...seems about right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Swingers. So, the dude get dumped by his girlfriend, mopes around a bit, and then Heather Graham picks him up at a bar...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave @Steve_Worsley @thesophiew Christ, that sounds amazing. Smashing up cities and breathing fire with a massive, like... wallet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It kinda makes sense to split into lots of little ones as you can switch on and off the files at the @import level...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, I do like Bootstraps way of splitting things up... just gets tricky after a while.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@boagworld It's amazing, eh? A real timesaver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zdarsky Personally, I would have opted for the B over the 8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p @HarryFord Yeah, I think the first few season 2 episodes have been more expositional... should be pretty interesting from here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryFord @Jamesp0p Best episode of season 2 so far by quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHOA. Just watched this week's Game of Thrones #whoa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andybuchan Apparently so, but I just wanted what Meg Ryan was having.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybuchan Hey, I was there the other day :D Had the pastrami sandwich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can probably buy it in Tesco, but whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brought some peach tea back from America. It was a good move.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I've had some pretty horrendous dreams though. Perhaps incriminating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yesterday. No comments on my socks, please.  http://t.co/94YfIOyh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miles better than JFK, LAX, or London Heathrow at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to be stuck in an airport all day, you should consider Washington Dulles. Decent free wifi, clean, spacious & smooth jazz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M1ke most probs! Getting fat is quite fun though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I think I just want to go home and inject Skyrim into my veins... it's been too long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had an awesome time in NYC, though I'm looking forward to getting back to Manchester, despite hating every single one of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I'm stuck in Washington Dulles airport all day today. Can't check my bag in for another 4 hours. I think I'll just sit and eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm down for Avengers tho, sure!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Was the future self tweet with regards to Looper? You should kill your future self.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive I promise to ruin the film forever for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive I guess I'm a sucker for a well written story. TDK just didn't 'flow'. But we'll continue this another time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Did it work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Ha. *ahem* classic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive I could go on for hours! :D TDK is one of my pet hates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive I really liked Batman Begins as it had a proper story and wasn't as unintentionally funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Honestly, I think nothing in the film worked. I'm looking forward to TDKR though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive Nah, didn't. I don't get how so many people really liked it... but I probably like some pants film too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive @Redswish People would probably notice a burly dude dressed as a bat legging it down a hallway trying to be inconspicuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive @Redswish ... and not to mention his frequent disappearing act from public places, i.e. a bank or a fucking police station.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive @Redswish The way every line in the film feels forced. How convoluted the plot is. How ANNOYING Batman's 'voice' is....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereinthehive @Redswish SERIOUSLY? It's really quite bad.It's really badly paced and frequently ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish I really liked Batman Begins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish No, you didn't like it did you? It's a ridiculous film... and I do often like 'superhero' films. (I'm aware Batman isn't a super).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gablaxian At any level, a website made in the last 10 years might be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I kind of agree, but for a company the size or Virgin who rely on their website to do important things, it's a bit of a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgin Atlantic goes on the list of huge companies whose websites are beyond terrible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stripeyflowers I watched it recently too... pretty brutal. Really great though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eve_Barlow I'm glad Homeland was able to remind me how ace Claire Danes is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I still hate The Big Pink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liking the new dashboard UI for #WordPress 3.3 - I thought the last one was a bit clunky. Some nice new features too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching last night's Black Mirror. I'm a sucker for a dystopian love story, but why are all the Northern characters abhorrent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Gor for it! My hi-fives are pretty much always free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aloox2 I do indeed! A clever script written by this dude:  http://t.co/wTwtbdeK - v.easy to set up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm up to season 4... really liking it though. I think season 5 is actually season '4.5' according to Wikipedia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants I'm at the start of season 4. Digging it so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Really? Does it let itself down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That said, I haven't reached the end yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think most shows tend to become weaker as they go on, but Battlestar Galactica seems to get better and better. Really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants I've got the first couple, need to step away from the computer for a bit and read words on paper like ye olden timeses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants Are you reading the books or watching the GoT show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timharbour Yup. I'm watching the first week's. I'll maybe watch this week's later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a week(?) behind and I'm catching up with Black Mirror. What was the confusion about? It's ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lommination It was all a big sexy dream.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok. Would anyone be kind enough to view the following link and let me know if anything fudges up?  http://t.co/9VCZLNq6 - thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been experimenting and created a little website to pimp myself out this weekend. I shall tweet it shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2nd attempt. Who's out in the NQ tonight, then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallodom you're on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallodom I've been using .less for this thing I'm doing. Pretty nifty. Makes more sense to me than .sass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Super idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Ah, that's very good of you! I'm just in a bad mood today. I'm hoping tea & coffee will sort it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Just can't afford to buy anyone anything or even go out! Bit shitty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #tweetdeck also doesn't give you the option of deleting spam messages. Shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camera_obscura_ Come back and play Manchester soon, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, the #Twitter version of #TweetDeck is shit. Where the hell of all the settings gone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next year I need to concentrate on making money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being completely broke at Christmas isn't the best thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallodom do you still use Aptana? I'm giving it a go for this project I'm doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaikdean @Steve_Worsley @gnimbley To explain, IE is a delicious bag of food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @jaikdean @gnimbley it was something to do with looking at the image locally... And IE being a bag of f***.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thompop Well, yes. Unfortunately people still use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely stumped. IE 7, 8, 9 refusing to load a .jpg. All other browsers load it fine. #wtf?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redswish Boxing day I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's probably has something to do with how stylishly David Fincher markets his films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm quite looking forward to the new Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film... even though I've kind of, you know, seen it already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gomark I was watching it before and thought the same thing. Bill Pullman never hurt anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm surprised and not at all displeased with the amount of boobs in this film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Yeah! EB&D is funny... this isn't. So far, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Your Highness. It's a bit rubbish, innit? It's got Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman in it though, so I'll shut up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Leahnsf Jeez, they could have waited or something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>'Feels' is the only Animal Collective album I've ever *really* liked, I think. So there you go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charltonbrooker Quite the recommendation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yarcom Are you dating her or something?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm going to Liverpool tonight. My question for YOU is: 'Should I go to Liverpool tonight?'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave They've done this twice. Each time I get my websites down for days and the new server is JUST AS BAD. They're  a f**king joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomark They're expensive though. I've found another (local) hosting company, but I can't even more my sites as the JH server is down, again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of my websites down again for nearly 6 hours now. #JustHost are officially the most ridiculously incompetent hosting company on the web.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_Nimrods @racco I hadn't thought of narcotics, how short-sighted of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew That looks pretty cool! I might go check that out too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I ever get over my fear of dogs, I'd have to get a leash like so:  http://t.co/egVv7fMX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could play more #LOTRO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it there to do at weekends when you're not drinking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You mean when they FORCE you to watch the anti-piracy shit after you've legally acquired it. Very, very annoying. #fact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That chocolate binge has left me feeling anxious and paranoid. *hides*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Touché.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins They looked rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hinches @Steve_Worsley I'll be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It might be because right now I'm high on whole nut Dairy Milk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco *live<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, they may as well show the whole thing. Losers. I'll go as it's free and just down the road though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@threads_letters Yeah? Brave. I went to the first Tales, but I'm more of a listener as public speaking terrifies me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pet Sounds has to be one of the most lyrically bleak albums of all time. Probably one of the reasons why I love it so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HEY EVERYONE. I'm still looking for freelance web design / development projects to snack on. Holla at me if you hear of anything. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No alcohol for me this week. I mean it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave I think that's the fairest way to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave @tim_brook Do Dominoes still do 2 for tuesday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it in slightly poor taste to release a posthumous album titled 'Immortal'? #michaeljackson #hesdeadyouknow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_brook You can play both, you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave Tuesday perhaps? How about @tim_brook? Fancy some tasty CoD?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Maybe The Witches! That was actually scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@common_bar Whoever writes the specials these days has very fine handwriting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'm going to head over soon, but not today I don't think. Maybe when I have money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Agreed. I just don't 'get' Argento. I think his films are crap. Someone should make a serious attempt at making witches scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there's an ideal time to play Leonard Cohen, it's Sunday mornings. Or maybe late Saturday nights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall I totally hated Suspiria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Congrats on the big 4-0!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like Laura Marling and that, but I can't listen to the new album because of those guttural spoken words she throws in. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Julianne Moore was hot in Short Cuts. I have a thing for girls with red hair. See also: Lauren Ambrose, Alicia Witt, Bryce Dallas Howard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently women (and men) who have a particular fondness for Sean Bean are called 'Beanstalkers' - which is awesome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah! :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Morrissey is just an older version of Robbie Williams." - Steve Worsley #KillWorsley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totes, @racco - we should start a #KillWorsley hash. (cc @Steve_Worsley)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit, just noticed Steam got hacked? Can't we all just... get along?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Sometimes I've no idea what you're talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Smiths remasterings sound good. I remember listening to them on shitty rerecorded cassettes when I was  about 13:  http://t.co/IpN1q2mc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryFord Thanks for the endorsements on Zerply!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've created a profile on Zerply if ya'll wanted to add me as a contact and make me feel popular:  http://t.co/qYlGih8o<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice chatting to all you folks at ND last night, some old faces and some new. You know who you is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryFord Shit, really?It's getting awesome reviews. I need to complete about 5 other games then I can get onto it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spicy pizza at 23:30 was a good idea, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Where you fooding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That can't be real, can it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irpetedotcom I think maybe between half 6 / 7. Smell you there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley What time are you heading to ND later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using #responsive design methods in #webdesign is difficult if you don't want your design split into rows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve yeah, that was odd. To save money whilst I was away, I ate about 300 footlong subs as they were on offer. Not in one sitting, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve Back in England now, was a splendid month though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve How's NY treating you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia You're quite welcome. Arise, newly cool one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevenOakes DANG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @ottomancer @nicksnuts @lisaashurst @gtrufitt I shall be at ND.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enough designing things, I'm off to shoot things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt Isn't ND tomorrow? This Media Thursday sounds similar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just dribbbled:  http://t.co/rOPhDI01 a draft of a new logo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sewdarnhappy Ha, thank you :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've created a page on Google+ for my freelance stuff. It includes a not-finished version of a new logo.  http://t.co/xEJUnWLo Circle it, yo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look, it's @hinches  http://t.co/xPrkic69<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You keep your Wings, bub.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, with the exception of George Harrison:  http://t.co/vjJ3Yd2U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing more joyous than The Beatles. NOTHING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Just kidding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the next computer I buy will be a Mac. If I can afford to buy a Mac at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oklahomacafe nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha.  http://t.co/EqoRy43x (thanks @thesophiew)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave @Steve_Worsley Cool, well I can do it next week or the weekend if you fancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do spam bots think putting a half-naked lady as their avatar will make me take notice? (Because it does.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rideawave @Steve_Worsley Totes! You should come around tomorrow and if we fancy it we can head to ND afterwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suns Irrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Do you really? You should totally bring 'em over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley @rideawave Also, we need to have a PS3 CoD:MW3 night. I think @racco should buy the game, bring it over with a gamepad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley I don't mind where, really. Sat? I'm easy tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Live-tweets story of emotional breakup:  http://t.co/5Fqaifuh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'd be up for that, sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Battlefield 3 looks amaaaazing on full-spec PC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PS. I call dibs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Sharon Van Etten is more than a little bit lovely, eh?  http://t.co/17zOuCJC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was nice seeing @twinsistermusic the other night in Manchester. They've probably made my favorite album this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went for a run this morning... not very far, mind, but it woke me up a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decided to buy Battlefield 3 for my PC. I'll probably end up buying CoD:MW3 on PS3 when I'm totally rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley A bit of both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebymagnolia @vigor Too true. I try to be harsh with myself, or just remind myself I'll get chance to make it better next year or sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working on the redesign of my portfolio website at the moment. It's painful, but it's nice when I think of a good idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I think I might get BF:3 to give my PC a thrashing... I might get MW3 at xmas for social playingness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit. So, should I buy #Battlefield3 or #CallofDuty #mw3? Battlefield is pretty cheap on PC...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisntr Yeah, but I'm not even sure I have time to play it at the moment. I've still got about 3 other games to complete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisntr I'm finding it difficult not to download it whilst I'm sat in front of my computer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish It's awesome, innit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone know the stage times for #TwinSister tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Are you not getting Uncharted 3?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley MW2 was ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley The reviews for BF:3 have been good, if not quite spectacular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Whatever, you'll totally buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanLunn Yeah, I guess. They usually do it with films that have had poor preview screening feedback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan *3000 hours. Jeez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan I do love an epic RPG. Shame I haven't got 3000 to invest. :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanLunn I guess people will buy it regardless of reviews. I'm guessing they've done enough now to not ruin the formula.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone seen any reviews of #cod #mw3 considering it's being released tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hatmc ...and eyes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Coolz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yazz sounds good. I think some of us are meeting in Common for some foods and that, but we could possibly come on over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahlmorgan Snog her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I could be the Nigel you've been looking for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I think I might be a Nigel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Nigel... I like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As in: "Oh, did you see what she was DRINKING?! She's a total liquid drinker."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is everyone still using the term 'hipster' as a confusing putdown? Can we move onto another one? I suggest 'liquid drinker'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Isn't that always the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins I thought everyone knew...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Was that because you hate disabled people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hatmc I think what they didn't explain on th advert is that they'd been chatting for 6 months prior online to make sure they're not rapists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hatmc It's harder to have the sex appeal over a keyboard convo: "You got pretty face, lolz, let's date."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo I'm wonderful. Shh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone new out there in Twitterland fancy meeting up with a few of us for a drink or so in Common later? We're all ace, especially me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt Cool, give me a text or tweet when you're around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Eww.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley What time are you coming down later?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rednewsom It's making everything more java-ry, go with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Coolz mcoolz. I believe that's what the latest saying is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @racco I forgot to mention, don't let @jonnohopkins in on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley I'll grab food if you guys make it down in time 'n' dat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Did I not include you? Muha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @thesophiew @gtrufitt @racco @rideawave Fancy a drink or two tonight then? If so, what time?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Okydoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I could come along for one. Anyone else going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns What restaurant is this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five-0!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bah, wish I was at #fieldday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ma boyz.  http://picplz.com/fppJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should probably, like... go outside for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ps. Way down in the hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to watch The Wire again. Not sure how many times I've seen it through, but it's quite a bit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm at The Castle Hotel (66 Oldham Street, Manchester) w/ 5 others  http://4sq.com/pe1yQY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Cool, I'll head over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, I can come meet you where ever you end up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megapants They grow up so fast, don't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hugsformonsters I think maybe U2 and Coldplay are the same band... maybe not Bon Iver.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Drinks on you to celebrate, great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Oh no you di-unt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisee Ha, yeah :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool. Could potentially be involved in a big project for the next month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco You THINK therefore you ARE a thing capable of self-awareness. I don't think my fridge is that advanced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Or at least it'll THINK it's cool, and vaguely superior. Might still give me food poisoning though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun night at #northerndigitals tonight. Talking is fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you fix a fridge that isn't keeping things cold? Sacrifice a lamb?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave yeah, we're heading to Barcelona Bar shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm sat in Common now if you wanted to meet me. We can go to PS if you fancied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What time would you be at PS? Might be getting some foodz with Sophie if you fancied that. Soup Kitchen or somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badmachinery I think he's playing Lex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting into the new Horrors album now after a few listens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Common Bar (39-41 Edge St, Manchester) w/ 4 others  http://4sq.com/oMWqA3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm at Ghost Horses Website Design (Jewel House, 12 Thomas Street, Manchester)  http://4sq.com/oCrtIs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irpetedotcom Get your ass there, boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's going to #northerndigitals later?  http://bit.ly/qtdyJU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to the new Little Dragon album. I just thought you should know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon626537 Yeah, interesting chap, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pepsi White, anyone?  http://bit.ly/qUcqVp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle How about this?  http://bit.ly/fHyi1C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Yes, son?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First image of the new Superman:  http://bit.ly/qzlDWU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw an elderly guy, maybe in his 70s in the NQ the other day... totally covered in tattoos (face, head, neck, etc.) anyone spotted him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisee Tears... tears from heaven. Or rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer A cheese, crisps and daughter sandwich? Think of the carbs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithio Were you watching... Deep Throat, or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian @jag4091 And it's the gift everyone can enjoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer 1st and last, maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Did I say mask? I meant headscarf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Yet still quite hip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sorted out my mask for @thesophiew and @jag4091's party tomoz.  http://picplz.com/fthk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Why must you be so crude?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew All sounds good to me, let me know what you fancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew True 'dat. What time are you going to ND tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Right-on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave That's a big ol' blaze. What time will you be about later do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Galley More like this:  http://bit.ly/aSlVJX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave You coming to ND tonight? Might find a new job ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9avin :0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins @racco Crap. I forgot it was the Northern Digitals meetup tonight, come along. Might still head over to PS for one though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @jonnohopkins anyone fancy an IPA tonight at Port Street?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9avin Steve Wiebe is a hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9avin I love that film!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh ... as I'm already well past the estimated time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I'll try to keep my cool, I've offered another alternative, and also reminded them that I would require further payment...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I'm reminding them of that now, I've offered a sensible alternative already, which they rejected. I'm trying to suggest anothe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer ... and then leave them to mess the website up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I've done what I told them I would do, but now they're suggesting silly changes. I might just ask for the rest of the money owed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh Doesn't make sense and is making things pointlessly complicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh They want to replace the text in the navigation with images... then they want to click the icon to reveal subnav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I'm not sure I'm willing to do it if it means the website will no longer function correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone got any ideas about how to deal with clients making silly requests and not listening to reason? I think I may have to fire them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins I went for a run today too... it's not easy in the heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do like the 'Hide all posts from... ' feature on Facebook. Makes the whole thing much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins ...by running further, but just pushing myself as that would be pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins That, that would be pretty ace. We've missed the Great North run this year too... but I'm going to start pushing myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins I should probably try a half marathon or something first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Yeah? Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle HOLD ON:  http://bit.ly/pNDPXJ 180 miles? Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I'm on my way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Could do. Is that more that 26 miles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel the need to do something drastic. I thought: "I'll run the London Marathon!" but that's already closed. Maybe 2013. I'll sit down now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Is that at the cinema? You've seen it twice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, I liked how it was set in WW2, but they failed to grasp any of its gravitas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just been to see Cpt. America. Very 'meh'. Unintentionally funny and just felt quite... cheap. Made Thor look gritty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Hadn't seen that... but I'm not sure they can compete with this:  http://bit.ly/n4wIL2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer You'd be ok with that, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a sad state of affairs when you have to say: "Actually, if I do that... people won't be able to use the website properly."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I heard the blu-rays were just a transfer from dvd and no real changes. If there's new stuff, I'm getting them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...which is annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've found that many clients think it's so important to stand out with their websites, they're willing to forgo functionality and usability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, on the DVD. And me too... I've seen the Extended LotR documentaries about 8x more than the films now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The run I'm going to go on in a bit should be fun, I'm already sweating just sitting down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah. I was watching the Monsters documentary last night. Really inspiring stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, it's not out over here yet it seems. Looks cool though. Did you like Monsters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES. And I wonder if Troll Hunter is out in the UK yet... hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's with girls always taking photos of their feet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Shall do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Not sure, I said I'd go to whichever ever is easier for Ste and Beth, I'm guessing about 7:30 or 8?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer You in? Can I be the hot blonde bass player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Yes I do! Sweet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching the making-of Monsters. It's so amazing how such a tiny crew and such a small budget can make such a great film.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I heard that, yeah... but then I think he just ended up using the same people :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I meant creator as in Producer, really... just to clear that up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I.e. for Freelane friday, I mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Yeah, I've seen 'em. Looks good... I hope it picks up, the end of the 2nd season was a little flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Give me a shout if you go along and I'll join you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't get enough of the Washed Out album at the moment. #np<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Yeah... she's super-cute that Alison Mack lass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR Ha, I ended up watching a bit of an episode the other day when I was making some food. Everyone is very, very pretty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR I agree with you(!) I wasn't convinced with the weed-ifying of Chris Evans, but I'm hoping it'll be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, isn't Captain America supposed to be out this week? Haven't seen any reviews yet... that's usually a bad sign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth Meh. The first two were average at best. Even the Potter fans I know admit the films aren't very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco but i've always done that! Pah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth You did, it's better you know this now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Well I can meet you if you want, I'll probably head over about 6ish or before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@technicalfault You're probably right, yus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technicalfault I went for a run today, I think my exercise quota is spent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Yes, I like big, hairy men. They're cuddly. Make you feel warm and safe. I just... needed a subtle way of letting twitter know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technicalfault Probably. I'm more interested in hairy men then Chicago Bears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @technicalfault @waterchevrotain  http://bit.ly/qYYXcG it's changed to Chicago Bears now *wipes brow*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technicalfault @racco It was *cough* just research for... em, *loosens collar* is that the time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waterchevrotain Dare I? Oh, go on then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm... if you type 'bears' into Google search, the first result is the slang term for large hairy homosexual men, rather than the animal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco those @LulzSec chaps are good, but with my help... they could be the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Did a good job there, they did.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Agreed. Cheeky tikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Cool, it's pretty awesome. I think a couple left halfway through in my screening... not a film for everyone, it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish I went to see The Tree of Life the other day. Really ethereal and beautiful... and probably a bit indulgent. I loved it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish What you doing at Cornerhouse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleigh Bells are a better version of the Ting Tings, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz It would be a hell of a way to break up with someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a sucker for a backwards guitar solo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy horrifically rainy and depressing Monday morning everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phingersphil I've got another couple of minutes left in bed then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisee more boning? Insatiable. Have fun in NYC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to see The Tree of Life today. An intensely beautiful film.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @vickythornley  http://bit.ly/pq7Mjf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Agreed. Although I don't think I've seen Edgerton in anything other than the Star Wars prequels for like... 4 seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Nah, decided against it... instead I'm ODing on Cheerios and watching 30 Rock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If so, blame Bryce Dallas Howard in The Village... or the blind girl who just started working at 30 Rock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it wrong to want a hot blind girlfriend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave The John Carpenter version is amazing... I've never seen the 50s version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALSO. Please, horror movie trailer editors... STOP putting cheap 'jumps' in at the end of the trailer. It's no longer surprising / scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trailer for The Thing prequel. It's got Mary Elizabeth Winstead in it, so it can't be all bad.  http://bit.ly/no8i97<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR It was way more fun than The Dark Knight ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley There's arguments Steve, and then there's PURE BLOODY VIOLENCE *points at you*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@studioeNaR You're totally right! If 'ruled' means being overly-self important, poorly written and frequently ridiculous. ;P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave It doesn't matter if they follow you tho, you don't have to follow them... same as Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Everyone except you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Just sent you some info on G+ :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Sweets! My mum was there last week! I'm sure you'll dig that shiz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Oh yeah... where you off to again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley If I can't find the time to sit and watch the films, I probably can't be bothered to read the books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @vickythornley Y'all excited about the last Harry Potter then? I should probably get around to watching them one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's handy that my renewed enjoyment of jogging has coincided with my renewed addiction to Cheerios.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waterchevrotain @AlisonAgosti haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The films so far have been pretty amazing, particularly the Deborah Hayword short. They were just playing Blonde Redhead too. #minorwin<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samisee He did?! What a charmer. Nice word though. I would have just gone for 'smelly' or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Oh yeah! And what a splendid day that sounds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's ghostly serenity to the city centre at 5am. I like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight I learned to play the theme from Top Gun. It doesn't sound quite as 80s or bombastic when played on a acoustic guitar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rideawave Very wise Robbie. It's strange how so many Mac users are SO violently pro-mac. They're probably virgins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco has just admitted the difference between modern PCs and Macs isn't that great, just Mac users just like to feel cooler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having said that, the two girls with guitars at the moment are the best thing tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will girls dance to bands with guys in it regardless of how shit they are? I hope you have some integrity lady-folk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @markbebbington @rideawave What ya'll up to tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really good leaving words out of my tweets lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidnield @Redswish It's definitely going to be interesting... or massively slow and ponderous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is released today. I think I'll go see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It was pretty small, I go there late and was 2 rows from the front. I would have taken a photo but it was forbidden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I really enjoyed it, it was cool to be up close to Bjork. She played a lot of her older stuff too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave I should be able to walk down the street wearing a tiny little dress if I want to and not be raped by beautiful women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington Absolutely not. I just noted I said they were 'quite French'. They were actually 100% French, just to confirm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbebbington I had to escort two quite French girls across town. Then I had sex with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@technicalfault Ta, I'll do that next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also saw Björk's Biophilia show tonight. Really impressive stuff, completely awesome at points. Needed more Tesla coil! #MIF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just back from escorting two french ladies to their destination, pretty typical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns yo, Rob is giving me your ticket, i can pass it to ya.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth I have a fetish for small folk, so... yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irpetedotcom Yeah, still here at the back of the front room.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @boo0807 @rachael_burns What's the plan for the gig later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisee Pah. I preferred Royal Tenenbaums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish I get something new out of it each time I listen, which sounds a bit wanky, but it's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisee Have you been watching Bored to Death? I love that show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Grizzy Bear's Veckatimest was a bit hard going when it came out, but it's one of the best albums  in the last 5 years #imho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kitesglitch You're getting an album together?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Her thirst for blood is insatiable. It's what makes her such an exciting performer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Sure, I think @markbebbington said he's going, but we'll allow you to tag along. We'll keep the snogging to a minimum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Did you buy the Apocalypse Now blu-ray? It's super.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, being decapitated with a blunt sword might put a dampener on things. A sharp blade is fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm seeing Bjork's Biophilia show tonight. Looking forward to it, apparently she chooses an audience member at random and decapitates them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jag4091 He's pretty good, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yeah? I'm surprised how many people are saying go for it. I. May. Just. Do. That.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall That's what I was thinking... I was just worried about ending up with 20 guitars and not being able to play very well ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey I've always played on acoustics, really... but wanted to venture into electrics. Might go for this...  http://bit.ly/qv0Q3E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Give their album a listen. I was really impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey Haha... it's so very tempting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle My present to you is the gift of music played by me on a new guitar. Enjoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommy__Zoom Yeah? I like that thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's probably a bad idea to buy a new guitar to try and make yourself better at it, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethAveyard because it dried up ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I quite like Yuck. I didn't think I would as they've got an annoying name. Very Dinosaur Jr, as I'm sure everyone has already said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth Ha, yeah... they're less punky / aggressive these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth Their second album was really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always quite liked The Horrors... their new song is very 'safe' though, isn't it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@faithio You're one of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why does everyone on YouTube overlay their videos with Evanescence songs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Whoa, is that real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I enjoy searching YouTube for videos of ghosts and finding none that are remotely believable... yet still have 89,000,008 views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasteyh2g2 Yeah, saw that, wasn't sure how much of it was sales and how much of it was ICE CREAM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Yeah, really good film. Kinda wanted more of John Hawkes, but Jennifer Lawrence was pretty great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasteyh2g2 Really? Sneaky shits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLHaworth You play guitar?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork That's true, at the women aren't all violent and stuff. So far, at least.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaikdean It got ridiculously bad towards the end. I think it had the pox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't buy an iPhone by the way. I got a Samsung Galaxy SII. So there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katie_khan Need to renew my Heat subscription.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_khan No way! I thought Rachel Weisz was going out with Darren Arronofsky? #gossip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I thought so, I think @Steve_Worsley's was laced with a healthy dose of LSD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Haha, good stuff! Glad you didn't completely lose your mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And them boys can rock and stuff. I'm enjoying it. #U2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@phingersphil he likes to sing pho-net-ic-al-ly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think what I like about BBC's Glasto coverage is the unknown bands they put on live between highlights. I can't imagine ITV giving a shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I could join for a drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Ha, I even quite liked The New World. Loved the others, particularly Thin Red Line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork I'm quite a big fan of his, so I think I may go and see it while at the cinema. I have a soft spot for 'long and pretentious'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I think at the start of each year: "Yeah, need to get a Glastonbury ticket." and then forget about it until Glastonbury is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really quite disappointed with myself that I didn't buy any festival tickets this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah... seems Radiohead are playing at #Glastonbury. #bastard (cc @rob_leach)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@codebeef How long have you been waiting for payment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds Was it a massive pain in the arse? How long did it take / cost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I'm not an expert, but I think Gulf War Syndrome was caused by too much frigging.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@franisaholden Get everyone to pretend they're asleep like in primary school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've not had a flapjack in like... weeks. I need to remedy that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer huzzah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End-of-the-world weather is back! Yay! It's the rapture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Are you asking me to stitch your mouth to the anus of another person to prevent you from eating pasties? Done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*I love having to delete and re-do my tweets because of mslpelling.s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm going to help you with your problem, by eating 60% of each of your pasties and then putting the rest in the bin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's quite exciting tracking the location of a parcel online, innit? I feel like a spy. Like a parcel spy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must be this tall to read this tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Shit! She ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, end-of-the-world rain shower. Sexy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm probably well behind the times and stuff, but Gang Gang Dance are #amazing. #np<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Not yet... will do soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mynamesnotdave You all set for the 10k next week? I'm smushed my knee up. Need to rest it 'til then. #excuses<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha, sure! Never played it, looks ace tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I've started another quicker one, hopefully I'll get chance to get back to Gazr soon enough. Hit a wall with that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley They sound splendid... my new PC hasn't come yet tho, and I've just started playing around with a new project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @davidnield My start time is 10:55. They've sent me a nice blue Christie t-shirt thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley What time do you start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like I'm in the white band for the Manchester 10k run next week. Is it wrong to use a #whitepower hash? Probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking out the latest Beasties effort. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap It would provide a little stress relief, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to do potentially frustrating work on the back of a sleepless night. Could end in #deskthumping.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Haha, where do you find these .gifs?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hello. I'm finishing my web design/development project soon and will be looking for other lovely work to er, work on... so keep me in mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Pastels FTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin You're so cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing how people can take maybe months to build a complicated plug-in, and then not bother to show how people can make use of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eeee. #GameofThrones is really shaping up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just getting my #GameofThrones on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah. I actually looked up how money goes to the artists today... apparently not a lot :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good heart these days is hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer yeah, I've been heading that way :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to #sftoc today. Let's hope there'll be room to breathe this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must remember to do that accounting thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a big twinkie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zombieland might be the perfect lazy-day film. It's got action, laughs, romance, zombies, Woody Harrelson...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ben Hur is ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had an idea for a little project to keep me busy. I should have ideas more often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah! Kevin Dillon and Jeremy Piven's characters are good... probably because they're actually supposed to be arseholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Entourage is perhaps the smuggest tv show of all time. I'm still watching it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've done the same. Though I managed to shower, which I was impressed with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork I'll reserve my judgment a bit longer, but Hollywood really needs to learn how to cut a decent trailer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Muha. Yeah, point taken... but Thor simply looked cheesy / camp, not a blatant rip of something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork *immortals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork I never got around to watching The Fall. But Immortal does look pants, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watched the first episode of #GameofThrones - really good! Looking forward to the rest of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Galley I remember shooting it out of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I also follow about 600 people on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Pretty much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ah, yeah. I spoke to her on Facebook. She prob doesn't remember :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I canne, I need to try and figure out this ecommerce lark. Also, Hillary Judd? I think she's Fran's friend. Do you know her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although IE9 is a big improvement... it's still a bit shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I've just downloaded Game of Thrones. Tonight shall be magnificent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's lunch time. Does anyone else feel self conscious whilst masticating in public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @thesophiew I liked it because it showed the ups and downs making it more real, rather than the cliched happy ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @thesophiew It wasn't THAT depressing. Were you expecting happily ever after?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Not seen that one, looks interesting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, I've seen that. Great film though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamJRobinson hmm... I may go and see it if it's supposed to be good, but I'll wait for more reviews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leahnsf  Crap, that link was busted, here we go:  http://imdb.to/bjcgAx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Yeah, I didn't watch the 15 min intro, need to watch it all at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Yeah, I didn't watch the 15 min intro, need to watch it all at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leahnsf It's this!  http://imdb.to/i3bpq7 Bean as Borormir Pt.II  - Game of Thrones is Pt. III :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Oh yeah, it's got everything! Babes, blades, battles, Bean. All the Bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p It's the premier tonight innit? I hope so as I plan to download tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leahnsf I watched Black Death recently. Did you see that? I was kinda impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Crumb was ace! Thanks muchly for the lend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle It's going to be incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, I'm literally salivating for Game of Thrones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Rach has lent me a documentary about him. Pretty cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That's the chap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It's shit! Just kidding... really interesting characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm watching Crumb! I forgot you lent it to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Which film are you hiding from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Carlos isn't a horror! Supposed to be good though. I'm still waiting for LoveFilm to send this:  http://imdb.to/8yB9Um<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm just looking on LoveFilm. Nothing to choose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are 99.9% of all horror films utter shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I was hoping your cyclecomputer would read it to you. And you'd be all upset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Common Bar w/ @thesophiew  http://4sq.com/fOuEXX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @peatreebojangle I could come along for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hitler was a Pablo Honey fan.  http://yfrog.com/h3k8hlj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach You smell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We all want to be like James Dean." - Scouting for Girls. So, we all want to be dead at 24. Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ha. You could just say it was part of your costume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'd like to do the #londonmarathon one day. Maybe on a bike, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilonacatherine Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit! Quickest #londonmarathon ever! Well done Mutai. Bit of vomit to celebrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenVidEditor Didn't he do the Thong Song?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Bingo Is it wrong that I'm enjoying it too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilonacatherine Haha, spotted it! I should probably read my tweets before hitting enter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilonacatherine Haha, spotted it! I should probably read my tweets before hitting enter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone can run 26 miles, they're pretty much a hero in my opinion. #londonmarathon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlie74 haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlie74 Damn, missed it! iPlayer, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I wonder if  anyone will throw up at the finish line this year? #londonmarathon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Awesome lyrics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also imagine it's hard being a marathon commentator. "She's running!.. still going!" for 2 and a half hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the London Marathon. I can totally relate to their running 42k as I've just run.. um, 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit gloomy over the Barrow-Downs tonight. As always, I guess.  http://yfrog.com/h8m1ktmj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At 27, I'm technically a grown man. Is it still acceptable that I spend my evenings watching zombie films and slaying orcs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craig552uk Yeah! Good film. She's a good actress, I just didn't like her character in Juno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I thought Juno was annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe Ellen Page is 24. It does makes it more acceptable to think of her as cute, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I've seen it before, 'tis good. Just forgot how smug ol' George is, but it suits his character in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Up In The Air. Clooney is one smug mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plenty of drunken tools around the city centre. Must have been a game on or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It certainly is. I'm going to tell them to come around and collect it in future. Fucknuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Like... drown you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You should have mixed the wine with water. I feel splendid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I have noticed that your apartment smelled of rich mahogany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@totmac I've had to pay by BACS. Utter shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously Manchester City Council... how about getting a payment system that works, eh? It's a f*cking joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Do you actually have stalkers or are you just being a diva?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to Manchester City Council for not allowing anyone to pay their Council Tax. Neither Online nor Telephone Payments work. Idiots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco you're all welcome up to mine if you fancy, otherwise we might find you later.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle What's happening in Trof? I might be in Common for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ha. An erection in a public toilet whilst sobbing. Wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle You should try it. It's pretty exhilarating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I usually try to produce a good snot drip, that can keep people at bay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle Yes, whilst urinating. I usually stop urinating after about 40 seconds, but I can keep crying for 40 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I often cry while at the urinal in men's bathrooms. It really freaks people out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo Yeah! Ace website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I think you meant my Balrog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a dream last night where Michael Shannon was eating people's feet. I probably had too much Leffe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'll come over and kiss you and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Chrome is fine though, as is FF. Just Safari makes it look pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Well, Apple did a shit job of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Safari seems to render text-shadow really badly on a PC. Chrome does it perfectly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ta for the #ff @rperrydesign rightbackatcha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, I actually meant 'From The Kites of San Quentin'  http://mysp.ac/dQeshl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw From The Kits of San Quentin last night at #japanchester, I was really impressed with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithio Common do Leffe for £2.50 a half<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Worse than Clooney?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katieliana I think Bruce Lee did it better:  http://bit.ly/d2cLqU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle I've seen that, and it's amazing. I hope that was your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katieliana Ugh. Kill Bill... awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mynamesnotdave I blame Jesus for pretty much all my wrongs. Tax due? Damn you Jesus!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley my feet aren't hairy, they stopped growing when I was 8. I'm still a size 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had quite a splendid Club Sandwich at Common. Thought you should know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley you make me double sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt Yo. You at Common yet? I just need some dirty cash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew #weef<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt That's what turns me on about you, your attention to detail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt I can, yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently he got eaten by dogs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever happened to Johnny Borrell? He wasn't a cock at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something about eating bacon and/or sausage that makes you want to grab the closest animal and eat it alive. All screamy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco Ha, really!? It's totally true though. Not many people notice how incredibly good looking I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been to see @peatreebojangle's work tonight at her exhibition. Most wonderlicious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Oh, I remember Funnybones well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Can do, sure. Or I can meet you elsewhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'll get the first drinks in ;) #steverape<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Do they drive a BMW or a Merc? Because those people are better than us and don't have to indicate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish You're my hero. I wasn't allowed to give any mine because I have #TigerBlood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley What time will you be around later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Is it true that you should never look directly at The Sun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'll be there. In all my glory. #northerndigital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might make myself an oxygen tent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As nice as it is living in the centre of the NQ, my windows hardly open, and when they do, all I can smell is fried food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welcomebrand It just makes you feel more popular, doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, really looking forward to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yes! Yes he does!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Cabble Good choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peatreebojangle You draw a mean pair of breasts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt You still want to be meet in Common at 6?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork I love the Watchman GN too, which was why I was even more surprised by how well Snyder did with the film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork He seemed to hate Watchmen too... which I liked. And he's obviously a visual director, rather than a great storyteller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heh. Listening to Mark Kermode rip Sucker Punch to bits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redswish There's a mystery about it i guess. I might actually go in sit in Common with a Leffe. But with a comic to occupy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish They're usually just sitting knocking back whiskey. I think I'd be bored and possibly unconscious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork It's true, it's not a complete alternative to actually owning music, but it's quite handy to just stick a new band on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth Their first album was by far their best. So you might be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer my squeaky knees mask the shoe squeak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I measured the shoes... each 3 feet in length.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bought some new shoes yesterday. They make me look like I have massive clown feet. Which I actually do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redswish Cheers for the review, dude. Hopefully I'll get to see it later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just watched Brothers... rather pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waterchevrotain @Redswish You'll have to give me your review of #submarine. The film looks good, but Richard Ayoade annoys me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Telescopes, not temples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just remembered that I find football quite boring, so I've put a film on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@craig552uk Ha, it sounds ace. Subtle bit of murderous dialogue really spices up the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I.e., a Board Meating sounds much more violent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you change the word 'meet' to 'meat', it gives everything a different spin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo There'll be other times. No one can stop a love this strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cokehat Well, I do feel good. But I knew that I would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo we could have fallen in love all over again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You're welcome to come, I've got a big ol' booth to myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Common Bar (39-41 Edge St, Manchester) w/ 3 others  http://4sq.com/dKEQj9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshcroft Strangely moving...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone... it's Friday.  http://youtu.be/CD2LRROpph0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryFord I'm making a comeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something interesting has just happened. Not interesting enough to explain though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rob_leach #facechangefriday was just too radical a concept for people to comprehend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @rob_leach: @Steve_Worsley @thathurtabit Oh. #facechangefriday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm in your twitter stream, lookin' like a sex machine..." #facechangefriday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach it's #facechangefriday - It's gonna be huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm a bad mutha, I know that much. And a sex machine, also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I can pay you because I'm the hardest working man in showbiz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this face suits me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, you maybe have noticed I'm starting a new trend. #facechangefriday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orkle The £2 we agreed is still ok I take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ian_Lunn As a web professional, I follow #tigerblood and #winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco At the Apollo? I saw her too. Though I didn't like the Volta album that much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orkle sold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I love you too Rob, just so you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orkle do we get to haggle? I'll start off a £4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leahnsf I don't think bands should be expected to write different songs for each album. It would take ages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Go J!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You're in the queue? Try and grab some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boo0807 @rachael_burns @rob_leach I think we'll be able to get some, she is playing for 6 nights...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @rob_leach @boo0807 I've run out of time and can't buy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @rachael_burns @boo0807 Maybe they're staggering the releases to prevent crashes? We'll have to keep trying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Not. Even. Me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm going to a Meetup with Northern Digitals  http://meetu.ps/KvV9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like to play a game on #ffffound where I see how few clicks it takes me to get from an innocent bit of graphic design to a nude woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saxgirluk Have you thought of doing something like this?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaoLU6zKaws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've also categorized Metropolis under 'Romance'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovefilm on the PS3 is utter shit. Nothing works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might go and sit in Common in a bit with my laptop. Think about what I've done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yes, I was mixing beer and wine... and not feeling fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I preferred Pablo Honey to The Bends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Ha, I think it tails off after! Overall I think it's a 'grower', which is such a shit thing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, in #thekingoflimbs news, I've listened to the album a few times now and Feral is still my fave track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Would do but I've got loads of admin stuff to sort out and other stuff after that :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You usually enjoy it more after about 4 listens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @Steve_Worsley @rob_leach I'll still want to listen to it tomorrow. I become quite involved with each album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @Steve_Worsley @Redswish So far... really love Feral. It's all over the place. Amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @Steve_Worsley @Redswish Aye, got it today, yeah.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just been to see True Grit with @rachael_burns and @thesophiew. Everyone left feeling disappointed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmNuttall Seriously? She well smells and that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Then it's ace. If you were a boxer, why enter the ring like a twat? People will just want you to get your head punched clean in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, I've finally got around to fixing my 'What's Your Problem?' website. Feel free to have a play:  http://bit.ly/cJEbQv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm up for that yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like how PJ Harvey's last few albums sound like she's gone mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Fair dos. I'm going to skip the alcohol and go straight onto the crystal meth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden Smart! Did you take it with you when you left?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I knew you'd crumble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden Crap, I didn't notice any super blue crutches the other night. Were you casually leaning against a wall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You're quite welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I wasn't going to do anything until you said: "Don't update my twitter!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Natalie, you shaved your head for V for Vendetta, did you also shave your v for vagina?"  http://bit.ly/81rz6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I thumped your mum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's great when you're editing content online and you press the backspace key to delete a letter and instead lose all your changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any PHP web developers looking for work? @AmpersandIT is looking.  http://bit.ly/glf5jV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts @rachael_burns I saw that job, yeah... I'm not really a PHP developer tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Well, the first rule hustle rule book is lose first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I prefer just 'Maverick'. Like Mel Gibson, but less anti-semitic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I prefer just 'Queen'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns sometimes it's a burden, always having to be so dangerous and sexy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Danger is my middle name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Your middle name is 'douche'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Multiple twitter accounts? What are you, the queen or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irpetedotcom Ha, no probs dude! You'll have to come along to Northern Digitals and have a proper chin-wag with everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I came to bed to drink tea and watch Boardwalk Empire. And I'm all outta tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn good #blab tonight. Very inspiring as always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yo. Yeah Freelancing is pretty cool so far. Filling in for Creative Lynx at the moment but hoping to get more personal projects<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@franisaholden Cheese, dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What time does #blab start tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm there, son. As are a few others. #blab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A nice bit of Mew. #np<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I just have a @Steve_Worsley @Steve_Worsley related stammer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @Steve_Worsley I'm sure we could MAKE something happen. Poker?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"If I wanted to waste my breath I would have given my wife mouth-to-mouth resuscitation."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I know! Where have you been?! I'm working at Creative Lynx today. Like a real person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm checking out the new Cut Copy album on Spotify. Best enjoyed with sunshine:  http://bit.ly/iiVLhr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap The story has been told, it's just done very well. I got a lot out of it. Give it a whirl, yo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Uh, juicy juicy abs... *droolz*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched The Fighter with @rachael_burns, really really enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh em gee. Just saw Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I'll come say 'hi' in your face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian you in Common or NTP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Bit later than planned, but are you about, or gone home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian What time are you staying till? I might be over about 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Possibly... I'm currently writing up that thing for .Net mag and need to get it over to them today. Running out of time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yeah, I am indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're hosting websites, don't EVER use JustHost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You had your chance with Pie, you blew it. He doesn't forget these things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching Buried. It's actually very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone is interested in the #superbowl here's a sneak preview:  http://bit.ly/cZWPsX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign Root beer or Ginger beer #FTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign About a week. I live too close to the bars i like so it's too easy to drink. I'm replacing it with root beer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I think that's what she's saying... it's just mostly vowels and slurping. Weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, it's hard to have a conversation with your mum while your dad's penis is in her mouth. She always calls then tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Your mum doesn't make sense with her mouth full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns that doesn't make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You're right. He's very handsome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign wine sounds really good. I'm staying away from alcohol at the moment though because I'm well healthy and that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns He was buried right from the start. He's panicking and can't breathe. Getting funny now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I think that's it, yeah. It's not all that funny so far though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I'm watching a film with Ryan Reynolds where he gets Buried. Can't remember the name of it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap The good times were all based on lies! LIES! They cheated us and then expected us to be thankful? NO SIR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaRisbec They basically left about a million questions unanswered. Like bastards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It's on at 9 if you fancied it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Come watch The Fighter instead. That's got people in it. And stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer They said they'd "Carefully planned out the full mythology" before starting the series. Which was obviously bollocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @ottomancer ... we won't bother explaining the things we promised we would. So, yeah, you've kinda wasted 6 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @ottomancer I was totally into #LOST right until the last episode... in which the writers thoughts... actually...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Holy shit, really? Can you send pics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley A year on and it STILL hurts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, remember #LOST? What a waste of time that was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley I like a peach. I don't like the suede texture though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco I've been playing it a bit. Only against Bots though. Need to train myself up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks I was right to be concerned! How about some tweets about bunnies and such?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Have you seen this? You may have a problem:  http://bit.ly/icSwAc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to cosy up in bed with this guy.   Goodnight planet earth.  http://yfrog.com/gyfauxpj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vickythornley Why do they have massive sticks? They looking for a good ol' fashioned beat-down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at North Tea Power (36 Tib Street, Manchester, Greater Manchester)  http://4sq.com/eXqtt0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shiz... why I am only just waking up now? Deep sleep y'all. Feel I might now have brin dmage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ha, has your photo suddenly tuned retro?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Ha, me too... I just couldn't get into it. I know it's supposed to be ace. The Lynch film is a bit pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I haven't got any cash, but you can come to mine and watch something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Ah! You got me, there. #paedophilia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I have Royal Tenenbaums yeah. I think I downloaded Mr. Fox too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totes. You're not... Ram Dick are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco hahaha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Twosomes are usually just two people. Though you could ask to watch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley No, I'm afraid that won't do. Xbox is for chumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley Buy a PS3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley It's not on for ling. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I have plenty of adventure in me. I'm search google images and that. Aren't you busy with Pizza?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Not enough what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco What the hell do you look like btw? I image something like this:  http://bit.ly/ijPMbM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotpants The first two rules of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave You should turn that moping into MOPPING. Your floor is a mess. And buy a PS3 already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns When was I moaning? I would be happy to hang, I just said I didn't fancy fighting thru drunk folk to see the midnight film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns But remember, he's wild in the sack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Not your type, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Don't think so no. What you upto tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm home alone tonight. I might watch Home Home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Here's a pic of Mr. Pie. He works in music promotion:  http://bit.ly/fzVjky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian She does. Literally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Top 3 Weekly #lastfm artists: Metronomy (25), Cocteau Twins (19) & Arcade Fire (16)  http://bit.ly/cAsmZR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'll DM it to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'll give him a text, no promises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns No-ones perfect. Except pie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'll send him a text. The pie doesn't do commitment though. No one can tame him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I know a pie. Good pie, likes a drink though, and his football. Wild in the sack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You want to date a pie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saddest song ever.  http://bit.ly/gwlNFO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you'd like a depressing Friday night in, why not listen to this lovely album I've made:  http://bit.ly/dh8QbN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lovesick teenagers don't ever die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Yeah, but rachael_burns is copying me and coming off the skag. I need to crush her with my incredible will power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, 'Program Error' - the two sweetest words in the English language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ff Wizardly wordsmith @threepenny - she has a lovely new website that you can visit hereereer:  http://bit.ly/ewraLy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deerhunter's Halcyon Digest is fast becoming my fave album of 2034.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave It's obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'd go for a soft drink wit chu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury You mean... 'get my nails did'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish The I'm New Here album? Aceness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish I was listening to Nebraska pretty loud yesterday. Made me feel like a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I was moaning about sodding iPhone landscape mode for a website. Hopefully it's all sorted now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully I can stop bitching about mobile browsers now. Enjoy the rest of your day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian It's just seems to be the landscape iPhone that doesn't work correctly with media queries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I've tried that body pos rel and element pos abs before. Didn't work very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously. I f*cking hate mobile phones. #mediaqueriesareshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'm using a PC. It's not very practical to borrow someone's phone / touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I just want to display:none the TW if the screen is below a certain size. Should be simple...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'd need about 500 screenshots. I hate Apple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Dammit Rob, I can't wait that long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian That's exactly what I'm trying to do. Won't work. Or does on some simulators and not others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I can't really unless you want to lend it to me for a few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tompepper I just want to check media queries are working. They don't seem to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>V annoying how websites render so differently between different iPhone simulators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, if you download the latest version of Safari while using Safari, it both deletes the old version and the new one you've just downloaded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth Ha. Perfect, ta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know a way to test websites in iPhones without buying one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rachael_burns @rob_leach @thesophiew  http://youtu.be/kDKiQfBs9lo Snatch Wars. Genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew That's ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Prince is really the most ridiculous person of all time. Sign 'O The Times is ace though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @racco She should just use her imagination. That's what pornography is all about. Imagination. Plus it's got Ram Dick in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Chatroom roulette?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns we could watch stuff too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You not coming to ours? We're probably having pizza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just dribbbbbbbbbled:  http://drbl.in/OFA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the guitar is such a phallic instrument, how come so many über-macho metal bands lick the thing? #inthecloset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds Um... 10 minutes. My tea is actually cold now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz You don't have a PS3 at your office? Or a kettle? Pfft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a quick blast on Killzone 3 while I was waiting for the kettle to boil. Pretty. Amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner That's weird. I have that same mug.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pimp hand: Keep it strong.  http://bit.ly/fT6W0I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marvin_speakman @ruthiepoos @Ben_Nam I have to do work?! I thought the freelance game would be like this:  http://bit.ly/h3ZMox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. Should probably do some work then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Be gentle with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 I've seen clips from that film. "Not the bees! They're in my eyes!" etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 Ha. Classics, but no bees?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best .gif ever?  http://bit.ly/hUeaeT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like I'll be working with @ruthiepoos @Ben_Nam and @marvin_speakman in Feb. I wonder if they'll beat me up and take my juice money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hair has grown so much that I'm not sure if I command it or it commands me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. Off to watch The King's Peach. Or whatever it's called.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 I always use FontSquirrel, all free to use and a decent selection. Even does the @font-face set up for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 Yeah, I used to do that. Pain in the arse. @font-face is just about the best thing ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 Cheers dude! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks You're probably right, yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 I probably had it to it again when sobered :/ totally worth it tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 I've tried the wine and coding thing before. Took me like... 4 hours to style an unordered list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks I love that song / album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 I hear that, yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My pet sound for the moment:  http://bit.ly/dFfpez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White Stripes split eh? Can't say I'm too upset.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trickeedickee Thank you very much sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benj_greenhalgh I saw it! You were pretty quiet. The camera loved Alex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been mental busy today... yet still got pretty much nothing done :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo About 50% I fink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My phone has just vibrated but there's nothing to see. #ghosttext<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew you talking about Best Coast? I'd like to, might need to get a ticket closer to the event perhapz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns  http://bit.ly/hSqAb5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Cool, I smell better now. See you there. At TEAcup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, sounds good. I'll go shower. Where we meeting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns What time? I've not even showered yet :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Is there any CCTV footage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad The Duke Spirit are getting some airplay on #6music. The lead singer was always a hottie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley That's your standard 58" Sub, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns that needs to be made into an endless animated .gif<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how I roll:  http://bit.ly/gwZtIl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't the Killzone 3 multiplayer demo supposed to be out today? #ps3 #killzone3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markjames19 @AmpersandIT @Steve_Worsley @rmalpass Ta for the kind words, chaps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo You should keep the old FF and I'll keep emailing you for testing screenshots :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinhicks ta dude :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth more so that he's using a version that's 5 years old :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss What browser and version are you using? does it look the same on others?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss Holy crap... that's mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mynamesnotdave Ta sir, I'll look into that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Tell her: "There's a problem with my pants."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt @jibubo @racco ta chaps :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I read that as 'Cylon' stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian DAMMIT! Cheers man :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixelenvy Cheers man :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo Crap. Really? Hmm. Seems ok on my FF, could you send a pic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Wow, ta dude. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The website that I've made for the super @threepenny is now live and on the interwebs. Have a little look-see here:  http://bit.ly/ewraLy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap. Just checked out the Google Art Project. Such a great idea. Well done Google.  http://bit.ly/h3aAka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or rather... last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Dan Cederholm's talk from Build this year. Très bon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass I'm about 4 episodes into Boardwalk Empire. Digging it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus, I'm hungry like the wolf tonight. A really greedy wolf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to work, then eat, then work tonight, so not going to make #smc_mcr this time. Need to go soon tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissJayneLouise Just as long as you scoop it with your fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'd like to. But I have none. Might have to go to shops. Or order a pizza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've got far used to going out to eat. Staying in seems very boring indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass If you get it and decide you don't want it, I'll have it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Do you open doors for ladies and then slam it in their faces?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's off to #smc_mcr later?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This design is starting to look prettier now. Let's hope it stays that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Hmm. I think you'd need them. Unless you can stick in a php or .htaccess redirect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Just create your splash page with a Page Template then then set that page as the homepage, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. Bury the beds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know what a glute is, but apparently I've just been working it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns What happened last Friday? :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 I'm not sure any other women will ever satisfy me again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley ha. We'll need that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 If only real women had hair like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I said I'd come away with you, ya spoon. As long as I can get the money, like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google Docs is looking particularly ugly today. #crapredesign #googledocs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Andy Carroll has gone to Liverpool then. Who's Andy Carroll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Why not run whilst drinking beer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Agreed, people are using it so broadly it's become meaningless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is still wonderful.  http://youtu.be/yUrqy1Ec06c "B*tch, I'm Rick James."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Same thing. I think. Cleanliness is next to godliness and that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks I never got past that to be honest. I'm able to wash myself these days though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks You're a very angry young man, aren't you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks love, yeah. Line your stomach with love before you go drink 5 pints of hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want a flapjack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Liam Gallagher's witty wordplay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Yeah... I saw that. Probably a porn-dungeon up there. Possibly mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Remains inconclusive. I was hoping for a pool and big slide and that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Good point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There might be a roof terrace at our Thomas St. flat. I'm trying to convince @rob_leach to go as those stairs are probably boobytrapped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project___365 Cools, well feel free to give me a shout if ever want to collaborate on anything. Like singers do and stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watched the 2nd episode of Red Riding. Really good in a really depressing kinda way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer That's midway through the 2nd...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I liked the 2nd season, goes a bit soggy in the middle, but the start and ending are ace. And mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Red Riding. It's scratching that itch left by Cracker. Oh, how I miss you Fitz.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nicholascoates It's true. It sometimes seems to be more about politics than the actual quality of the films. Still some excellent films tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah... it just didn't do anything for me. Shame. I love Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Ratatouille...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap And when Buzz goes all Spanish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Eveyone seems to love it. I watched it in Imax 3D and still forgot everything that happens in it. Other than the creepy doll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't really like the others either, so it makes sense. The Incredibles #FTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit shocked that Toy Story 3 gets an Oscar nod. And how many people seemed to have loved it. Thought it was a bit... limp.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, that's been going on for ages that... they mentioned it again on the Kermode prog, didn't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided to listen to The Dark Tower audiobook while I work. We'll see how it goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Sophie weefed, but @rachael_burns and I were impressed. Scarier than I thought, well acted, crazy in a good way. Recommended!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah I was hoping you'd pay me? I'll be sending my invoice out within the next few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It's just acupuncture yo, how else do you think she stays youthful?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@custardlove Have you put the code that your Analytics account gave you into the right place?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Can do, or you can call in at mine if you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything takes 5x as long to do when you're tired / hungover. Winners say no to drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt @craftedpixelz Yeah, maybe I should start out small (cheap) with the conferences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts Ha. You totally should. Set up traps and stuff, like Home Alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts I don't think so, I often hear lots of drunk people walking down the  back alley tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts You should start a hate campaign to drive the place into closure :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yeah, just looked at that... save quite a bit with that. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Keep me posted, I've never been to Canada either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian You're looking at Interlink, eh? Does look good...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Really? and you can get cheap flights? Sounds promising...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a dream I was back in New York last night. Isn't there a way you can get a flight really cheap if there's like... A spare seat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A larf at @thesophiew's place tonight. I'm sure she'll sleep it off and be as good as new tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley you heard me 667%, bitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley We did that around 4:30pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah man, started at 2pm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Ha. I remember doing some websites in Flash with sliding panels. #thefuture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Yeah, it was pretty ace eh?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Haha. A wondeful reading of 'The Petals Fall Twice' by @zdarsky  http://youtu.be/A9dAxXnPFVs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madebyshape Where are you guys based now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Oooh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Sweet. @thesophiew Is there actually gonna be food then? Or just drink 'n' drawers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Yes, yes I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @sophiebradshaw Will there be any sweet potato?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IE9 doesn't support text-shadow? Lame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, that probably doesn't do you any favours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Maybe it takes time to work, or something :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Those sleeping drugs not been working?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley We can always use a towel around a door knob. Old school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambaconsam I got one off their website. Came today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Maybe you are...  but maybe it's like the Quickening in Highlander. Check yo' neck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm wearing my @LBHappiness t-shirt today. I hope I grow into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Heh. It just sounds stupid: "SHE GETS... SHE GETS...." - she gets what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, that's the one. Strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#6music have censored the word 'high'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You getting your hair chopped? You'll look swish dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just been for my first run of #2011. Fun in a: 'I'm going to pass out and die' kinda way.  http://bit.ly/fmSRWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds 'Ow do. When were planning on having said design?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Sure, come on over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Nah. I've just installed version v.11 of Opera on my PC. Looks the same as Chome and FF. What version you got?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley you're welcome to head over to our place before...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Oh, i do.... I do. @coxy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I can't update, uninstall or repair my version on Opera. ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, this is actually quite impressive (2:08 onwards)  http://dai.ly/fSl4w2 more singers should do the naked wet flying spinning thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds Yeah, working on it now. There's a huge different between Mac and PC browsers' line-height :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correcting CSS bugs through twitter isn't ideal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmds No, not yet! Got til Feb 7th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Ta dude. I'm pestering ol' Mr. Worsley at the mo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Yeah, I have. Doesn't seem to be working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any ideas how to get consistent line-heights between PCs and Macs? There seems to be a like... 50px difference :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @sophiebradshaw I'll have to use different class for macs :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Any different?  http://bit.ly/iaUIse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Bloody macs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Can you have a quick look at again?  http://bit.ly/iaUIse same? different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @Steve_Worsley Yeah, @sophiebradshaw spotted that. Works fine on PC :D I'll have to check it out. Ta dudes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The website I made for Paperhouse Lettings is up and running now. You may have a wee look here:  http://bit.ly/hH2CXK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cokehat Heh. Yeah, from The Other Guys. V.funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I hope you like prison food... and penis."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonniegrrl Do they have to be mutually exclusive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bestycoastyy Lookin' goood. *sleazy voice*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I was wondering who would slow roast a dog's asshole and serve it to her husband... you would."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You can't have a conscience in the pimp game." - True dat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching The Other Guys... it's actually very funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley I think you're only supposed to use instagr.am for pretentious photos. Absolutely no smiling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley  http://youtu.be/s9dvAWFDbN4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley hahaha. It would have been amazing if my dad sent me styrofoam, as an Xmas present... from France :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley We should just play on my Stylophone all night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's strange when you see an ex-film star appear in a film after a couple of decades. Looks kinda like they've melted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, so... The Killing Fields was probably a bit too heavy as I'm only half watching it. Maybe The Other Guys is a bit more appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign To be honest, I don't know who she is. She seems reasonably pretty tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign I'm not sure they'll be too pleased...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Congrats dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign I like how you mentioned both of them in that tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiffanyduening But... aren't they flowers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is reading the #naconf feed all the day the same as being there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It was in reference to your pie. :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Things. Just. Got. Real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly to my mind The Walkmen's 2nd greatest track:  http://bit.ly/gjSmh9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew yeah, but he says it to me all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, I wrote that facebook profile in like... 2007. I'll have to do something with dancebastard.co.uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ha, Really? We're already an international company. We can split it fairly down the middle 80/30 in my favour ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Can't you cut it up and use jQuery's hover event?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I just registered dancebastard.co.uk ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth you'll have to ask @zdarsky nicely, maybe he'll write more for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before I was a Web Designer, I had a successful career in Interpretative Dance:  http://on.fb.me/dTh6n2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew There better be some Fresh Prince.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, everyone. Read this:  http://flic.kr/p/9bDEN8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha. "I'm slickling his peeny."  http://flic.kr/p/9bDEN8 (by @zdarsky)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns To Walkmen? Haven't got a ticket and need to save the pennies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems @rob_leach and folks are off to see Walkmen tonight. I might have me a sexy party in their absence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Are you sure you weren't getting confused with Color Me Badd - I Wanna Sex You Up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Possibly something off Dry or something... not sure. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Hmm... not sure about that. Early or recent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBloodyMyers Ha, that's perfect for #showusyourmugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns depends if it works out or not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had an email from a potential client. Should be an interesting job if it goes ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrcakey Totally... but where do you get another Liz?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew You need Windows 7, the task bar is much neater :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to PJ Harvey's suicide album (White Chalk) should perk me up for the afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadeByMayo I think majority ask for a bigger fee if they have to develop for IE6 users.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns There aren't many ladies who know how to pull off a decent Ascii wall poop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I noted that. ASCII poo-diagrams #ftw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @instruct: @bentopliss that sounds like school kids lunch, you brought a transformers lunchbox as well? -haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns #youbetterbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach An excellent choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've just boiled the kettle and will scold you with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign I've been on the Lapsang Souchong for the last few weeks. Smokey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Well, that's actually Chai, but thank you for your thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've now moved onto a nice peppermint tea. Refreshingly minty tea tea... tea. ™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign I only went freelance at the start of the year, so it's exciting at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rperrydesign I've been working from home for the last few weeks. Really like it. I live in the NQ so can escape to a cafe if needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins What could you possibly have against this guy?  http://bit.ly/i2JW9h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins ...but... ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns That's from ROME. And I've got a crush on that actress, so ta. :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns but corn-rows are so you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You could maybe trade them for hair cut? Or I could cut your hair and you pay me in pizza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've got a few 2-for-1s at Pizza Express?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns They could reanimate Heath like this:  http://youtu.be/a7zDebveHeM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Do people still give out phone numbers? I thought Facebook had taken over that stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Death hasn't prevented Tupac or Michael Jackson from working on new projects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welcomebrand Sweet, I'll check them out. Maybe I just haven't given the correct amount of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, Pavement fans... I've always thought of Pavement as being massively overrated, but if any album could change my mind, which would it be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philjeffs I always try my best to be for a decent man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish :o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I think if a real person dove into coins, they'd cripple themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting re-envisioning of the DuckTales intro:  http://youtu.be/NmpAx8Z5z40<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Well, she's been in a few quite famous films. And she's hot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickhurst Then again... would you let an architect design a building if they had no idea how  / if it could be built?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Late bloomer, eh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo It's true, I owe it all to Jesus and his roaming hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Jesus touched me repeatedly between the ages of 4 and 11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I can't, though I really wish i could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'll add it to my to do list. Along with 'invade Poland'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Yeah, but he drank standard ASDA stuff. I'm a Twinnings man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm totally Mr. Tea man. I've got like... 8 different kinds now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Ha. It seemed more appropriate than: "I've been raped :D"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw We won a bottle of beer! Sophie is proudly keeping it until Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to Orlando Bloom? Did people eventually realise he's rubbish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@custardlove Nice site that. Tumblr seems to be quite a popular way of getting your stuff seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've been raped :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm moving to the country. I'm gonna eat me a lotta peaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Cool, I'll give 'em a bell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks The problem might have been you had 76 applications and windows open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh Haha. Perfect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkavanagh I'm afraid if it's paper it must fall into the cup category, and therefore not eligible for #showusyourmugs. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Girl1: "Me and him... we're made for each other. Made for each other. Made for each other." Girl2: "zzzzzz" #overheard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Just sweet tunes, man. Sweet tunes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The girls next to me are talking about #mybigfatgypsiewedding. It seems EVERYONE saw that last night. I was playing on my Stylophone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach And chart music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boo0807 In my experience prostitutes make excellent quiz partners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'm in for that. I can stay here, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaikdean Not free until 2nd week of Feb I don't think :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sat in Common, using Teacup's wifi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common's internet connection... Slooooow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaikdean I would be interested, depends when "your people" are looking for someone tho?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sod it. I think I'll go work from @common_bar for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I'm not sure there's anything on I want to see at the mo (that I haven't already seen)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth  http://bit.ly/31abtc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to get out of the 'office' some time today. Going mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshcroft I quite like The Party Time Party. It would confuse people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaikdean I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I am, I'm sure most of the usual ND crowd are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaikdean Could be! Do you work for Creative Spark?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Ha. No probs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshcroft How About 'PARTY TIME'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshcroft Simple really, innit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I could be Prime Minister. You just have slag off the previous government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Sounds good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benj_greenhalgh Haha. No seriously, get f**ked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Exactly right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian There's room in my mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew You can't eat LOOK! Or can you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benj_greenhalgh I'll cut you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RT @Steve_Worsley: We like our women the way we like our research papers...  http://bit.ly/gPtb62 - true dat. Huge glasses help too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@instruct yeah, I liked that one. How they wouldn't apologize because they 'Can't have any regrets in this life' - Might try that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@instruct I've never heard it before. Pretty amazing. I quite like Huey's little stories, or how he'll slag off some bands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Cool, should be fine then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@instruct Just gonna tweet how good that is... #6music<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos The next one is a #blab night I think.  http://bit.ly/e0SwN2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos That's a weak as my Kinect abuse excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Might do. Ben mentioned it, and I signed up to the Meetup page. How come you never come to a Northern Digitals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I've used the same excuse. Though I don't have a Kinect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Does your boyfriend abuse you an blame it on Kinect?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question for Developers, my SQL query returns the correct info in PHPMyAdmin, but the same query doesn't work in the actual website. Why?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Chai remains King of Tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna rock 'n' roll all night. And party some of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, what did I do before tea? Put my head in my hands and weep, is what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Sweeet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something for the rag and bone man. (Over my dead body).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Night, Burnie. x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Note: A quick job is never a quick job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholascoates That's a big ol' screen you've got there! I've added the div to my query list so hopefully shouldn't overlap any more :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Will your dad do that to you? All slo-mo, like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholascoates Ta dude, what size screen are you working on? I'll have to add a media query in there. Ta for that!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Despite me ringing Salford Council and cancelling my Direct Debit for Council Tax 6 weeks ago, they're still charging me. F**king idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You sound like Frank Booth again. Minus the GPS bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a match on or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had my daily fix of the Bed Intruder song.  http://youtu.be/VKsVSBhSwJg I can get on with my day now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow, that guy from the Zutons is really annoying. Much like his band.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm watching 'Greatest Songs of the Naughties' - Will Young has been chosen so far. Great start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns There are loud bits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit yeah. Just got Chrome working on my laptop again.  Seems I DID have a stupid virus thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Yeah, looking forward to that! Looks mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great use of the Johann Johannsson track on the Battle: LA trailer:  http://youtu.be/ORb3zC8z94w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Ha, her character is supposed to be dying I think, so you'll have to let her off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Restless looks quite interesting:  http://youtu.be/p7t29dNoTxs Might be 'coz I have a thing for Mia Wasikowska.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched the Thor trailer. Looks god-awful. Nice one Kenneth Branagh:  http://youtu.be/a0_FIK6h7t8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've sure you've seen this before, but it's worth watching over and over and over...  http://youtu.be/4pXfHLUlZf4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I just watched that one :D Ooooh ow, ooh. etc. Have a listen to this:  http://youtu.be/-nJ4Voyrk9U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RT @Ian_Lunn: Going Freelance: 6 Weeks In  http://bit.ly/hyrToP - I'll have to have a read of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damiangostomski Hey dude. I've got stuff in at the mo' to see me to the end of Jan (hopefully) nothing for Feb yet tho :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I was kinda hoping you'd say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Did they have to buy separate couches to use their blankets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's surprising how many big company websites use forms which hide what should be inputted after you click into it. #annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That soup was ace. My compliments to the Chef... Heinz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Are you in her will or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns They sound like they've got those internets all figured out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. I just went to the bathroom. Please RT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard Colours by GROUPLOVE on #6music. Really liked it. Might have to go see them at the Ruby Lounge in Feb.  http://mysp.ac/aTKKgg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@designermag I've been trying to avoid it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@designermag Have they split up too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I've heard those noises. Something akin to the sound fighting cats make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns 'Some' isn't good enough, Burns. Must do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @rob_leach Holy crap... I had that same dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns He's got your colour too. Did you not manage to sleep?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You gotta work harder to reach the big leagues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ff @rbgArts @ottomancer @gablaxian @rachael_burns @PatrickWall @welcomebrand @harryford @ian_lunn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody likes snow anymore. Not even its own mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, I'm watching the flakes fall down like little pieces of icy annoyance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, not liquorice, I hate that stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Friday everyone, may it be filled with sunshine, puppies, and liquorice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I love Lord of the Rings:  http://youtu.be/-nJ4Voyrk9U #lotr #juvenile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @sophiebradshaw I'm sure whoever messaged you is pretty happy with the #megalolz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian You can do the little fiddly bits that are usually too boring to do otherwise, the film makes you not notice as much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian I was working while watching! Laptops are ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched A Single Man. Great film. Beautiful score by Abel Korzeniowski too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @sophiebradshaw If a guy came up to you and asked you to buy them a drink wouldn't you think: 'f*ck off'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bristolren You've had guys ask you to buy them a drink? Or they've offered? No harm in offering, but demanding a drink is a bit different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that that has ever happened to me. I just watch a lot of films, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think it's a bit fucking cheeky when a girl goes up to a guy and is like: "Would you like to buy me a drink?" Pfft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall I thought it was super, especially for such a tiny budget. Very inspiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, Splinter was a bit of a bad ass. He was no Krang tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Monsters was great! wasn't it? @rachael_burns has no taste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Isn't that Thundercats?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have I just been tweeted at by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Did you eventually get that tattoo on your foot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Your prize could be sitting next to me for a bit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Are you still in Common?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I remember you mentioned it the other day for my promo page thing. Stupid .htaccess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian True dat yo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today has been annoying. I have to eat pizza to correct that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer @mancunian @jonthebeef @rachael_burns @rob_leach It was the fu*king .htaccess file, innit. @gablaxian wins the prize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Graham you f*cking genius! It was that pesky .htaccess file! I owe you a drink! Or a kiss. Your choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunian It's not just images, it's JS files, css files, it says they're there according to Filezilla, but the browser can't see them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonthebeef I'm seeing dots now 'cuz I'm getting so pissed off. Not CYMK, or spaces... all valid. #fuckingshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I think it's something fucked up with the server as it says it's there and uploaded, but the browser says different. Shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally  lost. How is it possible to upload an image to the server, see it in the folder, only for the browser to say it doesn't exist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afghanmoon Hey, thanks for looking. Yeah I'm on a hosted server. I'll have to ask them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This website is ace:  http://www.dkngstudios.com/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts *thumbs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbgArts Ha, yeah... I'm sure one day letter-box card dropping will pay off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew You can pay in installments. You can pick it up when you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Seriously tho, do you want it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Actually... do you just need a router? Virgin sent me one the other day, don't need it! You want it? £40,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Yeah, how does it feel now, eh? Bigshot. (cc @rob_leach)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Nice! Should probably get some money first tho, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy totally with you on that one. Brown bananas are quite tasty... green tastes like plastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWall Killer Lattes tho ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lickstudio Cool! congrats dudes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin The Owen Pallett album? It's ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComputerArts #CAEXPOSURE  http://www.ghosthorses.co.uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to Owen Pallett's Heartland. It's very good.  http://bit.ly/dc0Kcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. Put my name down as Stephen Fairbanks Fairbanks for this:  http://bit.ly/hnp3up I'm so important now I have two identical surnames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaireEGamble I thought it was really good yeah... he knows how to direct a film that Danny Boyle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Photo: zdarsky:  http://tumblr.com/xii17dn2n1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched 127 Hours last night with @Steve_Worsley & @thesophiew, very good. I had to remove my arm this morning as it was trapped in bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelDiPaola You'll be pleased with the rebrand then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be honest, I've barely noticed the stupid mermaid thing in the middle of the Starbucks logo before now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhackett I guess that's why stuntmen are only used for the wide shots, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afghanmoon Only one table - SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE comment_post_ID = 10 ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 40 - no longer works?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any idea why my SQL query has suddenly stopped returning things in random order and gone for Descending instead? #sql<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I've heard a bit of Lawrence Arabia, never heard of Pepper Rabbit. Any good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhackett That's ace. I hope the the speed of the bike was sufficient and it didn't end with face mashing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I really liked The Horrible Fanfare from that album. Trippy, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I hate The Knife. Nah, I don't Silent Shout is probably one of my favourite recordz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns yeah, I have actually... with the lazers and the masks and the oohs. Super. Do you like The Knife?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fever Ray. Yes please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz That's been the top of my 'want to go' list for a few years. Maybe this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz you're off to Tokyo? Well jealous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit,  just stop following so many people. Too often replying to the wrong person when tweetdeck updates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury pic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmarkmillar I like the guy... but Hostel up there with The Excorist?!? No sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmarkmillar Eli Roth?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley All The Shins stuff is good! I think I might listen to one now to prove that to myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. This website needs to be built. Make it so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faithio Pfft, 127 Hours was ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap What did you think of the film? I really liked it. He's a talented director, that Boyle. And CAPLAN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I particularly like Feather, i think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Good girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You should listen to this btw:  http://bit.ly/1a0rxj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 What else would I be talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Maybe some time in the future we can get Franco'd out of our minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian @jag4091 Is it true that white people are really well hung? #thingsjagdoeswithwhitepeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImaginaryDesign Dude even! :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImaginaryDesign Cheers due :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder just WHAT #thingsjagdoeswithwhitepeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Me too! You back in Middle Earth now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew How about the National Portrait Gallery?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt He's a maverick, clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ian_Lunn Ta. Yeah, just started this week. Been pretty hectic so far, cool tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fluffypig I also know the lottery numbers for that day if you wanted to know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy What's text?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy They have internets on phones now!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ta for the congrats dudes! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy Shit. You're right. I presumed as web judges they can see into the future and stuff? I'll try not to worry. *worries*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh! I've just got an email from @thecssawards telling me my  http://www.ghosthorses.co.uk website is website of the day for 10/1/11. Ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt I don't know... they do look pretty ace though, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Haha. Maybe they've seen the website?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha.  http://youtu.be/b-jIBHI3U6Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns  http://bit.ly/eq4UEf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, it's amazing album. And I picked that one for my 2010 comp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, lesbians are cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns If I was a girl, I'd be a short haired girl. And be a champion arm wrestler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Short haired girls are cool. Everyone knows that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns 'tis a good venue. I've not listened to their new album enough to get a ticket tho. Get a Twin Shadow ticket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any other Manchester people fancy seeing 127 Hours tonight at the Odeon @ 7pm? Orange Wednesday, baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @thesophiew Rob's still plagued out of this mind, so he's gonna have to miss out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley There's a 7pm showing. We'd have to get there maybe 6:30? Orange Wed, you see. (cc: @thesophiew)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy I do always wear it. Horrific lice problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins It was a way to share text, images, etc. with multiple people in real-time, but it's being discontinued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy you're telling me you didn't mean the things you said? #heartache<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy We have! I have one of you cards on my desk. I spoke to you for approx 4 seconds at a ND meet-up. It was love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy It's true, I totally love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#np Deerhunter - Earthquake  http://bit.ly/exSbVK - it's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikfbaars You'll have to do a Broadband speed checker and kick their asses if it's rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikfbaars Is yours pretty slow? Hopefully ours will stay nice and speedy. Might have to kill them if it goes back down to half a meg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo-hoo! @virginmedia have got their act together and de-restricted the broadband from 0.4meg to 7+meg. (cc @rob_leach)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns ace innit? The Weibe remains a constant source of inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, aren't beds great? I feel bad for folk in the 18th Century that had to sleep on pigs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right that's enough work for one day, time to unwind and shoot people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Admittedly, he's got style... but he's the devil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Do you see? You always fall for the wrong guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#teamweibe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Well, I hope you and Billy Mitchell are very happy together and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Steven J. Wiebe FTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just dribbbled, innit:  http://drbl.in/Jtj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley How about ye olde Odeon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DAVID_LYNCH Can we have another film from you this year please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah. Just got followed by "The #1 pharmacist-recommended, over-the-counter brand for urinary and vaginal health." #score<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'll beat anyone's ass, you know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Nah, an open call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyCulbert It's not officially a bear wrestle unless there's blood spilled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, just it's 127 hours long, so it's pretty intense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I only mention it because, if you fancy it, i'm gonna BEAT YOUR ASS. In a non-sexual way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rob_leach Fancy seeing 127 Hours tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyCulbert Works out kinda nicely that, dunnit? Do I get a cut of the profz?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@threepenny Thanks for the RT :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I has hoping iStock would save me form the perils of clipart but their selection is possibly worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the new iStockPhoto search that refuses to show any results, ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Oh, absolutely. Sleep is more addictive than crack. Loads of people do it apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetimwaring Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt success!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems photography is the hobby of choice for a lot of web professionals. Personally, I choose bear wrestling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're not scaremongering. This is really happening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zambonini I think that song was about constipation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Oh, there's a gush alright. #mighthaveaproblem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian You're making me wet, if that's of any use.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redswish I've kinda of missed out the best bits, really. #missedopportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Christ, I hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Now you're talking... with like, foam shooting out of my mouth and stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I would do, but I don't have as enough housewives lusting after me yet. That's gonna change in '11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Ha. You're right. I should just have it on a loop with no way to turn it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dragindb Ta dude :D still need to find to time to change bits, will hopefully get time soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco ta to you too... :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice. I had nearly 300 people waggle my jaw yesterday:  http://bit.ly/hnQKDm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew WELL better than the series...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh, the latest Walking Dead turned up today. Bit of light reading for this eve'.  http://yfrog.com/h7qvglj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian As soon as I master the tea-bag timing, everything else is easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leaving the tea bag in for 10 minutes is probably too long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yarcom True that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yarcom Actually, that's from 2010, innit? 2001 remains genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkiosk I can't get past how miscast young Sophie Coppola is in that film. Bless her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simplebits I think the beauty of HTML5 Boilerplate is that even if folk don't understand it 100%, they're still better off using it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayHealey Eveyone's a critic... ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Kinda drunk on @gablaxian at the moment. A heady brew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ha. Pause it? Of course not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns  I dunno about the day, but I'm always down for some pea-soup and crucifix masturbation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian There's NOTHING I want more than to be part of an unstoppable uni-beast of raw sexual magnetism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Cosy... and incredibly sexy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Why aren't you watching The Exorcist? The only scary film ever?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Oh yeah! Didn't notice that. You can slag off with impunity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it Christmas yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I haven't unfollowed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Maybe Tweetdeck is going mental again then. Did you find a #drunkz partner?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I just tried to DM you but it said you weren't following me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Heh. You've stopped following me. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Tune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I'm currently getting 16kbps from a 10Mbps package. I think that's #uttershite (cc @virginmedia)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you please explain why your broadband service is so ridiculously appalling, @virginmedia?   http://yfrog.com/h4ey0g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm really enjoying my @virginmedia broadband. Download speeds of up to 16kbps. #uttershite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty ace that my new broadband internet access manages to be slower than dial-up. Thanks @virginmedia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pretty ace that my new broadband internet access manages to be slower than dial-up. Thanks @virginmedia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns From Fresh Prince?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cripes. I hope the internet connection isn't always this slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missrachilli I think when the broadband is set up, it's ok... it's just the customer service is shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap *time zone five* The Kiwi who I work with says he can't handle the cold. I've lived here all my life and I can't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap You back in Ol' Blighty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian True. Hopefully I won't have to deal with then again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, that feels good. #homeinternetconnection (cc @rob_leach)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns How was #quizmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Christ, I'm not sure I can. I can drink tea. Tea is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You gun' get got.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bentopliss Oooh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Xmas gift? I'm a bit broke, so I can only afford to give small albino children as gifts this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I can get you a small albino boy for a good price if you change your mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden No, you've ruined everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edbaldry Handsome chap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I wasn't offering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden It's like... metaphorical, or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm going to punch you in the ovaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden Pffft, no-one chooses daddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I was thinking more like Thunderdome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Wanna fight about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far the answer seems to be Chips. #daddyorchips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven%27s_5th_%28film%29<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... Daddy or Chips?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something has been on my mind for a while, and I was hoping you Twitter people could help me decide something once and for all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Well, I've seen Beethoven's 5th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Absolutely not, I've just had a Lipton Ice Tea (Peach).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ha, that's ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetimwaring Very interesting. I'm particularly fond of the chin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the Crystal Castles ft. Robert Smith version of Not In Love, but can't they play the original instead sometimes? #6music<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What better way to cure a hangover than wresting with a website made of tables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I hope so. I really do. They haven't text'd me to confirm it tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach 'fraid so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Terrible. Just want to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco That DOES sound good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Whatevz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, and Cyndi Lauper said that girls just want to have fun, so that means that they've all got coke addictions and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley is also correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach She's right tho, to be fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns and the USA flag, which is a must for any date.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Blonde Redhead - Penny Sparkle! How could I forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Have you actually seen that? I've only heard rumours, I don't think I'm man enough to sit through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin I liked the Sleigh Bells album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin There's probably a few beauties I can't think of right now. The Gorillaz album as ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin wasn't over the moon with the Avi Buffalo album, but I did really like the Crystal Castles album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Haha. You took some time with that one, eh? :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Yeah, that's one of the one's I'd choose. Also Beach House, Best Coast, Tame Impala, Laura Marling... I need to think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 True. Just thought I'd put that out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 I preferred Boxer though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I do love a bit of gangster shit in my ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco @rob_leach Never heard of The Beatles... hip-hop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin I don't even know. I usually make a 'Best of' compilation of the songs I loved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, music fans... what was YOUR favourite album of 2010?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw  http://bit.ly/gbzqWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I quite like that Cage Against The Machine single. Catchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to the absence of a Katsouris partner this week, I think I may to settle for Londis again. Can't be bothered with a soup lunch anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bestycoastyy Santa has the coldest, deadest eyes...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns This is my all time-fave Brasseye moment  http://youtu.be/5tGkw6mHxJw (from 1:26 - 1:42)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Well, it's Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Is the turf war still going on at @madebyfudge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Maybe they want sommadat Fury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Sweet lord, that's one of my favourite Brasseye clips ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I was on the pavement with my bike the other day (going about 0.025mph) and a guy stopped and shouted: "PAVEMENT!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, Louise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I f*cked you over a million times and you died." @lyricallynoted<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns it's the ONLY way to travel. Actually, it isn't. But it's a nice healthy, cheap one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I like that! Rather cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just been blazin' up mad hits with @rob_leach on the ol' 6 strings. Breakfast at Tiffany's anyone?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns @rob_leach I'm not a great guitarist, but I've already mastered the being a cock part.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I wouldn't want to carry @Steve_Worsley @rob_leach with my musical awesomeness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Branny I Spit On Your Bumhole was the best I could come up with. #replacelastwordinfilmtitlewithbumhole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I have the voice of an angel. And the buttocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach We should. Although sober I have no excuse for slack guitar playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palmerama Ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Actually, this is my new business card:  http://bit.ly/h1V8pI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I should put: "I'll make you a website, GUARANTEED! If you pay me and stuff." - pretty catchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns He's right. That's the most incredible business card I've ever seen. 25 years well spent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Since when is it suspicious to want to purchase a bazooka over the internet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, I guess a face is important. Gives you something to look at whilst talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Teeth are a must tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Hats aren't important either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Personally when I drink, I don't feel the need to scream, or go 'OW-LAAAY OWW-LAAAY' etc. Maybe we should try it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is the #lovecreative vs. @cuckoodesign cam thing still going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Eh? What's awesome?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I was supposed to be, I'll probably be in Common tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ace, see you then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone tell those two on the right to do some work? #LOVESTUDIO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley What you upto tomorrow night dude? You don't fancy being my date for Aliens at the AMC do ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Answer to the previous tweet.... because the server is rammed to capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, so... I'm uploading a file onto the server, and when it uploads, it wipes everything on the file. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Because I made this thing:  http://bit.ly/bfM3zw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass I go through that every time I design something :) Probably better than thinking everything you do is ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Cool shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snookca Rock 'n' roll.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Actually really loving the latest Deerhunter album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenEnergize oh yeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Nope. I'll have to watch that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Deal, but you must watch Party Down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Cripes, used to love Wayne's World, haven't seen it since I was like... 10 tho. Can't really remember No.2 :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury You should, it's ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It's pretty much the greatest comedy in the history of the universez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury You better be! *points menacingly*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenEnergize Blackburn Wordpress you say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns That song always reminds me of Dumb & Dumber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Highlander!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Heh, Queen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Well, I wasn't being. The guy who made the album is American. Just a bad pun, innit.  http://bit.ly/22OsXM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury It's a Sufjan Steven's album. A rather good one, not all us English are thick yo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury yes... thanks for that.  http://bit.ly/gHjlHn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on, feel the Illinoise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins teee-uuuune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Very very true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cornerhouse to potentially move folks, here be the story, innit:  http://bit.ly/ev8WNJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NQHQmcr Thanks for the heads up. *stuffs semi-automatic in rucksack*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns  http://bit.ly/ev8WNJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NQHQmcr 'Moving Cornerhouse' sounds a bit weird tho :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It was on BBC news this morning... they're proposing the move, isn't definite yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domrodwell Near the Hacienda building apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh, they're planning on moving the Cornerhouse, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn you apple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns OMG wot totalz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steverg I completely agree... one of the most frustratingly shoddy websites I've ever used #tesco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Yeah, should be pretty cool. I'm going to carry a log on my back all the way to Prestwich and back everyday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just signed up for the Bupa Great Manchester Run 2011. It'll hopefully force me to get off my arse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Heh, no not really. Possible tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It was removed as it was too suggestive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#nowplaying Sonic Youth - Dirty Boots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Might only need a couple of people or so, i think Robbie said he'd help out. Thanks for your 'support'! gettit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone with a strong back want to help me carry all my belongs and put them into a van and then a new flat? 4th Dec, baby. It'll be 'fun'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You love your Cake, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Have you got any episodes? I've both seasons of Part Down. Then they cancelled it :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Have you seen Party Down? Just about the greatest thing ever.  http://imdb.to/4y18C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ah, never seen it actually. Keep meaning too. I used to like Summer Heights High, but it got too painful to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @ottomancer: @thathurtabit I've got your back on this one. You spin up the minigun while I lob grenades. #ie6apocalypse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns but this might have made up for it:  http://bit.ly/f8ZGUO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I think you may have hurt my brain by making me listen to this:  http://bit.ly/haRlM1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It's an amendment to a website already carved up with images for corners, so I'll have to keep that up :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm taking upon myself to kill every single person who uses IE6. @ottomancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz Hmm, never got around to using that... maybe now's the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I'm totally for CSS3 use, but the client only seems to use IE7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Was thinking that, but it's just for one box. The client's staff are the folks who have to suffer their browsing through IE6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really begrudge having to cut out images to display round corners. I hate you, IE users.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13twelve Noted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco shut it whitey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks It's ok, I thought you were horrifically mangled from a car crash or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks What the hell is wrong, dude?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I was getting skinner, turned out my belt was on a looser notch than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Did you tell me you were a hair icon? No, but I'm not blind, yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Plus you're a hair icon. Or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm listening to your Rach Bound & Down comp. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimTheGuest Ha, I dunno! There's some characters in there. I always opt for a massive amount of Greek salad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Cuckoo Design (247 Chapel Street, Salford).  http://4sq.com/965H4k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A trip to Katsouris might be on the cards today with @hallodom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns NOTHING gets by me. Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass I have that Slaughtered Lamb T! The answers: American Werewolf in London & The Shining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You're subscribing to my 'Songs I Like'? Excellent choice. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @thesophiew No more three way snogging for us. Or maybe when we're all better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a horrible sore throat and a general fug to my aura today. I better not be getting another cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftedpixelz I might not be able to go to the HTML5 thing if  you want my ticket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Yeah, having an NQ 'office' makes us mighty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @melissaks: CAN'T FUCKING BREATHE. -- famous last words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, The Script are really good, aren't they? #untrue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Project, baby. Project. I.e. website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellzenner Yeah, I did hear the Frankie Rose album.... Candy is going on my 'end-of-year' list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@threepenny Hehe, thanks for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carnage. #walkingdead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. It's fucking zombie time. #walkingdead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet. A nice little project should (hopefully) be heading my way in January. Pretty excited about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellzenner I'll second that, Best Coast are several shades of awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez, I've missed playing guitar over the last few days. #rockingmymediocreguitarskills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Twats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I just got that too. Zuckerburg will hang someone for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are BT now using Apple products in all their advertisements? Are they getting confused?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue If you're not saying the same thing, you may need to check yo' neck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noel Edmonds represents everything I want to become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanFillion Really? I get that all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the hell do I keep getting plumbing companies following me? Today it's the wonderfully named NiagraFaucets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just used this rather handy Dribbble API / PHP parser thingy:  http://bit.ly/b83zif<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owltastic Gmail picks up if you write 'attach' and reminds you that you've not attached anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm too school for cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to be different, I think I'll listen to Cocteau Twins as I always do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Not dead, that giant coffee has made me invincible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that ultra-massive coffee I've just had has made time slow down. Kind of in bullet-time right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tompepper I saw no Donkey, I'm afraid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just nearly cycled into Wayne Rooney in St. Anne's Square. He was all 'urban' with his hood up and a photographer in tow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Fucking hell, is that a Dead Prez quote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Pfft, why ruin a perfectly good pair of handcuffs when you could cut your hand off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns You should go for something more heroic like my WEB CHAMPION. People look upon me like a god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach That's a great idea. I think I'll bring all my failing food related problems your way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Nam Where do you play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some very sexy (as in, waaay boring) admin duties to take care of this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach There's just no spark there any more Rob. I think it's just time we went our separate ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks The eponymous lady Michael Jackson sang about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my 4 year long on-off long love affair with Alpen has officially ended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Aye, I'll be heading into town at some point for a coffee or something so I'll give you a holla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Yeah, he doesn't sound all that lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Holy shiz :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I meant you... being venomous. Didn't end well, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Eee, venom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Oh, of course. There really is but one real choice in the Lynx range. Gentlemen prefer Africa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Thank christ I'm not trying to figure out Java. It was always my least favourite of the Lynx collection too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have such a powerful algorithm. People are frightened by it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Thank christ I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10:55pm Javascript debugging... does it get any better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The latest Harry Potter film breaks record for being the first Harry Potter film since the last one to break a Harry Potter record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Do strangers not usually ignore you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Doesn't it though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Not too bad. Slight indigestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Come hang with me tomorrow in a cafe while I stare into my laptop and not speak to you much. It'll be fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching Annie Hall through the medium of LoveFilm's online streaming. Film's are much better when they pause themselves every 3 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Ha, I'll do that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm drinking chai tea whilst doing tai chi. The latter isn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah I'll check that out, sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xbaz You got it, sunshine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm off work again tomorrow. *mega thumbs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury Oh totally, women can't be trusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury I've never seen it either. I hear it's pants, I need something with a bit more indie cred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Listen to the girl, as she takes on half the world..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury That's next! I'm watching Lost in Translation at the mo'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seem to be watching a lot romantic-y films of late. I'm 'ard, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can teach you how to moonwalk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot the opening scene is just Scarlett Johansson's arse. Score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I'm going to continue working, but I'll put Lost In Translation on to keep me company. Ace soundtrack and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can judge how involved you are with what you're doing by how far you let your glasses slide down your nose without resetting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Awesome, I do the same with flapjacks... but then eat them all. What office is this then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns What the hell are you doing with all this food?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cunningly, I just stocked up on food at Tesco Market Street without setting foot in Market Street. #donotcrowdmebitches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer it's one of those albums where every song is honestly spectacular and completely timeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, I need to stop doing web stuff and play some guitar or black ops or something. It's Sunday, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XfmManchester Is he dead then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I've stopped giving blowjobs, at least not on such a whim, it's a little demeaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've cleaned my flat. I feel I'm a better person because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethfury How did your boobs hold up the other night? Satisfactorily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pet Sounds is actually the most angsty teenage album ever. It's also possibly the best album ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beach Boys FTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Why do you always have to steal my women? What's wrong with you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley That's all I've ever wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah The pixie girl from Scrubs? Heh, yeah she's pretty cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if Ramona Flowers will come out for a drink with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue I just googled 'snuggie'... sold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your blanket questions answered.  http://yfrog.com/1a83tj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone assuming I'm jerking off? It's simply the kind of comfort money CAN buy. #blanket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue Women have such filthy, filthy minds. And often a strange fascination with footwear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Better than Cruise. Ridiculous. Night dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like to watch films with a blanket on my lap. Strangely pleasing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Like Tom Cruise in Risky Business? Well sexy.  http://bit.ly/cWlLYR enjoy your sleep. Lightweight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scott Walker? Oh, go on then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The more you look forlorn, the more to you I warm."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah Oh shit, I forgot you were going there. Might have to stay in tonight, too tired and hungover. Enjoy Born Ruffians!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to music through one speaker is a terrible thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey ha, I see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey I don't know any better, no. People seem to like Socio Rehab in the NQ tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey I live across the road from Corridor, 'tis a cool place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Bag full of cups. You DO know how to party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Food that good, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelPasse Have you seen Good Dick? I really liked it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've made a very lovely compilation in Spotify, feel free to listen, bitches:  http://bit.ly/dh8QbN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone is in the market for a quirky romantic indie, check out Good Dick. I really liked it. Plus Marianna Palka is pretty cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm gonna watch a film first, but yeah... you're pretty much spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Still difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns It's difficult being the tallest man alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I'm 9'3"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Well, I'm probably taller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm staying in on my own tonight, watching a film called Good Dick. That's just how I roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns yeah, but I was TOTALLY there on the opening night, with Santa and Prancer and all them. So f**k yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns I was here yesterday too, so you're 22 hours (approx) behind me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the North Pole Bar thing, drinking something or other.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think I'll spend the rest of the day in bed. If I need anything, I'll tweet it and someone can go get it for me. Technology is wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah I'veno idea what's going on right now. It's taken me a while to write this. Not that long, really.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, I've started rebuilding my website. It's exciting. Will it be good? Will it be pants? Will i get frustrated and cry? I just don't know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dragindb It's no Aliens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite liking Manchester's Oi Polloi website:  http://bit.ly/4siWOy - who made that then?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yesterday was Simon & Garfunkel day, today... Neil Young. #wordtoyamomz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy I think even I'd be seduced by that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It was alright actually, I wasn't expecting that much, but it made me laugh quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool, the Spotify update makes a little pop-up say when the next song has started saving me from having to listen to adverts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Common Bar (39-41 Edge St, Manchester) w/ 2 others.  http://4sq.com/8qzLSI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Yay! You should read the graphic novels. Super ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm kind of half watching the remake of The Italian Job. What a god-awful film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I'm afraid not, they've just been employed by Nintendo to sell their DS. As you would, obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People, please... don't mess with Jedward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos IE probably keeps us in jobs too, to an extent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley They're both on there, I was just spelling it wrong, like a #loser<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Ha, I'm only interested in Simon & Garfunkle ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? No Simon & Garfunkle on #Spotify? #losers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know where I can buy a decent laptop case/bag in Manchester City Centre?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RT @serafinowicz: Lennon inventing the iPod (feat. @timheidecker!)  http://youtu.be/jcVS9ssNYVQ #beatles - excellent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, guys, The Beatles remain cool. Apple do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach What the crap is an unboxing video? The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite R630-13T<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I think I prefer Aliens actually, and Alien was amazing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer It's just about the best thing ever. Pisses all over Avatar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Ha, I saw The Box at the cinema, that guy was pretty creepy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Seems that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, why have I left it so long since listening to Tom Waits?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet. Just got a couple of free tickets (and hopefully, drinks) to see Aliens at the AMC for this:  http://bit.ly/9W5S5K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns The joys of dentistry. Are you drooling slightly? Feel like the elephant man? I live for those moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks I don't think they do that if you 'admit' to insanity, as that usually means you're sane. Kind of a Catch 22.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evalicious I *heart* spa music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evalicious I like whatever is playing at the mo'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evalicious You listening to #6music per chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley re: #WalkingDead - good guess!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watched the 3rd episode of #WalkingDead - it keeps getting better, yo'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've done some very important file tidying tonight. And that makes me mighty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks ah, I didn't see any vintage bikes or esoteric twinings, innit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks Oh yeah. Do you like in a warehouse by the way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks You're deceptive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah How's it going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah I am indeed. Might not be in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks You have blue hair tho. That's quite indie. You just need a beard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was thinking of putting some more important documents of mine into Google Docs. Do y'all think it's safe enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy You think you've broken it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 All mine used to do is cut my mouth up and make me oh so self-conscious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Sweet, I'll check that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 I had to wear braces. Freaking hated it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy That link didn't work, yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth The Black Angels you say... I'll check them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should stop listening to the Twin Shadow album all the time and find something new, any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Rock 'n' roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBHappiness - when can we expect a lovely album?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns So you're a Director Programmer, Web Developer, Photographer, Flash, Front-ender? Are you freelance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy I'll completely delete Opera and then do a fresh re-install. Just for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I'm heading back to MS-DOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos *hi five*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreweccles Really? I haven't noticed a massive difference. I just like doing the running bellyflop and shoot thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreweccles Not playing online? Months of fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twin Shadow on #6music - hells yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_brook I'm started doing the same, i.e. Chrome for browsing, FF dev.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy @ruthiepoos I've tried to install the latest Opera about 10 times on my Mac and it always fails :?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_ashworth Chrome has it's own built in firebug equivalent, but I prefer the real Firebug. Just the smoothness of Chrome is ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachael_burns Nice. Roasted wild boar with apples in their apples in their mouths? Kingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find myself using Chrome more and more as my browser of choice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@philjeffs He was doing a Cheeky Girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philjeffs yeah, really is. I'm a big Kubrick fan, but I remember getting pretty bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Ha. Fancied him out of pity... I think any guy would be pleased to hear that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins It's a great album. I'm listening to Merriweather Post Pavilion now, I didn't like it that much at first, pretty ace too tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to walk around with you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue sure, why not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went down a large pothole on my bike and took the full force to my crotch. Still numb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap As much as I want to do Zooey, I'm not a massive fan of her singing :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach You're right, I should have a sit down. Maybe a tea to unwind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just filtered out myown tweet there by mentioning the 'x' word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else care to get #semen trending? It's probably better than #xfactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissaks I thought it was some obscure hip-hop outfit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtrufitt Yeah, I'm exhausted. #semen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it technically a re-make if the original was a TV adaptation? We'll say yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, they're remaking The Woman In Black starring Harry Potter? Hrmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someofmywork Dang.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LuKaDesignCo He usually gives me the traffic report, but today we discussed the dodgy types around Salford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer yeah, the December CING you coming? I've not been to one before. (cc. @Steve_Worsley )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love making small talk with the Postman. I'm so rubbish at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to a Meetup with Creative Industries Networking Group (CING)!  http://meetu.ps/2ZB7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez, I just clicked the #twitterjoketrial hashtag and TweetDeck went mental. It's right that people are angry. Completely pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach No pets in the new flat. #otters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Are we friends on Last.fm btw? I couldn't find you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I was going to fill out my form and scan those bad boys in, email them futuristic style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else there want to be my pal on Last.fm? I'm ace, btw.  http://bit.ly/aGDvMK #lastfm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley word!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#np The Orb - Little Fluffy Clouds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Nam Sounds good, we'll see if I get any time though as I'm moving out in a couple of weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Nam Nice. Not really played Zombies much, I've been on the Multiplayer last night. I'm amazing* - *mediocre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Nam Were you playing Black Ops Zombies last night? What do think of it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew How sweet of you. You should come play BlackOps! Steve is busy, like a chump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue Hot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I'm on there I think... same username as this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladybirdblue He was breaking wind for 20 mins? Impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, they knife me in the spine, then offer me tea. It's a strange custom, but I'm getting used to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley My favourite is hiding in a window waiting to pick people off with my rifle, before being stabbed in the back. Every. Time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Christ I hope not, the person I've been controlling has died some 800 times already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Black Ops isn't a war though... it's just a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#nowplaying Acid House Kings - That's Because You Drive Me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley It's pretty cool whatever it is. Probably useless if you need to move on quickly, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Cuckoo Design (247 Chapel Street, Salford).  http://4sq.com/965H4k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrcakey I've only seen really positive reviews so far, yeah... really good. More of the same, but... with more cool stuff thrown in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the coolest new little thing I've seen in #BlackOps is how you can run and jump onto your stomach whilst shooting folk. Much fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm on the multiplayer, might save the singleplayer missions for when I don't have an internet connection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm getting my ass kicked on #BlackOps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rideawave Indeed it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley How's what? Black Ops? Just about the play it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please leave us alone when we're dancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins This could be the exception:  http://bit.ly/bTLiaF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EatYourOwnEars Really good that album, isn't it? I've been hammering it quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybudd I think that's #sarcasm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jag4091 You've got monsters in your parasol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you do... don't tell anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Nam Just had a quick go of Zombies at lunch... that hasn't changed much from WaW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallodom It says so on the back... I'll check in a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallodom @ben_nam Got my copy of Black Ops today. 4 player Zombie co-op this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I look forward to pointing my weapon in your direction, and then unloading. #warisgay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Dude you free for some Black Ops sometime this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boo. Ya.  http://yfrog.com/033ggpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley If things happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley There may be about 6 there already! But sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley DENIED! If we end up getting a place, you'll have to come play Black Ops! Obviously you're welcome to play before that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco I wonder what the no-graphic content version would be like...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ehupLOVE They gave you a girl on a bench? How DID they know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Sounds cool to me. We might not take that one we saw, looked pretty ace tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellyforspots I got mine done at printing.com was half price, if I remember correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a cool flat in the NQ with @rob_leach  - don't take it before we do. Or else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psychological torture today in Cuckoo as someone is making us listen to Radio 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickythornley I think it's because the average Potter fan's bedtime is about 7:30pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Camera Obscura's My Maudlin Career isn't the best choice of album to cheer me up, but it IS amazing, so there we go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, so... bit jealous of everyone getting #BlackOps today. Hopefully mine should turn up tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Urg. Flat hunting is pretty horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WalkingDead update: It's still ace after episode 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer No idea... should be interesting to find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HipsterEscorts I knew there'd be a time where cataracts and male pattern baldness would get me in with ladies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Nowhere Boy. Being in The Beatles seems pretty easy. Might do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus. If my #mac ran any slower today it would be traveling backwards through time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner I think I might buy another coat to put over the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't taken my coat off all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I can help you get through your exams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@racco Ha, it's all in his delivery....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone getting down on the Pulp vibe today, I think Wickerman is their best ever song:  http://bit.ly/96x0Ck  #pulp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'm afraid it's already Pulp day as they're reforming for some festivals and all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Dude, I ordered Black Ops. Might get it Weds, do you fancy a play this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah! I loved Kula Shaker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually getting excited by the idea of Xmas now. Mince pies, log fires, mulled wine... it's usually just cold and expensive, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Yeah, he's already in about 8 bands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer No Josh tho...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Pulp were good 'til the end, man! They just stopped writing britpop tunes and started writing better stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley The ska band?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Well, he 'might' have killed himself. I can quite happily listen to other suicidey-musicians, but him less than others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"What I want to know... what exactly do you do for an encore?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ClaireWill We Love Life? 'Tis here:  http://bit.ly/bliikd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a bit strange when bands reform and everyone suddenly cares about them. No-one bought the last Pulp album. (Though it was ace).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClareWallais I'm listening to the posthumous 'An Introduction To...' I'm all for downbeat, but I find it hard to listen to him often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez. Listening to some Elliot Smith this morning. The chap is pure emo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin I had a big thing for her once. Still kinda do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Real :/ Not exactly a subtle copy, is it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin I'm there and so is @thesophiew I'm not sure about the others...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha, they do seem to somehow managed to sneak in the most inappropriate adverts to the mood of the music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer atta boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamdavidprocter I think I just spoke to you @CuckooDesign - we're all loving your work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I hope you have that booming thespian voice. I want to feel the floorboards shake...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@racco oh, it's all ABOUT the #ulla right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley @rob_leach @ottomancer  I actually think everyone should be listening to this for the rest of the day:  http://bit.ly/3RwUUW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I felt bad for him during the "Radiohead! D*ckhead!" heckle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Did you end up hating Thom Yorke by the way? I don't think he came across that bad, really. A bit petulant, but aren't we all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @Steve_Worsley We're all grown men comfortable in our love for one another... threeway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley No-one could ever move me the way you do, Steve. No-one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Both my computer and my internet connection are going as slow as hell today. It's fantastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jibubo Yeah, I'm pleased it's going to be Jackson... I just don't think it would have felt the same with Del Torro. Roll on 2013?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Ha, you really hate that film it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'd quite like my own ponytailed henchmen. #fuckingdiehard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach you've never seen Die Hard? I hope you're joking. #fuckingdiehard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking Die Hard is on E4. FUCKING DIE HARD. #fuckingdiehard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Ha, I've never met you, but this is how I picture you:  http://bit.ly/bJw2YO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive Belgian Chocolate Chip cookies.. So bad for you, yet... so bad for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins you know, if everyone turned their kettle on at actually the same time... nothing much would happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseHigham84 Ha, you're so gone! Nah, I actually spoke to you in school (or pined over you) so you're a keeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach @thesophiew you guys... I'm an artist, innit. I don't do choruses. Or self-promotion of any kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss I sing and strum like an angel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner I didn't think this through did i?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so I'm currently writing a song on my guitar and it's going to make me millions of pounds and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I think I might just do the great facebook cull now, I'm just worried I'll upset someone and they'll stab me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweeting is hard with a guitar on your lap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I think it was an 'unsure' face as I wasn't sure it was the right tattoo I mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm thinking of deleting a my facebook 'friends' / people I didn't know in school and replacing them twitter people who I actually speak to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Was that the foot card thing? :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not The Cardigans, I should point out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cardigans are the best cure for hangovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach My French is limited, there was only so many times I could say bonsoir before they lost interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmNuttall Apparently it is the sound of air expelled from a wolf's vagina. Which makes perfect sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach I was trying to talk to that French band (in French) outside Ruby Lounge. Nice chaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach She did, I was already a bit drunk after the Glasser gig then I met up with her and drank a lot more. I'm just not man enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Very good indeed. You should listen to Glasser on spotify, as well as Porcelain Raft and The Bewitched Hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah,  but who parked first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew You certainly did sound like a tool, yes. No, you seemed pretty laid-back actually. Rock 'n' roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew I'm listening to All.Fm they're playing Kisses, which is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah, #inthecity last night, The Bewitched Hands, Porcelain Raft and Glasser were all amazing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayHealey Yeah, it makes sense. I just really hate Robbie Williams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHealey @gtrufitt I quite like the way #Facebook target it's ads according to your interests. Makes it less annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgust is not the same as apathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't #spotify bring in adverts that actually have something to do with what I'm listening to? Eg. I don't give a shit about Robbie Williams<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Possibly, or they just kicked me very, very hard. I was doing one of those dazzling runs i do, they didn't like it ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I think a lot of teams put in more hours than us. Plus we only had one sub #excuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olos_nah Cycling around Ireland? Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@building_blocks 4 loses, 2 wins! We won the last two once we remembered how to pass and shoot and stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley and someone managed to kick me in the shin so hard they split my shinpad, and possibly my shin. But i'm 'ard, see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley We started off quite pants, then got worse, then redeemed ourselves with 2 wins at the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had fun today at the #creativecup despite getting quite bruised and blistered. We might try and win a few more matches next time :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Powerleague - Ardwick w/ @domrodwell.  http://4sq.com/d0IrPc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss Ha, yeah that would be perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy 10:10 10/10/10 - enjoy it, it's the only one you'll get. Unless you're on a 12 hour clock, i guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Ha, thanks, I'll certainly need it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos I'm pretty sure that's a cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sneakpeek at the(XL) @CuckooDesign kit. Key to success = play a 15 man team #creativecup  http://yfrog.com/n5rjvtj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiemaymanc Orangepeel ties are where it's at right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh, I've run out of disposable contact lenses for the #creativecup - I'll have to wear my glasses. No punching me in the face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I watching this again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think having your face eaten by a chimp is worse than forgetting your lyrics #xfactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Looks good. Christian Bale looks really skinny again eh? He needs to pick a weight and stick to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_leach Maggie Gyllenhaal? I like her character's tattoos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha, thanks for that Steve. 2003? I must have been 38.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley  Yeah, just can't control my bladder when Efron is about #efroneffect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley You betcha! That Zack makes me weak in the loins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Do you like Twin Shadow? I'm really boning them at the mo'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping that staying in and playing guitar all day will make me a better footballer for tomorrow. #creativecup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Wow, that is pretty impressive, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelloHughes You're in the #creativecup tomorrow? Who you playing for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha... do you think that guy was just waiting for BT to ring?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Twin Shadow. Really amazing.  http://mysp.ac/6JFA3i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley Yeah, he kept saying how he wouldn't rest until he'd personally strangled the life out of every last one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still think Google Maps / Streetview might be the best thing the interdweeb has given us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, what is it with you and whales , man? You wouldn't shut up about them last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew Ha. That's such a good name for a band.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Lord I hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After my picture went missing from @CuckooDesign's fireplace yesterday, I decided I should fix it:  http://bit.ly/azSBnZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm catching up with #TheApprentice - was it a prerequisite that all the contestants have to be wankers? Or are all sales people like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to catch up with this week's #InBetweeners later, was it good funny, or was it over-the-top again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now eighteen months' hard labour seems... fair enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, that too. I'm not proud of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone with a withheld number called before and left a message on my a/machine that was just a resigned sigh. Maybe it was Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley To talk to? Yeah, drew a little face on it... wasn't the same.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Really need to find a girlfriend before I go away with the family again, it's hard to chat to people when they're snogging their spouse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins And she would say 'link' instead of 'like' as I just did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Ha, she didn't actually say that did she? I think it would be more like: "I really link Pink's new shoes."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>... but at the end of the day, we can all agree that Editors are shit. 'Kicks like a sleep twitch' indeed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian And what about images? Prob no practical at the mo to design websites using &lt;canvas&gt; or SVG or whatevz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_cahoona @jonthebeef Illustrator is definitely a miles better design tool, but often the design changes when converterd to .jpgs .gifs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Vector based browsers? Guh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonthebeef Maybe Fireworks... but Illustrator as a vector-based program is well shitty for raster-y website designs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Might see you there then dude. @thesophiew and I are looking for more team-mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins You should come do the Common quiz tonight. Sure they'll be music questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Eee not good :/ Did you deserve it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins I saw PIL @ the Academy last year, 2 1/2 set! Not listened to much HEALTH tho hearing good thing. BR amazing as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redswish Did you actually get punched in the head?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Listened to any super albums recently? I'm digging the new Blonde Redhead album.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm rather fond of the new Yeasayer video:  http://youtu.be/QO1y1wJduCo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnohopkins Was it your pube? If so, you're probably past the whole politeness thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Unless they've somehow managed to construct a donkey-mindreading-device (and I hope they have) it's a human voice over :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Like... they'll show a film of a old donkey and say: "My owner can't afford to feed me."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think it's a bit strange when animals are given human voices when they're trying to get donations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Really? Ace. Cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided I'm definitely going to Tokyo this year... or next, as I'm crap at saving.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@philjeffs Ooh, nice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@olos_nah I'll position: absolute, left: 5000px your face in a minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franisaholden I'd use caution when approaching a 'rip-roaring' film, probably best off with a bit of 'rip-roaring' than 'hilarious' tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you hear of a film being described as 'hilarious', it isn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley There was a div that I somehow missed with: margin 10px auto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Djohariah Djohariah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Hey, I found that 10px margin bug. It wasn't a bug. It was me being an idiot. *thumbs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My last day off today, might nip down to the @cornerhousemcr in a bit to watch The Girl Who Played With Fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Hey, thanks for the help dude, I'll check that shiz out. Just ignoring the problem for now :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ran my first 10k since the Bupa Manc run. Did ok, considering. I have received a nice blister as a reward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I've used the base-reset, yeah. Something crazy is afoot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where the sh*t is this margin at the top of the browser coming from? Everything is 0'd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha, in the mirror? It think it is! We're way famous, man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw You should. If I was a girl, I would have short hair, maybe bic-it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw You look different, Bradshaw. Hair-cut, or hair changing device? I must know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley I'm sure I could handle a drink at some point, gimme a holla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I think you'd like the Pilgrim books. I reckon they could have made a couple of films, rather than cram it all into one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just about the greatest thing ever:  http://youtu.be/jxl11ANkTx4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Yeah, saw Pilgrim the other day, really like it! Probably still prefer the comics, but they did a damn fine job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Yeah, it was pretty break-neck in it's pacing, probaby could have been 3 films. The action was amaaazing tho *thumbs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshcroft Oh yeah, Pilgrim was ace. Though I don't recommend it if you have photosensitive epilepsy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm sure I will splash the soil with the blood of the undead at some point today, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos Did you see Pilgrim them? What did you think? I was really pleased, innit. Very faithful to the G/N and all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesophiew @Steve_Worsley @tim_brook Yeah, you just remember that, guys. I'm the perfect f*cking gentleman.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tim_brook @sophiebradshaw @steve_worsley I can still meet at 7, or can go later if folk would prefer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@graphicgoose I'm meeting up with @Steve_Worsley @tim_brook & @sophiebradshaw later in the NQ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley The power of monkey was... irrepressible. It's something I think of a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Where is my mind? I was watching Fight Club last night actually. WEIRDz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonthebeef Nice album, that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Seriously?! What host are you with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian Glad I could help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian that makes you 50% better than @ruthiepoos and I, but 100% better than everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos We're 50% better than everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I think maybe, yes. I'm quite excited about this though:  http://bit.ly/dgdP06<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got me a half day today. About 50% worse than a full day off, but 50% better than a full working day. You do the maff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where the hell can you get decent, none-cheesy icons from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Either you're listening to New Order or watching Trainspotting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gablaxian If you're around the NQ tonight, you should come for a drink with myself and @sophiebradshaw @Steve_Worsley @tim_brook<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Last time I was there, the same woman took half a bottle of beer off my table and put it in the bin. :O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha! I've no idea what's going on here... am I winning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carrie_l_hall Yeah, they've said they've fixed it a few times, but it keeps getting worse. Might have a caved in roof tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://yfrog.com/86ttvj - I'm resorting to drastic measures to ignore @CuckooDesign 's  leaky roof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthiepoos one without those metal mouth-zips! They chafe anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bentopliss I have tried that, rather boring though. I prefer the excitement of having to dodge the scallies and crazies of Salford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely smashing it down in Salford. Not sure I'm man enough to go for a run in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrcakey Well, no I'm not. I'm pretty much a none-fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentopliss I'm in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rick_Turner I often come last, so allowing me join is good for boosting people's macho-football-player-pickingness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else in Twitter land got a Premiership Fantasy League is can join? The Cuckoo league is rather... empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philjeffs 8 burgers in 8 seconds! Must be some kind of a record. Here's our FF video on Facebook:  http://bit.ly/c3OLa6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doolallytap And SP isn't out here for another couple of weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Dammit... I'm not THAT much of an Edgar fan. Spaced was ace, as was Shaun, didn't like Hot Fuzz much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw And we got asked if we were ready to order about 18 times in the first 3 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw If my food was a dinosaur, it would be a delicadactil. Which is good. Although the waitress' whiny voice was a tad annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw You off to Wagams tonight? What's your dish of choice? I've had Amai Udon the last 15 times I've been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthbooth Wow, that's ace. I spent £30 on my 8GB stick a couple of years ago. What a world...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Yeah, nothing new there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Ha, you can't see anything... just me NOT sitting in my seat as it's soaking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Chappers_ Heh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I think we'll share her, when she's in the Northern Hemisphere, she's mine, Southern, yours. Deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I'm re-watching Party Down. I don't think any other woman can compare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap WHAT?!?!?!?!? THAT SON OF A...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Give it to John Cusack, the dullest actor on the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap I've only actually seen Steve Carrell in Anchorman and 40 Year Old Virgin... and The Office. I'm sure he's made some shit too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Super, cheers sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Come on, Steve Carrell is loads more lovable than Ricky Gervais... I just wanna hold him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesp0p Yo, there's a guy called Ben Nam who i work with who wants to go...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Not as annoying as Ricky Gervais...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Nice on one the Best Coast listening! I think they're ace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixelenvy @xbaz @ottomancer Aye, Dead Snow... just watched the ending of it now with my breakfast. Mmm, entrails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then again, it does have Nazi Zombies in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, this film is a little odd. If you really want to surprise someone with sex, it wouldn't be when the person is on the toilet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Shit! I didn't know Will Oldham was in town. Touch his head for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap RLY. It's fun and lovely and fun and lovely. And funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiebradshaw Jesus, I'm not a particuarly fashion-minded guy, but christ that's ugly. I might get one if it goes down to a tenner tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doolallytap Well, I recommend Scott Pilgrim, as you'd cream all over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer Good christ I hope not...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottomancer I'll still be watching no-doubt, looking forward to it, but was concerned it seemed a bit tongue-in-cheek spoofy :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Or did you mean Crystal Antlers? Hmm. I didn't know of Perfume Genius, quite like it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Hold on... you think The National sound like The Antlers?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Nah, I probably prefer Beach House as they're dark and sultry, but Best Coast are sunny poppy. Both ace tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll need a few listens of this new Arcade Fire album before I pass judgment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Actually, there comparisons in that BH and BC are both a female and male combo, and their band name sounds similar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin They sound nothing like Beach House! But Beach House's Teen Dream is my fave album this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeredithSimpkin Hey, you like good music, eh? Have you heard the Best Coast album? I should have gone see them in Manc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley Have you watched this week's LOST?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Worsley I'm of the same opinion, I don't think CSS is that difficult that it needs a framework, tho there are a few ideas within them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rmalpass I think using CSS frameworks for small websites is overkill and well, lazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass ... is that the framework is consistent so you don't have to re-learn anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmalpass I personally think they're not needed unless you're creating a massive data-driven website. I think the argument for frameworks...<|endoftext|>
