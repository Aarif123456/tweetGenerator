<|startoftext|>@zoochum @adamhousley I try checking back to the old fox reporters that used to give us our news. They are towing the same middle of the road info.  They are why we are in the trouble we are in today.  We need to follow people that are actually going after the corruption. Writing articles about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoochum @adamhousley Adam telling you all sides are the same and changing the subject to his favorite foods is ridiculous.  We are being censored and our FBI &amp; DOJ is corrupt. Your gut told you he is equivocating both sides and that’s wrong.  Don’t let him talk you out of it.  We have work to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheAmishTerp @adamhousley Jack’s tweet was pathetic.  Doesn’t take any action just like the GOPe.  I didn’t see Adam praising it but, if so that is really sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamhousley These last tweets are typical conservative approach akin to Romney, McCain, etc...  Its so frustrating.  Guess you have a few insiders telling you some info but, your takeaway is everyone is bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jCPub19 @adamhousley @POTUS Agree.  Trump tried to befriend Obama only to find out about the hoax Obama approved.  I’m tired of conservatives lumping everyone together.  Trump has leveled with us in government. The Dems and GOPe are corrupt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rosestrain @KyleKataryn @Gunnyhighway_99 @GM @MyVOCSN Stop blaming the President.  Ventilators are the job of hospitals and the state governments to procure.

<|startoftext|>@ClimateAudit Yes.  This is what we need.  An extremely detailed timeline of all involved and their actions.  Too many articles with cherry picked facts.  Can’t connect dots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Did the FBI alert CIA not to use Page or divulge info to Page once FBI thought enough evidence against Page to spy on him?  Were they (FBI) not concerned the CIA was in the dark about this supposed crook?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@favortj @JonathanTurley Did top brass CIA &amp; FBI have a conversation regarding Page (especially after Page’s name/investigation was public knowledge) if FBI felt Page was compromised? When did FBI alert CIA to stop using Page to conduct official business?  If not, FBI knew this line was a sham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Yes.  Coupled with the dossier starting with the Rs and then used by Hillary suggests a full on coup driven by FBI. It’s the ‘Insurance Policy’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley ‘Insurance Policy’ was discussed in texts.  Cannot be a coincidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Comey seemed unclear but is on record (maybe to legitimize the dossier) quizzically exposing the dossier as first funded by R elites.

<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Problem is the complainant 1.) checked box first hand knowledge and did not have any 2.) IC IG determined complaint was credible without the first hand knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Law is 1st hand knowledge not necessary ‘in order to file complaint’.  But, real life without it most complaints would not be investigated. Therefore, the Form asks complainant to check box if first hand knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWHuber Or, they don’t need first hand knowledge to file but, most complaints without first hand knowledge would not be investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SD49ersPadres @cufarmer @ByronYork Thus, getting the IC IG to review compliant and finding ‘urgency’ whereas other departments did NOT.  This is all part of the coverup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SD49ersPadres @cufarmer @ByronYork Strange the FORM required first hand knowledge and was only changed upon this particular ‘whistleblower’ filing.  Clearly, the whistleblower (attorney) found a way to file the form by checking 1st hand knowledge but not really having 1st hand knowledge as shown in details.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork The news release is wrotten to make it seem like the same procedure has been in place since 2018 and the ‘whistleblower’s’ complaint followed current procedure.  In fact, the ‘whistblower’ was treated different than form.  It’s a cover.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter Part of this is an act.  He’s purposefully playing the part if too big a report to remember. It’s also a strategy on Mueller’s part.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Applelleplus  https://t.co/l7Ax15WE5x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL You have some good legal points but, blaming Trump for this is typical.  Next liberals will blame Trump for Jussie.  I was wrong about the copyright.  I still think it’s a shame REM resorted to legal action for a meme.  You argued legal points but, it’s greyer than you let on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL I told you from the beginning I’m glad REM kept their copyrights.  I hope they did for their sake.  I didn’t realize publishing gets involved but, that seems to be very grey in memes.  How is Trump wrong in this case?  You blame Trump for everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL I think we’re both done with this.  Bottom line liberals want to get in a legal battle any chance they can.  Conservatives are out living our lives getting caught up in the bitter blues of liberals going after every cause ad nauseum.  You gave some clarifications. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL This is the entire reason Carpe choose this song.  He knew the band would become unhinged after giving written permission and the entire parody is the bands emotional equivalence to the liberal politicians at SOTU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL The song is adapted to partial format to show the band was only partially levelheaded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL Now that is very grey.  It is official business to show the State of the Union.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL Yeah. I get that but, Mike spoke on behalf of the band and Carpe went ahead. So did Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL No one is advertising.  You try to conflate all this stuff. It’s a meme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL And, we are discussing Fair Use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marinaroj @DOBrienATL @m_millsey Thought police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL It IS grey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL I got that but, you asked me to show you where Mike gave his approval.  Approval in law goes a long way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL Mike gave permission in writing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL Looks like the meme was Fair Use to everyone but Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL Here:  https://t.co/w6qDQa1ZJD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL @m_millsey You do know Mike had a tweet that said (paraphrasing) ‘go ahead Fair use’ directly to Carpe.  I’m just saying this whole thing is ridiculous for a meme.  People on both sides like(d) REM and to deny a conservative to tweet a meme using bits of a song is overdone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL @m_millsey Okay.  Thanks for info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL @m_millsey Mike gave the okay for Fair Use to CarpeDonktum via a tweet.  Maybe he decided later to rescind or Universal got involved.  Bands sell rights all the time despite being a good or bad idea.  I’m not so sure you’re in a position to know details you claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oracleorare @DOBrienATL @m_millsey I’m glad they didn’t sell the copyright.  If in fact they did, REM may get royalties  and that’s fine, too.  Universal is their negotiator?  Universal has something to gain.  CarpeDonktum said Universal made twitter take down the video.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry Apology not offered. Watch the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry The fact this stuff is published shows where NRO stood.  I was constantly bickering with them to support our GOP candidate. NRO supported nutcase Evan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ar_Chroi @VWHORUSHD @RichLowry NRO did everything but come out explicitly to vote for Hillary and then Dems in ‘18.

<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @RichLowry And, maybe had NRO came to the kids defense sooner (than today and some half apologies yesterday) the left would not have taken this so far.  The kids aren’t jn school today because of it.  Get off your high-horse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry And wow.  You want an apology from me?  I think it takes over two days in your works to expect one. In this case I don’t need to apologize because I said the truth.  Good luck honey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry I’m not making it up.  Maybe you don’t read enough of their articles.  Wow.  You sound just like them.  Good luck to you.  I could care less if you read them or not.  They don’t support Cruz anymore because Cruz is with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry Yes they did.  Bottom line they are so anti-Trump they have liberal followers.  Jonah wanted to bag Kavenaugh when the libs did this to the nominee.  They tried to take out Trump after being elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @RichLowry NRO should of been on the boys side. At least should of done their homework before commenting.  They are journalists. This was a Catholic school. I didn’t like the look of the first video I saw. But, I knew to look for more info based on the world we live in today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry This was written last night at 5:55pm after it was clear for days Saturday night to Sunday night) that the article was wrong.  He had it in his twitter feed until then. Probably still does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @Ar_Chroi @RichLowry I will not waste my time reading it.  I’ve tried reading these people.  Tried getting them to unite with Trump supporters.  It’s useless. They told us to vote for Dems and Hillary.  Plus, I’m sure it’s laden with lessons for the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrypictures @VWHORUSHD @RichLowry It’s called freedom of speech.  I support Trump and have a #MAGA hat.  My kids goto Catholic school.  You want to take that away from me? Just try.  We are voting for him in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @RichLowry Yesterday. Several several hours after the full video was out and several had already apologized.  Guess you like your apologies late.  My take they waited until there was any possibility they didn’t have to apologize. There are different types.  Wait till it happens to your kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostjingo Phillips is a creep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @RichLowry The writer had the article posted in his twitter feed until last night.  Maybe still does.  I would have made the guy take it down Saturday night. Personal apologies were not made timely. Guess we have different standards. They judged boys when further info was readily available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bflat879 @RichLowry They can’t be like Breitbart because they have an agenda.  They don’t want tea party or Trump supporters.  They want war and open borders for their big huge corps.  Then, they try to disguise it with moral lessons for all of us they presume are not successful. Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLowry @marlo_safi NRO did the same thing to Trump supporters that attended rallies and fundraisers.  Your goal is only to elect your GOPe candidates that want world order and no borders.  At any cost.  You wanted us to vote for these liberal opponents last election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLowry @marlo_safi The writer had the article in his twitter feed and available to read still last night.  Are you kidding he didn’t know to take it down Monday night?  Those of us in twitter following the story watched the entire video available Saturday.  Wow you’re slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VWHORUSHD @RichLowry No.  They should of done this Saturday night when the full video was available.  With their supposable superior moral intellect it sure took NRO a long time to refute and apologize in unison as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLowry @marlo_safi The original writer had it on his twitter feed at least until last night.  Probably still does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcGiller @RichLowry They accepted it because it involved Trump MAGA hats. NRO can’t help themselves denounce Trump supporters. They are still livid Trump beat their swamp candidates. They think they’re morally superior to Trump Christians/non-Christians.  They think their think-tanks still fool us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey We watched/followed the Covington Catholic story &amp; knew within an hour on Saturday the story was wrong. We will not wait 24 hrs.

<|startoftext|>@ethanhein @RealWadeGarrett @annehelen We really don’t care.  These women can work their lives away.  Better they stay with cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealWadeGarrett @Johnny_UT @annehelen Clearly it’s a Femi-nazi she admires.  This chick has some real problems.  Best to avoid at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annehelen Ma’am you need help.  One day you will realize your extreme feminism did you no favors. Already getting on with age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annehelen You attaching an innocent 16 yr olds picture to all of those accusations about boys/men is disgusting. I hope my daughters are not overcome with feminist rot that got to you.  Please tell us the school you taught at so we can avoid it at all costs. #MAGA #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJohnYarmuth I own a #MAGA hat and you scared the heck out of me with your dictating we don’t wear #MAGA hats.  #StandWithCovington John you tried to take away our free speech.  You tried to scare us into not wearing #MAGA hats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper I am so proud of this exemplary statement and the behavior of these boys.  #StandWithCovington #proudtobeCatholic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle @jaketapper Usually,he speaks in his own voice.  Quoting someone else is a start but, what about stating the facts himself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers The narrative is the video.  Geez.... it’s not complex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnsonHildy @washingtonpost  https://t.co/uqp5WSyFG0. NRO had quite the skewed take.  Baboozled?  Or, lying?  The videos were out yesterday afternoon.  #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlsHouston @goldietaylor Goldie, I don’t know who you are but, you need to actually watch the  video.  Your tweets are concerning that you can’t see the truth.  Ugh.  Your hate is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxKennerly @jaketapper @reason @robbysoave Oh my.  You are lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJohnYarmuth You are scary.  What does this mean?  Is this a prelude to censorship?  To what?  Scary.  Are you a socialist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EsotericCD @DavidAFrench  https://t.co/uqp5WSyFG0 Your NRO article is still posted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFrankovich You wrote an article like this and then stepped away?  Do you know how this is affecting the boys and their families?  What a disgrace.  I have no clue who you are but I am aware of NRO that published it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmleigh1977 @NFrankovich No.  He still has it posted.  https://t.co/uqp5WSyFG0 #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janelinton Agree. #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @willchamberlain Thank God we have a platform to refute their narrative.  #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ You backed everyone but, the boys learning at your Catholic institution. It seems contrary to your position in the Catholic Pedophilia scandal. I am a Catholic and disappointed in your tweets.  My kids goto Catholic school.  Is this how you treat your family? #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @willchamberlain We support them and fought for them on twitter since hour one.  This was a smear campaign not dissimilar to the Trump rally/fundraiser smear campaigns.#StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain @RepThomasMassie And, did you notice all of a sudden #CovingtonCatholic is no longer trending.  Twitter is pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepThomasMassie Awesome. My thoughts exactly.  The boys showed exemplary behavior after being harassed for quite some time. #StandWithCovington<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@221Btrentbo @Roondog56 @MylesBoch @DanRather Stop blaming everyone but, the culprits.  In this case it’s the Elder and the harassing Israelites.  Geez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I #StandWithCovington I #StandWithCovington I #StandWithCovington  #CovingtonCatholic #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertWeav1 @DavidAFrench @michaelbd NRO failed miserably.  They wrote an article comparing it to the boys ‘spitting on the cross’.  Apparently, they took down the article and don’t mention it in this lesson. #hypocrites I stood with the Catholic boys since the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt How about training for the elder on not to invade people’s personal space with intimidation tactics.  I can’t believe you think we should cater to these creeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExNinja95 And, the creeps said the boys were products of incest.  The media doesn’t go after the Israelites(Hebrew something formally).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @KurtSchlichter Agree.  We are not stopping.  This is for our freedom of religion and speech.  Coincidentally, Twitter was trending Sinead O’Connor incident with the Pope this morning.  This is a pile on to harass Christians and Christian Schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@221Btrentbo @MylesBoch @DanRather I’m not okay with the Elder being able to intimidate kids or myself in this fashion.  I’m not okay with just walking away anymore. Don’t you get this is a fight for our very rights and truth.  This elder needs to know it’s not okay to intimidate kids or other adults like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter Or, stop caring about them.  My life has been much easier after I stopped following those types. Every once in a while I check in and they’re still spewing their hate.  And, it is hate. Jonah can’t give one accolade to Trump or his administration.  Not one.  French the whole lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EsotericCD So we can’t support our President without being harassed.  Wow. Guess you can’t be a Catholic or a rich kid either.  Some country we are turning into.  Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter Veteran or not we are supposed to allow a person to approach us and heat a drum in our face?  Sorry, no. I will not take it nor would I want it happening to my kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter I’m not letting it go till this boy has justice.  It’s not right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@221Btrentbo @MylesBoch @DanRather I don’t think he realized what was happening.  I think he thought the respectful thing to do was let the elder beat it in his face.  So if he walked away can you imagine they would say he was disrespectful.  The elder is so wrong for doing this to a 16 year old kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter @DavidAFrench It’s hard for NRO to not hate anyone wearing a #MAGA hat.  NRO likes to provide lessons to those of us that dare wear one.  I have one (and signed by Trump) and have never worn it.  Pathetic.  This is what happens if you dare wear one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisKole @DevilwomanTam @ali Exactly.  I would not allow anyone to beat their drum in my face despite what they’ve done in life.  It’s grotesque and intimidation tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@221Btrentbo @MylesBoch @DanRather Would you move if you had a person beating a drum in your face? Why should he?  The Native walked up to the Catholic boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfaver @DanRather He lost it awhile back when making up stories about Bush. That’s when he lost his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selinasmed @amburwhitehouse @SLIMANOS2 @TheKevinDent @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo The guy cussed at me.  I’m a woman and don’t take that. He is s pig.  My argument did not go dry.  Try reading just about anyone admitting they were wrong.  https://t.co/YDhsk4j1HG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SLIMANOS2 @amburwhitehouse @TheKevinDent @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo You’re disgusting.  Sleazebag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calvinstowell What were the catholic boys saying dmthat was so horrific? Name one thing. They didn’t say anything horrific. The Israelites (Hebrew group)said horrific things to the boys and about gays.  Didn’t the Catholic boys call them out on it? Yes, they did. You are not being transparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @TheKevinDent @SLIMANOS2 @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo  https://t.co/GLdamrE0IZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @TheKevinDent @SLIMANOS2 @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo Sad.  The writer changed his mind after seeing the full video and he spells out why.  I will not allow you to condemn young innocent boys. Ruin lives just because you perceive them as privileged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @TheKevinDent @SLIMANOS2 @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo  https://t.co/xpAlTJu04m. Please read the article.  These are the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo Try the full video (an hour long) with sound turned on for the full facts.  It’s  on my timeline.  Seriously, please watch it.  You are wrongly condemning 14-16year old kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKevinDent @SLIMANOS2 @amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo Ah wrong.  The kids were there for the March for Life.  They were not there to protest.  Again, watch the full video (it’s an hour and probably too long for you) and you may learn something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo You better go back to the drawing board.  You’re misinformed.  No sense arguing with someone that doesn’t know the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKevinDent @amburwhitehouse @SLIMANOS2 @happyhelenb @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo You have a thing against serving fries? You’re ridiculous.  You think because you live in Beverly Hills the rest of us serve fries?  You know nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willchamberlain @Cernovich @Barnes_Law We cannot let this go until media admits the truth. This is important for all of our sakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCormickProf @amconmag The elder in fact thinks he can heat a drum in people’s faces. I would be upset if a drum was in my face.  How would you handle a drum being beat in your face?  You feel people should just walk away? I can’t say I would even though I respect elders and veterans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCormickProf @amconmag If you watch the entire video from start to finish list of these boys acted exemplary.  I feel they were dancing to the drum at first thinking the elder was comforting them after the attacks by the Israelites. They are 14-16 and clearly young and some immature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCormickProf @amconmag I wasn’t happy what I first saw either.  Then, I saw the boys wearing MAGA hats and knew first hand this was probably not accurate.  The media andleft treated all of us that attended Trump rallies and/or fundraisers this same way.  We were adults being called racists etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @SLIMANOS2 @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo What do you see them doing that is wrong behavior?  A guy hears a drum in your face.  Your 14-16 and they didn’t retaliate.  Phillips is a known agitator.  The kids were there for the March for Life.  You’re getting bad information but maybe you’re not interested in truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo He walked into the kids circle in the middle of their school chant.  The kids didn’t even know Phillips was approaching them.  Sounds like you haven’t watched the full video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baseballcrank @lheal @JeffQuinton If you watch thee torevuseo (hour long) the boys handled themselves quite honorably.  If a stranger was banging on a drum in my face I would of told him to get away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EsotericCD This is the way they treat anybody that is a Trump supporter.  They treated those of us that attended rallies and fund raisers for Trump the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pj219 @motmemes @MuguimiDavis @ChrisCuomo What’s yours?  Standing in front for an upside down flag is disrespectful to our country.  Beating a drum in a boy’s face or anyone’s face is disrespectful.  Going into the boys circle is odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey What specifically is the taunting?  One kid did the Tomahawk Chop.  Agree people shouldn’t do this but, an entire stadium did it.  Were they all racist?  A few were dancing but, so were the people walking with the elder.  They were moving to the drum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkermatic6 @washingtonpost Wrong attachment.  Sorry.  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkermatic6 @washingtonpost  https://t.co/uqp5WSyFG0 here’s the full video.  Please watch in entirety and and see if you really think the kids meant harm. I would be curious to know.  Do we are supposed to let a man drum right in our face? And, if so we are supposed to move for them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SLIMANOS2 @amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo No.  It wasn’t stupid from both sides. Watch the full video.  Kids can chant just like the Eldercam bang his drum.  He just doesn’t get to bang it right in someone’s face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amburwhitehouse @happyhelenb @TheKevinDent @mickhagen @Uncle_Jimbo The elder Phillips walked into the boys area.  The elder banged a drum in the boys face.  What did the boy(s) do to harass him? They danced and so was the girl seeming to be part of the Elder’s group. You are picking on 14-16 year old boys.  Get a life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arlenparsa Wow.  Did you watch the full video (over an hour)?  These boys stick up for gay tight when the Israelites use the term ‘faggot’. The same kid that Phillips tried to intimidate gestured to his friend to not debate.  These are pretty nice boys.  They had been harassed prior to all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arelab13 @CassandraRules This morning this was written.  https://t.co/uqp5WSyFG0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules Me too.  We need to fight back with the truth.  Show our solidarity with these boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeOnAJourney @Cernovich That’s why we cannot let this one go.  We have to fight and get the truth out.  I will not let these boys be destroyed by Phillip’s lies and the disgusting Israelite’s harassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustaGuy1225 @NFrankovich Don’t give him that much credit.  He knows the truth but, any chance to bring down #MAGA is NROs agenda.  Remember they wanted Hillary since they couldn’t get their GOPe world order person.  It’s the Goldman $$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrsantiagomnaz @AvaFremont @NFrankovich Here it is.  So tired of these elite NRO judging us like they are God. Pathetic.  The boys were acting more than appropriately.  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFrankovich  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5. Judge for yourself.  NROwants to condemn anybody that wears a #MAGA hat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mucifous @JonWain33 @applegreentech @maggieNYT  https://t.co/11XfEVwzjm  Here it is in full version.  Watch from beginning to end and you will see the boys displaying mostly exemplary behavior.  Especially for 14-16yearsold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjconk01 @callme_Chari @Shouryureppa @ScottAdamsSays @CNN If someone walked up to me in a public area and started beating a drum in my face I would do at least the same.  We do not have to take that crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btgozon @JonWain33 @mucifous @applegreentech @maggieNYT The boy that took his shirt off probably does that aspart of a chant.  Give him a break he’s 14-16.  Big deal.  Phillips got in their faces.  Why should they just listen?they basically did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btgozon @JonWain33 @mucifous @applegreentech @maggieNYT They were there to meet for their bus pickup.  If you watch the entire video the Israelitessyarted telling to the boys first.  The boys were polite.  Then after being called ‘product of incest’ and much more they started their own school chant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callme_Chari @bjconk01 @Shouryureppa @ScottAdamsSays @CNN I didn’t think it looked good at first but, I remembered first hand what they did to us attending Trump rallies.  Tried to make us look like we were all racists.  Sad that the church didn’t stand up for their own and get the facts before apologizing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsBuckeye @benshapiro @AClementsWKRC @Local12 And, Phillips turns around and faces back down the stairs after the boys left.  Phillips claimed in paper he was trying to get up the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AG_Conservative The media participated in it.  There is nothing to recognize. Did The NY Times ask the boys their side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AG_Conservative  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AG_Conservative @willchamberlain Phillips has a path to the left to get up the stairs.  He choose to go into the boys group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Here is the long version.  Spread it!  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrap02 @Cernovich  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5 watch the entire video (it’s an hour) and you will see the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btgozon @JonWain33 @mucifous @applegreentech @maggieNYT  https://t.co/s1LRcpTmx5. Please watch the entire thing from beginning to end. You will see the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrap02 @Cernovich Just watched it this morning.  Will find and post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Wow. Maggie knows this is #fakenews.   I am appalled at her behavior.  Please look at the full video.  You will understand this is fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonWain33 @mucifous @applegreentech @maggieNYT The boys were there for March for Life.  They were meeting there for their bus pickup.  Watch the longer video and these kids reacted appropriately after all the insults from the Israelites group.  The more you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLowry @Timcast This is a dumb take.  Watch the full video and these boys acted appropriately in the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Esjabe1 @c3yric @StableGeniusRN @nickmon1112 A drum beating in your face and what was he supposed to do? He can’t stay in his space or he is disrespectful? Give me a break.  Pick on people your own age.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joshuacarroll83 @JamesMartinSJ @NCRonline I wear a MAGA hat and my kids goto Catholic school.  I support the wall.  Watch the entire video.  If you still support the drummer than you need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Their school and church apologizing to Phillips instead helping their own school-kids is sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leftistkevo @Bo_Tovar @worldwaldweb @slpng_giants I think the Elder was trying hard to intimidate the boy.  The elder walked into the boy’s space and drummed right in his face.  The elder had his people filming.  The elder is a left wing antagonist.  You are a bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyNotAMoose @linkszxx @RandyHu87093758 @AClementsWKRC @Local12 True.  But, what’s wrong with saying Build the Wall?  We can’t say that without being called racist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays @lsraelhr @JackPosobiec Are we supposed to simply walk away because of his heritage.  I agree to respect elders but, not necessarily when they beat drums in our face while filming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays @lsraelhr @JackPosobiec What would you do if this elder heat his drum in your face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays @JackPosobiec I do too.  But, if the elder approached you beating his drum right in your face what would you do? I wouldn’t like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Agree if the elder was not confronting the kids.  But, we are supposed to let someone beat a drum in our face and walk away?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I think this is not the truth.  Does Dr. Ford speak like this at Stanford.   She seemed unclear about everything but the alleged assault.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC Wish Ford was asked these questions. 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdabrosca @Cernovich Exactly.  I even am starting to believe her.  We need facts showing us why her ‘story’ is faulty.  We saw 3 maps and nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimStrassel Yeah that is not how the general public and mostly liberals see it.  We want specific points to show her story doesn’t pan out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Burghgirl69 @johncardillo Sure.  Doesn’t get our pick in the Supremem Court.  Have fun with the little side-notes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedogist @JonahNRO Jonah, this was your guy. This is how your GOP fights for him.  Trump needs to abandon all of you and go with the female judge nominee tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench @benshapiro Maybe if Ford has to be more specific than her same very thin story we could determine if she is lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 So what?  That’s a side-note.  People will say the assault happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 And, clearly the GOP will not get to it. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @PoliticalShort Let’s focus on the assault day.  That is a fun side-note.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze The point is Ford gives open-ended answers and is giving her ‘story’ whether true or not.  GOP have no fight. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze The GOO have no clue about how to back their nominee in a clearly unsubstantiated charge.  They blew it again. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze She is under oath GOP should ask her to answer the questions.  A person’s career depends on it.  They are handling her with kid gloves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo And, how does this help Kavanaugh?  That’s not the point here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ Why is this attorney asking her about that? She seems to ask questions she doesn’t know the answers to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker @Cernovich I would like questions to try to determine the truth.  The process should have been to lead us through what happened and ask questions about the discrepancies. I’m not interested in her later psychological problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer Leave it to the GOP to accommodate and not fight. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimStrassel We did not get a straight answer in that.  How do you not know if you gave someone the documents?  That’s s lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturbe_d @AriFleischer Ford is playing naive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze We’ve failed to show or ask if Leland was her best friend yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze I would tell her to ask her attorneys next to her if she gave them or not.  She is under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPCarney @JonahNRO This is why we voted for Trump.  Get it yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturbe_d @AriFleischer I’m not sure the general public cares about small little inconsistencies from 35 years ago.  GOP has to make bigger points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO And now Ford gets pointers from her attorneys during break.  You don’t think they are giving her notes during Dem side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO Absolute disaster.  Ford is purposely using up time by her answers.  Ford acting like a naive little girl.  She wears a Pussy Cap. Don’t buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ This isn’t a problem.  Ford will say she thought they were nice boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC @BuckSexton It will establish that Ford lies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@garygleeson @juneslili @RaheemKassam @realDonaldTrump Because Steve didn't come out and say the statements were not true. Axios reported he was in the process but it never came out. Still hasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam @Laurie5956 What are we supposed to 'believe' when Bannon nor Breitbart addresses the book from your inside perspective. Non coverage is #fakenews. Please tell us what happened. We have been waiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews We agree. He should never have recused himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanvswan We already had distrust of the media and did not need any 'Fuel'. So not correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews Change the name of your publication. Bannon betrayed President. Breitbart is not the reason Trump won. Most voters never heard of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO Keeping your soul voting for Hillary Clinton and then attempting to subvert our election process? We know full well Bannon/Breitbart problems. Doesnt make you right on Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO I can think of a publication that 'squandered power' once had. NRO. You speak for a subset of your old readers. NRO's predictions and preaching was so wrong in '16 and '17 you have liberals cheering you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Trump's legal team to enforce Non-Disclosure Bannon signed that are standard in business. DCs ineptness in business matters is showing again. #DrainTheSwamp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidAFrench Better voices like NRO preaching values while protecting the swamp and world-order? No such luck. Breitbart readers will not follow NRO, its agenda, or Evan Mcwhoever. #MAGA Trump/Bannon relationship is inconsequential to our success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yair_Rosenberg @redsteeze @MittRomney Should we send pacifiers to all of you? Or do you prefer a rattle? Trump did not need (or want) the Presidency but did it to straighten out the corrupt inefficient government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Red telling Romney not to fight for seat, Romney not bringing up Benghazi, milquetoast McCain in his lame  Pres run are all examples of GOPe inability to conquer liberals. Instead, they bring down Trump's conservative agenda to protect the swamp. That's where we are at.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @SiriusXMPatriot Sorry, but Bannon has to address the book. Tuned in and it was ignored. That's almost #fakenews. You need to address.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @BreitbartNews @SiriusXMPatriot Bannon did not address the obvious. Bannon ignored book in opening.  Please don't become #fakenews.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@devous3 @JudsonMcCulloch @cherry_bethea @stranahan Trump shouldn't have to write the plan. That is a job for Congress.  Trump wants a better plan passed. It's called Executive position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwb_wen @stranahan Deary, unfortunately with legislators it is not about 'negotiating' it's wheeling and DEALING and lobbyists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwb_wen @stranahan Dear you should read about it. You're the one wanting Trump to legislate w the rest of the ineffective legislators. He is an executive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan We pay personally for Ryan's failures. Please don't tell us we don't understand legislature. I pay many $ for him to do his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hiturbine @stranahan Ryan wanted it. Covering illegals is inevitable but not via legal citizens premiums. Lee, If Ryan wasn't ready than he should of spoke up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan In the real world we come up w workable solutions to problems. Legislators concerned w solutions for their lobbyists &amp; deal making. #NOMORE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Pretty sure Medicaid/Medicare are still in place. This bill covered illegals w our healthcare premium $. Find a solution &amp; pass a bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWMegafan @stranahan We shouldn't need 4D chess. Just a decent bill for the people but fair to insurance etc.. My family healthcare tripled in 2 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan But, Trump could say I gave you a chance and you couldn't get a good bill passed that common sense people would be for. It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Why didn't Ryan incorporate part of Rand Paul's bill. Or, at least read it. Legislature needs an overhaul. #lobbyists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Ryan said back in October he would step down from Speaker if Trump wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Trump should be focused on executive orders of protection, military etc..  Plus, Trump campaigned on not being beholden or owing to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan So Trumo should tell them he will give them something wasteful in the bill to get it done? Let Ryan do that. Trump says what he wants done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Again, this is a new approach to government executive branch similar to business executives. Legislation process adding deals etc is bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Not formally but Trump could have a conversation that told Ryan to get a more conservative bill passed while Trump works on other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Trump should not have to wheel and deal w legislators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Right. Trump delegated Repeal and Replace healthcare bill to Ryan. Ryan was supposed to legislate it. Trump gave encouragement for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Trump is bringing a business style approach to government. Still have to follow legislature but Trump doesn't need to deal directly w them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Trump delegated repeal and replace to Ryan. In business we delegate. Ryan didn't get it done. #demotion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Comey said Putin wanted Bernie to win.  Ironically at the same time GOPe were paying for the dossier work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitchyTeam @joelpollak Hacking Aug '15. Investigation started July '16. Threat wasn't critical enough to access DNC servers firsthand or inform Intel Committee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze I get the feeling FBI does not like to access servers during investigations. #ComeyHearing #ClintonEmails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGowdySC @FBI We wanted questions asked of Comey regarding this info. GOP is always a step behind.  https://t.co/68CjTZJDvX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet, no one one the committee asked Comey about why DNC would not allow access to server &amp; instead had erroneous Crowdstrike make report.  https://t.co/wSJxvZmQLr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGowdySC @FBI Again, GOP missed opportunity to ask direct questions to Comey. You all are dancing around the questions Americans have. #donothingcongress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Did not go far enough. Forget it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurdOnTheHill Here is a good article on your line of questioning. Could you go further? Why didn't adNC allow FBI access to servers.  https://t.co/68CjTZJDvX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn't the FBI get access to servers. They asked! Ask Comey this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the line of questioning we need. Better thanGowdy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan finally getting to a few of your points!   Listen now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! August 2015. 'Never got access'! Keep going!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoungDems4Trump @lbasscook And, they sure like her husband in 2013.   https://t.co/W5ZRSEKiOy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Most Americans never heard much about the details in the emails anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Why doesn't someone specifically state this or ask Comey instead of us having to connect dots. Republicans are lame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Team Clinton made fun of their own donors on the emails. They also degraded their voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG now Nunes schilling for the GOPelite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze People voted for Trump because they are tired of crooked bought politicians on both sides. Period. The elite still do not understand this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comey is using this story because he knows the hacks occurred in '15. Comey trying hard to get Trump in the mix to justify wiretapping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii The problem is why the committee lets Comey get away with this? Comey doesn't answer the few questions applicable by speaking in a cloud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erniehat And, to invest in the candidate that was not electable by polls and pundits. The hacks occurred in '15 according to Comey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sessions should never have recused himself. Absolutely ridiculous. Either fight back or our nation is being sold out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to change the way hearings are conducted. Waste of time. Part of time should be a special prosecutor style line of questioning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hearing is a waste of our tax dollars. Asking intelligence why we impose sanctions. This is not economics 101 class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter Is our intelligence so poor that we do not surveil the head of a campaign colluding with our 'enemy' when under investigation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter Question for Comey: Did the FBI review DNC hacked computers first hand or rely on the DNC 3rd party Crowdstrike?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews Wasn't it Obama that revealed he would have more flexibility after election to the RUSSIANS in '12. Could Rogers comment on economy effects?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabriella_akat @mflynnJR Comey already spinning this to 2nd hand info. This will never be investigated by the swamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giraffesalive1 @ericbolling Sadly most Americans only hear CNN (and FOX today) spin that Trump is being investigated. Questions are terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @redsteeze Same reason @ChuckGrassley just tweeted Comey already admitted it to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliespiering @joelpollak And, FBI doesn't use surveillance on Trump if under investigation? Doesn't add up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are on track to have him confirmed and on the bench in early April. #ConfirmGorsuch by @DaveNYviii  https://t.co/powde4wa2r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Great work Lee. This is not adding up. Comey handled Hillary's investigation same way. They failed to get all her servers for the emails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stranahan Comey said the hacks started as early as 2015. When did Crowdstrike think hacks occurred? Trump was long-shot primary candidate at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewart1306 @Trumpwatching1 @Rosie How much was contributed to Trump? $0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt No. It is not obvious. You and your kind did not win. We want someone just like Flynn.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @bender2440 @JustinTrudeau  This is not a religious ban.We need extreme vetting from jihad nations.  https://t.co/bcLDKg9oCa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bender2440 @vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau There's no change. Obama banned Muslims and so did Carter. We want laws abided by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Archivist1000 @vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau U won't. Plus, I never made the point US is the most free. Although, I believe to be true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau China has no concern for the environment. You must live w their expectations on environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau Why are u in US if your hero is leading Canada? Not as easy to get into Canada as one might think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau No. Have no interest in living by the UN, Canadian, or Sharia Laws. US is sovereign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau U need to read ur pinned tweet. US lives by OUR Constitution not by 'world expectations'. Latter=no freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 @giovanelo74 And, does he have dealings with all these other Muslim nations?  https://t.co/bcLDKg9oCa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giovanelo74 @crossland68  U may want to inquire about these countries if concerned about other Muslim nations.  https://t.co/bcLDKg9oCa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @JustinTrudeau Wow. U must feel no freedom. US is changing our policy so u better change yours respectively w that premise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancouverboomer @crossland68 Agree. What I meant is Sharia Law is not just a religion. I'm religious but it doesn't supersede US law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Meanwich @AMluvinit2 @VoxGenevieve Yup. And, if u want Sharia Law move. We had an election here &amp; Thank God we elected as a nation Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giovanelo74 @crossland68 Trump put his business decisions out of his hands.Trump revenue going to our gov. SA gov is not calling for jihad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Meanwich @AMluvinit2 @VoxGenevieve If you &amp; a large group of people want a yacht and have no respect for law that would be a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 @giovanelo74 That argument didn't fair well during the election. U still trying to use Trump's business dealings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giovanelo74 @crossland68 How did you feel about Obama's ban? Your argument is not rational. U want all Muslim countries included?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjfettweis @crossland68 Spend some time in a refugee camp. Educate yourself on what's happening in Europe. Or, in a Muslim pop US city.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricRWeinstein We are all grown ups here. Why are you treating Muslims w kid gloves? We are trying to avoid Europe's refugee problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricRWeinstein Who is doing that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricRWeinstein So you are okay w what's happening in Europe? What about the safe zones?Muslims don't want to leave their homeland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveGoeing @ByronYork @POTUS It is clear Chicago needs Federal military or CIA to clean up city. &amp; Flint. $ is not used effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 May have obtained visas in SA but trained in banned countries supporting jihad. Agree SA may need to be added to list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EWErickson If Donald Trump is not a 'conservative' than sign me up for whatever he is. I will not return to McCain &amp; Bush 'conservatism'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveGoeing @ByronYork @POTUS Yes. Like to see that. In addition tell us why Obama and Carter Muslim bans were not critiqued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 Saudi may have funded 9/11 but the terrorists were from other countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 They want Sharia Law here. It is not a religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMluvinit2 @KurtSchlichter @VoxGenevieve @RadioFreeTom studies show refugees want Sharia law over our Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossland68 Ask current refugees in America and most want Sharia here. That is a problem. Our Constitution is the law here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter @VoxGenevieve @RadioFreeTom The issue is also sharia law and an ideology.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich This thread is interesting. U would like.  https://t.co/z1nOnU7Zmf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 Trump is volunteering 4 years of his life to help straighten out America. Just make sure U donate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 U realize all the fortune 100 /500 companies take advantage of tax loopholes &amp; debt restructuring. Go after them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 His tv show alone raised millions for charity. His son raised millions for St. Jude. But yeah whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 I feel sorry he took the job w the naysayers. He didn't need the  https://t.co/z6F573T4s7 much did u give to charity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 + he is taking no salary. Employing several thousand people. Paying their salary taxes &amp; salary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 he has made efforts to avoid the conflict of interest. His companies are giving the government the profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 look at his kids w their charities. It's really a disgrace people want to tear apart a family that is successful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 In building subs often don't complete things proper. Trump doesn't go around not paying people for good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 fairly unheard of w no debt. That's admirable. Trump has built beautiful places. Relatively few failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 Where did he lie about it? It's private &amp; usually co is worth 10x it's income. + he has personal assets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 where did you get the 4 billion? His Disclosure said 10 billion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 what's your debt? Seems you like to discuss business debt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 believe you said you're a small business owner. Respect that much. But, why discount a large business owner?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 remember to pay taxes on the investment gains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 That is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 when is this debt due? MSM forgot to report that when attempting to trash Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 He is worth 10 billion. And, more after his Presidency. Thank God we have him in office. He will fix our Gov. $<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea9711 @tsteele93 Trump companies income each year is at least 650 million. His asset/debt ratio is good. Ur not in his league.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@diana_west_ @gatewaypundit Yes. Could be. I hope. And, if Comey would of stepped down (as did another FBI higher up) doesn't help justice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ @nypost PRN have a nightly server backup?Backup system? Of course they do and would have emails on it.No warrants but immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ @nypost Great articles. True that agents first notified Comey late week as said?Discussed w Lynch (Lynch w Obama) in &lt;2 days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@true_pundit @Thomas1774Paine Did FBI reopen case because articles like this came out on 25th. Very damaging article. Shows coverup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comey reopened case after this published. #HillarysEmails  Hillary's 33,000 emails might not be missing  https://t.co/ozT80dJGcq via @nypost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kausmickey In the meantime we need to investigate $ from HC via McAuliffe PAC to McCabe. Obama lying. Immunity w no warrants?Kabuki show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico @HillaryClinton Hillary failed to answer if she had asked Huma what's up. Lol. They know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico @HillaryClinton Of course they cannot release investigation info. Huma must have a press conf.&amp; let us know what's on her device.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakedalaska @MichaelCohen212 @LAPDHollywood  Could you facilitate this LAPD? 1000s are tweeting about this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RWayneReid @JonahNRO @NolteNC @BuffaloBlueBear Silly to think they believe in a fair Primary of the People. We can still call 'em on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HopkinsTN @MadaGasp @jamesspivey @JonahNRO @NolteNC @BuffaloBlueBear Ventura was the Reform party candidate. So what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWayneReid @JonahNRO @NolteNC @BuffaloBlueBear I thought Jonah contributed $ to the GOP. He is similar to Trump if he contributes to both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FBIReopensCase    Pic via @LarrySchweikart    https://t.co/mGgbGbUuKD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NolteNC @BuffaloBlueBear @JonahNRO And, Trump is the person that won your party ticket fair and square. Primary has to mean something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO U think a Trump loss allows u to say say I told you so. Won't work. Our fight goes on despite Nov9 result. Believe Me. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO You're trying to help Evan get a state. Evan's not on most ballots and VP is wrong. This is who you're touting. It's a jerk move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Comey did not specifically say Weiner. Maybe it was the Clinton Foundation probe? 'Another case'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii And, if said phone has classified docs on it somebody (Hillary) is responsible &amp; do not need 'intent' per the law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frankthorp @gatewaypundit Of course because Rs control congress but she said it to deceive the people &amp; look like conspiracy. She's a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kausmickey @JohnKStahlUSA Maybe Weiner gets immunity because of info he turned over to FBI implicating Hillary &amp; Huma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald Does Huma have access to classified information? Hillary is responsible. New probe goes much further than Weiner device.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_Gonzilla @AmericanSoWoke Joe, Did you see this? I'm sure several are wanting to help her.  https://t.co/EihsyCzjPy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianbeutler Yikes. FBI is investigating her again. Huma in big trouble. So is Hillary. #HillarysEmails on Weiner's sext phone. Scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Is that how Glenn Beck &amp; Jonah Goldberg see it too? Elite Rep. Pundits see it same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPBarryBennett @adamgoldmanNYT Comey had them. Didn't they check Huma's phone on 1st round? She did get immunity. FBI never checked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegoldfarb @JonahNRO Per Brit's show Jonah doesn't want to dismantle the elite GOP or his power in jeopardy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Comey is worried a President Trump will go after him for a coverup.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GatewayEcon @LS814 Yes corrupt. But, the banks should own their debt they issued. They got the return on backed investments. #corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GatewayEcon @LS814 Exactly. That is what Trump wants. Renegotiate. Disingenuous to say Trump doesn't want to back allies. It's a condition.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jlangdale @FBI the docs are either classified and not marked or treated as such it contain coverup info. Why else wouldn't release?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShanaLin4 @ByronYork Problem is they will take their sweet time. Sounds like they don't even have the 302s done. Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShanaLin4 @ByronYork ok. Then obviously that is why they won't release rest of docs that are probably classified or contain coverup info.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShanaLin4 @ByronYork Yes! Must be the reason. Aren't ongoing investigations public info though?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbent2199 @redsteeze Trump did not back out. Cruz did. Trump's pledge included a back out. Cruz's did not. Cruz back out based on personal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbent2199 @redsteeze that's fine if Cruz stands up for his wife. Don't get how that has to do with Cruz's smarm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbent2199 @redsteeze Cruz was giving a fantastic speech. Could of simply said 'vote against Hillary'. Sad, he would of been a good advisor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbent2199 @redsteeze Trump stood up for his wife's honor when Pics sent out of Melania. That happened first. Father "Anointed King". Odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbent2199 @redsteeze The RNC were plotting behind his back &amp; Romney/Kristol started suggesting a 3rd party. Voters were betrayed. #caveat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze if you remember Trump was the only one to add the caveat 'if treated fairly' when taking the pledge. Others a clear 'yes'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @PatrickRuffini Are you kidding me? That suggestion is pathetic. If invited somewhere you don't pull a fast-one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @PatrickRuffini Cruz did not need to endorse Trump. But his suggestion to vote other than the party is disgusting and a #traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery He had a fabulous speech going. Loved it. Then he pulls a stunt at the very end. Even taunted NY delegates at very end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze No. I truly think Trump would of honored his word if there was no funny business.You don't get to where he did without character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @lisakauai @tedcruz The whole reason the pledge took place was to trap Trump. Funny..it ended up showing politician's character.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @KFaulders The big win is Cruz gave his word to support the GOP nominee and apparently he is standing by his word. #honor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @BreitbartNews And, it will go the same way any other Clinton investigation goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaredWyand I want to see Orlando info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery And, Hillary gave classified information to non-cleared people. Comey admitted to this today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatewaypundit Comey gets around it by saying it is criminal to lie to FBI. Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @HillaryClinton neither did the IT guy that plead the 5th and all the subsequent IT people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Chaffetz just now said it best. Got the most out of Comey.Trey just made statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @FBI they were the ones that determined personal versus official<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @FBI and the IT guy. Can't use attorney client privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @FBI this is why Petraeus got in trouble. Hillary gave to attorneys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Did Huma or other employees discuss w Clinton the server is a problem? Comey didn't answer when this was raised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snowden @man_of_renown @ReutersPolitics  'Sophisticated' enough illustrated here  https://t.co/hXbRX3bVcA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Looks like she is 'sophisticated' enough with her words in this email.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Can somebody directly ask about this? How does Comey explain this and say she was not aware?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @jpodhoretz Supposedly there is a 302 document summarizing. Great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkHalperin @ChuckNilosek @SHO_Billions @briankoppelman @Showtime @SHO_PR Why the hell r u sitting upfront. For a TV show? U r a circus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerringLiz @redsteeze Well it was the 4th of July holiday weekend and a Saturday.  All official business is done best on those days! Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav it was a sham interview. Who conducts serious business on a Saturday of a Holiday weekend.  And, Hillary goes to theater after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze Why was Comey not present himself? And, then he did not meet with all 5? Was able to finalize 1 business day later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav @redsteeze more important no oath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav apparently she did not need to take an oath before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesseKellyDC Sure. The attorneys went ahead without her knowledge &amp; wiped her server clean. &amp; the IT setup guy that wiped his clean.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter Again, U nailed it. 'Racist' is being used for differing opinions. Judge is the 'racist'. Does Trump belong to race groups? NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter I was called a racist on Twitter yesterday for the first time in my life.  I guess Trump and all his supporters are racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpollak And the 'judicial independence' is of question due to the judge belonging to race organizations that boycott Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Either stop talking about this or give equal time to Hillary's indictment coming down. Trump's case is not government business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Judge was not acting honorable. Should of recused himself. Trump not happy about it. That's business.   https://t.co/IM9kc4w55j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Sure. And, in an alternate world the judge would of recused himself long ago stating he is a member of a group boycotting Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mviser It's telling that the MSM keeps asking about it. How about Hillary's indictment or another Mitt story?<|endoftext|>
