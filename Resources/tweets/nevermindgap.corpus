<|startoftext|>@rtenews Well there’s a surprise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie My point is that if the US, EU and Canada set a price for purchase.. like the unit cost is x plus 5 cent profit per Vaccine. That’s 50 million in profit for the drug companies. Would that be enough? How does that not make sense for u. The EU US and Canada have the purchase power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Oh god. Think it’s time to say good bye. Have a good evening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Good for u... well when I mean say the state clearly that includes the EU ( a group for states working together)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyholohans @garymurphy1919 @TerryMcElvaney @rtenews I work in the heath service and defiantly would not be putting my face and last name up. Most people with real jobs can’t do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garymurphy1919 @tonyholohans @TerryMcElvaney @rtenews Lol not that hard when there is two spellings for the same name... but sure look if that’s where u are at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie No that’s not my point at all. Let’s hope u don’t run a business which your logic and verbal reasoning. What I’m saying is the state should be making sure the get the lowest price possible and a fair price. Pure and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garymurphy1919 @tonyholohans @TerryMcElvaney @rtenews So what the definition of a fake account Garry? Just for interest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garymurphy1919 @tonyholohans @TerryMcElvaney @rtenews But this is the definition of a bot.. ‘An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet.’. Clearly if he can have a convo he’s not a bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garymurphy1919 @tonyholohans @TerryMcElvaney @rtenews Who’s the bot now? There seems to be a problem on twitter. When someone has a different point of view they are a ‘bot’. If people have less than 10 followers they are a ‘bot’.... no just they have a different point of view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Yeah I actually still don’t know what you’re point is... apart with coming back with your so wrong... you can’t change. What do u even think my opinion is? Seems u can’t see the wood from the trees, a one trip pony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Yes of course. The state should always be trying to reduce to profits made from third parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Not the Irish gov - sure we are a irrelevant small island. The EU and US could have sent the price lower, the EU is paying less than the US, which is good. However 9 billion was given to the companies for R and D. Where does that payment fit it? Is it an investment?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Again Adrian. Perhaps read what im saying. We gave them money which I agree with to make the vaccine. We indemnified them, agree with that. But now we have it, it’s not for them to make billions. Maybe a few million would be enough, considering it was tax payer money that was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryMcElvaney @rtenews No I’m not saying I know more than him. Im saying the ECDC who is made up of the top experts in Europe do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WSJ Everyone has a mba now... all the idiots I know in work went and got one. You can’t teach common sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianS55283694 @LiamTwomey9999 @Independent_ie Where is the contradiction? Simply saying they didn’t take a huge amount of risk. Please explain the contradiction????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews I don’t think we can take much more of this... can they just negotiate and maybe the press might just not report on it until they say yes or no. This constant rubbish speculation is killing us!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews So sick of this man. He’s either concerned or very concerned depending on the day. The EU says travel is safe.. he says he doesn’t agree... like wtf... a small small man on a small island of course knows better.... look haven’t we done so well on our own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamTwomey9999 @AdrianS55283694 @Independent_ie No Liam maybe just read. I never did that they shouldn’t have bankrolled them or indemnified them... but let’s not say they took huge risk and now deserve to make billions while we all pay for it in tax. Maybe u don’t see the big picture. Nothing is free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Actually gross. They took now risks, governments ie the tax payers poorer hundreds of millions in funding for these companies, they are also indemnified.... no risk whatsoever. Amazing an editor put this crap in print<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrisonjaime TRUE STORY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden Sad thing is that many will vote her in for this reason alone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryLouMcDonald I’m for SF in the next election. FG really letting the ball down, the whole county is in shite. @MaryLouMcDonald and @PearseDoherty what will u do about people who don’t work having more disposable income than those on min wage. There is allot of problems in our society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skankycabbage @irishexaminer @ciananbrennan And for the covid vaccine - emergency payment of 1 euro per vaccines to GP’s and pharmacists. They can’t be getting rich from covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skankycabbage @irishexaminer @ciananbrennan Yeah it’s a complete disgrace. But don’t worry the nurse in the GP is not getting the 15 euro per vaccine, he/ she is getting 15 an hour (below a hospital nurse mostly). The only people giving vaccines should be HSE employed nurses - for all vaccines. Save the state a fortune<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump One thing good by Donal trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victori39328075 It will be as long as we accept the status quo. Consultants need to be taken to task, scanners lying idle past 6:30pm and weekend except for emergency’s. Tasks being taken away from nurses and given to doctors and pharmacists that cost extra.... a big shake up required!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EU_Commission Maybe stop taking in meet and wood from brazil. Might have some effect<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Sure isn’t always, and it’s not because of covid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewYorker Need to tax the shit out of these online retailers. Really fucking the jobs of many and also killing towns and city’s across countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Don’t think that’s true...  https://t.co/IvrsrSKLra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer @ciananbrennan Louise - can u look at pharmacists getting 15 euro per vaccine given please. A nurse top of scale gets 22 euro an hours and can give one vaccine every 5min. That would be 180 euro to the pharmacy. Absolutely disgraceful. At most they should get 2 euro a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lefty7062 What were your symptoms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Great so all the off peak times will become busy. That makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes And how much will they get paid? 15 euro per vaccine? A new nurses gets 15 euro an hour. Let them give it - guess how many vaccines they will get in a hour?  https://t.co/Pd0vdzm4Zg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Two points, first one would hope nurses GP’s and pharmacists would give the vaccines. Second - the whole bring retired people back.... look how well they did that with the call for Ireland.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TZeliznak @CNN And this guy actually didn’t kill anyone, he was just with the wrong people at the wrong time. Imagine u were killed because of a bad judgement call when u were a teenager<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TZeliznak @CNN Nobody deserves to die. Even if they killed someone... life in prison is a sever punishment. It’s barbaric to kill people, not one European country does it as they are civilised.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MenAreLikeWine_ @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC No there is allot of blame for the church, that’s like saying don’t blame the rapist, look at the victim. But I agree the Irish should look at how they let a organisation get into the governing of the country and control peoples lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MenAreLikeWine_ @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC Quite possibly true. I wouldn’t not come to Ireland because of it. Not all Irish ate catholic, and judging by the numbers in church, many have deserted it due to the exact reason u mention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @_IHREC Change the wording from housing to accommodation and then u get what apparently u mean. A right to housing means just that... that everyone gets a house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Do t find it offensive. It’s reality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC And I see from your Twitter your a trump supporter... which adds to it all.

<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC There u go. U say I should be ashamed for helping others and not going to church... where u seem to by loyal no matter what, that’s exactly why I don’t go any more. People like u, sitting up the front in your nice clothes while not actually listening to the message<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC They should be, helping others and living a Christian life doesn’t go hard in hand with colluding with rapists, pedophiles, tax avoiders and the rest......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC No it’s completely not a case of can’t be arsed. Was a every Sunday guy, replaced listening to stuff with actually doing stuff. No spend my time doing helping the needy on Sunday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC But what is really simple is not propping up an organisation built on lies, self interest and deceit. There is a difference between a government and a organisation that u can leave without any real consequence. Perhaps the consequence is a better conscience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC Your taking a ridiculous stance. Your going on about moving country, leaving jobs etc which is not simple, but your wrong, every vote counts, look at a recent election where 12 votes decided the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wolfiewire @AnthonyICHH Yes and unfortunately people bought the idea that have a safe place to live with medial and social staff is a bad thing.   No services for people anymore and we are further being pushed down the ‘help people inject’ pathway which will further complicate matters in years to come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC For the state, I vote where I believe change can happen. That’s within my control and I don’t have a choice to participate living in the state or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apclxx Quite sad. It’s really a barbaric act killing someone, says allot about society that they believe killing people serves some sort of justice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthonyICHH @wolfiewire No unfortunately not. Many homeless have complex social, mental and drug issues that just can’t be fixed, only supported.

<|startoftext|>@Ka20Ce @DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC Buy remaining in a organisation and participating in that organisation you support the morals and principles of it. Not going to sit and listen to people telling me about good and giving them money... where are the lessons learned and what have the done to repent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimesPol Just like the bucket of water he threw over the payment for the student nurses who were used as slave labour<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReverendWarnock Anyone in Georgia who earns less than $15 and votes republican can only be classed as an idiot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD I actually don’t agree on any further increase for people already in the higher tax bracket unless earning over 200k. I think the lower earners pay more, and deal with the wastage and reduce benefits for non workers while increasing benefits for tax payers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JP_Biz More than likley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @ionainstitute @declanganley @stevenconlon @MichaelKellyIC Not sure why? Don’t go to mass anymore because I don’t support the catholic cover up of sexual abuse and abuse of other vulnerable people. But getting sick of a ban on Christian values, but yet everyone else gets a voice.... just plain wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Yeah it’s complete madness. I’m also working as a contract reg. mad money via a external company. I see about 40 percent of it. I would have worked direct but they have stupid hiring rules etc. Such waste!! Anyway I think we are on the same lines... pay tax but get services!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walls2 @DonnellyStephen why would someone who is terminally ill want a medical card? Especially someone who has worked and paid tax. why on earth would u expect to get healthcare? Sounds like madness to me.   btw are ppl on the dole getting a Christmas bonus to buy shit and booze for Christmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Yep it’s available in FR. I work in heathcare, ire is horrific compared to France. It’s literally like Ireland compared to perhaps Sierra Leone.

<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Sad to hear that and rightly so she should get that. Find it hard to believe u would not get it into France. What’s it called? Same in France, they don’t send a taxi, they have a hospital bus. More economic and environmentally friendly. But she had a disease covered. Many don’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Yeah the 25 percent that don’t pay any tax get free gp care, the rest had to wait until over 67 after paying tax their whole life. The point is the people who pay don’t get anything, that is a disgusting system. Why I’m moving back to France. Invest in a system that invests in u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Really need to overhaul the benefit system. To many clinging on. Like people paid to be a ‘career’ for their on family. Single mother non working earning more and having more disposable income than a single worker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Everyone should pay tax at a minimum 10 percent. Need to increase income tax like u said and get rid of the usc, car tax etc. Agree with increasing tax on petrol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Well again I disagree. It’s only a select few incomes that are not in line. Teachers far overpaid compared to EU, judges (despite getting a raise today) are overpaid and doctors along with many civil servants and politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD Don’t have to pay extra in hospital (no bed payment like here) if u loose your job u get 75 percent of your pay for two years..... your tax actually means something unlike Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD I lived in France (was always warned it was a high tax country). Tax was high, but not as high as here if your a high earner (or not so high - just over 38k). No car tax, no tv tax. But I actually didn’t mind paying as I got services for the money taken. Free GP care, free meds,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD that’s a misnomer. I get 50 percent of my pay each month. I then pay pax for my tv, my car, petrol and house. Never mind all the tax on food etc. We are actually one of the most taxed in the OECD, just not everyone in Ireland pays tax. It’s the most unfair society in the EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FineGael @LeoVaradkar Yeah it was a big problem for the last 20 years. What about your insurance promises 5 years ago? I think u appointed a minister to review/ reform. What did they do? Clearly sweet FA!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McConnellDaniel @fiannafailparty @malcolmbyrne Clearly it doesn’t look good. Time of SF to get into power. Never voted for them before but will next time. Sure they can’t do any worse that what we have. They are just morally disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cros13 @RichardbrutonTD went with base salary. Can u find the total paid including expenses, political party payments etc... also u look at income tax - usc, prsi and all the other tax we pay goes where.... and don’t say to pay for services. Tax payers get nothing! Even pay for call a fire engine:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damien_English @StudentEntProg @DervalORourke Maybe call student nurses and pay them!!!! U have messed with their educational placement by making them work as nurse assistants due to staff shortages. Pay them!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill How’s guli doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelTel Yet they are paid like shit and abused by people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t believe that they should be paid in general times and normally they are shadowing a nurse and learning. Now they are used as nurse assistants as there is not enough staff due to covid. Pay them now as they are staff not students!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Allycon3 Yeah it is. U have no idea what your talking about. Maybe leave the musical stuff for the medical person in the photo. I’m sure she knows her job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boglawyer Where was the covid protocol. Seems YFG don’t care about gov policy either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allycon3 Because u don’t wear gloves giving vaccines. So ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar u just voted to increase the pay of judges who are already overpaid. This is during a time many are living on 350 a week and we are increasing our deficit, never mind the student nurses being exploited. Always vote FG, this is the last straw. Will give SF a try @sinnfeinireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMcEntee @SAFEIreland @irewomeninharm @TeachTearmainn Helen u just agreed to raise the pay of judges in Ireland who are already overpaid while student nurses are being exploited and many have lost their jobs due to government covid policy. U just lost my vote, always voted FG but this is the last straw. Goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar are u actually serious! What a disgrace, the most well paid people in society getting a raise when the country is in debt and student nurses are being exploited!!! This is a scandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevDoyle_Indo Seriously??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Goodbye brexit deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzieDee Azie unfortunately twitter has brought all the loons together....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump It’s over. Go home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WineLoverSF @Yahoo Yeah same. Maybe great Americans lost their lives this year, either from cancer like Natalie or covid etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INGAZ_ZAGNI @rtenews Yeah but u can’t plan to use a airport car park to help Dublin port with trucks. That’s not viable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes I wonder will they salt the roads unlike this morning. Imagine black ice on a motorway  (M3 with multiple crashes). Constant ‘warnings’ about fog from met and Irish media but the council can’t manage to do their jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetimes Between this and earlier in the year bleaching the beach to prevent covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill This man is becoming an all American hero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonwillchambers Give us a break<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Luckily she had a brain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WineLoverSF @Yahoo Extremely sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INGAZ_ZAGNI @rtenews Wouldn’t think so. More that u won’t be able to get a space. Ppl mad to get a holiday. Once the elderly and at risk groups vaccinated, which will happen before April/ may travel will be a go and the masses will go to the sun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Doesn’t sound like she answered that question anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INGAZ_ZAGNI @rtenews Yeah that way the cars can park on the M50, that would make sense also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Ah yeah how does he know that then? They on the red phone to him for his opinion? Or did he read the NYT’s like the rest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gardainfo Where is the community guards turning on the Christmas lights in Ballymun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes U think they would at least put a mask on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EUCouncil Solidarity yeah right!! How come unions don’t have the right to cooperate across the block to protect workers rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that anybody seems to care. But yes journalism is important  https://t.co/NL2En2vocg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheannabana @WandaSpeaks67 @notcapnamerica And it’s pretty pathetic to block someone and then still comment on the thread. What’s that all about? And why block someone because u look like a idiot and make no sense?  https://t.co/IwZf2FOF8B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheannabana @WandaSpeaks67 @notcapnamerica will reply here. Since u blocked me and then commented so I can’t see what u said and can’t comment back. Yeah it makes sense. U said I don’t listen to black people but I’m black. I asked u what your solution is but u don’t seem to have one. I think we need to sort out poverty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill He speaks like he has not been leading the ‘third world country’ for the last 4 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews Of course. What did we do to prepare? Nothing!!! France... extensive new car/ truck parks.... the UK.. the same. Ireland, we will talk about it and eventually do nothing but manage to pay loads of consultants and managers for input<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie The only Irish media person actually questioning and not just being a puppet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheannabana @WandaSpeaks67 @notcapnamerica Im a black man. Was just interested in you telling me..... since u decided I don’t know anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar  https://t.co/ywHZgmXXJY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJAMcBride Tax needs to be applied to online products and rate decreases for small business on the high street with removal of paid parking on the streets. Simple solution. Act!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheannabana @WandaSpeaks67 @notcapnamerica So go on what do u need? Yeah it’s not in my head, it’s a statistical reality. From the census black people are the most venerable to poverty.  ‘22.5% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),[78] 44.0% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),[79] ‘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenningsLizanne @mommamia1217 @joncoopertweets Extremely sad. Sorry to hear that. Wake up call of all those not wearing a mask etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Husker06270135 @BenHilton28 @realDonaldTrump Is that a serious question?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @aronahr @seminole_357 @_mishamish Yeah thought so to. Let’s call it a day, I think we agreed somewhere in the end. Have a good evening, nice chatting with u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @aronahr @seminole_357 @_mishamish Was this for me to reply?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Debmeto @1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 See we don’t have all the info, yet everyone jumping to conclusions. This needs a panorama report.... Twitter is just not the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CursedLavaLamp Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtzJackson @CursedLavaLamp People better get out and vote. This one will be down to the wire and already leaning to GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP This is actually hilarious 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardbrutonTD Can’t afford one Richard? Maybe if TD’s were earning less then we could pay less tax and actually benefit from working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CursedLavaLamp Kinda funny that Perdue means LOST in French<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@challam19 Did the nhs not get more money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets As much as I despise his politics and agenda.... I wouldn’t wish covid on anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ossoff #butonlyifwevote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @Annette96316049 @LeahButlerSmith @GovtdontlieNOT maybe they should put u training the people at the FDA and the MHRA as well. Seem u know everything. And thanks I did ACLS, just saying what we all think, the instructor draw a certain type or person, the same as the manual handling guy, but I bet u loved that course as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @Annette96316049 @LeahButlerSmith @GovtdontlieNOT You’re a anti covid vaccine. Makes sense considering everything about u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @Annette96316049 @LeahButlerSmith @GovtdontlieNOT Lol I’m glad u spent however long looking for that. Looks like I landed myself in a thread with allot of mad people and ‘advanced life support instructors’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes No shit. Can I get 300k to say stuff like this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill That girl wouldn’t know what socialism was even if she lived in China or Cuba for years. Yes she is saying Biden is going to make America like China. Come on... have a Brain and grow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill I guess we will soon find out. Not long until the end of the year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith Yeah but then who would have cared for them. Don’t think u would have the staff required for that. But in a Ideal would that would have been the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith Most likely. But what do u do? Open the doors and risk them all dying for the sake of a few weeks when they can take a vaccine ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith Possibly was. could also be sick of her? If she’s like that all the time? the banging on the glass, it’s a care home. She must have upset allot of older and confused ppl. She’s the lady who was arrested for taking her mum earlier in the year. That time the police were at fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith I worked in a home a long time ago as a student. There was one or two people out of 80 who had regular relatives. The rest wouldn’t see anyone from one year to the next. Maybe times have changed and relatives are seen regularly, they must with all the sudden concern for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith No look question away. Just we don’t know the full story. Maybe the nurse was there for 15 min and wanted to get the woman back to bed, and was tired of saying the same thing over and over..?... or maybe the nurse is completely int he wrong and the woman is being abused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 No I haven’t said I don’t see anything wrong with the nurses behaviour. I said we just don’t know the full story. Pure and simple. You went on the attack. I would just like to see all the info before shaming her and passing judgement. Glad u weren’t a judge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT @LeahButlerSmith I would have taken her home first. But in their case, I wouldn’t have argued and banged on the glass. I would have phoned 911<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 What’s so shocking? That I said we should see the whole video before passing judgement??!! What it’s terrible to have all the facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 So what are u qualified in? A nurse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Yeah agree!! At last but pin management is a fundamental part of end of life care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 U show doctors how to intubation and teach us what drugs to use? Sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Ha I’m not going to send my hospital protocols via twitter. Clearly my understanding is the same as yours, we just have different names for the policy’s. U have care pathways.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @1Mirror1978 @ninnyd101 Yeah it’s called pain management<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @1Mirror1978 @ninnyd101 Now wait for the caring racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Ha I think u are the stupid one. Again the mind of a ‘advanced cpr instructor’... maybe I don’t live in Scotland where clearly they have care pathways... were in from it’s DNR 1 and 2... guess some country’s might be different... imagine that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 No I have u down. Your not a nurse or a doctor but trying so hard. We all know your type, ‘the advance cpr’ all the same attributes as the manual handling instructor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @1Mirror1978 @ninnyd101 Look at the lady, she most likely is advanced dementia. U could have a DNR 1 - all intervention except intubation and CPR, or u could have a DNR 2 - which is as above but extra ... no antibiotics or intervention and only pain management<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Lol your the worst then, the ‘advanced life instructor’ that does a 6 weeks course and knows everything about nothing. A little Knowledge is a dangerous thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Yes agreed. Maybe she did say that? Like one min before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 DNR can mean exactly that. There are several different levels, it’s just clear there are loads of keyboard warriors who have no clue about what’s going on. All I’m saying is we don’t know the full story. Maybe the nurse is completely in the wrong. We won’t know with 1min video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @SetHarthLives @ninnyd101 Yeah that’s where u are naive. When abuse happens there is an outcry. It’s not as simple as having a free for all. What if she brought covid in and killed them all. Maybe the other relatives wouldn’t be so happy???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Yeah but u don’t know what her situation is. Maybe she had covid and is recovering, maybe she looks better than she did yesterday. Maybe she has a DNR??? All the shit we don’t know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @1Mirror1978 @ninnyd101 Yeah we agree on one thing. Call the ambulance. Don’t bang on glass of a home for the elderly. Completely disrespectful. Nobody seems to care about that??? And for the nurse, maybe right or wrong, Can’t tell without the full video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Yeah better bring covid in and kill them all. That’s the best option. Or wait..... covid is fake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 If your a nurse u would know that perhaps this lady is a difficult customer. Already tried to take her mum out, seems someone decided it wasn’t in her mums best interest since she is still there.   And we didn’t see the full video. Can we see it from the very start. May help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @SetHarthLives @ninnyd101 Over the top. If she was that concerned, take a deep breath, don’t bang the glass and upset the confused people. Just phone a ambulance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @SetHarthLives @ninnyd101 Yep but normally it can be competed within a week. It’s a double sword, they are in place for a reason. Equally if someone was taken home and thrown in a bed and left there in their own crap we would also have the outcry. Just seems no it’s all drama, people are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 People. I’m sure that was great for their nerves and would not have upset them at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Mirror1978 @mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Well not really.. u serious or just naive. How long was the nurse standing there on the phone? How long should she continue that convo? Maybe her mum always looks like that. Maybe she had covid? What about yer woman banding on the glass of the home or elderly and confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouBetterSmile1 @ninnyd101 Glad I could help. Hope it’s gives u some perspective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouldyscone @ninnyd101 Looks like she’s on a bit of a political mission. Hard to make a judgement when we don’t know all the facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouBetterSmile1 @ninnyd101 Maybe she cares for him more then u? Or perhaps u want to give him a virus to end his days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahButlerSmith @GovtdontlieNOT With respect she is attacking the people who wash, clean and feed her mum. If she’s that concerned take her home and care for her yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Just common sense really. How stupid are they......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandraWeeden @GovtdontlieNOT What’s sad is that’s some working personals car on fire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@belfastsinnfein @MaryLouMcDonald If u are serious about it, bring everyone along. All religions and creeds, it must be a United Ireland for everyone, it makes sense. We would be stronger in the EU together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelTel They can just see the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WandaSpeaks67 @notcapnamerica What is in your best interest? In my head I have poverty is the main driver, need to focus on education and employment pathways?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Amazing to see when most companies like @CityJet are stamping on their workers rights. Cabin crew made redundant in July,  hired back on zero hour contracts and daily rate. Some only working two days a month!! @labour @forsa_union_ie nowhere to be seen! @RBoydBarrett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaFeid @GovtdontlieNOT And I bet they won’t hire them back on their normal terms and conditions and pay point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrRobbieOCall History is just repeating itself sadly and we are all but spectators<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Funny to watch back now while Boris is scrambling for a deal which will be shit anyway compared to what the UK had access to and lost by their own will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers Yeah u don’t need a warning, just need to open the front door. What don’t u warn people to be careful while walking? Seen some ice on the footpath earlier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jollz @itsRSAYMA How disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Heard your man was horrid to work for, always shouting and putting people down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryReintke Strange, would have never have said that about your English or anyone who speaks English as a second language for that manner...  I am a native English speaker and I am always delighted to hear u speak, as it comes from your heart and is passionate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_croxford That’s not good at all. It’s good to have opposing views, people with different opinions etc. If not u just see people who reinforce your opinion/ values.... which is not great if you want to expand your mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harte_t @AerLingus But let’s be honest, u will get your voucher. Just give it a while. It’s not like we can go anywhere. @AerLingus why don’t u help her out and let her know where she is in the Q......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glic16 There are 75 empty beds this evening in shelters. Get the word out if u know someone who is on the street<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeRob66 Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harte_t @AerLingus I am actually waiting for one. Might be a shock to you but I bet many businesses didn’t have hundreds of Oompa Loompas just hanging around waiting for a pandemic to process a once in a lifetime refund and voucher requirement. Give them a break, they are on their knees!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Badbarbieminaj1 @DavidakaBink @BangtanLena @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish Yeah maybe: re define that. Many white AMERICANS were racist in the 18th and 19th century and there still remains widespread racism in the UNITED STATES. Although not all white people are racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcerquone @thehill Such rubbish. Respectful to other religions. Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus, respect Christians and respect their day. Just as much as u should respect Eid al adha and other religions days. It’s actually disrespectful not saying happy Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidakaBink @Badbarbieminaj1 @BangtanLena @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish I disagree. Your talking about institutional racism, which is alive and well. However you can be racist, walk past someone in the street and make them feel small and inferior bcs of their skin, that’s still racism and can have just as bad an effect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DC0670 @DWUhlfelderLaw Yeah I just have the term ‘staffer’. I find it demeaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuckGeorgia The black children are mine u silly girl!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuckGeorgia Where have u got from at all? Your so far up your own ..... u can’t even see what is in front of u. That’s what’s wrong with the present. So far in your idea of life u can’t see what ms in front of your face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuckGeorgia No worries. Your entirely welcome, btw I love this new ‘privileged’ angle. What do u define privilege as?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuckGeorgia @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish Georgia I think your deluded. The UK is not in the EU anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YuckGeorgia @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish Well maybe u are stupid making a decision based on not facts what so ever. Why would u assume that there is widespread racism everywhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish Well one thing is for sure, the law and the system is a mess in America. From private prisons to how police ie the sherif is ‘elected’. Multi different law enforcement,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish That’s I might give it a read. But surely we can agree that things need to change....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Badbarbieminaj1 @BangtanLena @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish Racism is a idea. An idea that someone should be treated differently because of the colour of their skin. By saying ‘white people’ your kinda being racist. Black people jn Rwanda were racist against the Tutsi minority. Racism is not just black v white. It’s complicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish Man in to represent. One black and one white, with a black woman casting the deciding vote in the senate. Change needs to happen! Let’s hope it happens fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish John read some of the comments in this thread. There is allot of hatred on both sides. I can understand the anger of black Americans, but let’s be honest, u can’t say there are only non racist black people. Anyway the way to change is to vote, let’s hope Georgia will put a black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apiggy1990 @OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish Yeah it’s a disgrace. It more all the comments about slavery etc.....there is a election coming up. Hopefully people in Georgia will vote the right way, and the deciding vote in the senate will be a black woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews What a load of rubbish. They can’t apologise for him. He said what he said, he believed in his convictions. He never apologised, he didn’t feel he needed to. He is dead and his legacy is what he did. U can’t erase it or apologise for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw What’s a staffer? Like have we lost all words. Nurses? Admin staff? Nurse assistants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OptimistMela704 @seminole_357 @_mishamish Well nice to see some level head, far to much hatred on both sides, that will never solve anything. The past is cruel and horrid, stop looking at it and focus on the present and future. This constant injustice needs to stop!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BangtanLena @x_nicoleeeeee21 @Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish How racist is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lesbian_Moses @_mishamish There is something extremely sick with America at the moment. It seems many have forsaken all Christian values. This photo makes me sick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill Start with #Perdue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineAY Funny. This has more retweets and likes than a post I saw earlier about hundreds starving in a worn torn county. Just goes to show.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @Perdue said u lost!!! He wasn’t to negotiate with Biden in the senate. It’s time to give up and accept defeat. Even the person your going to rally for said u lost!!!  https://t.co/DVrRtwJK2O<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patrickdextervc @wolfiewire What’s it called?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie It’s fog ffs!!! Why are u warning people about fog??! Just say the weather will be foggy, without all this warning and alert crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews That’s nothing to be ‘alert’ about. It’s fog for ffs!!! This is getting ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Looks like Leo was doing his job - telling the GP’s they need to stop being selfish and offer more flexibility to the tax payer and do what’s right for patients. The problem here is the GP’s are fucking the state over. Should be free GP care and a GP paid at 60k is a good salary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Lol your calling it a a victory rally??? Like wtf? #Delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did u not hear? Perdue said u lost and he’s looking at negotiating with Biden? Lol and your going to help him. Your such a joke!!  https://t.co/DVrRtwJK2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Did u not hear #Perdue has said u lost and he wants to negotiate with @JoeBiden    https://t.co/DVrRtwJK2O<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Tragic - but all knew the risks of getting into a car after drinking heavily, speeding and two now wearing seatbelts. Just lucky they didn’t meet someone else on the roads and cause more damage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReginaDo Great idea. Actually will vote SF just for this. It’s a complete sham that we pay tv license (just another tax) to prop up people earning 100’s of thousands to read the news?? Like wtf??! #defundrte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer At a later date. What was the 4.5 million for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Extremely sad for the little girl. However just what’s wrong with the courts. Mum and dad in rented car, baby on belted in while driving. Now mum and dad get 4.5 million for failure to strap in child getting money of insurance from rental car company. More money for child’s needs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidDog111 @Reuters Sorry... but u need to just leave. U live in a country full of people loving the nationalistic uk politics. Come back to the EU when ready to be fully involved, inc the EURO. Can’t have one foot in and one out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters That’s a good! We are bending over to much!!! Let them break free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SomeDad @mannequin4hire @thejournal_ie Yeah that’s true because they are paid crap here. They get the going rate in aussi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FCTwenteBenson No I think that’s to simple of a statement. Im sure it was a bad batch of drugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie I think you need to be clear. They are working as nurse assistants rather than being student nurses. Student nurses shadow a nurse to learn new skills. These are currently making beds and doing nurse assistant jobs as there are no staff. They should actually all just go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie It will only be remembered for the abuse that happened it staff when once again our crap employment law let them down. Did she ever go to prison in the end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk Student nurses normally shadow a nurse to learn skills. At this point they are being used to do work of nurse assistants and to make beds as no other staff available. That’s not being a student nurse, it’s being a nurse assistant. They need to be paid for their work during C19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scottbails13 @guardian Yeah totally get that. Struggling with it and the best outcome is putting it in a news paper.

<|startoftext|>@guardian Shouldn’t matter, shouldn’t even make the news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanpwr @thejournal_ie Yeah but rather than just saying 53 they use words to make it more then is it. Why not say close to 50 percent?? Because it doesn’t suit the narrative for the people who don’t read the story<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnBre11293409 @lawless_belinda @thejournal_ie Yes we need the right of union recognition. In Ireland we don’t have that unlike most EU countries. We can join a union but the employer never needs to talk to them or even recognise them. Look at Ryanair etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawless_belinda @thejournal_ie The majority can. If they are they hard up they shouldn’t be trading.

<|startoftext|>@lawless_belinda @thejournal_ie Once again. don’t put one group of low paid against another. They all deserve better protection. Sick pay as a right, redundancy at more than 1200 per year of service. Like the #debenhams ,redundancy money guaranteed. Hours stipulated in contracts, the right of union recognition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Is she for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawless_belinda @thejournal_ie Yeah that doesn’t make it right. All employees need protecting. Need to improve the employment legislation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vintageshimano @SkyNews Yeah actually check out the last part of the video where u can see how the car is over the central line and the large amount of road between his car and side of road.

<|startoftext|>@wolfiewire However they did prevent allot of what we see today. If we could put new homes in place with social workers, mental heath experts, nurses and with robust check and balance to bring misuse/ abuse to a min. Will never get it to zero, but as close to as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wolfiewire Yeah I think u missed my point. We don’t have any of these things. We urgently need state run homes (HSE)to cater for people who will never cope independently in modern day society. These people went into church run homes which were abysmal, with no checks and balances.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@john_mcguirk #DefundRTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wolfiewire always extremely sad. However it’s never as simple as giving people a house. Allot of homeless people have drug and alcohol problem and/ or other social/ mental health issues. The problem is we no longer have any live in services. The church did play a role, despite the abuse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williamlegate This is a great idea!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Is that not racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews Firstly I agree this requires dealing with and a prison sentence is warranted.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews. No he’s changed his mind again. What a moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 Yep but it’s up to the people to vote differently. Apparently allot of people like the way they conduct business. It’s time for a party to emerge with new ideas and ideals. SF are just as bad, I wouldn’t defend them at all. Still allot of bodies buried around the place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 I’m not sure if they did or didn’t. My point is they don’t answer to journalists, they answer to the oireachtas, that’s our democracy. Journalism these days has allot to answer for, fast stories allot of the time without fact checking. Pb4P are a bit much for me. SD’s yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV No there was two groups present. One from the far right and one from the far left. One was asked by trump to March. Both are equally disgusting and need to be sent packing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Not really, u can’t change the story to suit. Months we were told about the lag, and u won’t see effects for 4/5 weeks. We are now seeing level 3 worked and Leonel 5 was called way to early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 No your clearly a SF head. That’s cool, you have different ideas about taxes, social housing, benefits and all that, great. Put your ideas forward, convince people they are good. Just stop the other BS: equally I don’t agree with FG’s new videos about SF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @kirkacevedo Unfortunately that won’t happen. When u get to that level money is all that matters<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC Dude it’s still trumps America, and this is it!! What has the country come to. Both left and right wing groups fighting in the streets. Where is the law and order?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 Good and keep voting. It’s a bit much stating Fine Gael are fascists and suppress others when your party gets to ask questions every day in the dail. Just because u don’t agree with their politics doesn’t mean they are wrong. Remember the majority voted for FF and FG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 Robert, u may have missed the last election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImperialistWl @paddylepage Not sure u will see Biden continue.

<|startoftext|>@Telegraph @realzoestrimpel No it would be free for all, with those who need it most first in line. Money does not mean heathcare before the poor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Ok you idiot. Just stop. Cleary this is wrong, all all of this stupidity must stop. Trump was the one who called for this, not Biden... so stop stoking up flames where there is none<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rtenews They needs this urgently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Rubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Yeah no wonder when they are not providing FNPT2 makes to nurses and doctors.  It’s a disgrace that they are still only given surgical masks, while they put their life in danger caring for the sick. #HSE #NPHET #COVID19 #ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Firstly this is like some kind of weird cult, it’s mind boggling....   Second, in the small print only 60 percent goes to the corrupt ‘djtp’s recount account’ while 40 percent goes to the RNC’s operating account.

<|startoftext|>@unleashthetea @charliekirk11 Lol the people voted. Biden is the president elect. It doesn’t matter about how many people on twitter complain. The election is over. Trump is out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @CathMurphyTD Yep where and who are the other 80. A list should be printed like the tax evaders<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jacobsoboroff @OsherryH It’s the minimum he could do. Then an apology and maybe a green card for their grief and suffering... the. Maybe a free house @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @CathMurphyTD I think he brought the judiciary into disrepute by going to a event that was clearly marked as dangerous and against the common good. The media just reported his actions, just like how they report on the alleged crimes of other who go before him for judgement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV @itvnews Unlikely now as Biden is in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmettOBrienIND @fiannafail @eamonocuiv Have to agree. Don’t see macron wearing a poppy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @CathMurphyTD Is it Andrew? Honest question as I agree trial by media is becoming the new norm and has proven to be very unjust. However if the Chief Justice is calling for his resignation perhaps its trial by his peers and/or superiors who seem to be in best place to judge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Off u go so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlStewartOBE @Allycon3 I also want to know why a government official was at W campaign event?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NikkiMcR @NY_SpecialK Every American needs to be very careful now including the media. Good job from @FoxNews. The world is watching, Europe is watching and we all know what happened in the 30’s and 40’s and how it happened. Learn from history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely clear for the #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin It’s incredibly sad to see many republican senators standing behind the vile and disgusting conspiracy theories spouted by trump. This will have untold damage to what was a once great country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent To much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Meanwhile the presidential press secretary is hanging out in some basement pushing conspiracy theory’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @pfizer @realDonaldTrump Do u know who’s missing at the table? Have a guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irvine_pat @SuzyJourno @PaulTyredagh81 What a disgusting person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump saying troops who mailed in the vote for NV are illegal..... WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Did u know George Bush continued with his transition while awaiting the results of the Courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill #GOPHypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein This is serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews No they didn’t. The said if it’s approved by the FDA and CDC without undue influence from trump they would take it. However if it was fast tracked without scientific evidence by trump they would not. That’s a huge difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @GOP did you forget this? #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden Fully agreed. But remember it is just one person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Just unfollowed trump. It feels good. Everyone should do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @S13Kimberley @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah we can all be individuals, work away. But individual rights don’t come before the rights of everyone. For example, you might as an individual want to not pay taxes.... how does that work out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sorrel17999238 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL April there is 1000 note deaths that matches the covid death notices. what are u proving here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S13Kimberley @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL If u have a punctured lung youre classes as high risk so u should actually be not going shopping so the mask wearing is irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S13Kimberley @Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Where did u get the no compassion from? Because I think ppl should protect themselves and others by following public heath guidance during a pandemic. Yeah your delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allycon3 @Mountai61137001 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL No I just don’t think I should have to treat people and put my life in danger for ppl knowingly not wearing a mask due to some idea of going against the norm. Very happy to see anyone who unfortunately get the virus and who were following the guidance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elizabe69238589 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Elizabeth you are right. But I bet u would call 999 to get an ambulance, first to go down to get your old age pension, did u send kids to school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Dude u must be sick. What the head of trump students do now? Not sure the head of the hitlers youth had many job openings.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Well to be fair to her she is correct. Dems have been point to reimpose spreader events for months, however what hypocrisy, like how the fuck can she comment on it, it’s like Hitler promoting human rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Anyway good night. Have to get up at 5am to go wear my make all day looking after probably some idiots who decided they had a immune system.... good luck with it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah it’s not easy. I do actually agree with what u say, but what I don’t agree with is this I’m above the common good. I would prefer a open society for the young and heathy, with the protection of the old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL so like everything in life... u know I can find a doctor who thinks treating HIV with vitamins works?? 99% of doctors approve of wearing masks including the Chief med Officer, the CDC, the ECDC. But go ahead, find the one, two or three who are against them. Yet let’s go with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL What do u want me to find?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL So what your problem then? Your doing it right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews My god... like what the F. Months of trump mask less rallies and you say nothing, now biden supporters out and your all over it and asking about cnn??? They have actually commented on the no social distancing many times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews To be fair the did exactly that many times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Maybe best not to expose him to covid also since he has asthma ... his anxiety won’t cope with ICU and being vented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah likewise I’m not going to give u my place of work and exact title. But u can at least say what u did in uni?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Ok, I agree with the anxiety and autism bit. But if that is the case, u should do his shopping for him, or put a plan in place, or do his shopping online for delivery. His individual right to go shopping is less than protecting the general population. And if he is anxiety prone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Not everyone. Like who? We had the asthma case, which is rubbish.. high BP, more crap..... so come on what’s next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL I know your not in heathcare... so do u have a science degree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Against pollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah it does to be fair, but rarely if your honest. Not taking away from asthma, many people get into serious difficulty with it. But I haven’t ever seen anyone having a asthma attack wearing a mask. Fun fact, many people with asthma in China/ Hong Kong wear a mask to protect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah because they had a open system, I bet u are anti lockdown?? France had everything open, even offices... so come on.. use your brain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL U see this is the crap. Wearing a mask doesn’t change your spo2 levels. Stop being a twitter scientist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pollymac65 @DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL If your so worried - just don’t bring them shopping. Simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep he got more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just your problem is that the other guy got 76 millions. U do know that the person with the highest number wins right!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL And maybe when u see the death due to covid u might stop mouthing of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL I’m not a GP. If your from a family of doctors ask then why they wear a mask walking around the hospital..... if u can’t wear a mask, just shop online. My actually point was that one individual shouldn’t risk many because they feel their individualism is above all. It’s selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump It’s over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mountai61137001 @Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah it’s the usual with your types. I work in an acute hospital and your around the right lines.... no not in my dreams, did manage to go to uni and work hard, I don’t discover science over the last few months and now think I’m a expert.... but I can see u got the twitter degree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DpbMccrossan @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL No your wrong, everyone can excepting someone with maybe a severe intellectual disability, whom won’t be shopping. In France the government doesn’t heed to the poor me group, no mask equals no entry. This I have asthma, I can’t wear a mask is just BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allycon3 @TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Yeah sure... I spend my day treating sick people with a mask on but stupid people like u can’t manage to get one on for 5 min in a shop. U should get a medical bracelet saying ‘non mask wearer’ so we would not have to risk our lives looking after u if u ever are dying from C19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepopcornreel @rashadrobinson @ColorOfChange He need to get onto Georgia now. Every black persons needs to be sure to be registered to vote and vote blue. All efforts to get the senate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has started. What a looser baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Here we go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sometimestrange @rtenews Yep, but report it like the way they reported the people in Killarney. Discuss the rule breaking, the illegal activity, get comment from the cmo and a minister.... not saying how great they are. They are reporting a party as a good thing, rather than illegal activity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyOMahony81 @SuperValuIRL Tracey - everyone can wear a mask. This crap about not being able to wear one is just selfish. Think of the greater good, if u can’t wear one don’t go shopping, your right to be a individual is not as important in preventing u killing an elderly person from covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Press suppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrColleen3 @rtenews How could anyone be comfortable with it. It’s illegal while only 30 people can go to a funeral and @DavQuinn can’t go to mass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatbilloakley @elad2042 Money ran out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull @GovtdontlieNOT Sorry about your friend. Just some points.. 1) it’s the cdc who make recommendations not the media. 2) I’ve seen on cnn and fox calling out the lack of social distancing. I don’t think anyone could condone the lack of social distancing and it’s a bit disrespectful for the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews disgrace, promoting these old partying idiots breaking lockdown which our businesses are closed. The double standards are just amazing. All over the young people parting in Killarney... but old people drinking in the streets of Mayo are fine. Btw so much for Garda check points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertburke84 The should all be fined @gardainfo @FineGael . Like what the fuck, the economy is being destroyed for a lockdown and here we are.... old people partying. #ireland #rte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GadiNBC @CNNPolitics should report this also, a bit of contrast. However these people just don’t know what socialism or communism  means!!!! Universal heath care is not communism lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Here’s what we know. I’ll never listen to any poll ever again. So big networks, please stop giving them time - trump is right about one thing, they are fake news<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guardian He actually seem mentally unhinged<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris please say count every legal vote (they can’t get. ‘Count every vote’). That’s what everyone wants, stop them missing your words. You are a clear winner, extremely distasteful stuff happening here #trump #biden #GOPComplicitTraitors #GOPHypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @FoxNews now. They just said that the Dems don’t want every vote counted??? Biden has said count all votes, trump said stop the vote. U guys got it the wrong way around.... #foxnews #biden #trump #Vote2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannoCaldwell @the__NIJ How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage Yep we will just have to wait and see....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage I’ve read that they have all been thrown out due to baseless accusations, excepting the court saying the ballots in PA received after the 3rd must be counted separately (only 3000 ballots so far according to sec of state PA)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk. @FoxNews is reporting a whistle blower had submitted an affidavit about back dating votes in Michigan. Can you please figure this, I’m sure it’s more fiction from tack, but would be good to get a insight into what this is about and get official response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage Genuinely interested. Will u point me to the one u think is best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have Fox News just stopped following the race? Georgia has been up 7k votes for hours and it’s still not showing on fox ⁦@FoxNews⁩ #trump #FoxAndFriends  https://t.co/vthOwsoFpK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage No I believe he can bring any case forward if he wants. I respect the system. I don’t respect his unfounded ‘huge fraud’. There simply is no evidence. Could u point me to where these mysterious stacks of votes are? What state and county... and a real source<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage Yeah your right. It’s rubbish. It’s deleted  https://t.co/MMEvvdVHam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage Seriously... be real. They are out the posted in ballots, most are for Biden, because Dems asked people to vote by mail to prevent Covid. Trump urged his voters to go in person. It’s simple, people should stop being dishonest and saying shit that’s not real...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryJaneVandek2 @mattgaetz I agree with u. But Did u say the same thing to all those talking about hunter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddylepage U can’t just use toe bits of info... what about all the tweets... stop the vote. I’ll give u that he seems depressed during his speeches, but still ranted about fraud and people steeling an election. Also said Georgia was run by Dems...... he just can’t stop the Lies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ARoosiline @thetimes @MatthewParris3 man, your lost,  anyone ok with some1 being killed in the side of the road, no matter what your past, you have serious reflection to do. The fundamentals of Christianity are lost on many now, don’t forget why we live the way we do... it’s because of a Christian Democratic society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARoosiline @thetimes @MatthewParris3 Behaviour based on some glimmer that it was not all bad. Again people argue hitler did some good, medical advances were mainly down to Nazi experimentation. But nobody can defend evil, and I’m not saying trump is on the same level, but he has done Enormous wrongs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARoosiline @thetimes @MatthewParris3 The problems is he has done so much harm, and all the madness can’t be ignored, down to ivanka spending the last 3 months pushing trade marks in China to breaking the law on using the White House for campaigning.

<|startoftext|>@ARoosiline @thetimes @MatthewParris3 Yeah hitler didn’t kill people straight away. And he has incited violence.

<|startoftext|>@kelsi_lou_who @JustVent6 @realDonaldTrump Kelsi - your wrong, in PA they are separating the ballots they came in late (let’s not forget why... because trump slowed the post service, this is direct interference in the election).

<|startoftext|>@Independent That’s nice of him considering the bible says for those that believe.. ‘thou shall not kill’. It doesn’t say thou shall not kill, except in certain cases’.......

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @GovtdontlieNOT @DearbhailDibs U know there is like a shebeen instead of pubs.... Perhaps there is like a church equivalent.... like a secret society or sect. Where secrets can be kept.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danyalmustfa1 Would be good to stop sharing. If your a journalist from a reader of news it would be nice for in-depth analysis. So much instant news now that that most of the time is factually incorrect. Have a good night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danyalmustfa1 No - it’s actually policy now. For active shooters they don’t want anything shared as it shows locations of police etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @thepopcornreel #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @thepopcornreel This is the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @bridsmithTD @TheHardShoulder Well here we are again. What percentage of the Irish electorate vote for PBP? Yet we seem to hear from them as if they are the main opposition! The reason people don’t vote for them is because we don’t want them representing us, equally we don’t want to listen either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_mageean @wolfiewire #defundrte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mick96017306 @ClaireByrneLive @simoncoveney Nothing to see - people trying to make something out of nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danyalmustfa1 They have asked that you don’t. Let’s respect them and the people involved and let them do their jobs. They have a reason for asking people not to share, let’s just do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump It’s like a farewell tour. Awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigMattSays @TheHardShoulder @seanspicer @kierancuddihy @NewstalkFM Contained in the muller report if u want to read it but here is a quick snapshot  https://t.co/79Wnca7MXw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s got to the point where your accusations are just ridiculous and your lies are just so apparent. #itsover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danyalmustfa1 Did you not get the message. Stop sharing, your putting people’s lives in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@American_Jew @LPDWien My god - where are all these people coming from. Just respect the police, they are doing their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bini_Guttmann @TerryReintke Does it matter what religion the people shot were? Was there any victims?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turning the corner??? #VoteHimOutandLockHimUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you read it? I wouldn’t call that an endorsement - more like an embarrassment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Would be a good result - let them quit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gram_Kat @WWEWillow @DonaldJTrumpJr I will let him pass on the spelling front. Auto correct is painful sometimes. But still vote him out #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier @annika1021 I think it’s the opposite way.... thankfully dictators are few and far between so maybe it might be best to join a NGO or something and put your efforts to good use<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Dirty perv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Few and far between<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Unfortunately it’s not unthinkable anymore..... it’s become a everyday nightmare under #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell Donald!!! He missed the importance of listening to the health experts and hundreds of thousands died!!! #Trump #Trump2020 #Fauci #2020Election #FoxNews #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters It’s amazing how we always watch things happen on tv - we know they are wrong, once it’s all over and with the vast suffering and death completed.... some UN body or watchdog calls for a investigation. It’s too late!!!!  We need action not contemplating how bad the crimes were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters She really should vote Biden and surprise him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Let’s go with a Biden for American values, truth, freedom, heath and prosperity. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I don’t think anyone has heard anyone calling Biden a laughing stock..... only you! You have brought everyone into the gutter. It’s time to get back to being american. #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindy0208 @nypost Hardly - sounds like they may not actually be the ones who were taking them. Of course it is wrong for anyone to be interfering with anyone’s sign, just the answer is shooting people. Better to call 911<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost My god - how could u take a fire arm to end someone’s life over a yard sign. Like what has this country come to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Of course - that’s what democracy is about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConorDNewman @realgussy @irishexaminer Please - what u don’t think one GP doesn’t talk to the next. People seem to be very naive here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realgussy @irishexaminer It’s not commercial info. It’s public info, it’s the rate the gov pay doctors. This is public info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PpollingNumbers @MorningConsult People need to get out and vote to mask this the real thing #VoteBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHardShoulder @seanspicer @kierancuddihy @NewstalkFM Today is a day I will turn newstalk off. Couldn’t listen to a man that clearly lied so many times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realgussy @irishexaminer Well it’s not the same as insider trading, he’s not making a profit. Plus it’s a deal that was completed so clearly the doctors would have know what deal they were getting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry To this day he is such an inspiration to all - and no looking right to left for a teleprompter. Just a man with words and intelligence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer I’m not really sure what the issue is here. If this was a business it would be nothing. Confidential doesn’t mean never show anyone - it just means limit access. If Leo was the elected leader (CEO) and decided that he wanted to share a document he has every given right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyholohans @thejournal_ie I’ll give u that one, the place needs cleaning out. It’s extremely manager orientated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie What’s needed is HSE fully employed dentists in primary care and allow access to them for all. For those that have no medical card charge a nominal fee (20 or 30) euro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryBoorstein @ProjectLincoln Yes possibly - but again who knows what trump told him to say - it’s the first time a president has interfered in so many independent federal organisations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln At this stage he’s just disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Kaewkamnerd @nytimes This usually happened in worn torn countries or countries ruled by dictators<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Should be called lie and lie again bus tour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EU_Commission Would be nice if we could use transport!!! The traffic light system is a complete flop as every country in Europe is red. A common approach across the EU is need to fight covid and the citizens of Europe must be allowed travel across the EU unimpeded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I’m sure they will cope from all the millions they previously made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic I think this drug testing is extremely good - you clearly should be doing more checkpoints during the year. Allot of your checkpoints however have guards just waving people past. I have never been stopped at one and gone past many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Every dictator needs a propaganda outlet. People shot dump the gazette<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN People need to go vote in person. This is getting ridiculous. Imagine this is America 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mick96017306 @GardaTraffic Yeah makes them look like they have been doing nothing for the past few years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepopcornreel @bluestein Hope your right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @votetimscott @NancyMace How could any self respecting lady/ woman vote for this man after what he said about women today. Is this what you want for your children and grandchildren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump calls the good folk of Iowa stupid in this video. Will stupid people vote for trump? #iowa #IOWAPOLL  https://t.co/SVecyvcDeW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HerschelWalker @JoeBiden @FoxNews @CNN @espn @MSNBC @MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Because they are not running for office? Why is ivanka taking in millions of dollars last year while working in the White House? Why is she in China pushing trade marks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Pure crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump She is begging for trump as she wants to earn millions more of the backs of ordinary Americans. How much did she make last year? How many trade marks in China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyholohans @Independent_ie It’s time to put these doctors on a flat rate like the the UK and every other country in the EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BothaBoy @Independent_ie No 60 but every time a GP refers anyone for a covid test the gov gives them 35 euro. All done over the phone.... imagine 35 euro for a 2 min phone call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Commercially sensitive info? They are unions not businesses! Anyway what’s confidential about doctors pay??! It’s all public knowledge - problem is doctors are over paid in Ireland compared to other EU countries. 35 euro for someone to say they have a cough on the phone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC How any woman could vote for this man is beyond me. #voteblue #FlipTheSenate #SouthCarolina<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Where was the secret service?? Maybe the bus was empty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericaFirstPAC She got a visa to do that add. They found her in a ice detention centre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump Was there as many Jews for hitler?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GaysForTrump..... lol how stupid could you be. It’s the same as saying hitler for Jews. Watch the video.... I’m sure the response will be, ‘trump made a mistake when he said he’s not for gay marriage, he meant the opposite’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CortesSteve If your Latino and vote for trump there is no hope for any of us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just get out and #VoteBlueDownBallot . Here is a great vid with facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing Hey excellent video! Makes complete sense. We need more like this, getting the facts out and less of the lies and tribulations of trump. Everyone needs to get up and vote. #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PpollingNumbers @EmersonPolling Extremely close. All votes must get our and #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lavern_spicer What a disgusting tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKyleMorris A bit like Ivanka who has been getting loads of trademarks approved in China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking It’s terrible to have a leader who is so dishonest and proud of being so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ Paul unfortunately you are brain washed. The facts are actually the complete opposite. It’s trump who has the Chinese back account and Ivanka who is getting trademarks passed by the Chinese. It’s trumps associates who are in prison due to Russia and it’s trumps campaign team...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Biden will be left with a multitude of problems to fix with the states left in a bad way after a bad presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump No he doesn’t. He should be preventing American deaths and taking care of covid rather than ignoring it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Are u seriously kidding. So much for being all for law and order. This is actually illegal what they did and the fbi will bring them to justice before a judge and their peers. This is our system. If you don’t like it.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Where did u get this from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chandragray08 I just unfollowed them and would encourage everyone to do the same<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@murray_nyc @DJJudd This is why other countries call some ‘dumb Americans’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How could you actually retweet this and approve of this behaviour. This is the start of the end of democracy . Shame on you! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer They all should be fined by the guards for breaking covid rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yerbamate71 @ambredino @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump The fact is if they didn’t get covid they would still be alive. Do you know most people who have cancer die of pneumonia. In the end do you say they died because of a chest infection or cancer?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmericaFirstPAC I just watched this. It’s extremely good  https://t.co/9Rkwz9wauv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray I think u will find it was a bunch of trump gun carrying white men driving and intimidating at a polling place in a predominant black neighbourhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Of course it is..... you tanked it and it’s not even back to where it was at. Btw markets were down this week again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGasparino @POTUS Gets me every time. The stuff is just hilarious - getting a bit boring I must admit now, no new material<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Man so full of shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WXIIMeredith @WXII The people they arrested were news reporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffmanForNC @JoeBiden time to call this out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump Reporters arrested at voting stations and police using tear gas on children and people in wheelchairs and voters. This is scary and reminds me of my history books about Germany in 1930.  https://t.co/AkLfnoF2De<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really nicely done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PpollingNumbers @CNN All #biden votes need to get out and make their vote count. Trump has already started trying to get votes thrown out in #texas. Pure #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahforHD134 @samstein Where is George Bush. Time for him to speak up against this disgusting, vile attack on democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cftrdghutf @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump What do u mean? I’m just saying I think it’s shameful. That’s it nothing more. It’s he right to vote for who she wants, I just don’t agree with it. End of.... life moves on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fistywolfbiceps @ReneRussell411 @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump No dude. They are not made up. All well documented. U can actually find most of the stuff on Trump’s on twitter profile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambredino @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump What this about. U do know the USA has one of the highest death rates per capita. Well above the countries u mention above<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larryelder Yes that is ugly personified. Trying to disrupt a presidential nominee talking to the good folk that took the time to listen to him. It rude and hateful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaSuhler U do know he’s the most hated man in the UK and couldn’t get elected to save his life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tophertownmusic No trump was calling for the death penalty for 5 innocent black teenagers in NY.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Truly shocking @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markiavelli_ @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump This is what they did in Northern Ireland during riots. Works well and is safe than firing bullets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Do u think it’s because democrats loose, dude it’s the other way around. We already see the trump trucks driving around with visible fire arms. This shit is not America and people like you are spraying petrol on the fire<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReneRussell411 @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump If your own ideas are supporting a man who decided to take kids away from their parents, make fun of people with disabilities, pay a prostitute to keep quite, lie and ask proud boys to standby and the rest....

<|startoftext|>@shahidmikhael @Dina68540061 @AmyMek I agree Shahid, however the Muslim community needs to come out and stand with macron not protest against him.

<|startoftext|>@Katereena @annika1021 Like WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche He keeps talking about this wishful corruption, but he’s talking about himself!!! trumps daughter is rushing trademarks in China as we speak and here is factual info about trump and China.

<|startoftext|>@TXTrumplican45 @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump actually a funny pic. But what’s funnier is your complete lack of judgement.

<|startoftext|>@Orla24816298 @Independent_ie No I do, just it’s not urgent, even in 6 weeks they can manage and if a real emergent just buy online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpStudents @CalforNC @ThomTillis @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump Lol trump paid a prostitute to keep quite and has a illegitimate son.... so in the same sentence he praises trump but condones someone who had an affair?? Is this guy drinking bleach???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump What’s sad is that certain death related to covid will arrive for these people cheering a mad man. 30000 covid cases related to his rallies with 700 people who attended dying from covid.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did u manage to get there? It’s being reported that fascist tugs are preventing presidential nominees from getting to locations. Imagine that in the United States 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeGunner09 @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump Dude I just checked your account - all you have done is tweet stuff about trump since I joined.. so I guess I meet my trump bot... nice to meet u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Common sense appears not that common<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve88keys @MImproxyble @realDonaldTrump That is true, however he actually started off quite main stream and many embraced his Germany first mantra..... a few years later when he took hold he started his anti immigration, and Jew, anti gay, anti catholic stances<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters U think ‘he will stand up to dictators’...... no he is a dictator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve88keys @MImproxyble @realDonaldTrump Many people embraced Nazi germany as well..... all based on fear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeGunner09 @theangiestanton @realDonaldTrump Yeah I did join in August, like what’s wrong with that? Before u get there I have 40 followers.... cause that seems to matter about your life experience and politics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EUCouncil @WHO @EU2020DE @jensspahn @EUCouncilPress @WHO_Europe There need to be a EU wide approach to covid - this piece meal crap is only damaging the block<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer That’s good - it means the other couple of million are complying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop being a dictator. If people vote before or on the 3rd their votes must and will count. This is what democracy, you vote and your vote picks the winner. The winner doesn’t win because of trickery or manipulation - #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigailmarone @TeamTrump I really think it’s great that trump supports show up to Biden rallies. Hopefully while they are standing aimlessly waving facist flags some of Biden words might sink in and make a difference. #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EliseRalby @tejaswoman @RepsForBiden @FearThisAndThat @GOP @kaybaileyhutch @RVAT2020 I believe that the republic leadership has gone astray. This year needs to be bad for the leadership for people to look again at the Republican values and put people forward that will hold those values. Republicans can and will do better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Great. Just what’s needed right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is this a joke??? He just accused them of committing fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews It’s a sad day where there is protest on the streets of London and the western world against a elected president who is saying the law of the land is the only law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeTurx @the__NIJ No but I bet you would wage through the kids who have no parents due to American crimes against humanity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Where did they think they were going with that..... seriously????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Reuters People are sick of paying over the top for the same shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters What the fuck? What are they going on about??? For sure it’s not in sympathy for the people who’s heads were cut off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 He’s such a toss pot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie The lockdown in France and Germany are not equivalent to ours. In France they have been told to continue to go to work, shops are open as the president said the shock to the economy would be to grave. Only bars and restaurants are closed for eat in.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Only two? Is this news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwilliam111 @ANoble63393050 I think they got it wrong. It’s shameful people got their heads cut off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you no shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodcallsBS @PoliticsReid Why do you assume Canada would take the individual states. Also Canada is a full democracy without individual state laws, and far right:left politics are relatively unknown which can’t be said about America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse U can’t make this shit up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent It is true that you cannot say this is a issue of all Muslims, quite the contrary it’s a small minority. However the Muslim leadership needs to intervene and come up with solutions that reduce radical behaviour, just as much as I would expect Catholic/ Protestant leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizaRosen0000 He forgets one problem - western society is not governed by the norms of religion but that of equal consensus by the majority of people in the state (democracy). If he wants to live by religion he should pop away and live in a religious state (Saudi maybe)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@G0ldkloud @Azcetic @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump Calling three French citizens who died fuckwads is disgusting. One was a teacher and the other two killed at mass. Have done respect. It’s sad to see so many horrible people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is actually getting pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie To be fair they are not. People have got used to just throwing clothes away and buying into fast fashion... destroying the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EU_Commission @vonderleyen @JHahnEU @PaoloGentiloni @europainitalia @ComisionEuropea @EUinPL Maybe you should not be directing funds into Poland while they have LGBTQ free zones. Completely against EU values and they should not be awarded for such - jobs or no jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh shut up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyPacchia1 @KamVTV @GhoSTorM143 @SheepofftheJeep He killed them by incompetence. America has 690 covid deaths per 1 million inhabitants. That’s one of the worst in the entire world, only behind Peru, Mexico, Brazil etc. America should have nowhere near that amount of death - so by his ineptitude he killed Americans....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TraceyOMahony81 Christmas is a religious festival which is engrained in Irish culture. It’s a time for family. No Government will say how my family will interact in my home or which family can attend. This is not Nazi germany or China or North Korea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EUCouncil Europe is a culture of openness, Christian values (believers and non believers), respect and diversity. There is no place for religious beliefs being imposed. If you come to Europe to live, you must accept the European culture. If not live somewhere else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthonyPacchia1 @KamVTV @GhoSTorM143 @SheepofftheJeep U don’t get the word? verb  past tense: killed; past participle: killed11. cause the death of (a person, animal, or other living thing)."her father was killed in a car crash" or trump killed many with covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump This is really nice to see. Country over party. #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hasan08931491 There is no denying history and unfortunately it cannot be change, same with allot of sad stories of the past. The main thing is to look at the present and future. What cannot be condoned is the continued push for land grabs in Palestine. It’s time for peach in the region<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badacademian @PpollingNumbers This is every true. Only two real parties and not even a popular vote. I would say Europe is more Democratic in terms of how they operate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Well if anyone is stupid enough to give them their votes.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0pinion8d This is extremely hard to watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier So strange..... are u hoping that trumpet brings u under his wing, may not be so nice in jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How is counting people’s actual votes that they were entitled to send it steeling an election. Surely it’s the other way around. Not counting legitimate votes cast by the people would be steeling?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill While trump speaks about Farage at rally referencing him as Europe’s  most power man??? He’s actually a non elected mad man equivalent of trumps bannon... really powerful? He’s actually mainly unknown across the EU  https://t.co/BeHFrSdpKp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw Wow l - how could you vote for someone like that??? #VoteBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squibbleyahoy @JackPosobiec I’m sorry but I’m not voting for some lunatics on the side of the street. You seem to think that every trump supporter represents trump and every Biden supporter represents Biden. That’s an extremely worrying position to have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Ok I’m not a trump fan... clearly no plan and needs to be voted out....but seriously, he’s sounding more and more like a raving lunatic. Are people seriously going to vote for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Well I think she said he was autistic? But anyway what is wrong with people? There is so much angst and hate, when did it become to shout at people like this? America has gone seriously wrong and it needs help #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @rtenews It’s an extremely complex issue which needs a good support structure in place for everyone involved. Clearly we can do better, why not a office for reunification?

<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @rtenews That may be correct but they have the right to protest and the right to highlight the wrong inflicted on them. Someone should tell people like you the trauma they have suffered and how they were wronged by the state yet again<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Prob not. So anyway how does voting for a man who brags about grabbing pussy, lies constantly and makes a policy for separating children from partners fir which Christian values?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavinbobbell @CelticGooner14 @SuzyJourno @LucidTalk @BelTel I’m sure it defiantly does!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics No it’s actually the White House chief of staff who said that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s getting worse and worse. Could he get any lower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SambinoChildish @irishexaminer Dude what country are u in that u think millionaires only pay 50 percent tax. Yes I agree everyone should get health care. What I don’t agree with is someone who never works getting a house, the exact same as the neighbour who works, plus child allowance, plus the dole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump It’s trumps policy for child separation from parents as an ideal to stop parents crossing with kinds which is another whole separate issues.... the cages and the policy are not linked....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Here I can’t fault anything in this article. It’s factual and gives an exact account what they were build for and what Obama used them for and why they were build. I still disagree with them, I think it’s inhuman. But trump took it one step further...    https://t.co/pe9lOAaxqO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SambinoChildish @irishexaminer paid enough. Just 50 percent goes on tax, plus a child who is sick so a fortune on heathcare- no medical card for tax payers... the point is people who are out working should not be less well or than those who are not. This happens in Ireland! Min-wage people better of on dole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump How they were used. People built prisons and other forms of detention centres and I think we can all agree that we need some form of detention Centers. It’s how and why we use them what matters???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Can you confirm that the policy to separate children from their parents commenced in 2017 under a pilot program under trump and he then decided to make it full policy in 2018, until he did a U turn after a huge amount of protests. The construction of cages is not the issue, it’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EzekwemUche @KurtisScaletta @ChaimSalomon @kbuldakov1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Hey john - this is an interesting take. Cages let’s call them confinement areas.... so who build them? Why is that relevant. They were clearly build to confine people for a purpose. This is not about the confinement areas. It’s how they were decided to be used. It’s.l a policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Douglasreber He actually looked better on the real 60 min rather than his leaked version... Anyway be blew both, it’s clear he has no policy and just stands for hate, fear and anger! Biden was presidential - bring hope back to America.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mickmac12345 @irishexaminer Yeah the 75 percent is a good thing. But remember u have to pay tax to get that, and it’s based on what u paid in.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN Yes law and order is Pennsylvania has ruled. Now respect the court and the law! It’s not terrible it’s the law - Americans are law abiding people. Leave the people of Pennsylvania alone and let them vote in peace, they are good people!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichealMartinTD Pure crap. How is Spain at 15k cases per day over the last 3 months with only 3.5 deaths per day over the last 14 days? Why are deaths in Ireland at less than 1 death per day on average over the last 14 days? Why has Sweden for less Covid than Ireland now? Lockdowns are idiotic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rtenews Sweden and Germany at less than 100 cases per 100k. Ireland is at 270. Spain at 350 and Belgium near 1000, yet guess what???   Ireland is the only one in a 2nd lockdown. How do we get it so wrong all the time?   Ans- put idiots who ran the heath service for years in charge.  https://t.co/cZnSiMn79v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yo_Ros @guardian Sorry Ros my bad, I meant to say second lockdown, same as Ireland and now we are going for lockdown the second<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaomiOhReally good article. Once thing to note is that Ireland has the most restrictive approach to covid being the only EU country in a second lockdown. This is despite only having 270 covid cases per 100k population. How can other countries avoid lockdown having nearly 5 times the rate.  https://t.co/kmPpXIDOwW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaomiOhReally @Paul5cott Essentially Ireland once again has the most restrictive and draconian policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovtdontlieNOT Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryMa95079649 @LeoVaradkar Jerry there could have been one cases that we dont know about. There also could be other germs that may or may not pose a negligible risk to life. Based on that fact that is not a fact at all I think all gyms should close for ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@News_Letter But I bet they still have ICU beds available in Belfast..... little know fact. In Dublin pre covid most days there was no free ICU beds or only one held for a urgent case from another hospital transfer which could come from anywhere in Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer We need a tracing system that can cope with 600 cases per 100k a day, the upper limits of what other counties are experiencing and btw are not locking down. We are still the only EU country doing a second lockdown with far less covid than Spain, France, the Netherlands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer And Nolan was on the radio saying they didn’t foresee a tracing system that would need to cope with 1000 cases a day... why the hell not, look at every other country. These are full blown idiots in charge. 1000 cases a day in Ireland equates close to 250 per 100k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BronhWalsh @DavQuinn U have to make that statement for the people like you. It seems now nobody can question anything. I happily read the times and the guardian and many more. The fact is RTÉ is rubbish - explain the word substantial in that headline - what is actually substantial?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@President_MU This bit was for your Philip. Your so wrong all the time and you just need to stop and get back to teaching or what ever it is you do in Maynooth.  https://t.co/tZdPsBxd9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@President_MU Yeah Philip I think he’s taking about you.... the people in the media proclaiming they know how to manage a outbreak however these so called experts never managed anything in this respect. The HSE PH doctors are never in the media.... so that was all for u. Just stop!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews Hi if your talking to Tony today can you asking him what’s his understanding of the word ‘substantial’ and ‘significant’. Yesterday he said their was a substantial increase in hospitalisations. In fact the exact number was 23, does he really think 23 is a substantial number?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn  https://t.co/VpO3dPncEh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn The ‘substantial’ change in hospitalisation rate was actually 23 which for me is neither substantial or worrying. Emotive language and misplace adjectives need to stop. More fact less scaremongering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn It’s from RTÉ, which for me means it’s possibly not the full story and probably requires more analysis. Not a conspiracy person but just think RTÉ is terrible these days. It’s a messenger vehicle rater then a journalistic team. Can’t find the DOH figure     https://t.co/tSU1O3HYrQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElMcM @rtenews @rte Complete crap - many reasons why we can’t follow them all documented already if you would bother to do some research. Maybe report this and why the death rates are now low due to increase survivability rate.  https://t.co/MxTFi9qtxw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gabeh730 @CalebJHull Press release is about opening a new building, not really that high on the news priorities considering, although new buildings are all nice to see.

<|startoftext|>@rtenews Correction it’s 13 as per the department of health. How are you not embarrassed RTÉ at your sensationalist inaccurate reporting, taking people at verbatim and not fact checking. This is the definition of trumps #fakenews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews @ZaraKing @CMOIreland You should ask him what a successful test and trace system looks like, how does ours compare to South Korea, Germany or Vietnam.

<|startoftext|>@rtenews Great a lockdown every 3 months. What clowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan This spread it to many of the 56. So sick and tired of this false narrative and fake facts being spouted as fact. Just report the case without the spin... it was completely about the badness about traveling abroad when that had nothing to do with the spread of the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Finally - he didn’t spread it to 56 because he was abroad and didn’t restrict his movement. He didn’t isolate when he got symptoms, that’s why he infected so many, also his friend did the same who got covid in Ireland. She went out socialising when awaiting a test after symptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan First it states key facts have been altered in this cases to protect the identity - key facts altered, he may never have been abroad. 2) never says when he got symptoms, could have and more likely got it in Ireland within community spread was rampant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan Niall will u call out the terrible reporting about the man who was ‘abroad’ and spread covid to 56.  https://t.co/zZsO8PRn2r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBJude @davomooregmail1 @FergalBowers Real story without the false narrative, - people with symptoms and who socialised while awaiting covid test spreads virus to many. You can read the actually facts yourself here, page 36/37. #COVID19 #ireland #rtenews #terriblereporting  https://t.co/zZsO8PRn2r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBJude @davomooregmail1 @FergalBowers Third, the reason he spread covid was not because he ‘was abroad’, it was because he didn’t self isolate when symptoms appeared, same for his friend who got covid in Ireland, socialised while awaiting a covid test, and spread it to many of the 56.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBJude @davomooregmail1 @FergalBowers Just some additional reporting on the ‘super spreader’... first the report states, ‘key details have been altered in this example’... so actually he may never have been abroad. Second it never states when he got symptoms, he may have and more likely picked up covid in Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Did anyone tell you there is a pandemic - where people need to social distance and organising mass gatherings is idiotic.

<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Really misleading and trying to push a narrative. Overseas is bad. It should actually read - man ignores symptoms of covid-19, does not get a test and mixes with the public. The overseas part is not relevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Such crap - when your loosing blame someone else. More lies, twitter will tell u what tweets they block and why (generally due to spreading lies or infactual info). If your not getting ‘retweets’ it’s because people know your a liar. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymcgee @IrishTimes Not according to yer man Harris. He seem to be constantly pushing for lockdowns which the WHO are against. Nice being on a top salary that doesn’t change while you destroy other people’s business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Little know fact, in Dublin, pre covid, generally only one ICU bed would be vacant for an emergency. Sometimes no beds and people would remain on a ventilator in surgery recovery rooms or accident and emergency as no beds available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn It’s unfortunate that the headlines nowadays try to make a dramatic impactful statement, full of fear.... then u read the article and the facts can be completely different. icu full to capacity - no shit, they have been at capacity for the last 20 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davomooregmail1 @FergalBowers Oh no pay away. Just not with tax payers money. People don’t go out to work and who work hard, for money to be taken off them to pay someone else between 100k and 200k to read the news, especially not to read the news to 450k people. It’s a false economy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Yeah I agree there. It was clearly coming, I do believe we should be basing our restrictions on the ICU capacity, and infirmity believe our icu capacity can be at least 50 higher, and it could be done within 2 months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtetwip @SimonHarrisTD The key in they clip for me was... there was a meeting yesterday for 4/5 hours, the one that I wasn’t at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghDowning @conor_pope We can protect our nursing homes, we can increase our capacity. It’s not as hard as it looks. It’s really Irish culture, ‘sure we could never get a good system in place, so let’s not bother trying’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leto_II_of_Dune @conor_pope I do agree it is more infectious. But that’s the reason the fatality rate is important, that’s transferable. I do believe people need to take personal responsibility. You know your risk, if it’s high, stay at home. Shop online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaomiOhReally  https://t.co/wKudma1Rom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaomiOhReally call him out. Yes we are doing ok in terms of testing 2000 per 100k last week, however huge backlog in labs and 6/7 days before we contact close contact, which is far to late. Denmark 5000 tests per 100k and Iceland 4000. Both results back next day, contacts with 36 hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PDX317115 @conor_pope Fully agree - I don’t advocate for what America is doing. They have no test and trace system, didn’t protect the elderly, actually trumpet called the whole thing a hoax. Unfortunately America is slightly different, it has a huge population that is morbidly obese with a high<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyGoldmuff @conor_pope No not at all. Your type can be spotted a mile off. Your first message said it all. Im just passing my Sunday morning. Now that is passed have a good day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenBa80496868 @conor_pope Do please - Hopefully you don’t, again your chances are good and even children with underlying conditions generally less than 1 percent have serious complications max. Try not to worry to much, your mental heath is also important, I’d get off this and read a book or walk isolated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope And the labs - we can actually allow universities to test. They all have the equipment and staff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kraster @alanfair12 @AndyMcCourt32 @conor_pope @DrZeroCraic Well now we can’t lock people up and destroy the economy because people can’t do that.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope But Orla that is exactly our problem. Why is our test and trace system so bad??? No excuse. Thousands of unemployed at home, all they need is a laptop and phone. It’s not rocket course so a 1 hours CBT traning course will do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @KarenBa80496868 @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope defiantly not in the mainstream everyone is lying. Just there are more reputable sources than others, the Irish times, the guardian both give time to different sides. RTÉ is poor. And because someone goes to TCD doesn’t make them right. Look at poor @SamuelMcConkey1 and zero C19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyGoldmuff @conor_pope lighten up. Not really full of crap, many have the same opinion as me in heathcare (just can’t say it as we would loose our jobs) The problem is all the sudden availability of medical experts and hyped up journalism. Look@around Europe, Ireland is by far the most restrictive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @KarenBa80496868 @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope Here is long covid from google<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyGoldmuff @conor_pope Well found long covid in google<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump The thing is that just won’t happen. Even if u put Xi in the laws wouldn’t get passed the house and senate. The pelosi thing is pretty much as Donald says fake news. I wouldn’t read much into that crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenBa80496868 @conor_pope But where is the data saying that they are well able to spread it. I get u need to isolate, that’s important. But try not to be shit scared, the chances of u getting it from that kid is less than 1 percent by current data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Our numbers are not high Orla. People keep saying they are high, compared to what? A test a trace system should be able to cope with a incidence rate of 500 per 100k. If it can’t it’s worthless. We are currently at 224 per 100k  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @KarenBa80496868 @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope RTÉ your have a laugh 😂. Just shows where u are at. My point being that u missed, there is no studies on ‘long covid’ there is no data. Only scaremongering. The same the deadly virus that we Jews about it April which causes panic buying.... turns out it’s not so deadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Yep but nice chat - do take your points, just can’t agree. But there lies democracy......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump I was the same, until I started to watch thing in full. Then u see they are not gaffs, he corrects himself. I do the same, so does everyone, even trump. For me he’s answered everything. What policy u talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump I’ve been on trumps page, no plans, no detail. That’s the issue. I agree with everything Biden says, I look it up and it’s generally fact. I watch trump, I don’t get any info, only who complaining about everyone. That’s no leadership for me. Anyway dude. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Saying lock them all up, that’s not democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Yeah that’s where we will differ, I’ve been on the Dems page, I’ve read their plans. I’ve had them in power and was happy with what they did. Equally I’ve always been happy with Republican leadership. I’m not happy with the behaviour of trump, I’m not happy that he keeps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump I agree that the media is very partisan except for a select few.  I agree that there is allot of dirty tricks, especially from the trump side, that Biden senate thing was a great example, doctor fauci taken out of context. Doing that is as good as lying, it’s misleading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyGoldmuff @conor_pope Yeah your problem is google and jumping on the first thing that appears. Be smart, look for the evidence, check the facts, it’s like the red head pushed out on RTÉ re deviating effect of covid, sure it’s true for him, but he’s one in a million. Have some perspective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Yeah I am, I watch the clip trump put out, do me a favour, go watch the full clip, Biden was running through all the things he ran for.  https://t.co/8EjZxFLYku<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump You are right in one respect. Fact, the dossier that put the spot light in trump from the Hilary campaign did materialise based on a Russian intelligence office. Fact, the dossier did not change the outcome of the report, what was in the dossier was true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Well depends how u define being a socialist, that’s a long road with two very different ends. Broadly I believe in: -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenBa80496868 @conor_pope In all for that. Data, research and solid conclusion and comparable with other illnesses. I’m just not for scaremongering about stuff we know nothing about. To much of that going on. People in their 20’s scared shitless about a virus that generally has not more impact than a cold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope And I do think their time would be better spent improving the system, the test and trace is one of the worst in Europe, only goes back 48 hours. Our icu capacity is now less. They dismantled the testing sites.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Maybe who knows - I do know the track record of allot of people on NPHET (it’s not great) and there seems to be a perversion with the media and twitter, I stopped following Tony and co. It’s not their job to individually spread news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Funny I was a Republican, gone to Biden. I still class as a Republican just need some new leadership, it’s gone rotten. I don’t really watch the news to be fair, I rely more on published gov articles and read them myself. Not saying I read no news, just find the spin unbearable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Thanks will give it a listen. I’d say he may have a different view point now with more data. I have a completely different view point in April<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Agreed at lest had planned. I’d say we’re are close on opinions. Unfortunately NPHET which is part of the DOH is inept, the HSE and DOH have never got anything right, always a shambles. Look at Germany, how are they getting it so right? Yer man comes back and day one.. level 5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope Lasting symptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope My point was for u. Stop being hysterical. The main symptom of ‘long covid’ is fatigue, yes the same as post flu. People getting ‘long covid’ generally for people who were incubated. Check it out, intubation is highly invasive and the majority of ICU patients always have long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope I do agree to a certain point. We know the icu projections for the under 65 if it were to travel in the community and we know the icu admission for people with underlying conditions. Perhaps we should do what Spain and France does, uses the icu capacity to dictate restrictions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump I could never vote for someone who colluded with Russia. #GOPBetrayedAmerica. Man wake up - and is Biden squeaky clean, prob not. Is anyone? Would u like someone trawling over your internet history and publishing it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusguntherky @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope Yeah disagree with that. Research does not need to be pulled apart on twitter, it’s a peer reviewed article and published by the WHO. Anyone who studies research will have an opinion, we just don’t need to jump on the conspiracy theorists twitter land trip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qlqn @conor_pope Here it is Alan - btw I try to avoid news outlets like the above unless they have a good track record and some sort of Independant journalistic quality.    https://t.co/pwFmPNYPws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4rbh @LarryBrindisi @conor_pope Spreading missinfortmon??? 10 to 50 percent chance of ‘long covid’. Where did u get this from?? What exactly is long covid??? And you recover from the flu, please it’s clear u only ever had a cold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyGoldmuff @conor_pope Have u any research on people requiring long term care. Many with ‘long covid’ have the same symptoms of people recovering from the flu... it takes time to recover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump Anyway that said it’s clear that’s not what Biden is about - it’s simply making healthcare accessible to all? Clearly that is good? And for him being shot..... he looked pretty good at the town hall and I think he’s got it in him. This slow joe crap is trump all over......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump in Europe at the moment (voted by mail) but the majority of EU countries have socialised heathcare and they have a higher life expectancy that the US. You also have private heathcare if u want it. So I don’t know what this obsession of paying mega bucks for heathcare is about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope We will be short of ICU trained nurses so mix it, one ICU qualified to one non qualified - put in place an intense traning course. Cut out all the crap (and there is allot of crap) in all college courses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Yes our lack of ICU capacity is a huge problem. Let’s fix it. 30k cash bonus for nurses who work in ICU covid wards. I know about 6 empty old wards which could be changed into ICU covid wards in 3 weeks if we work at it. Build covid ICU specific wards, increase the capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 Allot of research ongoing, one theory is that (may be right or wrong at this stage) the majority of children don’t reach cell saturation where the virus builds enough to become infectious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Many have unknown heart defects yet run a marathon and collapse and die. That’s life, death does occur. However we know now that 98 percent of people who died under the age of 65 had severe underlying heath conditions. Severe is not being obese or having asthma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope Agreed but again that’s try to protect everyone. We simply can’t. I know many not getting chemo due to current hospital restrictions. What do we say to them. What about the people who need surgery for hernia repair? People die from hernias also (not a well know fact)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryBrindisi @conor_pope So which that in mind the restrictions should be far less than first imagined. I agreed with the 1st lockdown based on what was know one the time. We know more now and there is no case for further lockdowns, the WHO changed stance based on the evidence, NPHET must do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryBrindisi @conor_pope Yes Orla, no doubt it is still dangerous. The same as every other virus or disease. The flu mortality rate varies between .1 to .3. This article suggests different mortality rates depending on age however the mean is .3. My overall point is it’s far less deadly then thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope One other solution to aid this - give healthcare workers the option to restrict movements and pay them 5 to 10k tax free for the lack of life. The ones that subscribe can look after the elderly who require homecare or nursing home care. Time to think outside the box<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orla_Woodz @SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope That’s true Orla, but if it spreads in the community like the flu the majority of people are completely fine (bar the days of sickness). At the moment at risk groups should be isolated (right now) so opening the community up should not change their position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joanienibhrian @kiliandoyle @conor_pope rules are for everyone else except me. I had a patient the other day (elderly) who I watched mingling with his friends, no social distancing. Then talked to me about the young people having parties.. I pointed it out.. ‘sure I know them from mass, they won’t have covid’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 The other point is now more and more data is indicating that covid is less sever or similar to the flu. These are mainstream peer reviewed articles. Here is one and you can check our CRO or hspc which has the same general findings.  https://t.co/zea5janalh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 The majority of children who contract covid have no symptoms or extremely mild symptoms, less than .2 percent get a sever disease associated with covid. For some unknown reason child to adult transmission is extremely low.  https://t.co/SaiCTwTLDB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWagner1 @ANoble63393050 The UK is becoming a police state under their a clear nationalist party. Worrying times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conor_pope The data is overwhelmingly saying this virus is turning out less dangerous than the flu. Below is a new peer review paper from the WHO, the data matches our own CRO figures. NPHET need to accept lockdowns are no longer required. It’s hard to change course, make them!!  https://t.co/bALTJga4wO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The science initially got it wrong which is ok. There was no data only predictions. Now we have the data it’s clear this virus is no worse then the flu, this data matches that of Ireland (CRO). We need to change course!!! #COVID19 #IrelandLockdown #NPHET  https://t.co/w6fmpcJA0e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenny1andonly Mad - who is she?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahLu70845564 @conor_pope I agree, but it’s time for personal responsibility. If they want to be ‘covid idiots’ let them. It’s their heath and their death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VSWIFTPF @conor_pope At this stage the social experiment is not working. Just open up like Sweden, we all know the risks, if you’re worried about heath stay at home, we need provisions to work from home legally, and keep the old and frail in a bubble. Keep testing and tracing (improve the system)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adrianfleming1 @conor_pope Your delusional - planes packed? The airlines are being bankrupt, closing bases and pilots and cabin crew are on mass layoffs. Cop on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiliandoyle @conor_pope In France they have a culture now embedded where they mind their own business - this is due to many of their neighbours being killed by nazis due to people ‘reporting’ each other..... just saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mairecait_nic @conor_pope @DrZeroCraic Because u can’t lock people up, destroy people’s lives and expect them to follow calmly. One point allot of the people who judge don’t get is... it’s easy to judge when your saving money while u watch others  loose their house and/or job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @AndyMcCourt32 @conor_pope @DrZeroCraic First you can’t break guidelines, can can just not follow them. Second we don’t know what guidelines are being broken. The problem with NPHET is they have no plan, lockdown for what, to get covid below what? R1? Ireland is not using qualified metrics. Let’s get sensible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent article re representatives calling out the complete lack of evidence for lockdowns and REPRESENTING workers. A far cry from #Ireland.

<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump So even if he did nothing the economy would have kept going. And there is Russia, there is no doubt that he colluded with a forging power. That in its self should go against every American core.   https://t.co/8eBxSjwPc6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert99633274 @realDonaldTrump My point Robert is that he is so corrupt he has to go, even if he did some good for us, which is doubtful.

<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar And just to add to that. The INMO managed to accept a pay decrease and increase working hours since I left. No other union would stand for the crap, my union now doesn’t and believe me it works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar Believe, It’s not an assumption. I actually got out of it and retrained as I saw what a farce it was. Hard work, extremely skilled work, need a huge knowledge base, but paid shit. I got out and would advise all to do them same until the pay increases. But the inmo are useless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miamul13 @CMOIreland @roinnslainte @HSELive Yeah essentially they are using isolation rooms as non available on the ward - blocking beds for people that really need them. Don’t get me wrong, they need to be in hospital, generally people over 65 who didn’t take this virus seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markylux @bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar To be fist to mark he’s correct, but the point his missing... most nurses do the job for the love of helping others. That is not a reason to use and abuse them!!! And it’s certainly not a reason to knock them down when they are seeking improvements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely throw out, otherwise it gets nasty! #DumpTrump #VoteBidenHarris2020 #GOPSuperSpreaders #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlue2020 #VOTETheWayYOUSeeIt #VoteHimOut2020  https://t.co/pezabD52Xf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libertfree1 @SpaceStrauss @TheEconomist Maybe you need to think what freedom actually is. I don’t advocate for a Chinese model however America is not much different. Sometimes canaries have an illusion of being free. Btw, have u ever been to China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar But to be honest Bert, this is why nurses won’t get paid more, it’s not the governments fault, their job is to pay you the least amount possible while ensuring people are there to work... the actual problem is nurses and their representatives. You have to fight, and fight hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar I have no doubt about the work behind the scenes, however work doesn’t equate to results. There is a problem when your doing that amount of work, yet you allow your members to start work at less than a luas driver. (No disrespect to the luas driver, just they have a good union)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INMO_IRL @bertflynnxx You would want to a bit more than call for it - withdraw labour until you get it. Btw what are u doing about nurses only getting surgical masks when FFP2 masks are supplied to our EU colleagues. Another failure by the INMO to add to the list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx @INMO_IRL @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar Bert unfortunately your union are doing nothing for you. It’s been like that for the past 20 years and they did absolutely nothing -<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@libertfree1 @TheEconomist Yeah ok.... nice take on it, I think they eat bats because they like to eat bats, they eat spiders also, but notice how they don’t have a problem with obesity. Anyway I prefer my Big Mac.... but other strokes for different folks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@agapanthus49 @PaulStonehous15 Yeah u were already open...... you have just set yourself’s back about 30 years.... anyway we both have different points, and yours will never change. So let’s leave it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx Underpaid and it’s basically because it’s a female profession. Their union @INMO_IRL has allot to answer for. Really a nurse should be starting on 35k like all the other degree courses. For students, they need to be paid at least 13:50 with is the same as a nurse assistant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertflynnxx What I don’t understand is why a nurse who competes 4 years of uni and gets a BSC starts at 27.2k, dental hygienists (2 year diploma 35k, dietitian (4yr Degree) 35k, ecg technician (6 week course) 27k... nurse do ECG’s anyway and it goes on.. point being, nurses are highly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmzcee @bertflynnxx Aldi is 12.50 an hour<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CMOIreland @roinnslainte @HSELive a very insular approach. I’m a HCP and see the devastation caused for ppl with other illnesses.

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie @rtenews @irishexaminer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s the same in Ireland, unfortunately we don’t have any journalists doing their job. They are happy to use NPHET sound bites with no investigation. How many covid patients are ventilated in ICU? Not just in ICU? #COVID19 #IrelandLockdown #level5 #COVID @IrishTimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiscePuer @MaryKenny4 No of course not, when people are in waiting rooms they in clothes with nothing exposed. When u sit in a clinic seat, the person before has wounds open, eyes prodded, bodily fluids. Get real please and stop being argumentative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flynn_dec #AllInThisTogether? Yeah right. I am a public service worker, again after losing my job in the private sector. I think we should tax everyone at 100 percent and then given everyone over 18 yrs 500 euro a week. That’s being in this together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 I only saw one person getting verbally aggressive and it want the host<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiscePuer @MaryKenny4 Yes they do clean the waiting room? Are people now calling to stop cleaning and infection control in hospitals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @NTBreakfast Here’s a tip tip - just don’t do them, or do them if only really necessary. ie no access to hospital ICU care. We are so focused on cases which are not compared to anything meaningful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKenny4 Hi Mary, in the hospital we clean most things in between patients to prevent infection. Not just covid but MRSA, c-diff and a while host of other nasty infections<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpaceStrauss @TheEconomist problem is we may  never ever know when China first knew.... but it’s a different culture and people need to recognise that.

<|startoftext|>@libertfree1 @TheEconomist you have missed the whole point... why blame China for not telling anyone (for 6 weeks) when we were noting going to do anything anyway if we were told... do u think the US would have picked up a new virus never seen before in 6 weeks, sure the president even said it was a hoax.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @drbosheaGP @NTBreakfast Priorities 1) testing that is fast and reliable (ire far behind the EU) 2) tracing fast and more than 48 hours pre symptoms (again ire way behind) 3) increase ward plus ICU capacity (again way behind) 4) STOP spending time in the media and do your dam job!!!!! Let people live<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 @nbrez The problem is they have not implemented a proper test and trade system. Only tracing the previous 48 hours, while actually 5/7 days people are infectious. People waiting 4/5 days for results, people being contacted 8/9 days after contact with suspected case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly The reason we are here is the inept NPHET, to busy on the radio, and not enough time actually implementing the systems required<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Contract tracing is a sham here. People should loose their jobs. Why don’t you start reporting about the complete idiots running the system. They only trace the previous 48 hours before symptoms, despite u being infectious for 5 to 7 days before symptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Well why don’t they have the army doing it???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie 400 people hospitalised? This is nothing, .0001 of our population. Reporters really need to start putting things into perspective and stop the scaremongering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMcGreevy1301 This is going to be known as the biggest scandal of our time, letting the department of heath ‘NPHET’ and the HSE enact policy for the country, not like they ever got anything else right... and Ronan Glynn, very poor cv for the position compared to other European medical advisors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ronan_glynn @DonnellyStephen @HelenRSalisbury @bmj_latest What deeply offends me is your complete lack of understanding of the economy and your crocodile tears 4 those loosing jobs and businesses.

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Yeah where did we hear this before? numbers that never materialise - but what if they did? Spain is running at 10k plus cases per day with a death rate of 3.4 people per 100k. Ireland is at .3 deaths per day per 100k. Is this a reason to destroy an economy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle The propaganda queen is at it again. nice to see those percentages. percentages of what? The United States has one of the highest death rates from covid per capita in the world, only behind Mexico, Peru and third world counties. Yeah we should be proud.

<|startoftext|>@AcerIhr @dbongino Look at the emails.... the dude sent it from a gmail. Like seriously, the guy is supposed to be working for a energy company, don’t u think they have a proper email. Also the FBI are investigating... sure and anyone arrested? No but trumpet cronies are in prison FACT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriotRob3 @dbongino Drain the swamp.... was that not supposed to have happened like over the last 4 years..... looks to me like your swamp just got ‘more bigly’ and actually all of American can now get the stench of pure crap and desperation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardBets87 @dbongino I’m not sure Russia is a respectable way of getting info<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @Twitter @Facebook @nypost You don’t need to send a letter as any person with one brain cell can tell u the answer.....The NYP published an unsubstantiated piece of rubbish  for a mysterious laptop ‘found’  to try and steel the election.... more Russian interference backed by #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>

I don’t look for past leaders to base my beliefs, I look at the present. Trump is decisive and hurtful. #VoteBiden have a good day sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle The above quote was from that article.  https://t.co/7VTbDhqeMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Germany clearly -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Ok James - where do you take your info from? Fox?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Dude wake up. Did you actually watch the debate? Sometimes when you believe in someone so much, which you clearly do, you can’t see the wood from the trees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle  https://t.co/3pHuPb0cWs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Ok can u furnish these writings or point me to them? I would love to see them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Pro life is a religious point. It’s based on catholic’s and evangelical, and other religious views - nobody wants to silence that view. If you believe in pro life don’t get an abortion. But stop imposing your pro life views on everyone. Don’t I see the hypocrisy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Look you seem interesting and would actually like to debate this stuff with you. I agree he didn’t call all Mexicans that, but he inferred that all Mexican illegals are rapists and murders which is simply not true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle But yeah exactly - your close you don’t see it... what has trump relaxed regulation on??? Business and the environment controls which suits him and his friends. How much wealth is in one percent of Americans society??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle  https://t.co/TKndxuokyC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle here is the BBC under 14’s. the British take their history very seriously and don’t edit it. ‘opposition to communism led many landowners and businessmen to support the Nazis – they were seen as the only credible right-wing alternative to the left-wing parties.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Here is a good article explaining the above. I know it’s from the post so u will have a problem with. But you can’t rewrite history to suit a narrative  https://t.co/6VXwtDU3qG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A funny work of fiction by the #TrumpCrimeFamily.

<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS Ok so it doesn’t read anything close to how she talks. but I’ll take your word. Of course FLOTUS wrote this. she went for fruit and veg, auld Donald wouldn’t  even shared the regeneron with her, and we are to believe that the regular people of America will get it for free..sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS Fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie I would prefer that than the utter nonsense of level 3 and 4 in Ireland that destroys local and small commerce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimesPol This can not occur! Is it not enough that years and years of hiding files, denial and suppression occurred. They should be published in the national history museum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent So corrupt. Should read... random repair man handed a box of newly printed and edited documents from an unknown man who looked obese with blondish hair with a strange orange looking face<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another one to add to the #GOPSuperSpreaders event! #Trump even is infecting his children with his disease #TrumpCovid19 #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NY_SpecialK Well the freedom to assemble is questionable under trump with anyone who protects being called terrorists with the possibility of being pulled of the street by a man in military gear with no identification and shoved into the back of a unmarked van. Yes you seen it in America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidjthunder @GovtdontlieNOT Post exposure. NPHET should be ‘gravely concerned’ with their own shit performance and complete incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidjthunder @GovtdontlieNOT At last some sense. Let’s go on and continue to ignore WHO advice on lockdowns. meanwhile test and trace is still shit. HSE only tracing for previous 48 hours before symptoms when you can be infections for 5/7 days before symptoms. People not contacted post exposure up to 3 days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie It’s getting ridiculous. The lockdown was to flatten the curve to prepare. We did no preparing!!! ICU beds still below that of the EU, call for Ireland the greatest hiring flop for unknown reasons. While France puts cities on ‘red alert’ which is the same to Ireland’s level 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Very difficult for the select few who are loosing their jobs while others sit at their ikea desk in the back bedroom and watch on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NY_SpecialK @LindseyGrahamSC Man this guy is just so wrong #VoteBidenHarris2020 and #voteJamieHarrisonSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle built a wall to keep people different out, called Mexicans rapists and murders. promotes the ‘proud boys, a private army (brown shirts) and uses select media or channels to push certain views while calling other media disgusting fake news. Maybe your history is a bit off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle Well James, nazi’s are politically right wing and authoritarian. In Nazi germany the taxes were lowered. Nazi germany de-regularised industry’s for special interests... ring a bell? Trump doesn’t fight for religious freedoms? He’s actually forcing the views (pro life) on many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_K_McGhee @IrelandSave @PLinIrlandia @GovtdontlieNOT Maybe - maybe not. Defiantly not a sheep - I see you spend allot of time with the auld Scientologists.... keep up the good fight. All the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@attybishai @IngrahamAngle No I’m pretty certain I know what they mean - maybe you can elaborate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_K_McGhee @IrelandSave @PLinIrlandia @GovtdontlieNOT Yeah but that’s where under law there is a problem. For a sale to take place there had to be a consented transaction - doesn’t look like yer man was consenting for anything as much as people may feel he is wrong, simply the guy would be stealing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrelandSave @PLinIrlandia @GovtdontlieNOT Well - let’s see, if someone doesn’t want to see you something, which the shop guy said.... u can’t turn around and say I’m taking it but sure ring me for the money....... if you take something that someone told u is not going to be sold to you.... it’s not for sale!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer Who made her an ‘expert’? What qualifies someone as an ‘expert’.seems to be these doctors who like to talk allot and scaremonger suddenly are experts while actual excepts who devote their life to virus, their spread makeup and morbidity get tossed aside.

<|startoftext|>@rtenews Would we not be better to actually put this money into increasing icu beds and bring our hospitals into first world healthcare. If we do this we don’t need to be in level 2/3 as we have capacity to look after people, then those ppl unemployed can get bk to work<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williamhboney1 @flannelly_mike Don’t be so naive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamhboney1 @verahussey Don’t think so.... there are not many people on the dole who just lost their job advocating for another lockdown... the people call for one are the people sitting in their back bedroom working away and the people sitting on the old age pension with no mortgage<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StellRvision She will get in as the reps have the majority. I don’t think she is wrong in avoiding these questions, she is demonstrating the role of a judge, not to be political.

<|startoftext|>@paulinepark Think dems should get behind her. I listed to her day 1, she seems extremely qualified and under oath had said she will be impartial.

<|startoftext|>@ncl_daniel @Independent For people in that age bracket it is no worse than the flu, in fact for the majority in that age bracket it really is less than the flu. Granted this is not the same for people over the age of 65 with underlying conditions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Also where was it tired? Sweden admit they got it wrong initially, and have had no more significant amount of deaths since the initial peak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Not true. Where is the daily testing for nursing home staff? Why are visitors still going in? We are making no effort to protect them. And if family’s want to see their relatives that bad, why don’t they care for them at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Only 3 percent of people who died had no underlying condition and these deaths occurred in the over 70 Agee group. It’s becoming more apparent that further restrictions are not warranted.  https://t.co/xwCGam5F6I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes It’s time the facts are data are really reported without the drama. It’s clear from the CSO that the majority of society has no reason to fear C19, with it is clear we need to protect the over 70’s and those with underlying conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlistairHaimes Time to start reporting the facts in Ireland. It’s clear the way to beat this is immunity but exposing the young with no underlying conditions  https://t.co/xwCGam5F6I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood And old means over 70 - it does affect some under 70 but these generally have a major underlying condition. Main story, there is no issue in the cases numbers going up, as long as we keep our elderly protected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood I think Andrew all this data is very good, however it is highly important to point out that although there is a large increase in cases - namely in the lower age bracket there is a corresponding decrease in mortality. It is clear this virus is generally only dangerous to the old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Andrew thanks for sharing. Just to note that 95 percent of people who died had a underlying condition, with 3 percent not reported and only 2 percent have no underlying condition. Here is the link  https://t.co/xwCGam5F6I<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@President_MU You would also know that covid patients in ICU due to lack of General covid beds. Many in icu not requiring an ICU bed and not even on a vent but these numbers are included as a ICU admission<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@President_MU Once again you are scaremongering and not preventing facts... the death rate had increased. Yes from 0.3 per 100k to 0.4 . Time this shit is called out by the main news streams @RTÉ news @IrishTimes @irishexaminer   https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie The ‘growing concerns’, ‘significant concerns’ and ‘ongoing concerns’ have been presented daily for the last number of months.

<|startoftext|>A bit of comfort seeing true leadership, making hard decisions based on the cake and not just a slice.

<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM Yes. Defiantly wasn’t helped by NPHET leaking letters to the press before cabinet got the courtesy of reading it.   One thought for the level 5 people. Ok let’s all be in this together. During lockdown, tax everyone 100% and everyone gets at a universal payment of the sum divided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior Clinical setting. Doctors make good doctors and save lives but are horrific managers and strategists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior 9) increases nurses aids to reduce nurses requirements on wards and push nurses into enhanced care settings. 10) nationwide data access - xrays, tests etc all common access.  Get these implemented and we would be running at a good pace. Need to take doctors out of MGT and back to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior 5) nursing homes - don’t like 1st placement your going to second 6) increase primary care - bloods, swabs, dressing all in community. 7) all GP’s in primary care team (HSE building) fixed salary. 8) increase responsibility of nurses - same functions and autonomy as USA..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior 1) decrease consultant pay and hire more. 2) consultants work 24/7 like U.K 2) increase diagnostic capacity, eg France electives run from 6am to 23:30 - not closing at 6pm 3) increase bed capacity 4) increase nursing pay to keep them -currently starts at 14 euro an hour - lidl 12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior I don’t disagree with everything you are saying. However healthcare politics pay a major role in the healthcare problem. Overpaid consultants, underpaid nurses, diagnostics shutting down at 6pm for elective scans. The whole system needs a shake up.  https://t.co/4ypiyFlhtQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood @StuartDNeilson Sorry Andrew I missed a link  https://t.co/9f2YefiP2v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes exactly - the same need to happen in Ireland, with an increase in ICU capacity. Lockdowns are having a huge impact On other morbidities. Living with covid is the only option #COVID19 #ireland #level3 #level5 #dublin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeckiePoo @Independent_ie When I mean finished - yeah we won’t all die, but bring yourself back to 2008 to 2016. It is coming again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood @StuartDNeilson And here is another good source. Up to 29 percent with a mean of  12 percent of tests are false negatives. In Ireland we don’t have healthcare professionals swabbing as we don’t have enough, which leads to poor results overall due to poor technique.    https://t.co/XPpJXOyhra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood @StuartDNeilson I don’t know where u got that picture from but in my book I would class it as spreading fake or misleading info.  https://t.co/SYLgRAjBXO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior Perhaps in NPHET (all doctors) didn’t leak sensitive information and send a letter to RTÉ news before the government there wouldn’t be public squabbling. Many problems in the heath service are due to mismanagement, we spend one of the highest proportions of GDP on healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfSuperJunior What crap. Consultants are the problem. Look at the resistance from consultants when new posts were appointed and consults continue to meddle in the appointment of new doctors.  https://t.co/DNjBdwR09s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartDNeilson @andrewflood Yeah we all here about this lag... let the level 3 have an impact, but even so it’s not warranted. The majority of scientists saying that PCR testing is over sensitive and is inflating the results by picking up people who had the disease months ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Andrew what do you work at and is your income directly affected by lockdowns. Many people living in a bubble sitting at a desk in their spare bedroom with no risk to income or livelihood!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes Yes except like everything in Ireland... we come up with the plan but then diverge and fudge it... exactly what happened with a panic call for level 5, then to make it look like we are doing somethings move all to level 3 - the exact opposite of the plan for a local approach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Yeah it’s coming - wait for the recession and still people are calling to move to level 5 for really finish off the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evercurious123 @RTENewsPaulC @DonnellyStephen @DrGavinJennings @morningireland What do u work at? Is your income or job affected by lockdown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelesteMcCreesh @RTENewsPaulC @rtenews @DonnellyStephen @DrGavinJennings @morningireland Yeah all all hope the country is over run with covid and people get sick. What’s. Stupid comment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deirdrefeehily @RTENewsPaulC @DonnellyStephen @DrGavinJennings @morningireland @CMOIreland He didn’t get it. It was sent to the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Perhaps open a new ICU - new beds.... there are many empty wards sitting around the land ready to be opened. Advertise new nursing jobs for ICU  with a 16k ICU pay increase to match that of our junior ministers. You will get many nurses coming back from Australia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BothaBoy @Independent_ie Yeah agreed. We just need to invest highly in our ICU capacity, bring it up to a decent standard of around 16 per 100k which is average from 5.

<|startoftext|>@nycdls What happened to #hilaryclinton is unforgivable. Her presidency was stolen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OFatigue You should sit and watch it to it’s full extent. This is what has happed to the great untied states and it’s still happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Basseyworld I wonder how many #GOP watched this and feel a sense of shame. Letting Russia interfere in the election means they won and the republicans sat back and watched... and they are still winning with #trump dismantling our democracy. #ComeyRule needs to be watched by everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AurtyB Sad - it’s a very good portrait of what occurred and how Russia stole an election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oRyanthehunter And amazing how the Republican Party are actually standing by and letting all this happen. I have lost all respect for the republican leadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleClark Putting lives of secret service men at risk form covid. What is wrong with this man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@over20205 @dbongino It’s an accurate one unfortunately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any republican who cares for America needs to watch the comet files, it all is public record and can be backed up #gop #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VoterSuppression #VoteRed #Biden2020 #VoteBlueDownBallot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericswalwell @Showtime @BillyRay5229 Russia stole the American election.. all the efforts of the FBI and CIA during the Cold War and Russia stole the election and placed a president of the untied states. Republics should be ashamed of what they have done to America. They have stood back and they standby!!! #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nameless_Weevil @andrewflood Also 90 percent of Swedish deaths were in the age profile of people over the age of 70, the majority with sever underlying conditions living in nursing homes  https://t.co/uGZrOuLxur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nameless_Weevil @andrewflood And although this sounds terrible as any death is horrific, 200 deaths per 1million is not a reason to close an economy or lockdown society resulting in delayed cancer care, a stop on operations, developmental delays in children with poor socioeconomic background and more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nameless_Weevil @andrewflood Two things about that... the year is not over, while our covid goes up Sweden’s goes down so the numbers may come closer together. It’s actually 206 more than Ireland. They did get the nursing homes wrong and if they protected them like they are doing now, it would be different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPh35387363 @biden @Pontifex My point is... believe what u will, just don’t be a hypocrite. If you don’t believe in the pope or follow his lead and guidance then your not a catholic. If your not a catholic then that’s fine. Just being a catholic and voting for trump goes not go hand and hand!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulreiddublin @LeoVaradkar @HSELive Front this to level 5???, what clowns are running NPHET.... oh wait the dept of heath and the HSE.... look at their track record, it’s horrific and now we are basing our livelihoods on them. Leo this is where the elected leaders need to stand up and say no more!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@higginsdavidw @DamianGalvin1 NPHET have clearly lost all reason and steer. Nobody is thinking about the wider implications and the severe damage this is doing to society both economically and mentally. Reading their minutes would only make you even more concerned  https://t.co/GQdGbqa4Mw @LeoVaradkar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Per 100k with cases above 10k for more than 7 weeks now 8) no consideration is being given to economy or other fundamental issues . Check the ecdc for full data  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Full alert in France is greater than 500 cases per 100k 5) no other EU country has gone back into lockdown 6) data shows this virus is not as dangerous as first imagined 7) Sweden never had any lockdown and the entire country continues on 8) Spain is only running at 3.4 deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewflood Andrew a few issue with the above. 1) lockdown in April was to ‘flatten the curve’ 2) it was for a unknown outcome with poor data associated to the virus 3) the majority of deaths were associated with nursing homes 4) now we have more data 5) Paris on full alert with bars closed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn How about no levels!!! We need to go to Sweden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie How does the media have access to this before the cabinet has made a decision. NPHET stinks and needs to be disbanded #COVID19ireland #finegael @LeoVaradkar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmurphy_TD People won’t lockdown again. I certainly won’t unless the gov pay my mortgage!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roscommon21 @MichealLehane @rtenews This is an exact reason why they need to disband NPHET. Also how do the public always have their letters!!!! When did the HSE or department of health ever do anything right in this country.... and now we trust them!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichealLehane @rtenews Btw 99 percent of cases are non critical for the people under 60!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eiamw @Independent_ie @LeoVaradkar That may be, however a change is required. FF and FG must be change out of the utter destruction of small businesses. Spain had 3.4 deaths per day and is the ‘worst’ country and yet we lockdown??? It’s madness and a scandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonkirbysthlm This is getting ridiculous!!!! We are destroying Europe with these lockdowns. And nobody is talking about Sweden!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie He’s back with a bang. What the fuck. Who are about jobs or small business. I never thought I would say this but call an election as I’m voting for SF... maybe they might have some sense @LeoVaradkar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is for #Trump2020 #VoteTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway Yes exactly!! That’s why it’s important for every dem to get our and vote and for the black vote not to be suppressed line trumpet did last time #VoteBlue2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory #VoteBidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump Sad really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Trump would prob vote for Biden to get his hands on them... all joking aside this is in poor taste #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Just get out and vote! Never mind the polls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishopMalesic I won’t RT this bishop as I believe it is a disgusting use of the church and the hand of god. What about a man who paid prostitutes? 2) builds a wall against the poor 3) divides 3) seeks violence and chaos. May god have mercy on you and may you seek forgiveness for your sins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesJJRyan He also has opinions about walls  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CatholicsforTrump need to check this out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPh35387363 @biden The pope has said trump is non Christian  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CatholicsforTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @realDonaldTrump The pope has called trump not Christian and refused to meet with pompeo this week as he doesn’t support trump. A real catholic would vote for the right man, Biden  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Yeah you vote for an atheist, a man who had two divorces, a man that paid prostitutes to urinate in a bed, a man the pop has called unchristian. Are u really a catholic?  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lindalewis2022 @realDonaldTrump Linda I think u got it wrong. If your any way catholic you would vote for Biden. The pope has even said his not Christian  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sachinettiyil @CatholicVote Maybe he said that but actions are not the same as words. The pope knows this, a true catholic follows the pope  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephJFlynn1 @cathponeill That’s good. Just don’t vote for him - the pope has said he is not a Christian due to his action. Catholic’s can be catholic and go against the pope  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathponeill @realDonaldTrump Your wrong. The pope said trumpet who builds walls not bridges cannot be considered a Christian  https://t.co/Eg8J6EbOfL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathponeill How maany of these principles does Trump abide by? Mocking the disabled, two divorces, cheating on his wife/wives, mocking Clinton when she had pneumonia, fuelling division and conflict, not caring about protecting environmental policies, and many more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IminHisbook I love that the national catholic breakfast club decided to ignore and not to read a letter from the archbishop. If these were true catholics they could never ignore a bishop, especially not a archbishop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adotri @WiWfb @popcornal @StarTribune I would think then they both the man and the woman should discuss and consent to have a child before having sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Now he’s telling us about end of life care.... there is no end to his knowledge. Where was he for abortion and gay rights... maybe he should go for election? That way he can legitimately spout his crap... and his millions, he’s not running to give it to charity. Sick of this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Ha once a week give your child three crisps. Not 4... 3 and then throw the pack out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Yet they only have 52.2 cases per 100,000 population..... put some perspective on it  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adotri @WiWfb @popcornal @StarTribune You seem to want to inflict your views on women. It’s for individuals to decide, if you don’t like abortion don’t get one. Abortion is between the individual woman, her doctor and her god if she believes. I don’t know your views but I do know people of praise, and so does Barrett<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adotri @WiWfb @popcornal @StarTribune Easy - so check out what people of praise is all about and their views on women - secondly wait for someone to bring another challenge via the courts re LGBT rights, many in play.

<|startoftext|>@RiochtConor2 @CathMurphyTD It’s good that we are starting to talk about other numbers apart from exact cases. However more variables need to be considered. ICU capacity is the main one and we should be focusing on increasing capacity for the winter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie What a crap policy - it doesn’t do anything for the 140k jobs a risk in tourism or at the airports. We need to follow the EU travel system and get this back up and running before irreversible damage occurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaL73741582 @DavidJHarrisJr Eyes wide open as well as my ears! Look what trumpet actually said during the debate. Why do u keep bring up Hilary, that’s 4 years ago, she’s not running... move on!! I listen to what Biden says, he is who is ok the ticket  https://t.co/e4L51ZkWcz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LawEnforceToday What’s funny... you are supporting a president who is trying to bypass law and order, asking proud boys to do your job. He also asked supporters to go watch the polls, which is a federal crime.. u sure you guys are about law and order? Meanwhile Biden wants to increase funding!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneapplebaum Sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Law and order..... yeah sure. The good folk who are in the police will have a harm time in the coming months. First and foremost they must protect the election<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Richard88051075 Dude that is vile - if you had any sense you would know that not all republicans support white supremacy and not all democrats support violence. One thing is true..

<|startoftext|>@marymacTV Or black voter suppression  https://t.co/tgyLHN3rmd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marymacTV Or what about black voter suppression  https://t.co/omY6di4fTw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Is this not the same brad linked to the suppression of black voters in 2016 with trump-et. Amazing how details of it surfaced this week and now he’s gone......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters @Reuters this is not accurate or true - the 10 causes you are talking about actually occurred in Aug. Read the small print in the press release and the perhaps fact check<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson Yes I can agree with that. I did vote for Bush - just can’t bring myself to vote for this man. I do believe it will be the demise of America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson When did we ever have a president talk about elected reps like this?? His job is to heal not incite violence  https://t.co/sb72zRJ74S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson But is it all not under Donal trump as president? Is he no longer responsible for this country as president. He has been the most inflammatory president ever, and it’s not American. This is not America or it’s values<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson Check this out and there is many more like it. Open your eyes and open your mind and smell the bleach  https://t.co/V9KQqGrUc6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson Yeah if you want to believe that go ahead.... it’s just more complicated. The majority of BLM protests are peaceful. The violence can not be condoned but often is not linked to BLM, and all violence is wrong, including the trump supporters going around with guns on the streets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColbyCovMMA @realDonaldTrump Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReginaDo @Brendangleeso Regina your a breath of fresh air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson Also look at all the violence... and all the trucks driving around in procession with people waving flags about... what does that remind u of? When did we ever have people doing that for elections.... this is getting scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson No I think u should read the history part about how hitler came to power... there are striking similarities, first refusing to accept democracy and elections, exactly what trump did at the debate. Second your own personal army, the proud boys, trump asked them to standby....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taliasun0 @bennyjohnson I guess. Why not go support the supreme leader, others did.  https://t.co/p4rLdLeB3f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_RRock_ @IrishTimes No I don’t drink. I wouldn’t like to see anyone die, however that is life. I would like people to get access to cancer care, for people to have surgery and so I can go back to work and pay my mortgage or my family will be homeless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicMvieLuvr @bennyjohnson Tnx (empty words) but please pray for the 208k Americans that died due to trump not taking covid seriously, also pray for the children in cages in ICE detention, pray for the people who don’t get access to healthcare because people don’t pay tax into the system.. it goes on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaBellamy3 @ppeneeds @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I would say they will actually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Democracy wins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Good - however a bit to late for the 200k plus Americans that have died needlessly. You should be ashamed of yourself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_RRock_ @IrishTimes Operating but not as deadly as they are saying 3.4 deaths a day in Spain and its had 10k plus cases a day. I’ll take my chances   https://t.co/WR9V1nZH20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Same but can’t wait to get back home. Just hope the riots have stopped and it’s as I remembered.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Anyway have a good afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS It always come to that when faced with facts. U said Biden did not condemn ANTIFA violence and I sent u the clip where he did. He also condemned all violence ALL during the presidential debate. Really try and open up, it’s ok to change course. Republicans are better than trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS And I got this on fox for u  https://t.co/1AZdVMMbAn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS ANTIFA is not an organisation?!!! It’s an idea or a concept or a belief system which denounces fascism (aka nazis) and perhaps are best a group of decentralised political activists. This is a good explanation  https://t.co/OIykmWru5V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@subsix848 @stacey_rudin @PCRmehole Yeah sorry didn’t see the date on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Denounced the violence and I also do not agree with any violence, however the vast majority have been peaceful protests. Of course he is not going to denounce any organisation looking to end racism (BLM) and neither should u, unless your a self proclaimed racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Ok BLM - this is not a Marxist organisation, it is a organization looking for equal rights and an end to racism (this is good right?) Marxism is about a society with no social classes - this is not what BLM want. Some violence has been attributed to protests, however Biden has<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stacey_rudin @PCRmehole Yeah he did say this and no people have forgotten. However maybe he just got it wrong or maybe the new data change his opinion. The thing with science is it’s evolving...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Ok I really am interested. First I won’t be fighting no, there is to@much violence in America at the moment and no need for it. Really explore this... what Biden policy is Marxist? Now find one he actually is attributed to, not some mad person saying it’s his and what socialism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDrumpf5 @davenewworld_2 #Dentonpc this is a nice shot for u to grab him and lock him up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Donna75588023 @buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Come on... what are u taking about communism???? Like get real, wake up and smell the bleach!!! Do u know what communism actually is? You should read up, then read about fascism - neither are what the republican or Democratic Party stand for but trump does. Country before party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donna75588023 @buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS That’s exactly right! Love America and what it stands for. Democracy - not a president who tells the boys to stand back and standby, not a president who says he will not accept the postal ballots, which btw we never had problems with before for any republican or Democrat POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Oh Cody - your so brainwashed. 1) overseas voting was brought in by Regan and a republican senate. 2) democrats don’t mail ballots, that’s the election office 3) country before party - that’s why I ain’t voting trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Thanks Cody - I know it must be a strange concept for you (bet u don’t have a passport) Americans do live outside of America and we can vote as well... go figure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donna75588023 @buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Shame u can tell your voting for hitler..... anyway if it makes u feed your inner hate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie How every progressive. Nice to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Fox News reporting the same thing. Trumpet did get oxygen on Friday. Dr. Sean Dooley just told the mother of all lies. He should be sacked for lying to the American people!! #TrumpCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Btw fact check - don’t listen to yer man Glynn. He is all spin and no substance. Check the last page of the press brief, the small writing. The 10 deaths u are reporting happened in Aug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Can u define significant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adotri @WiWfb @popcornal @StarTribune That is an issue yes, however it’s not a singular issue. What about LGBT rights?

<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @Allycon3 @FergalBowers @rtenews Like when did our department of health or HSE ever get anything right??

<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @Allycon3 What’s disappointing is that our ‘journalists’ are not reporting the facts @FergalBowers @rtenews just following the NPHET narrative, only 3.4 deaths a day in Spain on average.

<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @Allycon3 That’s true, also we will have numbers taken out depending on the coroners reports, we are placing all likely and unconfirmed deaths into covid stats, only confirmed after a coroner hearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fionamflanagan1 @Allycon3 Well let’s be honest 8 deaths - we are not talking about the plague here or some mad number.... btw did u know that 50 people die each day worldwide from falling out of bed. Just food for thought<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FergalBowers In fairness just shows sloppy reporting and the want to get everything out instantly without any questioning of the facts. It’s why journalism is dying, it’s not fake news it’s sloppy news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anoncatanoncat More trump supporters lambasting a French reporter and insulting France. I guess they forgot where the Statue of Liberty came from.  https://t.co/f0woGzLuwU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WiWfb @popcornal @StarTribune Not just different beliefs.. extreme beliefs. Like hitler and the kkk and Opus Dei. It’s never good to have a person with extreme views in a position of power. Centre left or right is always best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Of course he will - why care about people’s lives when u need to push a judge into the seat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes The probably hoped he would not get symptoms - disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h3h3productions Or course he did. If he pulled out of the debate because he had the rona he would have looked weak and would have polled even worse. This man would do anything to grab onto power.... remind u of anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Walls are bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Maybe he can return himself to after he’s done for  criminal damage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Looks time the whole upper Republican Party will get the rona. Trumpet was a super spreader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CTruthforTrump @POTUS I don’t think he will. He’s still telling people not to wear masks and spent the last year playing it down and saying it would go away. Like wake up and smell the bleach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS How do u fit so@many morons into once place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A clear need to have a good source that give ms honest and balanced info. #VoteHimOut #TrumpCovid #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEconomist Business men/ women are smart. They know the crap being push around is propaganda and not real. A rise in the boys and this type of agenda won’t be good for any business #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yawaru @CNN Fully agree but the headline was comparing AF1 to normal passenger jets. I don’t disagree that trumpet could have got it on AF1, just cnn don’t need to be adding passenger jets to scare ppl as they are not the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willmusic4food @KnoxLightGuy @CNN Yep fully agreed- always wear a mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcFromSpark @CNN Agreed about AF1 but that’s not what the headline says. It’s saying this might translate into a regular cabin. I’ve been a passenger on jets now for months, I’ve worn my mask and taken the sensible precautions same as my colleges. Not one of us has contracted Covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yawaru @CNN  https://t.co/edi3TuevcN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shelli_Rosen @CNN Yep but the risk of getting it on a regular aircraft is lower than in a shopping mall  https://t.co/edi3TuevcN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willmusic4food @KnoxLightGuy @CNN Yes agreed - however this is not the headline of the article. This is comparing airforce one to the average passenger cabin which had been shown to be relatively safe if wearying a mask and with the HEPA filter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilkelly No prob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnoxLightGuy @CNN It’s actually not. Research has shown that with the hepa filter the chance of catching it is really low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Bad reporting. The jet has a HEPA filter. More likely source is the confided space in the chopper with no filter and also the many rooms with no ventilation and close contact (such as hugging) that went on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilkelly It’s possible based to the indication of deaths per age group and to correlate the data but would take a good while. I’m sure the HSPC has it all, just need to publish it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilkelly Here is some additional data  https://t.co/3j6DTdeoMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilkelly U might add the age profile as well..... basically under 65 any risk of dying is close to 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast Not realistic - come back with something plausible. The man got it form not following cdc guidelines and not warning a mask, thinking he was above everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VincentCrypt46 Dose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllenBarryNYT The funny thing is that these donors are prob so far trump leaning they will actually think it was an honour to get covid from trump #WakeUpAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie He’s right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mick96017306 @Independent_ie Well  Mick, we all know now that it’s just advice from the high court case . You don’t even need to restrict movements for 14 days. Just booked a holiday next week. Bring on the sun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie People are waking up to real life, 3.2 deaths a day???!. If we are going by this we would dig up the roads, never drive and maybe commit mass suicide as the risk of death would be possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie What a load of crap. People are waking up to the damage to society. Can’t get an operation, cancer treatments delayed, business shutting down, people can’t pay the mortgage and for what?? Spain has has 15k plus cases for months now and their death rate is running at 3.2 per day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to stop asking for the resignation of other who have a different professional opinion.

<|startoftext|>@OrlaGleans @wolfiewire They always seem to go hand in hand for some reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie This is a disgrace. What ever about disagreeing with their house party’s their is no law stopping them. Any taking their colleges ID that they have to go the uni to pay for them to be returned??? This should go to the ombudsman and @uccstudentcoun should push this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar you are right. More and more counties are seeing the devastating effect lockdown is having on society. A new strategy is needed to live with Covid like Sweden and Belgium #finegael #dublin #ireland #COVID19  https://t.co/qLJElmUxW4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Amazing since they started to get a grasp on how to contact trace they are using it to scaremonger. News flash - they need to be doing this 6 months ago. Perhaps if the HSE did this we wouldn’t have the cases we have now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fotoole @IrishTimesOpEd Trump stands for nothing in Catholicism and I’m sure he’s paid for at least one abortion during his lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catholic’s for trump? Really? Here is the true teaching of the church - helping the poor and stopping tax cuts for the rich. This is not trump #CatholicsforTrump #CatholicTwitter #CatholicChurch .  https://t.co/M8TBl5johj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bocurran @TaylorRMarshall Catholic and trump is bizarrely used in the same sentence. Maybe u need to use that hour to go over the fundamental teaching of the church and then reassess. Be kind to your neighbour, help the poor, don’t turn others away who are in need. Respect your sisters and brothers...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kpaul70 @EvanMcMullin @jeanniegaffigan No to mention the shower he received in bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annonthedl People don’t like facts and don’t seem to listen is mass. What does it mean to be catholic I’m starting to wonder? It doesn’t seem to be about feeding the poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathponeill @CoachLouHoltz88 I don’t see how you can have catholic values and vote for trump. Jesus was not a one issue man, care for the poor and people who have the least, care for your neighbours, call out the injustice and make a difference for peace and stop hatred. I must be going to the wrong mass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@americamag Wake up. A real catholic would not vote for trump, a non baptised man with his obvious past, not to mention the bus incident and who shows such distain towards people in need. If you believe in those values you are not a Christian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEconomist So bizarre.... hard to make sense of this one... id rather vote for an atheist with the obvious checkered history than a baptised catholic with Christian values..... abortion... wake us bishop - the majority of Catholics want individual choice and see the benefit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s allot of caution for something kinda like the flu.  https://t.co/f8tAuLJwDD #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpHasCovid #trump #VoteBlue2020 #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn I’m am sorry to hear that, it must have been a terrible time especially at Christmas. The point is that is your family’s choice and it should be respected, just the same as another family such as Mrs. Forded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Thanks David. I will actually make it business to read the full bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn I think we will have to call it a day... just let people choose. Same with abortions, people live their life. If you disagree... don’t do it, and u can meet your maker in good how u want... it’s just many don’t believe in the maker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Really? U need to go work in a hospital. A cancer death is horrific and painful and can last months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Ok I accept it can be more complicated. let’s just do a simple one - I’m 40, I’m diagnosed with end stage terminal cancer, I want to partake in assisted suicide... can I have that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Ok well then we won’t have a problem as nobody will find a place to do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merrionstreet @fiannafailparty 1 Taoiseach 15 cabinet ministers and 200k unemployed #openthecountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn No, not when someone is making the choice in the full knowledge of their actions and who is suffering a disease leading to eventual death. Just to be clear it was correct for  Mrs Forde not to make a choice within the law?  https://t.co/CvAqlMSoi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn I just don’t understand u. It’s a choice... if you want to suffer and die, go ahead. It’s not mandatory to go for assisted suicide. Why do people always feel the need to dictate what other people can do. I’m David was the same about gay marriage. Just leave people alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Complete different argument. This is about having the right in full compos mentis to decide to end your life to forgo months of suffering to a certain death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Sorry ‘dude’ or non ‘dude’ - first can we establish that the article input forward as proof actually is about a girl who died due to anorexia? Not assisted dying ??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn Oh yeah? Where is the evidence of that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Yeah Dave, there is a difference. People with mental heath issues who want to be helped and those who have an excruciating illness leading to certain death, perhaps while in a bed wearing nappies. I know what I will be doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Yeah they may we’ll be, however the EVIDENCE from the rest of the EU is saying it has no material effect on that age group. Less than .4 percent change of dying, and as for the last scaremongering tactic.... the majority greater than 98 percent make full recovery in 10 days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD Simon can u explain how France had a excess of 8k cases for more than 8 weeks and yet the death rate is steady. Why are other EU countries open. Why is Belgium saying no more lockdowns. Spain is open. Why is Sweden having less cases? And the facts..  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@udippy @SimonHarrisTD You don’t need to be in lock down. Look at France and Spain. Record number of cases for weeks and Spain’s average death rate is 3.2 people per day. It’s Madness to close a country for that level of deaths. The same logic u would pull up the roads and we would all walk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marinabragaa @CNN Yeah sad to see. However I personally have reduced eating meet, stopped shopping at big giants like ikea etc who cut down huge amounts of forests and reduced my car to a 1.2 engine. We all need to stop consuming. We can solve this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerry2623 @bbarrymurphy @CarlMullan @Ryanair @AerLingus Jerry such rubbish.... it’s head office is the big building with the shamrock ☘️ on it... I think it’s actually called shamrock house, that’s where the Aer Lingus CEO....the Irish man Doyle from cork sits.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN What is wrong with this country???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire @the__NIJ Does he not have a stutter, this clearly leads him to have these moments. It’s a disgrace that you are using this against the man. You should be ashamed while he is going good  https://t.co/hENRDajtXR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nb_12_21 @RTE_PrimeTime  https://t.co/jD4Kjqm8Zc . What scientific paper is Sam producing???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nb_12_21 @RTE_PrimeTime Completely Disagree. He put forward logic that many scientists have, he is (was another disgrace) top doctor in the HSE and he rationale is clear and back up by facts. Sam and his naive zero covid..one gleaming issue.. NI, the border and the fact their flights to London are full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTE_PrimeTime This man is a hero! Bring him out more and put him in to lead NPHET.... it is so enlightening to hear someone put that idiot Sam and his ideas back in his box, perhaps someone will then ship his box to the faro islands when he can live in his Narnia. He is a disgrace!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rtenews @sharontobin @DublinAirport Let’s hope the gov sign up to that pan European travel system. We need to be able to travel around Europe and then test the people coming in from high risk countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerry2623 @CarlMullan @AerLingus @Ryanair Good for u!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerry2623 @CarlMullan @AerLingus @Ryanair Thank the gov - sure why don’t they all fly empty so u can watch them in the sky... how many flights have u been on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbarrymurphy @CarlMullan @Ryanair @AerLingus Yeah both are registered in Ireland and pay tax in Ireland - Aer Lingus flights all depart from Dub/ cork or Shannon. Both are owned by shareholders - Ryanair on the London stock market and IAG on the Spanish.....:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kennyrileyii @DrShayPhD Maybe watch the video? Cambridge analytical is well documented and it’s a fact.... no getting around it, it happened. Open your mind and be ready to think critically. No point in denying everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kennyrileyii @LacyJohnsonMN Ha that’s so childish - I don’t care about what people did 100/200 years ago. I live in the present and in the future. What has he done? Have the number of black men going to prison decreased? Or name a policy that he introduced that specifically targets black communities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fillmoregurl @AttorneyCrump Yeah it’s terrible. I feel for u, I actually can’t imagine the situation. Let’s hope people get out and vote and then some actual real change starts to happen. so many issues. However I do believe it’s by engaging, talking and reducing hate that progress will be made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fillmoregurl @AttorneyCrump I didn’t say ‘these people’ so don’t quote that. I said people, both black and white people in America seem to have so much hate, it’s not the answer. I get that the lady would be annoyed and angry. However I don’t think berating the teacher is going to bring change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edrushpilot @gongsta66 @SenSanders Good point in fairness - how much company tax have they paid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSanders It’s amazing how people bought into the fact that they are better if paying taxes, getting no healthcare while allowing the top 1 percent to make all the money and get away without paying anything. This is brainwashing at its best!!! #TrumpSupporters #GoPats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire @the__NIJ Well thankfully a bit of sense. Like #DefundThePolice ? What? No they need to change how they police and maybe redirect money into community policing instead of buy high grade weapons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews #onlyinAmerica . They seriously need to restrict guns in that country  instead of quoting some ideals constructed over 100 years ago.... when u think about it. Deferring to the ideas of men who didn’t know everything we do today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Seriously need to implement the EU traffic light system in full with on special Irish amendments that we seem to do so well.

<|startoftext|>@LeeColenso @nytimes Just tax them - all good bought online. 20 percent should do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph Nice commitment - action required<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes The only way is a tax on imports from online shops. Retail outlets provided many advantages, from local employment to keeping towns alive. Spread the wealth and allow small business to continue. Tax the giants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agriculture_ie @hpscireland I can’t bring my family in never mind  a pet........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie Good a bit of sense. We need to ramp up testing and also get our ICU beds to meet the capacity of our EU neighbours. How many does Germany have per 100k population compared to us? This would be better than living for daily NPHET briefings about how concerned they are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We needed a study to tell us this? I wonder why, a selected few doctors have raised to fame, our journalists are all over them.... word for word, taken down and disseminated without any questioning all for the greater good? It’s not fake news just Journalism is dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer I’m not going to read this as it’s the same stuff we have been pushed daily. I actually could take a article from last week and to replace this one and u would never know the difference. I’m sure Ronan is concerned and @SamuelMcConkey1 must be in there somewhere scaremongering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews @ZaraKing Can you please start reporting per population.... otherwise these figures mean nothing except examples of scaremongering. This is how a proper heath surveillance team reports figure. Maybe start asking questions instead of just listening and spreading.....  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes I really liked the example of the fluent German speaker from a German school, with German parents getting a B instead of the A she was awarded....... What ever happened to that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychologis1234 @thetimesscot @thetimes Disciplined or not it’s up to individuals now to take personal responsibility. The summer months would have been ideal for this approach, winter will not be pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @Helen_Whately @KayBurley She really is an excellent interviewer...... we need more like her. Pushing politicians to say it clearly and without spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the__NIJ @Independent Yeah I would agree with you if it only required a little energy. Unfortunately u could send one of these believers to space to see the shape of the earth, however they would come back listing all the methods which u used to trick them.... more conspiracies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the__NIJ @Independent I would waste my time on these people. They clearly have issues bigger than believing the world is flat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump A vote for Biden is a vote for democracy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Let’s hope the good sensible people of America bridge the gap under Biden and get back to being the great country that they were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMcCourt32 @Fraggle241 @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Yeah true about it’s never the time. They do need to get pay increases however some jobs in the civil service (not all) are well over paid. There is a value of having a job for life with a pension that never seems to be factored in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald The tax payers who paid for years before their job was redundant due to gov policy. It’s only when your in the system u see how mush is going out on a weekly basis... HAP, single mother, dole, disability, child allowance. The whole system needs a redo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMcCourt32 @Fraggle241 @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Don’t think many private workers are getting pay rises now, look at the Aer Lingus cabin crew. It’s not a time for pay rises, the public sector needs to reflect reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mick96017306 @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Agreed that they are not sensible, the most restrictive in Europe... but who pays for it? The people who just lost their job paid for it in their taxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan @PCRmehole @MaryLouMcDonald Yeah agreed or what about France. 75 percent of your salary for 2 years if u loose you’re job. You pay your taxes of this type of scenario. 2 years to downsize your house or look for a new job.. and it forces ppl to work, as if u don’t pay the tax u don’t get the benefit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah07085023 @rtenews Hi Sarah, these figures are correct however you can have higher than those set above provided the positivity rates is below 3 percent. This accounts for those countries who test more. Example is France who test 400/500 more per day per 100k population<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah07085023 @JaydonFC @rtenews we should just copy the Germans. Do everything they do and disband NPHET and the rest of the clowns at the HSE who never manage to do anything right... smear check... breast check.. trollys in A and E.. 2 year waiting list for operations, and we let them loose on covid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah07085023 @JaydonFC @rtenews Yes your right, although they don’t have to isolate if the get tested and have a negative result. U can get a rapid test at the airport. Makes complete sense. We should do the same here to allow the travel and tourist industry to open up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EnterprisesJm @rtenews No not at all. I’m saying there are 15 counties with less cases than  https://t.co/hhKTrdxCOy can look here and it’s an official site. It’s important to get the facts @rtenews is very disappointing in not reporting the bigger picture  https://t.co/WR9V1ohiqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgyleLoz I read recently in the express that #brexit spoofs were saying that loads of car manufactures will move to the uk. Guess they were wrong again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Facts4euOrg Still spouting crap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickkeca Not sure if it’s project fear...more like project reality. I remember seeing a farmer campaigning for #BrexitShambles before the vote... thought it was the most stupid thing anyone relying on exports to Europe and EU farming subsidies could ever do. No you will get what you want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydonFC @rtenews Not in Germany or France or many actually. Ireland is pretty much unique in that respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be great to be traveling on #Aerlingus again. I can’t wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie How many are related to stating irrelevant covid numbers without any comparisons to the population and other countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another effect of covid madness. The heath of our population is suffering in other ways. Time to get back to as close to normal as we can and ignore the hysteria caused by @SamuelMcConkey1 and CO. Ask then to explain #Sweden with using the word but.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews What a joke.... it’s actually unbelievable. There are 15 counties in Europe all with lower covid that’s Ireland, so they are safer than here. Germany and Italy both removed despite both having less than 40 cases per 100k compared to our 78 over 14 days. Destroying our economy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nealerichmond Nice to see someone who is articulate rubbish her #brexit propaganda. It’s hard to explain when someone calls out your bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdpoc Don’t forget all the money the NHS will get when it’s bought by the Americans - they could try spin that as a #brexit benefit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent I suppose the Swiss have more educated people than those that voted for #brexit in the uk. It’s a shame more #BrexitReality was not available back then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiGuys1 @CNN Can u point me in the direction of trumps healthcare package. Details... I have never seen one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FintanYTWalsh @EmmettOBrienIND I think people are sick of the scaremongering. We all have access to the data and can make our own minds up. Look at France, 5k cases at least per day for last two months and only 1.2 days per day over the last 14 days, Spain is at 3.1 per 100k population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiGuys1 @CNN Why would you not want access to healthcare? You people are bizarre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776Brigade @CNN Why would you not want access to healthcare? People are bizarre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wirereporter People are seeing sense now. They realise that they were sold a pup by #trump and #brexit by #bojo . This nationalism is bringing only fear, hardship and people are saying no to it. #eu is back on track<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Masks to be worn instead of cloth, not saying take them off?? So you agree with face masks, just the surgical type and not cloth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Yeah don’t have time to read this one fully in detail. But again it’s about healthcare workers in a high risk setting and pathogens from the environment passing the mask and infecting the worker. It’s not about face masks making the workers ill. They are advocating for surgical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 U need to read the articles and review in a critical manner. The first thing u learn when studying research. This one has several issues (a long time to go over them all), a varied purpose and does not conclude anything but this  https://t.co/WM3EHxRhSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Sorry I thought we were having a convo of not wearing masks as they spread infection for the user... my bad if we were not a accept fully that masks could carry bacteria which could infect an open wound or someone who is immunosuppressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Yeah to prevent surgical sites becoming contaminated not to protect the user... you can actually double mask to push that out longer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the @greenparty_ie doing about this. It’s as if they are asleep at the wheel  https://t.co/y86rf6Ydr1 #environment #fishing #protectnature #nature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Nowhere does it reference any harm to the user or do they try to correlate anything of the kind. So what’s the point in posting it, to prove bacterial infection exists when operating.... yeah we all know that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @GeorgeOB11 @SaraHaboubi1 Thanks for your encouragement.... so again the problem with the likes of you getting your online degree from twitter is your complete inability to read, interpret and apply research... this article is referring to bacterial spread from the face mask to the surgical site<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bl_byrne @paddylepage Covid is obviously hitting Pats pockets.... who the fuck is pat Byrne?? And why would anyone give a rats ass what this old man thinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France has more then 5k cases a day for last 8 weeks and deaths just are not happening, they are running at .4 deaths per 100k population over last 14 days. Where is the doom?? #COVIDー19 #ireland #dublinlockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes ⁦@rtenews⁩ that’s the problem.. there is no impending doom coming despite the news trying to convince everyone.  https://t.co/rJwLoiwvVG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeOB11 @FowlerProf @SaraHaboubi1 To go back to surgery.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeOB11 @FowlerProf @SaraHaboubi1 Well no your incorrect.... that’s the problem again, you see one thing and you think you know everything.... yes I am unemployed (in current role due to covid) after changing careers 10 years ago. But yes I spent 15 years in surgery FYI, I am back in uni getting back up to speed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Scared me arse..... try an American ICE detention centre and u will know all about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FowlerProf @SaraHaboubi1 What’s grown is what is actually in your mouth already. We have immune systems that take care of the billions of microbes in and around our body. Wearing a mask has not I’ll effects, I and my colleagues have been wearing them for years in surgery with no issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FineGael Not impressed. This is American styled bullshit.... doesn’t fit in Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InfojJohnson @SineadIreland_ that is clearly what not what is going on here. world is disgusting because it’s fuelled by this stuff.... anger and hate and everybody trying to out do another.I would have the respect for my mum not to put this on the internet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie This man actually needs to step away! Of course people who were in ICU on a vent are going to have problems for months after, the same with nearly all who go into ICU. doesn’t mean that the vast majority who have a mild case will have any further issues. He is scaremongering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyroneGoldberg3 @SaraHaboubi1 @PCRmehole Ha delusional as well.... yeah of course the gov pay people to correct the rubbish that people like u spout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraHaboubi1 Yeah why don’t u breath on a Petri dish or just swab your hand..... will grow the same. So sick of u self certified scientists after a week of reading shit on twitter.... people do degrees in this stuff so they won’t spout this crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyroneGoldberg3 @SaraHaboubi1 @PCRmehole Yeah why does it always come down to the followers..... again another stupid thing to say.... imagine being back in school where popularity seemed to matter... I guess for some it still does<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyroneGoldberg3 @SaraHaboubi1 @PCRmehole Such rubbish.... clearly u have never been in surgery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimesPol Well that makes sense.... Ireland may have finally copped on to what the rest of Europe do.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie What maybe is a disgrace is that the are forced to close, all the staff.... how will they get paid.... the suppliers? Untold damage to@our livelihoods due the ridiculousness of #lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie He’s so right, Ireland is a mad place to live, high tax, yet nothing in return. You need private healthcare if u can afford it. Meanwhile if you earning less u get HAP, child benefit the dole and medical card.... so it’s actually better to not work<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdavidbull I not sure people need to be represented by the news. News stations should just push the facts and the reality of a story, that’s what journalism is about. Just because u don’t like the news doesn’t mean it’s wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babsbear @paulreiddublin @HSELive Babs nobody is arriving and the airlines and going to fail.... he would be better to get some more icu beds up and running and start testing people at the airport to get travel going again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickBarryTD @ingridmileyRTE @suzannesherry4 @madelinewhelan Where is @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD and our justice minister @HMcEntee who all said they understand the #Debenhams workers plight.... yet they do nothing and stand back and let @kpmg trample on the jobless<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Fuck right off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @unherd David it’s the only place in Europe doing allot of things, only place locking down a capital, only place not giving liquidity to airlines, only place with the strictest travel policy...... we need to get real<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ACslater0 @MlMcNamaraTD @LeoVaradkar Or reduce capacity and then the whole country will suffer... reduced tourism, FDI hindered.... I get your point, and agree, but focus on the country not just cork and Shannon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACslater0 @MlMcNamaraTD @LeoVaradkar O you missed it. Dublin is equally is in bad shape compared to cork and Shannon. The airports are not really the issue it’s the airlines flying into them..... Dublin is operating at 10 percent capacity. Airlines won’t be able to get they going for long, they will collapse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACslater0 @MlMcNamaraTD @LeoVaradkar Dublin airport is in bits. Why are people always referencing Dublin??? Is pathetic, all our airports and airlines need liquidity fast, every other EU country has provided it except Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @Paschald @PatKennyNT Yes true the initial response was excellent to covid - now it’s all over the place, 6 months on travel industry is on its knees, Aer Lingus staff can pay petrol to get to work, pubs and restaurants closed in Dublin. They have lost it and need to open the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Same as Germany. Sweden is now doing very well. Although France has been running at 1000 plus cases since July and no massive surge of deaths.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes it would be nice for a bit of critical thinking here in the article.

<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Now it’s not the pubs, schools or travel, it’s people having fucking communions........ we have closed the country so kids can be dressed up and get a bit of cash<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Also have damaging developmental effects on young children. It will be hard to say for many but it looks like Sweden got for the most part things right, they admit themselves that they did not protect the elderly and nursing homes initially but that has since changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejournal_ie This is a disgrace. The man should resign for spreading such blatant misinformation @LeoVaradkar. This is directly at off from worldwide statistics and also are own heath surveillance. Their incompetence is increasingly showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Im sure he had a significant concern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @ShaneBeattyNews Did anyone else notice everyday since May there has been a headline from #NPHET with significant concerns, very concerning or they are just plain concerned...:.:.. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO Here also. Just another point of view apart from the one that we are all going to die. I know im sick of the regular few coming out and inciting fear when there rest of Europe seems to have moved on  https://t.co/vVcEqClzHv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO You act like everyone who gets covid dies. If you get covid and are under 65 there is a 1 to 2 percent chance of dying. Which is very similar to the flu.... it’s not rational that you close a country for a small number of increase deaths. What you make of Belgium?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What PR. He talks about it as if it’s here and ready to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO But can you work from home or are you a cabin crew/ ground staff that needs to be physically there?

<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO it’s not making money to buy a   https://t.co/OcUbWLfKLL’s to keep a roof over my head. if your not working how to you pay for mortgage? You in a council house or HAP? Or maybe u have a job u can work from home. I think it’s easy to have your point of view if you’re not effected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO work from home? You can also hone school your children if your so concerned. My points is everyone has different situations, your big enough to make your Owen decisions in life, just because your partner (and others) is at risk doesn’t mean the whole country should shut down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonoOneill07 @Sonpett1 @NewstalkFM @WHO Yes same as mine. Kids in school, which is better for them developmentally. In terms of getting covid, we have taken responsibility. Reduced social contacts, wear masks in shops.. that’s all we can do, time to move on, we need to live, need to earn money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Never thought I’d actually agree with this man...... but this times it’s not fake news. That’s exactly what the statistics are saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobyMcGuire8 @PatriciaGaffne5 @SamuelMcConkey1 No I don’t think we should be listening to one single person as they all have different views.

<|startoftext|>@silenced_wont2 #defundrte<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen Lucky us, as I’m sure we will be requiring the EU or WHO to pass it our direction. It won’t be Ireland hoarding or have the cash to buy wast amounts of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miesha6107 @fibromy @paulreiddublin @DrValerieMorris @HSELive No I don’t think that’s the problem. The problem is we are not testing and finding it it the community and isolating people. I do agree that they have lost it again... it’s run away. Now we have lockdown destroying economy and people’s lives, mentally, economically and physically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hakaman @BillGladstone8 @Rock_IRELAND And finally... they made one million more people living in the country than we do. Look at home many they have tested compared to us..... three times more. I would go into case fatality ratios and positivity rates but might be to much, any both far better in Denmark  https://t.co/NTgvAwlgs6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hakaman @BillGladstone8 @Rock_IRELAND And then ‘higher Daily rates’ than they ever did..... yeah that’s not saying much without comparing and considering their economy is fully open and life is normalish... so fully open and only 8 more daily cases than us per 100k population  https://t.co/8UvCmwTrbm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hakaman @BillGladstone8 @Rock_IRELAND I have to disagree, if you read the article, and compare them to us. We have no inbound travel, the capital is closed, no outdoor gathering at sports, pubs and nightclubs been closed for 6 months. Now the article.. the are reducing outdoor gather to 500 and restricting nightlife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValWebster @paulreiddublin @HSELive Because this is the real problem, their incompetenceZ#. But easy to blame the population, the bars etc. No the real blame is we have a shit testing and tracing system. If we had a good one, Ireland would be open like many other Eau countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fibromy @paulreiddublin @DrValerieMorris @HSELive No.. kids are in school in Denmark and Germany. Our problem is we don’t have a proper test and trace system in place. Germany and Denmark followed the WHO guidance, anyone can get a test, symptoms or no symptoms, quick turnaround, tracing comprehensive. Our is far away from that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillGladstone8 @Rock_IRELAND Why compare them to their neighbours. Do you compare Ireland to them too? Denmark is fully open to international travel, pubs and restaurants all open... low covid and low deaths.... so what are we doing wrong?? Oh yeah we dismantled our test and trace system instead of preparing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulreiddublin @HMcEntee @HSELive Paul maybe get of Twitter and do your job. we have the worst test and trace in Europe. the first lockdown was to prepare for second wave, of u did perhaps we would not be here. Don’t forget u dismantled the test and trace in June.. unlike Germany who increased it.. it’s open now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rtenews Why - they drove bu it when it was going and decided to do nothing..... it will those Garda get disciplined<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @kierancuddihy @TheHardShoulder Or we just move on.... follow in Sweden’s footsteps. They only have 20- more deaths per 100000 than we do.... not sure it’s worth it all. Then we have the every life matters, they should go and live one one or the islands of the west coast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @PatKennyNT I think people need to challenge him about his incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZRahnama @newschambers My point is after the first lockdown, all of Europe opened up to travel, pubs and restaurants protecting jobs, where Ireland did not. Germany’s and Denmark and Italy post initial stage are now models of how to deal with this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZRahnama @newschambers No unfortunately u cannot do that as those numbers are per 100k, for example Germany has close to 10,000 deaths where as Sweden has 5000. But that’s beside the point, I accept that the initial lockdown was constructive to get thing prepared for next wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZRahnama @newschambers Finland 6 deaths per 100k. So Sweden with no lock down al all is only 20 deaths per 100k people than Ireland. Germany, Denmark, Norway and Finland all did lockdowns, but have been open for travel since mid June with pubs and bars open.... make your conclusions if u can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZRahnama @newschambers Absolute rubbish. This is the problem, when confronted with fact, people like you go off into fantasy land.. However yes they did have more deaths than Norway, Denmark and Finland if you want to compare. But the order is Sweden 57, Ireland 36, Germany 11, Denmark 10 per 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZRahnama @newschambers Why are u comparing them with their neighbours as opposed to us? Btw their neighbours have opened up, Norway and Denmark and Finland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newschambers Oh Richard... will u stop the scaremongering. Why not focus on Sweden, now lower covid than us... many their approach worked. Or maybe Denmark or Germany, both lower covid that us, they don’t have bars closed and they didn’t shut down the airline industry... maybe open your mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely farcical. They want a country to have less Covid than us for it to be on the green list. Germany now on it, all its pubs are open, the airports open and accepting people from abroad.... why do they have such low covid??? Yes the test!!   https://t.co/CDxIvKOkLA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jon_weir @dublincycling @Independent_ie Maybe it’s just stating the facts. It will be people who blame, but the facts need to be reported. I bet u read about people going to prison for drug crimes.... it’s all illegal, u can’t choose what parts of the law u like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarneySister @gunker1 @IrishTimes Think they did that. Check out the covid committee in April where they told the gov. The gov did noting, this is the result. The only country in Europe not to give state aid or liquidity to the airline industry.... go figure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic What is the law surrounding this? If it is not illegal why are you stopping people carrying out their lawful business?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen @President_MU The 15th of aug is where cases started to rise again. Where are all the deaths. You will go done in history for the biggest destruction of the economy for a season of a very bad flu.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD It’s easy to pull together when u have a salary coming in!!!! This is a disgrace. Let people take personal responsibility. Set out what at risk really means, and then let let rest of us get on with it. I’ve never voted SF before but you are really pushing me there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD Simon this trend has been described as worrying and concerning every single day since March. This is not living with the virus, this is destroying industries and jobs! This will put the 15 to 25 age group out of work and destroy their lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maireadhilliar1 @RadioBrendanRTE @campaignforkate @ronancollins7 @RTERadio1 Yes sorry - Thanks for correction. I was driving and pulled over in a fit of rage listening to her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioBrendanRTE @campaignforkate @ronancollins7 @RTERadio1 Kate is aggressive and assertive but what she is saying is not true. You can’t close a society because u feel that it’s not fair to isolate old people. I don’t think old people would want their children and grandchildren to enter into poverty, for hundreds to loose their jobs!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioBrendanRTE @campaignforkate @ronancollins7 @RTERadio1 Why not ask them about Sweden? Do people need to go on holiday? Do people need to go to a pub? This woman has no idea about the opinions will have on business and jobs!!! This is not a measured approach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noreen77777 Ever consider they were just scumbags and not racist. Sounds like they could have done the same to anyone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie Look at these wages. 39 euro an hour of unqualified..... like WTF?  https://t.co/MxkFWYPx42<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1902Carol @breakingnewsie Ok let’s explore... what extra protections do they have in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Denmark that you don’t have. If they have something great, let’s implement it... then can we get back to the fact your overpaid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1902Carol @breakingnewsie Yeah I’m sure you did lots of work from home..... how does that work. Would just be better if you all work September to end of July like every other country. This crap that your salary is spread out. 35k starting for 9 months work... nurse 28k starting for 11 months work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1902Carol @breakingnewsie It isn’t anti teacher. Just don’t think u should be paid if your not in work. Simple. Doesn’t happen in the private sector. You have been off since April on full pay........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginMediaNews @AislingNiCTV any idiot could see this.the same for the aviation industry which is a vital infrastructure for the Island. They are literally destroying the economy due to a crap test and trace system. Can’t believe they are letting the HSE loose on the country, look at the hospitals they run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie Any excuse. If they do they should recoup all the day they got over three summer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feely_brid @Ordinaryman13 @Michael_O_Regan Actually it’s due to a piss poor testing and tracing system and nonsensical policy’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_O_Regan Your delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jesskellynt @NewstalkFM @salesforce @SalesforceUK I did listen to your podcast and enjoyed it thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jesskellynt @NewstalkFM @salesforce @SalesforceUK Yeah might suit one or two markets but generally we are closed. The airline industry is in ruin and we are destroying a vital infrastructure with the most restrictive travel in Europe. It’s strange we have embarked on this policy consider NI is open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @jesskellynt @salesforce @SalesforceUK Sure Ireland is closed for business. The strictest travel advice in Europe....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CiaranKiely @Allycon3 @roinnslainte @ronan_glynn Our gov doesn’t seem to care about the financial consequences and is taking the easy option to stop numbers increasing rather than increasing testing and tracing. Why are Germany and Denmark so low? Because they have competent people in charge of the heath service....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen @roinnslainte @hpscireland Waste of time. What would be better is concentrating on increasing testing, opening it up to all symptoms or no symptoms like Germany and Denmark (low Covid) and many other EU countries. More contract tracers and decreasing wait time for results. You have it all wrong!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlasgowlovesEu @wolfiewire Of course it was. It will be a disaster and all the lies told to get Brexit over the line will start to have consequences. Would be interesting to know how many truck drivers and people who work in freight and logistics voted to leave the EU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComiskeyAnthony @PTHosford Yeah I just join this. Couldn’t care less who follow me. It’s immaterial, a bit pathetic that u even say that, remind me of the people down the back of class in secondary school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newtownbarry @President_MU Yeah? Are the pubs shut? Can you not leave the city? Can you not go to the airport and jump on a plane? Every EU country has restrictions from mask wearing to maximum groups in houses. None have measure as draconian as Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeamusMacSuibh1 @FCTwenteBenson Yeah I would agree with the enforcement of masks!! Not the closure of the capital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Yes - testing increased 6 fold and you don’t need symptoms to get tested. Over 50 percent of positive cases did not have any symptoms so would never have been found in Ireland. Lets report the facts and have headlines that match<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Hope they get her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer @McConnellDaniel Someone with a bit of sense. Like why would u follow NPHET of the HSE, not like they have a good track record. Look at the EU, any other capitals closed??? No of course not. FFS, were are the outliers if Europe, on our own road, destroying the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rock_IRELAND @DonnellyStephen Don’t focus on reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nimmermaximum @DonnellyStephen Yes they are..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprising how NI especially Belfast is similar to Dublin yet they have limited international restrictions compared to ROI and Dublin. Clearly closing the country did not work. What a joke!  https://t.co/PYoykUBhiy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD Yeah I believe in the way Germany and Denmark have dealt with this. Italy is also following in their footsteps. For me it’s the right way, good public heath and least amount of damage to economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD Agreed. I see your posts and generally have the same thinking all your points. Covid we will have to disagree... Horrible virus, needs attention just strategy needs to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingnewsie The pubs and the rest!!! Look at the departments past... some many fuck ups, worst public health system in Europe. Reduced testing capacity in May, didn’t get community testing people employed. No increase in ICU capacity. They are a farce and should be sacked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD Andrew it’s up to people to be responsible! Actually went to a restaurant the other evening. A group of old men all mixing with no social distancing.... they made a choice to ignore the advice, we are all adults. If I was old I would be nowhere near a public enclosed space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClarkesLatin Someone should tell him they don’t work. He needs to #wearamask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Nice way to make light of it. She is a disgrace #lockherup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen Your living in Narnia.. we have one of the worst public health systems in Europe, degrade and lacking in substance. Our testing system is shite. Our ICU capacity is 10 less per 100,000 compared to the EU and yet you want us to trust these morons that never delivered before??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD No not really... both my parents ate over 60 and have underlying conditions. We don’t go into the house, we have tea in the garden and bring our own cups. My parents are working from home and I do their shopping. Simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes He is painful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD I’ll take my chances with the risk of dying being 1 percent under the age of 60 if u get covid... will also reduce my chance of getting it by #wearamask , keeping my social distance (yes with everyone and not forgetting after 5min) and meeting outside not having house parties ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ionainstitute Because they will be out of a job?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD #COVID__19 #ireland destroying our economy and tourism industry. For what???

<|startoftext|>@FCTwenteBenson No need for this. Is Berlin open.. yes .. Paris? Yes. Madrid? Yes. London? Yes. Lisbon? Yes. Rome? Yes.... actually all EU cities are open except Dublin. Why the fuck are we so different than Europe???!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulreiddublin @HSELive No need for this. Complete joke. Is Berlin open.. yes .. Paris? Yes. Madrid? Yes. London? Yes. Lisbon? Yes. Rome? Yes.... actually all EU cities are open except Dublin. Why the fuck are we so different than Europe???!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbRobinBarnett All the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen No need for this. This is a farces. I won’t be complying. Is Berlin open.. yes .. Paris? Yes. Madrid? Yes. London? Yes. Lisbon? Yes. Rome? Yes.... actually all EU cities are open except Dublin. Why the fuck are we so different than Europe???!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailFai @IrishTimes The first lockdown was to get the heath service ready. Not to ignore the ICU capacity problem and scale back testing. This is a complete farce. The country will be destroyed by the HSE and NPHET. Why we all following them? Not like they have w good track record<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes This is just a disgrace. The gov needs to go! They are destroying the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanWilde2 Good for u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie They shouldn’t be closed. They are not closed in any other EU country. My point is open everything up, invest in testing like Germany and Denmark. Take personal responsibility if over 60 or in a at risk group and  #wearamask and pay attention to social distancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael60698973 @IrishTimes No just he sees nphet and the HSE for what they are. Look atthe HSE’s handing of everything they touch.... always a disaster!! A and E, cancer care, mad waiting lists, smear problems, breast care issues. They are generally crap!! Why expect anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Thanks god someone with a bit of sense. No need for this at all... Is Berlin open.. yes .. Paris? Yes. Madrid? Yes. London? Yes. Lisbon? Yes. Rome? Yes.... actually all EU cities are open except Dublin. Why the fuck are we so different than Europe???!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichealMartinTD I smell bullshit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD You are painful. Perhaps if u did a job job in health our icu bed capacity would not be the worst in Europe. Not to mention our shit testing system... why is Germany and Denmark not having as much covid as us despite an open economy ????!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKellyIC Just nonsensical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM What a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie For me that’s not a reason to close a country, destroy a tourism economy and shut down the aviation industry, close businesses including pubs etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie My point about smoking is that if kills 6000 people a year..... driving... life is about a element of risk, it will never be risk free. For covid, statistically if your under 60 you have less than 1 percent chance of dying if u get it. That one percent is closer to .3 under 40<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie But when I say we get back to business I also mean we all still wear masks.... I don’t want to get covid. But I also don’t want to waste my life. I wear a mask, I respect social distancing but equally I will go on holidays and go to work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie No I wouldn’t agree. If your in a at risk group you can take the personal choice to take extra care. For example wear a mask if need to go shopping or get someone to do it for u if possible. Don’t have visitors indoor, meet outdoors and keep 2 meters. The rest of us move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Will u call a election and get back as the number one please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjawalsh @BBCNewsnight @SunetraGupta Not really... look at Sweden. It’s becoming a unfortunate reality for some that all Swedish people are not dead..... actually far from it.. their death rate from covid is not far ahead of ours.... without draconian measures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer @PTHosford Disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Leo we need to do more than 14 thousand tests. Look at countries with low covid, they test all people, even without symptoms. Let’s test and trace and allow everyone to get tested like Germany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 Let’s not get into American politics. Disgraceful of what happened to Leo, that woman needs to be arrested and brought before the courts for judgement. I’m sure all Irish people agree, no matter what your politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie How did she get to him and nobody about to detain her? She needs to be arrested. No reason to ever assault someone, no matter what your politics. She is a disgrace to our nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie That’s where I disagree. Of course every death there is a story and it’s unfortunate and sad. But we still drive cars.... people still take drugs and smoke. A recession can have severe impacts on heath.. the study of heath economics. The problem with NPHET is is pure medical....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie Not really - just check the stats. And then find what the countries which have low deaths have in common. It’s not international travel as the rest of EU is open. It’s testing... we have the worst testing system in Europe after Spain and the UK  https://t.co/mteCznpLZ7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dillyn_kinehan @IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie What is optimistic about closing a tourism industry?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dublaoigh @rettwt @MichealMartinTD @ronan_glynn Well people did die from it. Just less people died overall as nobody was driving etc. Less people having surgery.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer @PTHosford She’s wrong... look at other EU countries. All she will do sis destroy the economy, add to a recession and cause undue misery on workers and business workers. The people who are not effected now by loss of work don’t see the issue. They will in a years time when money stops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraMcMahon8 @jamesMu99856113 @gavreilly All of Dublin are leaving now before the lockdown. That’s way covid will spread around the country. Great move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CellaH26 @gavreilly It’s not as simple as that. You have to weigh up the effect on society and economy. Look at the increase in suicides in 2008/ 2009. Look at the decrease in cancer diagnostics.... the list goes on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly They are not necessary today!! We need to move on and people who are at risk take personal responsibility and avoid risky situations. The rest of us move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @PatKennyNT We need to live with this. Economy is being ruined, social norms eroded, community eroded, teenagers facing depression, business closing and for what?? The cure is more painful than the illness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn @PatKennyNT David I don’t agree with your ideals or beliefs, however u are getting covid right. Will u point out that Sweden only has 200 more deaths per 1 million population than us with no lockdown. Italy taken of green list despite having 20 less cases per 100,000 than Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MABSinfo Yeah and closing business and stopping inbound and outboard travel is helping. 12 billion lost to economy from tourists. Aer Lingus staff getting 250 for two weeks work, pubs not open - economy ruined by crap public heath policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntodGroove1 @Independent_ie How stupid are u? How can u get to zero with a border with NI who can travel to 57 countries. All the NI people coming down to Dublin to fly out as it’s cheap and the period from Dublin going to Belfast as it’s allowed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes How many beds have been increased since the lockdown which happened so we could prepare for the next ‘wave’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@President_MU Why has Sweden only had 200 more deaths per 1million compared to Ireland. Any why are no other big EU countries following our great example, Paris open.. Madrid open... Lisbon open... Rome open... Berlin open... Dublin????? - we have idiots at the helm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewstalkFM @andreagilligan @LunchtimeLiveNT Makes sense but that’s not what we are going for here. Number one objective is to ruin the economy, once all jobs are lost and in deep recession people will be allow out to catch the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudara @NewstalkFM She’s completely right. So are the people in Sweden and btw now the rest of Europe. Did u notice how no European cities are locked down??? Because they have realised Sweden got it right. We are just to stupid to see what’s happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Leo that was what u were saying last week. They should be opened. The country needs to live with this and the at risk groups need to take personal responsibility. Only EU country locking down a capital. The gov has lost the plot and is destroying the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you #sinnfein @orourke_darren @loreillysf for pushing these issues. This is #disgraceful and @HHumphreysFG could not give a shit about workers rights! #finegael #ireland #workersrights  #Debenhams #cityjet #clearys #meatfactories<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@collettemcg @DonnellyStephen @MaryLouMcDonald @MichealMartinTD U should have just gone to Italy... oh wait it came of the green list despite having less Covid cases than Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews can you please do some real reporting and challenge why Italy was removed form the green list when it had less incidence of covid over a 14 day period than Ireland??

<|startoftext|>@lichamber @TodaywithClaire @DonnellyStephen @lawlessj Hey - while your out defending... would you recall why Italy was removed from the green list when it has less Covid than Ireland or is FF just intent on damaging what’s left of the airline and tourism industry?

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar We have one of the worst testing systems per capita in the EU. We have closed our country for business. A glimmer of hope that we might be back to business and now I read you are closing the capital. This gov will be know from bringing the country back to the 60’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickBarryTD They have watched CityJet off shore jobs when we’re all #InThisTogether . Aer Lingus cabin crew on 150 euro a week. Don’t forget clearys and now Debenhams.

<|startoftext|>I do not agree with the protest or why they are protesting. But in a democracy they have a right. Coveney points out that they are the minority view. That’s exactly why the right to protest is fundamental. #covid #ireland #lockdown  https://t.co/OYQBzWqwqu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ Yeah unfortunately they UK are as bad as us in terms of testing. The simple matter is that our testing and tracing system is just not the same as Germany. But we need to push gov to implement a system that is fit for purpose and stop obsessing about the number of daily cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP ECDC is a better place to get data as it’s put into context per 100,000 population or per 1 million. Taking each countries death rate as a direct comparison is not possible.  https://t.co/NYZSwqyrV3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP They have a 32 death rate per 7 day period out of 45 million. That’s a death rate of less that 1.6 per 1 million people. So in context it’s not really a reason to close up shop. The problem is we have not realised that yet but Spain, France and Germany have. We need to catch up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP Fundamentally agree with the lag and the 32 deaths over a 7 day rolling period. However it is important to put these raw numbers into context. Spain had a population of 46 million. Take the lag concept, 6 weeks ago they were reporting up to 4000 and above cases per day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP Agree with the trends and lag of deaths. However they are just not materialising. Many different scientists are giving options as why. Here is one... I’m not advocating it, just providing one that came to hand  https://t.co/Ht2IF4sJ14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP Not reallly. They have 20 more deaths per 100,000 than us. That is not a really a reason to stop the majority of travel in and out of a country and close up shop  https://t.co/E8DBhTilfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ And felt brainwashed after being in Ireland. Business was open as normal and people going to work etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ %of positivity cases where people who had no symptoms at all. Imagine if we have the same testing regime here... logic would say it would double our positive case rates.. our gov is shining the spot light on non issues while our testing is crap and we have not increased icu beds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ Our actually problem is the testing regime. It’s nowhere near our EU neighbours and that’s what we need to focus on. For example France tests anyone, symptoms or no symptoms, same as Germany. They do double the testing per 100,000 people than us. And interesting in France, 50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ For three weeks in July. I actually had the feeling when I arrived that I was brainwashed in Ireland. It was business as normal over there. People going about their business, city busy, workers going to work. We are lagging far behind the rest of the EU and it will be damaging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ Yeah not to the same extent as Ireland. We have been extremely slow to get back. The rest of the Eu has moved on. Travel with the EU was back internally in June and they opened up to the world in July. Germany and Italy didnt see an increase in cases. I was in France for work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gianluc21703420 @RuthCoppingerSP That’s hard to know in terms of deaths. Look at Sweden... that didn’t happen. Look at Spain and France, their deaths have not increased. This is for many reasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ Airlnes severely impacted with thousands of jobs on the line with hundreds already lost. Largest contraction in the economy in the history of the state.. you don’t think this won’t effect you in a few months?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ No it’s far more that that. Work from home... means Dublin City centre is at a stand still. Closure of SME’s such as service. Lack of tourists... 12 billion lost to economy with devastating effects. Don’t travel... closure of one of the biggest infrastructures for a island nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaymc193 @DebenhamsStaff @DRedundancies @ChrisWinwood2 Excellent. Keep up the fight, you can bet top management will get their bonuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouiseLacy @planetjedward Very sorry to hear about your mum. For the DNR it’s prob a right decision. CPR his horrific and generally offers low to non existent quality of life. Sometimes it’s hardest but best to let loved ones go when their time comes. As hard as that may be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthCoppingerSP And a ruined economy is destruction for workers, our livelihoods... increasing homelessness due to mortgage default and then increase in depression and suicide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthCoppingerSP Ruth we need to get back to normal and live with C19. Look at the ECDC death rates. 1.6 deaths max per country per 100,000 in the last 14 days and lower before that. Look at Sweden deaths, only 200 more per 1 million compared to here. That is not a reason to ruin your economy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Julietannb @DonnellyStephen @JepicHQ Hi.. no I think it’s more they the rest should go about their business and those in high risk groups need to take personal responsibility to protect themselves knowing the risks. I’m in a high risk group, I wear my mask, only meet friends/ family outside with social distancing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Sure of course they do. It doesn’t fit the narrative. The highest number of deaths in a country across the EU per 100,000 due to COVID-19 is 1.6.

<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland But that’s the problem. Individuals shouldn’t get to do their own risk assessment. It is one size fits all when living in a society. The general population should be put at risk because some people have decided the vaccine doesn’t suit their personal values or beliefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland Essentially you are saying ignore the advances in modern health and risk your child dying...... for what? Your belief that you have some form of control in your life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland Nobody says that their are 0 risks in vaccines, there are adverse effects, from a sore arm to other minor issues. All outweigh the risk of death or serious brain damage often caused by the pathogen itself.   So that’s why nobody understands the logic of anti vaccine people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland Here. One of a leading causes in child mortality worldwide. The vaccines helps to reduce this mortality. Why would you not want to do that?  https://t.co/HD4yqw2TzD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland Where they? Is that a research study. I agree one should never do anything based on blind trust. That’s why vaccines are put through a rigorous testing systems and phases.... so that they can be evaluated based on imperial evidence and their benefits vs risk can be assessed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BusyDrT @HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland This is painful. U should go back and live in 1850. At least then you wouldn’t have to vaccinate but you would have a great chance of during compared to now. Use your head. Oh just saw your anti mask wearing as well. There is a surprise.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @BusyDrT @VestIreland Give me the example?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamesbaxter83 @KingBobIIV Difference is that they did it legally by enacting the legal mechanisms. I’m sure it won’t be long until they are back in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Yeah the know they are breaking the law........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reif44 @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump It’s the same thing..... if people didn’t have covid they would not have died, they died because covid was able to overcome them due to underlying weaknesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TXIndepndnt1836 @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Why don’t they make the writing bigger for him or is he dyslexic. Seems to have a real problem with the zeros.

<|startoftext|>@Maximil86429959 Yeah because we have loads of money. Also why did they just not take a plan from a previously  but children’s hospital from another country that worked well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BusyDrT @HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland I love these anti vaccine groups. Clearly you don’t have any idea for the rationale behind vaccines. As one of your cronies pointed out, people who are vaccinated sometimes get infected. So what the purpose of vaccination. Vaccinated everyone and this clearly reduces the spread<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@damienmullan85 Not really, more 70 and might as well not as half goes on supporting the other half..... pay taxes but get nothing. Wouldn’t mind if it was like France where u got something, not just supporting the lower half<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lidl_ireland Thanks again. I don’t think that a ‘screen’ separating staff means what you have. For example today, I walked behind one of your employees who turned around at his till and was in my face with no mask. Would be nice if you change your policy for the greater good. #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MlMcNamaraTD Load of shite. We need to join the Shangen area not the brits left us high and dry. Let me go on holiday. This is madness!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSELive @hpscireland @roinnslainte wonder why our cases are going up with no international travel. It’s not complying with rules. What idiot thinks sitting behind a 45cm bit of plastic prevent aerosol spread. Enforce your policy’s!! #COVID #covid19ireland #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lidl_ireland TNx for ans. I can’t find that in the gov guidance or the HSA safety at work guidance. Also there is no evidence at all that a small sheet of Perspex will stop covid. You really should look into this as you are putting customers and employees at risk. Mask wearing is only option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lidl_ireland why are none of your staff wearing masks at your tills in #dunshaughlin . Is this a store policy because it is not in line with national policy #covid19ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NiallCollinsTD your remarks regarding the withdrawal of Ryanair are naive at best. How can you expect business to stay when your policies are destroying the economy. Every other state in Europe has offered state back liquidity or aid to their airlines. Ireland is so far behind!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrexitFreedom @hermannkelly @fiannafailparty @sinnfeinireland That’s an easy question. Because NI is rules by the brits and Ireland is a consenting member of the EU and we are represented by the EU..... not to hard to comprehend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLalor18 Yeah we just need to move on now. We missed the boat, but was impossible anyway sharing a land border with NI. Now people who are in at risk bracket need to take personal care and take individual responsibility. The rest of us need to get on with our lives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rothbard1776 @realDonaldTrump Where and when did Biden say he agreed with riots. Cop on and open your mind. The reason why there are different words ( protesters or rioters ) is because they are two different types of people, who do different things. You can be a protester and not a rioter........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciarakellydoc U might pass that onto RTÉ and @ronanglynn . We know what this virus is, people need to be responsible. If your in a at risk group u need to take personal responsibility about your health knowing the facts. The rest of us need to move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSPIRAL_ Hey DJ- think your being w bit simple minded there. Those people who died with underlying conditions died because they contracted covid. If they didn’t get covid they would be here today. So yes they died because of covid..... maybe stick to your day job<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeeGilhawley This is leading to Ireland not having the full picture in terms of Covid and under reporting of the disease compared with other EU countries. But it’s looking more and more likely that we need to just live with this and reopen and get the economy back on track<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeeGilhawley What’s interesting about that research is the link that Ireland would have missed this covid due to restricted testing. In Europe most countries including France are testing anyone, no need for symptoms. 50 percent of all positive tests in France were from people with no symptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osullica Would be better if you do incidence per 100,000 and compare it with other countries. 27,000 seems allot however most are no longer infected<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland Yes but a direct link to serum levels and number of dose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland Clearly the vaccine is less risk, look at the common stuff, crying, bruising etc vrs death with the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyParisian @JinnyJo3 Europe has a Christian culture, led by democracy and free speech. Unfortunately it is evident that the Muslim culture clashes with the European.

<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland What risk does the vaccine have that can be greater than brain damage and death?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthFreedomIE @VestIreland  https://t.co/Apla0ptQAJ . I would disagree, the high death rate from the virus is not due to the above, it’s due to many infections. Luckily we don’t have many infections as the majority are vaccinated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MlMcNamaraTD @HIQA Not sure this is appropriate to be questioning if the ECDC and our healthcare officials are recommending. Unless we stop paying all these experts and save some tax payers money and then make our policy’s based from twitter and the papers?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alanprender @TheBeaconIrl Glad you weren’t around in 1940 Germany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plus_sue @DavQuinn Yeah agree with you. I follow all the advice and I expect the same of people. It’s just perhaps the mob mentality needs to change and lording people out of jobs is not the way to proceed. I would be happy if mask wearing was 100 percent mandatory for all - no excuses<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lookcloserguys @BHornet7 @TalbertSwan @megynkelly @KenoshaPolice You all actually need to take a step back. The world is looking at your country in dismay, we don’t see whites or blacks... we just see Americans treating each other like shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan @megynkelly @KenoshaPolice This man is clearly sick, along with the society. It’s all horrendous to watch, innocent lives needlessly ended. All Americans need to step back and look at what is happening,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Toibin1 @MlMcNamaraTD calling out this utter crap! I lost my job due to this travel ban and I’m going to loose my house..... for what???? A over cautious government led by doctors who have no idea about real life and the economy. I wish I lived on the mainland.. Europe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFQMUSIC Because they actually have brains and you could trust them... like name one person in FF who you would let loose<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney here is the real impact of closing our country. Death by Suicide surged in 2008 and 2009. It will be the same in 21’ due to the current policy. Stop the closures and open up, the cure is worse that the ailment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilHoganEU sorry to see you gone. Was hoping you would have stayed and let this pass over. What a fucking shame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Niall_Boylan What’s happening is a disgrace! Our economy is being ruined by a bunch of doctors that seem to love the camera. Complete miss information and deviation from the EU. Open the country up and let’s live with this like the rest of the EU. Mask up and move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plus_sue @DavQuinn Yeah we should all loose our job for using a mobile phone and perhaps a lapse in judgement. For all the people that urinated in the streets, got a speeding ticket..... let’s hope we all don’t loose or jobs for minor infringements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Yeah Michael martin does the same. It’s makes sense in other country just not in Ireland. Like what is going on in the country!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CatrionaColllns @drdavidsamadi A bit of a joke - I’m all for expression of opinion and protest, but it seems we are not into social distancing either?

<|startoftext|>@DavQuinn Yeah agreed. It worked well the separating the church and state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allycon3 @ursulamurphy123 @philipnolan1 That’s the problem, there should be no exemptions. If you can’t wear a mask don’t go shopping, get someone else’s to do it for you. The greater good must come first before someone’s individual concerns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RomanShortall Why is the pension not capped like everyone else. Mine is capped at 66k if I even get that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 @electionlit I would like to know when she went to lanzarottee - and did she keep the 14 days. The travel advice is only advice and we are all free. The 14 days is required.

<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 @electionlit Can you send me where you read that. I have this as the most up to date account, albeit with denial from SF but the guards are holding the point  https://t.co/ZzmIBeRsRc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rfwalsh86 @electionlit So what other options.... scandal after scandal SF councillor just apologised for being in lanzarottee. A member of SF asking party permission to speak to the guards, singing paramilitary songs when getting elected??!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s time to open back up the economy.

<|startoftext|>@Reuters Good for him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @ReginaDo Yeah there was no max for NI. I don’t agree with what she did, it was certainly a error in judgement and should not have occurred, but that being said she didn’t break any rules. That is unlike our Supreme Court judge... minister  and so on. They actually broke the rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuriousIrishGi1 @paddylepage @FintanYTWalsh That’s sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @ReginaDo Is there or was there restrictions on the numbers who attend funerals in Northern Ireland? I really don’t think there was, only social distancing required. I’m not a SF supporter, however she did not break any rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrewm19444646 @ReginaDo Ok from what I saw she was socially distancing, attending the funeral most certainly could be considered essential (btw this was a recommendation) and finally do you have evidence she didn’t quarinteen and many would argue she never left Ireland in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farrelly_peter @cominghome10 @ReginaDo Which rule was broken my Mary?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The__Boyler @ss_sheehan @Michael_O_Regan I’m not a huge SF fan, would never vote SF but I’m pretty sure the rules in NI were not the same as ROI. Let’s say it as it is not how we want it to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beyno22 @funkcreep44 @IndigoLeo10 Hey - that’s correct, a surgical mask will unlikely prevent the wearer from getting COVID-19. It’s if you have the virus the mask will prevent you spreading it. Yes I’ve spent my career in respiratory medicine, many studies exist and also peer review studies supporting masks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funkcreep44 @Beyno22 @IndigoLeo10 You could not use this study to argue against mask wearing, for example, going to do a shop, will not take 4 hours, prob only 30min. Don’t wear a mask, give c19 to a COPD patient and kill them.. worse than maybe a reduction in SPO2 which will bounce back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funkcreep44 @Beyno22 @IndigoLeo10 Hey - so as you can clearly see this is a study of people with END stage disease, it was completed over a 4 hour period. A surgical mask is not a N95 mask, they are very different. Also you would have to read the full study to evaluate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beyno22 @funkcreep44 @IndigoLeo10  https://t.co/AuKco8ZbhX here is a good article in general terms. You can find many peer review studies that back up this article. Also the WHO, CDC and ECDC who are experts in disease prevention all recommend mask wearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Resign don’t apologise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertburke84 We won’t have any politicians left when they all resign like Mr Failte Ireland... what’s good for the goose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndigoLeo10 @CatrionaColllns What a idiot - how hard is it just to follow the CDC guidance, no wait... they are telling you to wear masks to make you sick, I forgot the doctors and scientist have a mad conspiracy theory. Just respect others and do your bit. Clearly brain dead and selfish !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beyno22 @IndigoLeo10 Oh yeah - where did you get this info from? Amazing how people have a degree in science, medicine and defiantly not common sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funkcreep44 @Beyno22 @IndigoLeo10 No not really. Not excellent at all. Maybe you need to do some reading. When you wear a mask you protect others if you are infected, as the fine mist that comes out of your@mouth when you breath is not@spread into the air.

<|startoftext|>@DakotaLula Which part of this is really bad? I don’t agree with her opinions but I don’t find anything offensive. Making comments about the god elements?

Wear a mask not travel bans, fix social issue such a overcrowded dormitories or in our cases meat pants and lack of employment law @LeoVaradkar @SimonHarrisTD @HSELive @rtenews @sinnfeinireland #WearAMask #covidireland  https://t.co/uNV2xYgmZZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianFlanagan1 @ThingsYouNeed2K @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @rtenews It’s from yer man NPHET via department of health. NPHET needs to operate behind closed doors and stop with the press and PR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STARCHAIN6 @nytimes What will defunding achieve? Do you not want a police force? What needs to change is your type of policing, maybe go for community policing. However there is a culture prob and gun problem that also needs solving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianFlanagan1 @ThingsYouNeed2K @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @rtenews Please stop!! Just advise gov and stop coming out with your additional spin. Only one source of info needed and this should be the HSE. Too many people trying to make a name for themselves<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Extremely covid friendly at Centra Batterstown. Hand gel at entrance, 2m distance marked on floor, glass partition at cash counter and staff behind wearing masks correctly. Well done, first shop I feel safe in. A model for others #centra @HSELive #COVID19ireland #WearAMask  https://t.co/CIJR7ZRaMj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Really confused.. build the wall to stop C19??? America has done the worst job in the world at containing this. The ‘China virus’... look how they handled it. Amazing and they didn’t know it was coming. You got a head start and still managed to f@€k it up!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaysLeft4Trump @WhiteHouse You would think so, but amazingly after all you read from committees some Americans still are standing behind. Amazing to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aparis5150 @WhiteHouse Gods answer to Americans ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Counselor701 @WhiteHouse What does it say about your democracy if he can get away with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishexaminer No shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackBMontgomery Not fun at all. Thankfully someone seen sense. It’s called the European Union for a reason!!!! Additions need to stop, look at the state of the countries they have let in recent years. Corruption, no independent judicial system.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryMul16461591 Amazing how their ideal will destroy the country and economy. Most people agree we need to look at the environment, however the greens have show they are way of side.. no idea on how policy’s could actually destroy people’s lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @GardaTraffic Yeah I think 100kph is appropriate considering the road, Liffey valley is a slip road, same for hospital and the petrol station and houses have their own road with barricades separating them from the 3 lanes. Nobody does 80kpm as it’s to slow for the type of road<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get rid of this useless Chanel - if they can’t make it alone then let it go . Seriously overpaid staff is one of their biggest problems. #defundrte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @GardaTraffic Where exactly are the house? You make it like the front gate open up onto the 3 lane sorry N4 not M4 so 100kph would suit just fine. There are concrete barriers and metal barriers on both sides<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic Good work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD please just implement sound policy. Masks a must indoors, visors not a replacement, if you can’t wear a mask dont go in (be honest everyone can wear one). Cafe/ restaurant- masks off at table, if your standing then mask on.... employees on all the time - plastic screen or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanfair12 @GardaTraffic it is all relative - if the roads were set at an appropriate speeds then perhaps speeding wouldn’t be required. For example Dunboyne to fairyouse, at 60 KPH, wide straight road. Palmerstown to Lucan 60 then 80... 3 lane motorway. Only in Ireland do you find this #rsa #painful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just went into a restaurant- once behind the plastic divider the waitress took mask off and talked all over the food - you could see her saliva going into the food - mask wearing is not optional - you can’t remove it behind your plastic screen!!!! #WearAMask #HSE #getserious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar why are we not concentrating on mask wearing in shops and indoor setting. I’ve traveled with work in France and Germany and 100 percent complianace in both countries. We need to make mask wearing stricter here, about 20% not wearing one or replaced with visor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memeslikedreams @rtenews @MichealMartinTD He’s better to go back asleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a disgrace - this man not only wants to ruin democracy but also nature reserves - let’s hope he’s out soon and the world might get back to some form of normal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GardaTraffic Imagine - meanwhile druggies shooting up in the city center in plain sight...... anyway this was probably a long stretch of open road with a 50 sign designed for you to sit there and pick of easy targets to increase the coffers #sotired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters You would have to wonder - I guess they are probably the no to vaccine groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LShortington If your mind can’t be changed by looking at the abuse and maltreatment of people by your country then your a lost cause #cristanityislost  https://t.co/c2fnxru2pR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MexicanTatertot She should be proud - maybe open your mind and what you stand for  https://t.co/aHwHrHHOaZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Pleas #VoteTrumpOut2020 and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain . Sure a shame to see the destruction of democracy and and a world leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a horrible place to live. So happy with the #EU #Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even better just copy France, Germany Denmark and others - just go online and make your covid test appointment - no need to call anyone and no symptoms needed - that’s a proper testing programme - will never happen here, far to advanced for us @SimonHarrisTD @HSELive #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even better just copy France, Germany Denmark and others - just go online and make your covid test appointment - no need to call anyone and no symptoms needed - that’s a proper testing programme - will never happen here, far to advanced for us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedoggynetwork @MlMcNamaraTD Yes - why not? The rest of Europe is open except us - listen to the hysterics and ruin our economy, people loosing their houses, long waiting lists to a heath system with no money - get real! #COVID19 #COVID19ireland #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why all people must wear masks - not exemptions - in France if you can’t wear a mask you don’t go into the shop... end of story. You have to account for these idiots who put an individual stance above society @SimonHarrisTD @LeoVaradkar #WearAMask #COVID19ireland #idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipnolan1 Don’t forget to bleach every part of the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do you still bother... you lost, nobody bought your crap. Just close up shop and move on #AbortionIsMurder #GetALife #WomensRights #choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xart00n @_johndunne @ionainstitute I thought church teaching was not to use contraceptives...... ?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Well I’m sure her expert opinion in viral spread is far more advance than @DrAnthonyF . Let’s listen to a special Ed teacher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent_ie Your original article was shameful - who cares where people go on holiday -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should also vote for the Irish communist party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greenparty_ie wake up and concentrate on what you stand for..... focus on this rather than forcing resignations and holiday shaming @cathmartingreen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tvcritics @Knightsatire No he’s our cold - when he wakes up can you pass on he’s the minister of transport @EamonRyan @greenparty_ie @FineGael<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddymacc1 Yeah it’s called working for the greater good - and civic responsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paddymacc1 anyone can wear a mask. this is just a cop out for lazy people@in Ireland . I’ve bad asthma-wearing a mask is no problem - it’s up to everyone to do their bit, and if you can’t wear a mask don’t go shopping - ask a family member/ friend or neighbour #COVID19ireland #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evers_deirdre @oconnellhugh He won’t as we have a higher case of c19 per 100,000 compared to Italy. He was at less risk over there. People need to start thinking and not living in hysteria. good that you are looking after yourself, you should continue to cocoon as you are in a high risk group #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaithiMonaghan @oconnellhugh Local tourism will not replace the 13 billion in GPD from outside tourists. People need to get real. The current policy is leading to a sever depression which will have a wider impact that #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sircmora @mir_ocall @oconnellhugh Use your mind..... Ireland’s COVID-19 case numbers are nearly the exact same as our European neighbours per 100,000. Also add that we have one of the worst testing programs in Europe - we are brainwashed. We are the only country in Europe not open to Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a disgrace - they need to be found and brought to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD listen to a man that listened to days and days of evidence and obviously has listened. The country cannot be run by NPHET - they need to stop giving press conferences and just advise the elected Goverment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@europlias @MlMcNamaraTD Tell that to poor Mt Fáilte Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroCOVIDIsland @MlMcNamaraTD Such rubish - does anyone who believes is a covid free island have any concept of current affairs or history???? It’s not next week your going to convince @DUPleader to follow a all Ireland protocol and shut the north from the U.K. painful listening to such crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MlMcNamaraTD @ainefitz77 Thank you - it’s you (TD) we elected, not a bunch of doctors - it’s about listening to everyone and the for the goverment to GOVERN - based all all the information not just the science!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PublicAccessPod @JoeBiden When you loose empathy, no matter for whom you loose everything. Think this is the prob for American at the moment - lost values and individuality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit of common sense. It’s a disgrace that he was pushed to resign. What he does in his on time is his own business, espically traveling on the green list.   @greenparty_ie  https://t.co/PzZ1HMwLTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Someone must have been up all hours preparing that. Nice job...looks great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreudianSlip3rs @ImpactGameStat @CovidIreland @ronan_glynn @roinnslainte I’m not shopping in stores anymore I’d their staff don’t wear mask - and if I see a face visor with no mask I leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CovidIreland @ronan_glynn @roinnslainte And employees passed on covid also! We need everyone to wear masks!!!! Also visors have proven to offer not protection and this thing if you can’t wear a mask it’s ok.... complete rubish, if your that sick don’t go shopping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earnestobob @ronan_glynn your answers can be located @ECDC_EU . We have one of the lowest test rates per 100,000 population. France for example.. anyone can get tested. No symptoms require and no doctor referral. 70 percent of people tested had no symptoms and 50 percent of all positive cases-asymptotic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babsbear @ronan_glynn @SiobhanDonohue Babs..... 2 percent of cases came from international travel.... don’t buy into the narrative, it’s false. The reason it’s rising is people not wearing masks and replacing them with visors, no social distancing and the worst test and trace system in Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RitaMul87212345 @ronan_glynn Rita I don’t agree with the lockdown - but it’s not a simple as saying Dublin has more cases.... U need to look at the cases per 100,000<|endoftext|>
