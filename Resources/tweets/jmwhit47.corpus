<|startoftext|>@KellyO @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump BREAKING: the #TrumpCrimeFamily accelerates its grift of US taxpayers as the corrupt regime draws into its final weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMastriano NOT at ALL -- in fact, so far, NO ONE, including YOU has produced a shred of real evidence.  You are lying to Pennsylvanians, going against democracy, and need to be removed from office. RESIGN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Thanks to Trump's #GOPComplicitTraitors, Covid-super-spreaders, and #MoscowMitch's refusal to assist American citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Though technically US president is constitutionally authorized to pardon people, the obvious use of this power to COVER UP TRUMP's personal CRIMINAL ACTS is a further evidence of his many, many CRIMES  that need to be investigated and indicted, as appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle @Twitter did something to try and subvert #DiaperDon, but #DiaperDonald is now the trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockyMntnMike @bobcesca_go Good, but being more of a traditionalist, I think draw&amp;quarter would be a fit punishment for multiple counts of obstruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq Sure, #DiaperDon  is #LosingArizona -- is that right? my auto-correct has been screwy lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani What is the PENALTY for lawyers LYING over and over again to the public?  Surely there must be one, as surely as #DiaperDon will make another mess today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_Narrative Should be interesting since "White House press secretary Judd Deere said the President's visit is scheduled for Saturday, December 5 " -CNN.    ...(?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Especially since Trump-regime has managed to exacerbate all these problems dramatically over the last 4 yrs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #DiaperDon: Other than hundreds of billions you funding for new weapons contracts, US military pretty much AS was.  We NOTE that you've been DESTROYING weapons used for spying on your sponsor, Vlad-the-poisoner, and destroying morale for 4 years. It's why you LOST military votes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN BREAKING: #DiaperDon has still not cleaned up his pantload of TOTAL BS from yesterday.  The Trumpenpuppet definitely needs some parental attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch .@realDonaldTrump: #DiaperDon is still trending because a HUGE pant-load remains bunkered in the oval office awaiting further instructions from Putin on how to further DAMAGE US before the filth is cleared out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic_Triumphs @farandwee Of course he SHOULD BE in prison; but in this country, plutocrats pretty much always get a get-out-of-jail-free card. It pains me to vote that he will have a comfy retirement, still being highly subsidized by taxpayers at merde-lago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO Thanks for quoting the DERANGED president and promoting his deliberate LIES about the election.  We all know you like to push the Republican agenda through your WH 'reporting', but it would be best if you find a new #GOP champion. #TrumpPressConference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Merry NEW PRESIDENT to you, sweetie.  If you collect the 'rona this turkey-day with your hard super-spreader-partying, hope you recover in time to witness the inauguration of the decent man replacing the Trumpenfuhrer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump The EXTREME FAILINGs of the Trump-regime in fighting the pandemic will always rest upon your shoulders.  I don't think your throwing around "happys" is going to unload your bad BAD Karma on this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsJR88 If you cut out the citron pieces -- no so awful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany JfC Kayleigh!  You must be so grateful that God saw fit to see your fascist bossman overwhelmingly defeated -- you may now atone for your FALSE WITNESSing and sycophancy to the most EVIL man ever to sit in the oval.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Depends on who gets sent to prison first, and where they will be confined; otherwise, Jarvanka are definitely made-for-Florida folk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @DailyCaller #GOPComplicitTraitors continue to insist Trump's obvious collusion with Russia was some kind of hoax.  Just wait until the Mueller Rpt is further un-redacted, and chief OBSTRUCTORs of JUSTICE (e.g., AG Barr) are eliminated from DoJ!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawleyMO Versus Trump's cabinet of sycophantic reality TV stars and billionaire donors dedicated to destroying their departments, Biden's cabinet is an AMAZING upgrade to the #GOPComplicitTraitors currently serving.  Stuff it Mr. felonious voter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @EPA FACT: Trump-regime COVID response is so bad, it has caused MAJOR industrial &amp; travel slowdowns.  MEANWHILE, Trump and #GOPTraitors have done all they can to strangle environmental regulations and Paris climate agreement.  You REALLY REALLY suck at being environmentalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio So your campaigning against Walmart or something? #GOP/Trump trade wars have done nothing but raise prices. You are so corrupted by your sycophancy with Trump that you don't make ANY sense anymore. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated Denial. Anger. Denial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Cool.  We can now add Negligent-Genocide-Barbie to your list of major accomplishments in the failed DjTrump presidency, aside from your grifting millions in taxpayer funds for personal travel. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Not to mention how when Dems "lost" 2016 elec (by getting 3mil+ votes) - Republicans told the 'em to "GET OVER IT" and immediately confirmed Trump's ultra-far-right cabinet and policy agenda, while pundits celebrated the revised DC swamp ballet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Trump's crimes have not been fully delineated yet. I expect there are major unknown felonies.  Once ALL those crimes have been investigated &amp; prosecuted - MAYBE a pardon would be in order, but doubtful.  NO ONE is ABOVE the LAW, especially with multiple deliberate criminal acts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_VanDerMeer Trumps crimes have not even been properly delineated yet. I expect there are major unknown felonies.  Once ALL those crimes have been investigated &amp; prosecuted - MAYBE a pardon would be in order, but doubtful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq IN FACT, Ms. lawyer-lady, many reasonable state officials have, on a bi-partisan basis, CERTIFIED these election results.  STOP LYING or LOSE your LAW LICENSE!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila Letitia James did a great interview on @FullFrontalSamB show last night touching on Trump NY issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila @CNN After 4 years, it seems like they would have a pretty clear idea of "Who tipped-off Giuiliani about re-opening HRC server investigation" at a minimum, let alone all the Ukraine krapola.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq You and all the unethical lawyers of deranged Trump's D-list legal team are doing everything you can to stress test the hell out of it, and create an autocracy with one-party rule.  You must be so proud! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes Outside of obvious right-wing media support, it strikes me that there is generous deference to Republicans, voters, &amp; policies on ALL MAJOR NEWS networks (even on MSNBC).  Sure they get criticized when warranted, but the default position is "Republicans know best", sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenolin1 This has been blatantly obvious for years.  As long as the #GOP.lutocracy presides over Senate and high-courts, #MoscowMitchMcTraitor is absolutely fine with autocracy, kleptocracy, kakistocracy, or idiocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley While you are argue nuances of policy, your deranged dear-leader Trump has completely brought down the party of #GOPComplicitTraitors into the gutters of fascistic autocracy.

<|startoftext|>@GOP However, back here on Earth-1, #GOPComplicitTraitors are trying to steal the election &amp; destroy democracy because all-y'all are TRAITORS and power mongers.  F. U. and get the hell out of out White House!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnastoehr Imagine how joyous TG '21 will be provided progress w/CV-19 vax, etc. goes well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Don't forget that, aside from avoiding criminal prosecutions, T currently has numerous taxpayer-funded income streams from US military operations (e.g., overnight stays at Turnberry, refueling), secret service rentals, etc., that he will sorely miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio The "media", in general, fall all over themselves trying to kowtow to Republicants, and y'all know it.  But you always have to play as martyrs.  US Citizens don't like the fascist direction of the current #GOPComplicitTraitors.  But you just be YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Yes, in America, when people commit FELONIES, they are PROSECUTED! It's the LAW.  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emptywheel No -- you got it in your subsequent tweet; R's just want to always be able to exclude enough D-votes to remain in essential power positions.  Losing 'house' once in awhile is 'ok' as long as the plutocracy still presides over Senate, POTUS, and high courts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Trump has been totally deplorable in every sense since he first vaulted himself into public life in NYC in the 70's.  He posed as a Dem, though he never had any real political conviction.  How he managed to CON R's into exalting him to POTUS will forever be a sick mystery to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio You know what IS SHOCKING??? #GOPComplicitTraitors such as Sen. RUBIO whom pretends to be a devout Christian but worship a nazi-POTUS and allows him free reign to kidnap children and KILL HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of citizens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Numbers28 Trump/GOP's only hope of pulling off a victory is to fabricate a zeitgeist that ALL mail-in ballots/processing are suspect, and create enuf CHAOS to get judges involved.

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I.e., Trump wants GOP-controlled states to override democracy by installing 'electors' that will cast EC votes to him.

<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq NO. Trump needs to concede and YOU need to stop filing frivolous lawsuits or be disbarred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill There may be room for discussion about 'terminology' - not that it's gonna change anyones policy desires.    But as the #GOP does it's own autopsy (it won't) they have to ALL make it clear that FAR RIGHT fascist/terrorist groups cost them the presidential election (THEY WON'T).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Most of these people have not even BEGUN to pay for their crimes.  The #TrumpCrimeFamily hasn't even been charged with a whole list of felonies. Can't wait to see entire Mueller Rpt un-redacted to find more #GOPComplicitTraitors  in the 302s.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle John Bolton completely FAILED that test last year when he refused to testify in extremely URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY issues.  He is one of the premier #GOPComplicitTraitors, a TOTAL Republican FAILURE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slack2thefuture @opusworks I wish he would appoint Hunter as special WH advisor position just to totally troll the whole GOP/GRU conspiracy BS and payback for Jarvanka -- but of course in the sane world, this is bad policy and he won't, which is also good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillKristol More likely you'll need to be thinking about NEVER-Carlson, unless your into that sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein You know perfectly well that #MoscowMitchMcTraitor refused to pass any legislation -- STILL REFUSES.  Once again, Republicans obstruct and THEN blame Dems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly "Russian collaboration"?  Mueller Report, which is still highly redacted, cites numerous instances of CLEAR COLLUSION. But cause many Trump campaign witnesses LIED/refused to testify, crime of CONSPIRACY could not be proven.  YOU KNOW THIS!  You also know his diabolical record.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenniferJJacobs @KristiNoem @ThisWeekABC Do not fear; SDNY will be calling SOON!  Also NYAG.   Also, @ejeancarroll attys have been trying for months!   In fact, T and the entire #TrumpCrimeFamily will have plenty of DAYS in court in the near future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ Right- like expecting J.Shapiro to focus on voter fraud, and have Fox/OANN/Sinclaire TV arguing his alternative facts &amp; push into the zeitgeist his theory "Elec is a big mess--time to get DoJ / SCOTUS involved -- no rush decision" - but it's not quite rolling out as planned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger ? She has been a complete GOP sell-OUT last 4 years. I don't think she will buck MM on anything, - so -- hopefully if Dems take Senate, yeh, she'll be an ally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hbobrow1Hbobrow Heartening, I guess, but a grim reminder of the FAILURE our institutions in the last 4 years. So many INDECENT ACTs and DEATHs that could've been avoided -- and I'm sure the surface of Trump's criminal actions while president has barely been scratched.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump The LYING liar pressSec is declaring a mislead? If Trump had even a VAGUE plan of worth, it would be presented.  After SCOTUS strikes down ACA, months or years of negotiations with Insurance Lobby, AMA, States, etc. are required for new HC plan. U got nada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heritage_Action The PLUTOCRACY rules now, in plain sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein The fact that this unqualified judge will become a SC Justice  today is confirmation that the US SENATE is a CORRUPT institution that in no way represents US citizens or democracy.  It MUST BE ABOLISHED; y'all have failed US miserably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Y'all probably would like to GET OUT of DC so Biden?  Er, NO, you really need protection from prosecution, so the most racist corrupt grifter installed POTUS in history?? Ding Ding Ding, I win. #TrumpIsCompromised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney No, ACB is NOT qualified. You have cemented your partisan fate. For awhile, you seemed to favor promoting democracy in spite of Trump authoritarian criminality.  You have clearly abandoned that in favor of #GOP.lutocratic control of courts.  Shameful END to your political future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Looks like you are gonna be going thru some things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Unapologetic answer from most R's:    $  &gt;  humans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonaSigal Right - me too. Not sure who is sponsoring the link - but I do know @Twitter is NOT labeling or blocking tweets from A-h's like Mike Huckabee when they deliberately lie and promote disinfo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 After a little brainstorming with Jarvanka,Trump realized CV was an opportunity to super-politicize and make a fortune off of the pharma and economic stimulus bills associated with a huge pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duty2warn Bush is still very much loyal to the plutocracy plank of the #GOP.  I'm sure he's personally disgusted by DT, but as big supporter of Susan Collins, Graham, et. al., W doesn't want R's to lose POWER so - silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Reverse psychology? Since savvy Americans know Putin prevaricates or lies as is convenient, Vlad's hoping we will now consider the Biden propaganda to maybe be true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh - there was PLENTY of  there there in your e-mails.  Mueller just couldn't indict you because he knew it would piss OFF daddy way to much, so MR used the excuse that you were TOO STUPID to know you were being a TRAITOR to indict you for obvious felonies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc You forgot "first there is a favor we need, THOUGH".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delavegalaw Exactly.  It's obvious that in Jan/Feb, T balked at doing anything -- then when it became clear the pandemic was real, and Pelosi would generate PPP and other pgms -- WH immediately began configuring out many ways to PROFIT from CV-19 funds and pharma therapeutics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your magical covid-spreading tour continues!!! #TrumpDeathToll229K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski The coat-hanger industry thanks you.  The snake-oil-cure industry thanks you for the business when people NO LONGER have the ACA.  Clearly #MoscowMitch or DjT will be thanking you with some special bonu$.  People of Alaska will thank you with a "NO VOTE" in 2022 election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Add in the super-spreader rallies, and one pretty much has achieved genocide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump All that #COVIDIOT Trump contributes is sitting on his ass chatting on the phone, seeing how the #TrumpCrimeFamily may make bigly money on the side of these prearranged deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You and comrade Atlas keep pushing your 'herd-mentality' approach to CV and holding super-spreader events to see how many US citizens you can KILL for Putin. Harasho! #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How many people are you willing to KILL for your narcissistic urges? 10k? 60k?   229K ??    #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @david_hemond Of course, we'll never be allowed to know, but I somehow suspect that good ol' Vladdad probably strongly advised Trump to take the 'do nothing' approach to CV-19, also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Riiight...he should have just "let it wash over US" and save a couple of down-days on the DJIA like you so bravely did.  Now look what a success your response to CV has been! RECORD DAY for new cases!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepClayHiggins Please provide a list of FOODs you have there to Antifa headquarters IMMEDIATELY!  Rumor has it you may be holding something unauthorized in your pantry! The collector will be in contact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Um, still waiting for just ONE successful Trump infrastructure proposal promised for the last 5 YEARs, and we got NOTHING...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreggJarrett Boom! I guess that anti-fox-propoganda ray gun I received in the mail from Antifa headquarters actually works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneLytv I did hear 'go ahead', but that's almost as bad -- totally dismissive of the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Unfortunately, all of the information on the #TrumpCrimeFamily is still largely redacted from available legal proceedings,  but we expect that will end soon in ACTUAL INDICTMENTS rather than tall tales form RU faeries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch #TrumpCrimeFamily is gonna be going through some things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Does the Trump campaign actually reimburse the US gov't AF1 operations for this, or is it one of those things citizens will never be allowed to know about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go @RealClearNews Taking into account a little behind the scenes bump from Kemp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Just like sorry old jalopies such as yer-own-self, they will die off within the decade, hopefully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Important for trump to get this vote of confidence from the pedophile lobby.   #TrumpIsPathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly @PattyArquette "Fair and balanced".  Even your alma mater dropped that because they KNEW they were HEAVILY BIASED toward the fringe right, just as you remain.  But keep up the audition for the new "trump TV" coming in about 3 months!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Fortunately, the nefarious Giuliani foreshadowing turned out to be a dud so far...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudepundit Definitely - and BOTH ways.  Sounds like in 2017, the funds were 'incoming'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Then why are you abusing US?  Every frigging thing the #GOP does is about consolidating POWER for the benefit of billionaires or multinational corps.    I guess, like your cult45 leader, "the Donald", you practice sadistic dominance in your romantic pursuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonWDC Also, Trump cabinet and appointees to virtually every important position are persons deliberately charged with UNDERMINING their departments -- it seems like this is not really excoriated in any debate topics or campaign ads as it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Great pic - T looks dazed &amp; confused, just like his entire term has been. He definitely gets a participation trophy at least! He managed to get through 90 minutes without having a major temper-tantrum, and his depends held.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 When oil prices started falling down to pennies a barrel last spring didn't Trump regime buoy the oil market to ensure gas prices stayed near normal levels (for the sake of Petral ind.)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanspicer MEANWHILE, you remain one of the BIGGEST JOKES of 2016, and have no relevance to the current campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley 'Woke' up ya old fool; there is a vast difference between freedom of the press, &amp; private social media disinfo' screening.  If you are suddenly so concerned about freedom of the press, start with un-indicted-Individual-1 TRUMP who attacks and threatens reporters on a daily basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Either Marco is giving a good ol' boy WP sign, or he is trying to 'tuck in his shirt'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Just wait until they confirm what is in the Borat3 dossier on Rudy Giuliani!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mschlapp SO, to clarify:  YOU stand with persons who BREAK the LAW!!!  Thank you for your confession.  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Unfortunately, your actions in this life weigh heavily on your heavenly fate -- right now they are SO HEAVY, you seem to be headed directly southbound.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Private 'zoom session' with NY friend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 T's flagrant self-obsessed stream of conscious rambling sometimes reveals a little too much truth for even the most devoted red-hats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle As opposed to DjT and the entire #TrumpCrimeFamily who have BILLION$ in financial ties to Russia, Saudi, Turkey and various nefarious countries -- while they literally grift millions from US taxpayers for their sinking business, rewarding the richest citizens w/tax cuts? Right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch Since Russia has been less successful this year in funneling money to #GOPComplicitTraitors through the bankrupt NRA, I guess your service as twitter-troll is the best they can expect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Voted and WITH you!  But, please do not let Joe be putting pro-tRUmp RepublicanTs on transition team or in any sort of cabinet position.  They have literally destroyed democracy in this country for the sake of pure POWER and will do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump If the issue of court packing comes up, Biden should point out how #GOP has deliberately fouled the judicial system by filling lifetime appointments by unqualified right-wing judges in attempt to SUBVERT DEMOCRACY, as seen recently in SCOTUS dec. re: PA vote count. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @washingtonpost @seungminkim Wow - sounds like it will just as impressive as your and the Donald's new #GOP health care plan, y'all will come to  rescue US with after your new SCOTUS judge scuttles the ACA in a few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenAlexander A little bit of a LOT TOO LATE to finally be speaking up against the Trumpenfuhror's campaign of disinformation and jeopardy to PUBLIC health.  #ComplicitGOP Senators such as yourself have helped to create the #TrumpDeathToll220K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoteMarsha Until you take your role as a sitting US Senator seriously enough to investigate the deep and wide corruption of DjTrump and family, STFU #MoscowMarsha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Used to be that way ... future not so sure if a certain fascist authoritarian is able to heist the election again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickKristof Once the DoJ/OLC can get past their "POTUS must be treated as infallible KING" indictment blocking, TRUMP MUST be prosecuted for the multitude of OBVIOUS CRIMES he already should have been charged for.  THESE CRIMES were REAL and brought harm to US citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr GOD will get you for your LYING and deliberate inaction on CV-19 relief legislation.  You remain the most despicable Sen Majority leader in US history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle If anything, I get mad at Welker for seeming overly sympathetic with official WH and GOP representations of events she is covering.  As usual, Trump is projecting from his fabricated opposite-land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah_Yael_Gold Coked up Hollywood actress who landed role replacing Shelley Long on 1980's sitcom 'Cheers' was pretty good.  Then she got nutsy w/Scientology crap, then got ginormous physically so she could land a gig as weight-watcher spokeslady.  A sad pathetic trumpanzee for last 4 yrs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump I know it's REALLY ALL ABOUT the money, isn't it? I mean, sure the republic is in on the verge of becoming a complete fascist autocracy and the #GOP is devastating the environment while driving a giant wedge into the heart of US, but how 'bout that NASDAQ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulaReidCBS @CBSEveningNews 1) You're wrong on the essence of the issue 2) INSULTING reporters has been completely NORMALIZED by sitting POTUS Trump and WH consigliere's whom have done it daily for the last 5 years -- take your plaint to the WH rose garden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz Misidentified spokesperson / junior congressional cheerleader for the most corrupt POTUS in history has spoken.  Rick should know, since he has seen how authentically adept at CRIMINAL behavior his dear leader DjTrump is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Better lie down and rest, it appears that your CV-19 fever has you hallucinating LIES again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Now we are getting somewhere! Please identify ALL homes currently owned by DjTrump and what the mortgage amount is. Next, identify the entities to whom Trmp owes 400,000,000 - $1 BILLION  Next identify all the condos that #TrumpCrimeFamily sold to GRU agents above mkt price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This is TOTAL BS.   TRUMP had deliberately embarked on campaign of harming millions of seniors by denying CV-19 safety measures and promoting herd-immunity.   TRUMP is literally KILLING US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump "With all due respect Sir, your willingness to let hundreds of THOUSANDS of us DIE for the sake of Wall St -- and MILLIONs DIE for your herd-mentality?  Doesn't add up."  --American Seniors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @qello2525 They are all your ol' peop's  Bill. What made 'em do it?  Simple greed or power-hunger?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump "Yes, this rings especially true in soliciting our votes.  However, with respect to your willingness to let hundreds of THOUSANDS of us DIE for the sake of Wall St -- NOT SO MUCH!!!" --American Seniors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulaReidCBS @CBSEveningNews You label something, and then CHOOSE to highlight the BS story.  How about concentrating on a few of the roaring dumpster-fire scandals surrounding the Trump campaign and presidency; Trump is well known for being highly respectful of reporters - NOT AT ALL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBurkeNation Yes, and if you buy THAT, could I interest you in an investment in the Washington Monument?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse 1) millions of seniors in line like #GOP treats voters in GA and TX?     (these lines go on for days) 2) NO ONE will take a vaccine pushed by TRUMP 3) CDC credibility had been decimated by WH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein @urbaninstitute And yet you offered hugs &amp; praise to  #GOP process to fully load SCOTUS, 6-3 to ensure this happens.  You seem to be a liberal in spirit, yet secretly pulling for Senate and judicial plutocrats to prevail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Get over it Babushka-Barbie, Social Media has rejected uncle Rudi's RUSSIAN disinformation campaign. Meanwhile, STOP with your constant Hatch Act violations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Yes, the #GOP is facilitating the complete breakdown of the nation by use of conspiracies and fascist authoritarianism, but some on the left may be bad actors too...    One of your most profound statements since you categorized 47% of US citizens as being completely lost to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeidiNBC @SavannahGuthrie @NBCNews Still very, very wrong for NBC to grant this free publicity stunt for Trump on same night as cancelled debate -- the fact that he is self destructive IS the only saving grace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews After providing Trump with a free multi-million dollar publicity hour, this is the best outtake you could come up with? #BoycottNBCTownHall<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Reuters Frigging #MoscowMitch can take his blocked GRU propaganda and shove it where the sun don't shine; McConnell is the KING of BLOCKING, only he blocks ALL things that assist citizens rather than corporations or billionaires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein Lone wolfs in the Senate are constantly BLOCKING important legislation based on whatever minor-excuse.  Why is this nomination process SO EXEMPT from objections?  It's become obvious that the Senate is a corrupt and undemocratic institution!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimsciutto Trump has always been obvious about this -- every international relationship is just about his PERSONAL feelings.  His personal feelings are always about financial benefit to TRUMP that may be at play.  He has NO interest in actual foreign policy or US security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Ok - let's have a fact check about this. 1) submit all receipts of #TrumpCrimeFamily deals, trademarks, &amp; bribes received in last 4 years. 2) disclose the breakdown of payments from the Trump Inaugural fund to members of the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate.  3) hurry, time's running short!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @Twitter LYING and spreading propaganda to US citizens is quite offensive also.  But in Trumpworld, ALL rules are meaningless (Re: Hatch Act), so welcome back to our reality.  Also, #BoycottNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PGreen1950 @CharlesPPierce w/Chuck Todd working as main pitchman for the plutocracy in general.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McFaul Every picture of Trump rallies these days just LOOKs like an assembly of Corona Virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kris_Sacrebleu Provided Dems win control, the drumbeat of fear-mongering about deficit spending from all "conservative" politicos and pundits is going to suddenly be DEAFENING, like it heralds the end of the republic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr There is so much SMOKE left from all the TRUMP CAMPAIGN meetings with Russians in 2016, it's hard to see in here. #TrumpGraveDancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @SavannahGuthrie Great big boost for your favorite son DjTrump.  But CDC has said that persons with CV-19 must be quarantined at least 20 DAYS after serious infection.  YOU ARE ENDANGERING LIVES!  At least DEMAND DjT take and show a NEGATIVE CV-Test prior to debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Yes, Iv'e got one. "The Masque of the Red Death" by E.A. Poe perfectly illustrates the brilliance of the GOP plan to fight the pandemic.  #GOPHypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCPolitics Obviously trying to bless your favorite product, DjTrump, with some last minute campaign boost -- could you please at least utilize REAL CDC guidelines and avoid adding more to the #TrumpDeathToll219K? I'm sure your employees would appreciate that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimVandeHei Trump blatantly LIES/spews disinformation - is that what YOU consider to be "answered"?   Trump's completely failed to disclose basic security information, e.g., Tax Returns...where's your media OUTRAGE about that?    Oh that's right. Trump just being TRUMPY is all you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump MAN, YOU ARE REALLY JUICING this campaign!!  You really know how to ROCK the ROID RAGE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn The election results that were cosponsored by your comrades in the GRU?   The Election that was personally subsidized by Vlad-the-poisoner-PUTIN?  No - never will accept that #MoscowMarsha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Fascist authoritarian-wannabe VULGAR POTUS using the powers of his office to belittle/cripple every US institution, vs. resistors calling him and the #ComplicitCorruptGOP out for such. Sure, both-sides must cool it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn Then why the hell have you tried to repeal ACA dozens of times, and now turn to SCOTUS to overturn? This is a BLATANT LIE.  You're only interest is boosting health insurance industry PROFITS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Gee - as I recall, you said you would to do that with your dozens of accusers, but - why didn't you?  Oh yeh, because you realized that in DISCOVERY, you would have been totally decimated as a SERIAL SEXUAL PREDATOR. #TrumpIsALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imillhiser Something about the wrath of millions of dramatically affected citizens (since GOP has absolutely no plans for ACA replacement) might also be influencing their latest signals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump See that (tho totally confusing) was EASY! NOW release the last negative test results from the week of 9/27-10/3/20!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump So I guess y'all are deliberately trying to get the #TrumpDeathToll219K moving on up towards half a million by Christmas?   Extremely SAD the #TrumpCrimeFamily is so desperate to stay out of prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest Many of them live in areas ravaged by wildfires that Trump basically mocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Please, please DO elaborate! We know his campaign had dozens of surreptitious contacts with Russians, why? We know DjT owes $400++millions to someone, who? We know he does everything his comrade Vlad asks, why? Why won't he condemn the bounties on US troops in Afghanistan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump DAMN!  It is always a curse every time some Trump gets anywhere near the desert.  You are SO NOT WELCOME!  #IvankaTrump adds to the #TrumpDeathToll219K<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump You mean the insurrection over the US gov't takeover by one Vladimir PUTIN?   #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Only because they have NOTHING to replace ACA with, and may be a little squeamish about huge virulent blowback from millions of REAL people being drastically effected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger You keep forgetting that the "P" in GOP is really all about POWER.  They'll do anything, KILL anyone to keep it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rudepundit @MollyJongFast Remember it was just within a day or so of damning excerpts from Wolkoff's new book “Melania and Me: ..." were revealed -- perhaps a way to cloak Melanie from criticism for awhile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Idiotic 'politics' from un-elected Senator who filled her OWN POCKETS with million$ in illicit INSIDER TRADING gains while she allowed the #TrumpDeathCult to LIE and continue KILLING CITIZENS.  Talk about a POLITICAL HACK!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu red and turquoise are a horrible color-combo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nprpolitics Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Mike Pence have both refused to agree to the PEACEFUL TRANSITION of POWER after the election, so there's that itty-bitty nuclear bomb aimed at the heart of the Republic that you might want to look into...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO Hundreds of thousands of dead loved ones would STILL BE ALIVE if Trump had just acted a little more responsibly in Feb/Mar 2020, and A LOT more responsible ever since.  His generic little prayer is an insult to ALL of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman THIS is a LIE, as per usual. #GOP is ONLY concerned with their sacred billionaires being allowed to live as oligarchs - near tax free, as they drain the economy of resources and pollute the environment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hjelle_brian Republicans have SOLD their souls to the DEVIL for many years just to get the courts fully loaded with extremely conservative ideologues.  After all that, and their imminent future of residing in political hell, they're gonna make HUGE deal of this any witch way they can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce .@chucktodd is totally gay for Hewitt.  He really complete's his need to fully propone the 'both sides' position.  I'm sure there will be much ado about the court packing, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sladesr So, in the real world where a fascist self-serving Un-Christian dictator-wannabe taking experimental drugs made from fetuses, your only concern is making sure that SCOTUS remains locked up 6-3 by Catholics.  Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakehounshell NOT at ALL. Trump is constantly spreading disinforming about MAIL-in ballot fraud and other false narratives about VOTING. Biden is just pointing out Trump's "poll watcher" shenanigans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sladesr There are two choices in this election. 1) Vote for Biden to SAVE democracy 2) Vote for Trump or ANYONE ELSE to KILL democracy in favor of fascist authoritarianism and to END this republic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Exactamente!  Media has totally normalized Trump's constant illegal, unconstitutional or amoral behavior; we're lucky if sometimes they refer to it as "unusual".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @BLEXIT Thanks so much for personally promoting the ever increasing #TrumpDeathToll215K, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert ? All he needs is about 4 R-Sens, right? #MoscowMitch is preventing the votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet I guess, but am nervous about it.  The Trump sycophantic CDC / HHS are extremely troubling -- I would NEVER get a Trump-pushed CV-19 vaccine, that's for sure!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Awfully generous of you describing R's as pro-life party. At best they may be pro-fetus, but are otherwise a DEATH CULT, happy to sacrifice many lives for any immediate pecuniary benefit or POWER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d .@RodRosenstein is complicit with AG Barr in facilitating fascist authoritarian Trump's grip on institutions of democracy.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What happened?  AG Barr seems to have not been able to stop this FBI raid? Is he sick with CV-19 too? #TrumpIsALoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden Meanwhile, TRUMP is a #COVID19 super-spreader deliberately infecting Gold Star families, WH staff (how ya doing'?) GOP Senators and anyone else he can while running the country HIGH on steroids and Adderall. #25thAmendmentNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley List of things Americans deserve to know from TRUMP: 1. To Whom does he owe $420million ? 2. When was DT's last negative CV-19 test ? 3. Does DT support Putin's bounties for US troops ? 4. Involvement with the MbS &amp; Red Sea Alliance ? just to get started...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls How nice that you &amp; your family have tippy-top health care as #GOPSuperSpreaders go about giving pre-existing conditions to citizens as they plan to RIP AWAY ACA protections w/new SCOTUS pick.  Disgusting!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman 1) US does not need any more Trump super-spreader events to shed his CV-19 indiscriminately.  He is toxic right now. 2) DT discarded all rights to debate format demands by refusing to obey rules at first debate. 3) Where are the missing campaign funds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColoradoDavidSu He would have closed down the investigation if he had Known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenRonJohnson @WSJopinion How about the clear and documented COLLUSION between the TRUMP campaign and MOSCOW in sabotaging the '16 election?  I think that definitely trumps your vain attempts to cloudy up FBI documents with internal procedural BS. #GOPCrimeSyndicate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamwandasykes I think he is getting his Mormon 'rule by Elders' mixed up with his pledge to uphold the US Constitution.  CV delusions or just good ol' GOPlutocracy? You decide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio RIGHT on the money! A sycophantic televangelist anxious to bring on the apocalypse v   sane proven leader with the knowledge of real US allies and ENEMIES (e.g., RUSSIA)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMikeLee Excellent argument for authoritarianism!  The people can't be trusted.   The 'elders' will tell US what is right. Also helps to ensure that the rich get richer allowing all else to pick up the crumbs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT But the 64K question is: will journos outside fox and oann still want to give him free air-time or constant press?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL @lowrad57 As RR stood next to AG Barr at first MR read-out, he looked like a deer-in-headlights -- racked w/guilt about the obvious Barr misrepresentation &amp; dis-info exonerating T.

<|startoftext|>@SpencerPI @CheriJacobus @realDonaldTrump Exactly! Trump ads need to extoll the corporate socialism that Mnuchin/#GOP crammed into PPP act, but explain how things like Medicaid, Social Security and public schools are terrible for US!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus @realDonaldTrump Yes!   I'm an undecided CA voter terrified about the perils of socialism. If I watch several MORE TV ads convincing me to vote Trump, I may be persuaded.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maddow As with ALL things Trump/#GOP, weight issues heavily to achieve immediate maximum corporate profit$$$. Deregulate everything, re-open the economy; convince folk that a few million dead is great for WS, so should be acceptable on main street.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP THANKS for reminding US how the #GOP took Bill Clinton's healthy, low deficit economy and COMPLETELY TRASHED it - creating near total financial collapse of 2008.    DESPITE deliberate GOP efforts to block recovery, economy recovered.  THEN Republicans TRASHED it again under T !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump This little photo-op totally encapsulates the Trump presiduncey:  WASTE of gov't recourses  ENDANGERING lives for his vanity RECKLESS disregard for protocol ELITEISM as he flaunts his power while others can't go near their loved-ones when dying of CV-19. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump ATTN Eric:    This is not a trump-time-share promotion PR campaign.

<|startoftext|>@gnuseibeh @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden "Gentleman" should genuflect to the US' most corrupt tyrant in history to allow him to continue inflicting genocide and mayhem on America for another year after he deliberately got himself and thousands more infected w/CV?

<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress I think a better conspiracy idea would be that it is the work of Vlad-the-poisoner-Putin whom has decided that his puppet-potus would be more useful silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakehounshell Reasonable arguments for probably every US president but DjTrump who has been deliberately breaking every norm and LAW he can, each day, since 1/17.

<|startoftext|>@DavMicRot It's been super relevant since 2016, and it is INFURIATING that FBI, CIA, DoJ and GOP Senate have refused to investigate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Because regular citizens who do NOT GET fully subsidized HC (like Senators) get are a little concerned that you are about to BANKRUPT them and destroy pre-existing condition coverage.  The #GOP plan is to let people DIE. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@essenviews No - easy to see.   Even the supposedly most patriotic Republicans/defenders of US institutions (e.g., R.Rosenstein) HAVE to be in on the con to preserve POWER (and the financial benefit$ that accrue to the #GOP.lutocracy with that power).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel All written up in sharpie, I expect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Sounds like FOX is going to do it's best to get favorite investment Trump re-elected. All-y'all have done irreparable damage to the US &amp; share responsibility for the #TrumpDeathToll200K.  Funny thing is - your lawyers argue your TV hosts LIE all the time; not even a news network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OK, but since you are so happy to avail yourself of testing resources, you can use this time to go ahead and get @ejeancarroll the DNA test she needs to prove you sexually assaulted her.  And get an IQ test while you're at it. #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq So - no time:    LIE   lie   GOLF   camera   TV  #TrumpDeathToll200K shows Trump running the country to hell as directed by Putin -- yeh, he's on fire alright<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Wow - the very antithesis of Republicanism. Are you announcing you will finally abdicate from the #GOPComplicitTraitors ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimVandeHei Of course - it's always about how the Dems are hemmed in one way or another.  Any direct salient questions they ask will be couched as misogynistic or anti-Catholic by anxious pro-Trump media.  The reverse of 'but her emails'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby .@ejeancarroll requested Trump DNA sample matches? Certainly could be a collateral benefit from any "testing" that is done before the debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert No doubt many earnest folk of the #GOP have grave concerns about Trump. But their love of plutocracy / one-party rule 'uber alles' is their stronger commitment, and for that they are extremely dishonorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures @FoxNews @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Fantastic.  That gives Durham time to expand the investigation into the TENS of MILLIONs of dollars in dubious financial shenanigans  in the last 4 years by the #TrumpCrimeFamily, especially Ivanka and Jared, while daddy diverts taxpayer money to Trump businesses.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeidiNBC Isn't the question: Will they obey the LAW? States have well established laws concerning ballot counting - I don't think #GOP gets to just override those with their new general paradigms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader What a crock. Republicans have sabotaged democracy and are in the final process of destroying the last institutions.

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain After 'hating on' pretty much everything 'democrats' do since you positioned yourself far-right awhile back, I'm sure they're taking heed of your warning. What's NOT GOING to  END WELL is a country subjected to a SCOTUS making decisions not supportive of 70% of US citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ @realDonaldTrump TOTAL CROCK of SHITE! You know Trump's exec order is worthless dribble - with no legal standing.  ALL-y'all #GOPComplicitTraitors are busily trying to take away ACA protections (incl. pre-exist. cond.) even while you deliberately infect 7 million people with CV-19.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clairecmc If that resulted in the Senate being abolished - that would probably be a good thing. It is NOT representative of the people  - basically a tool of suppression for the plutocracy.

<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Statement is self-contradictory, and I'm sure will be self canceling.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP If you nominate a justice BEFORE the election, Republicans can freely ABANDON you to VOTE their conscience (for BIDEN!), as SCOTUS will be packed for decades, and they won't need TRUMP anymore.  #GOP /McConnell WANT you to do this, so they can get rid of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ Thanks for delivering the suicidal blow to your 2nd losing attempt to get elected Senator.  I guess you just want to give one last parting big F-U to democracy on your way out, Ms. appointed senator and handmaid to #MoscowMitchMcConnell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brithume @ZeCat6 Once again Hume offers some BS to try and divert attention from the REAL story of Trump's total incompetence and disrespect for EVERYONE, including the military.

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich He love them as PROPS (only!)  to make it look like he has powerful backing.  Trump knows his own profile on everything (except racism) leaves him looking weak and vulnerable, so he needs heavy artillery to make him "appear" strong.  He his a very weak, WEAK human..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisBrennan To counter M.

<|startoftext|>@GOP If Trump and all-y'all #GOPBetrayedAmerica cohorts had developed a REAL NATIONAL TESTING strategy, PPE  development, and an effective closure to stop CV-19 in its tracks 6 months ago, US would be fine!

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So nice of y'all to be covering for your pain-in-the-buttbuddy Trump as he has once again SABOTAGED himself and ALL Republicans due to his inane narcism and/or fealty to Vladimir Putin.

<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Spoken like a true Trumpublican. #GOP has completely abandoned US democracy. Y'all are just a crime-syndicate desperately trying to avoid your future in prison for the multitude of crimes committed while pocketing taxpayer funds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Guess WaPO is feeling the heat to try and "both sides" every issue (like the NYT) even when the ratio is about 186,000 to 1 in terms of actual weight involved in the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Absolutely! -- that is, once he is far out of reach of the nuclear football, CV-19 response, and has been thoroughly tried for the multitude of crimes he has committed -- we should definitely leave him and the entire #TrumpCrimeFamily  alone in cells to reflect on their past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS Certainly it would BE BEST for you not to claim some MORAL high ground when there is substantial EVIDENCE that you are a corrupt and racist person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Right.  You can be assured it will be a softball q&amp;a in which Barr will be allowed to dispense multiple allegations of 'antifa' or BLM misconduct w/o any real evidence and no cross examination.  LOTS of "Order"...very little "Law".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN UH-huh...keep up the denials -- it's sure to put the question to rest.   Better have a word with Pence about it though -- he simply says "he doesn't RECALL" but does NOT DENY it !!!!  #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @GenFlynn TG "The judiciary" is actually acting like the US Constitutionally mandated 3rd branch of gov't.   If Trump wants to pardon Flynn, he should.

<|startoftext|>@SRuhle This means she is desperate to get re-elected.   Wants both Trumpees and never-trumpers.  Also, she's just being honest - she is totally onboard with anything #MoscowMitch needs/wants, and that means she is totally on board w/DT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance And when GRU does the penultimate number crunch on Nov. 3, any big surplus Biden vote count will suddenly dissipate to just the perfect tip of the elec college to DjT/GOP in key swing states (just like in '16).  We will never know it happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich EXACTLY! For 3 years every DoJ and congressional action has FAILED to hold DT in check - let alone END his criminal presidency; we've been told by 'wise elder statesmen' types the BEST solution is to vote him out.

<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel I'm sure she doesn't want to eternally reckon with the devastation wrought by Trump with all his LIES and misdeeds that she faithfully represented, but I fear her own part in obfuscation and cover-up of these lies are definitely fodder for St. Peter.

<|startoftext|>@johnrobertsFox FASCISM is a powerful drug.  Certainly, if they can get away with it, ALL future presidents (if any) will pocket tens of millions of US taxpayer funds into personal business, and use the full power of US government resources to keep hold of POWER!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP as opposed to #GOP* who want everything to be produced with petroleum-based byproducts, fracking EVERYWHERE, and texas-tea instead of coffee for breakfast.   *Also, throwing in (for free) destruction of the post-office and subservience to Putin/Russia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Fantastic.  The LOONIES are ONE step closer to running the asylum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington trump's special contempt for McCain is probably fueled by the fact that the late Sen. was virulently anti-PUTIN, and was instrumental in beginning the collusion investigation by providing 'Steele Dossier' to US intel .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins @SenFeinstein Not enough Senator.  DeJoy MUST reverse the destruction he and your GOP cronies  have done to USPS to STEAL the ELECTION.  You must assure Maine voters that the election will not be corrupted by Voter suppression and shenanigans by TRUMP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Most IMPORTANTLY (I hope all your supporters appreciate it):  TRUMP surrendered all US foreign policy interests to Putin, and is actively working with Russia to destroy NATO and to enable US troop casualties in Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I notice your "LIKES" are falling way-off. Pretty soon your tweets will be "ratioed" because the MAJORITY of your trumpanzees are giving-up on you, or are part of the #TrumpDeathToll173K ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Sure - he will do that RIGHT AFTER he reprimands PUTIN for Afghanistan troop bounties...   YOU KNOW perfectly well Trump is bought and paid for by PUTIN; and thanks to you, he remains in power destroying western democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins @SenFeinstein About 2 months LATE there, Senator. Your collusion with McConnell to allow DjTrump to rip up democracy in exchange for generous donation$ and plutocratic policy has led to 170,000 negligent deaths; now DELIBERATE deprivation of US Mail which many are dependent on for medications.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamcbest Yes, unless it was taught before the 7th grade when they dropped out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump No, I'm afraid Trump is headed for that one very "special place in hell", so unless his brother was also one of the most vile evil beings whom ever walked the planet, no, they won't meet again.   #TrumpDeathToll172K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Perhaps offer some thoughts and prayers to the families of 170,000 Americans whom have died due to Trump's complete negligence in CV-19 leadership.    And perhaps you could encourage the dotard to STOP POLITICIZING safety measures/school reopenings before he kills 170k MORE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio So #GOPBetrayedAmerica Marco is just going to go ahead and admit that Trump will have his Vlad-dad Putin send over some of thugs like he's about to do in Belarus?

<|startoftext|>@kenvogel @KamalaHarris Man, that must be very disappointing to pro-trumpy reporters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw There must be at least a dozen actual FELONIES that Trump has committed while running for president and DURING is WH occupation.  It is not a "vendetta" to finally prosecute the CRIMES that the ludicrous 'OLC memo' has prevented DoJ from pursuing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang THAT's IT!!! - Trump has officially started a REAL "War on Christmas"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn I suppose that #GOPComplicitTraitors would like to think that asking LEGITIMATE questions about a lifetime SCOTUS appointment is character assassination -- especially since the nomination was specifically to protect  the ruthless criminal Russian Asset in the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJohnEastman Should you lose your tenure as professor at   @chapman_law because you are a SORE LOSER  promoting such RACIST nonsense? Depends on if they want to be considered a legitimate institution...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Oops - he's probably talking about DON McGHAN whom advised him that this old Fed Society alumni would assist in protecting him and the GOPlutocracy during Mueller probe and beyond.

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d He would say it is some part of 'mother Russia', and wouldn't be too far from the truth (unfortunately).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington So, I guess they have to "slum it" now that they are no longer officially royals...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go Aided by complicit GOP-Senate, the US DoJ is protecting and sanctioning the CRIMINAL enterprise in the WH.   If the infamous "OLC MEMO" against indicting a sitting prez (not a law; never legally tested) was not being held sacred  by the DoJ he would be out of WH, if not in jail.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper He's trying to muster his "bemused face" -- you know, that shite-eating-grin that ALL right-wing media guests &amp; pundits wear when attempting to criticize or belittle any Democratic or liberal people/policies.  Unfortunately, his inner terror shines through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney Alas, your completely DEPLORABLE identity is back. Guess you are totally on board the PUTIN/Trump ticket, despite their plans to continue destruction of NATO/ western alliances. Apparently you have no problem with bounties on US troops in the war your daddy started 18 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz @JoeBiden Thank God you are backing the dotard stable genius DEMENTIA TEST-acer who is golfing his way through his drug induced tenure pretending to be a POTUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio "WE"??? DjTrump &amp; his GOP consigliere's should have made this a priority in FEBRUARY, 6 mo &amp; #TrumpDeathToll162K ago.  But all-y'all just let PUTIN control the narrative through his puppet and you DID NOTHING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR How is brutally DESTROYING equivalent to "shaking up"?  Took 2 weeks to get a straight forward priority mail package delivered straight to Fresno IRS PO Box. Something is gravely amiss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent "guess I better start checking twitter to find out if Trump is replacing me by Nikki..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris If anything, they might pursue some meaningful restrictions on the sale of weapons of MASS DESTRUCTION that y'all seem to want to hold US hostage by.    Now go enjoy time at one of your vacation houses bought and paid for by NRA members, before you are forced to relinquish them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @KamalaHarris You mean she has not offered fealty to PUTIN like all-y'all trumpanzess who USED to be conservative but are now just instruments in the Kremlin's destruction of world democracies?  Imagine!   #TrumpCrimeFamily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imillhiser And sadly the gaslight has been a brilliant star to all the LOCAL news affiliates who touted it in headlines last couple of days, albeit with a minor caveats suggesting Dems say it might be illegal, making THEM out to be the villains of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence Unfortunately, due to the complete and utter FAILURE of LEADERSHIP by TRUMP and your-own-self, Mr. CV-19 task force head, much of the nation remains crippled and unable to compete in daily LIVING, period.  Don't try to act like some robust cheerleader here - YOU FAILED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debrajsaunders @realDonaldTrump Only to the extent that TRUMP is the eye of the hurricane. ALL trouble and devastation whirls about him and he brings it on with glee.  He is as close to the DEVIL as any man can muster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz That must be why PUTIN is investing so heavily into his best chance, PUPPET TRUMP!  By George, I think he's got it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guitarviator Absolutely! With the aid of complicit GOP Senate, the DoJ has been protecting and sanctioning an active criminal enterprise in the most powerful position in US/world governments!  Unimaginable peril - and look where we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Is that before or after he allows PUTIN to put bounties on their heads in Afghanistan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN A "bug"? Probably a deliberately installed "feature" by major TRUMP campaign supporter/surrogate  M.Zuckerberg?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenRonJohnson Since you are being so boastfully "tough on Russia" -- how about enjoining Trump to demand PUTIN stop levying bounties on US soldiers, TODAY!    Then STOP facilitating GRU/Ukrainian disinformation &amp; propaganda! #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliVelshi Something I am very curious about: When the Fed buys corporate bonds or otherwise infuse money into the markets to "stabilize" them, is that all added to the National Debt - especially if/when the bonds are defaulted upon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @vicky8651 @realDonaldTrump Yeh, next time you have pillow talk with @KellyannePolls ask her to give you the full scoop on late '16 Trump-campaign's multitude of Russian interactions and Kremlin fealty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Don't kid yourself with the comparison. If Trump/GOP enact his style exec-order simultaneous with court decision to abandon ACA -- Insurers will be unregulated for premium increases, deductibles and limits on preexisting cond's.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@schwartzbCNBC Definitely appears that CNBC and lots of other TRUMP-loving media are the ones waging a campaign against Kamala.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm afraid your definition of what's #illegal is rather #DerangedDonald.  What's illegal is contained in a multitude of indictments waiting for you when you LOSE the election, Bigly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoycottUtah "counterproductive"?? Yeah, it does sort of get in the way of #GOP luctocracy holding onto power though legitimate democratic means...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YES, YOU did participate in the CRIME of the CENTURY! Thanks for admitting that.  As soon as the BS about not indicting a "sitting president" is no longer relevant, AG Barr will be indicted for OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE, and you BOTH will be proven guilty. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Oh yeah! The FBI did after receiving direct evidence that Trump-campaign was conversing with known KGB agents &amp; other foreign actors illegally assisting in his election.

<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump You're overt lobbying to supplant @VP on the ticket to never-neverland this November seems like a career-ender, but since the #GOPBetrayedAmerica , guess there's no where else to go but up Trump's dirty canal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The most impressive numbers are the over 3,000,000 cases, and 132,000 deaths because of Trump's insistence that the US stand down in Jan/Feb '20 so that he could get his little China trade deal done, then profit from CV-19 drugs/PPE. #TrumpDeathToll132K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Fantastic. Grifter-trash-Barbie introduces new PR campaign to gas light unemployed citizens on behalf of the DjT autocracy with cutesy suggestions on how to stay alive after daddy destroyed the country for uncle Vlad! #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump If only for once in your damned career you thought about vulnerable LIVE constituents instead of statues to DEAD traitors and one VAMPIRE Traitor-in-Chief, DjT. #GOPDeathCult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwCongressional Sounds like y'all have quite the man-crush on DjT!!! Careful, you are gonna give Lady-G (@LindseyGrahamSC) the vapors, hitting on his main squeeze! Also, thanks for contributing so much to the #TrumpDeathToll136K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker Might want to investigate Trump's calls with Putin to understand why he wants to kill US citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Yes, that MUST be why Trump completely STOOD DOWN during Jan &amp; Feb and did nothing -- allowing the #TrumpDeathToll132K to start and continue... Nothing at all to do with his Trump's instructions from Putin, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan If by "weaponized", you mean read IC reports the @GOP then suppressed?

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is there still a Federal Death Penalty for TREASON against the US?

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Worst News: #GOPComplicitTraitors continue to aid and abet Trump in down playing CV-19 just to juice the economy - for Nov. election (only).  Also, since you failed to remove the dotard from office, you fully share in the #TrumpDeathToll132K .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Haven't you heard? Under pwesidunce DjTrump, there's NO LAW &amp; Order, just criminals involved in massive conspiracies/crimes, and then being "PARDONED" or commuted.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Southcom Congress must pass a law that says a POTUS can't vacation MORE of the time than he is in DC, and NEVER at his own property -- diverting taxpayer funds to his own pocket.  SHAMEFUL. #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpKillsFlorida<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump By "doing well as we have" you mean following Puppet Master Putin's orders for you to "stand down" and let the killer pandemic "wash over" the US.  You are definitely the founder and CEO of the #TrumpDeathCult .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse You &amp; Trump could care less about the safety of children. You have already shown that in repeated CV-19 testing failures.

<|startoftext|>@AP Absolutely, @BetsyDeVosED: It's not a matter of student safety, of course, but rather the Trump administration must pry open the economy and push pedal to the metal!!! The Fed can only prop-up the stock market, buying junk bonds etc. so long! Nov. 3 is not that far off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradMossEsq As if anyone could try to make an actionable case about any of it anyway? At this point, ALL politics, national defense intelligence and even judicial proceedings/outcomes seem to be a matter of "he said, she said", and rendered subject to political opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@megynkelly I know - we have all heard the stories in NYT how Trump and family bilked millions from the government via tax-fraud / tax-evasion, and that DT's empire is built on Russian mob money laundering ops... same ol' same 'ol. Much more interested in the Mueller grand jury testimony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregolear "Oh no they better not!"  https://t.co/aPKA82wRrm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyKadiK In his demented head, he figures if he and Putin adamantly deny (or claim hoax) GOP &amp; enuf public will believe them and therefore, NO he won't do a thing. Question is will some legitimate patriots in CI or GOP make it CLEAR it AIN'T NO HOAX...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence What became 100% clear today is that B. Kavanaugh is a LIAR and totally flawed justice.  #GOPBetrayedAmerica when they insisted on instilling this political operative after a phony FBI investigation.  Another TRUMP/Pence failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olgaNYC1211 ALL about POWER and $$$$$. The GOP-lutocracy has invested ALL capital in Trump, and fear if he falls, so will they.  Mueller, Intelligence professionals, "patriots" of all sort stand down to enable the continued control of US gov't by a wealthy few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Thanks for clarifying this is YOU.  Inebriated white-trash living in a mansion gained thru tax-evasion or money laundering, brandishing weapons of mass destruction recklessly as neighbors peacefully stroll by.  It really perfectly represents Trump's vision for America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Mike_Pence: Is there a reason You and Trump were NOT briefed on this? Why? Are y'all gonna do anything about Putin's treachery, or is this another Helsinki moment for posterity???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod You work in mysterious ways, I know, but just giving general directions to ground zero seems a little light-weight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Ya know the whole "every fetus is precious life" thing has pretty much been blown out of the water completely by all y'all (same) conservatives not giving a flying-f about hundreds of thousands of people dying from CV-19.  You're just trying to dictate misogyny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenBaratzL I was mesmerized by the slow-moving-wreck of the '16-elec, so I watched #MorningJoe pretty often back then.  Even after Joe &amp; Mika had started turning sour on Trump, Mika would often offer long diatribes about the (horror-o-horrors!) HRC email/server nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrassrootsSpeak T seems to be attempting the hoax-spin angle (just like all things Russia).  HE thinks he can explain it all away by denying it ever happened. WH may be attempting more intricate cover-up on briefing him, but T will undercut them w/tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @nytimesbooks Was wondering how you were gonna SPIN latest treason.  Of course, it's just a set of creative LIES. But gives a great excuse to call Vlad-dad 2-nite and then re-assure US that he says 'Nyet' to doing tomorrow,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Clearly a red-hat pile of propaganda. You are truly one of the stupidest people alive.  Have you EVER done anything to try and make America great?  At this point, quitting your fascist-tweets would help a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Might have --  but today you went golfing with TRAITOR of the millennium DjTrump, after it's been disclosed that he endorsed Putin's killing of US soldiers in Afghanistan. You both are bound for the trash pile of history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood @wolfblitzer The thing is that T probably doesn't really have that much political conviction about it; Trump is simply TOO VAIN, he worries his makeup will be smeared in public.  It takes 3 hours every morning to try to get it right...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence You are a FALSE representative of Christendom. Everything you do is on behalf of the devil-incarnate DjTrump. You and Trump have constantly striven to DIVIDE the nation. You are complicit in the #TrumpDeathToll127K  Go to hell, go straight to hell, do not pass GO Mike Pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump JUST IMAGINE the kind of indictments and punishment coming the way of TRUMP and three eldest spawn!

<|startoftext|>@NatashaBertrand Aren't we still waiting for him to testify about the Roger Stone sentence disruption that was supposed to be back on March 31 (which was 6 weeks after his last travesty of justice?)  He'll never show - he or GOP will figure out some delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerriKupecDOJ Official DoJ endorsement of CORRUPTION??? This is an absolute travesty of American justice and all-y'all POLITICAL appointees who are forsaking the rule of law for fascist authoritarianism NEED to be IMPEACHED. #ImpeachTrumpAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec ABSOULUTELY NOT. This decision shows the TOTAL CORRUPTION of the DoJ under corrupt AG Barr, and the UN-indicted president (individual-1). Of course they are trying to undo that also. A GINORMOUS failure of the DoJ! #ImpeachTrumpAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mburm201 @davidfrum Vlad-the-poisoner-Putin agrees! Totally silly idea that RU used their money-laundering kompromat on DjT and several GOP comrades.

<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule Your point is well taken: OF COURSE I'll be VOTING.

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins Thank you! Obviously you're talking about the TRAVESTY at the DoJ perpetrated by AG William Barr.

<|startoftext|>@KerriKupecDOJ SHAME on you for weak justification of the actions of CRIMINAL AG Barr.

<|startoftext|>@thehill theHILL:  you might want to fact-check or vet yourself.  TRUMP has said tens of thousands of LIES, many repeated over and over.  The DEFAULT setting must be, that if TRUMP SAYS IT, it is most likely a deranged outrageous falsehood (LIE). PERIOD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenvogel @JoeBiden The argument from the NYT appears to be that you need Trump to be perceived as a viable, totally normal candidate for race-coverage since he is such a rich source of material for your inside sources.

<|startoftext|>@orangepeel18 1. Fox news, OANN, Sinclair media (etc., propaganda outlets) 2. Republican cultism (our way or the highway)   3. Complete denial - heads in the sand IF presented any derogatory information 4. BLATENT UNADULTERATED RACISM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump There will NEVER be a public statue of DjTrump, unless it is enclosed with barbed wire and dedicated with descriptions of the holocaust he reigned over in the #TrumpDeathToll122K 2019.

<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Sift through the opinion politics involved in this 'reporting'; Sift through your numerous articles. YOUR work reeks of FEALTY to TRUMP despite occasional required critiques.  YOU are an ACTIVE participant in the #TRUMP2020 CAMPAIGN.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarthaRaddatz Unless you get Bolton to admit that he refused to testify in House impeachment trial because he favors the GOP-plutocracy being in CONTROL rather than allowing US democracy to prevail -- it's gonna be a bunch of pucky-poo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Great counter-programming to daddy-dearest's war on GLBTQ folk. Pretend that Ivanka is woke, while the Trump-regime moves to discriminate and violate human rights and equality wherever possible  Y'all are EVIL in the extreme.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greta @GenMhayden Get OVER IT Greta. DjTrump has systematically DESTROYED all conventions of decency.

<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Your allegiance to Trump and McConnell, no matter how disgusting and racially divisive-- and especially ENDORSING DT's CRIMINALITY by failing to remove him after impeachment has GREATLY contributed to the destruction of civil order and democracy in the US.

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden No, it's mostly just those who conspired with PUTIN to destroy the US, miscellaneous anarchists and violent alt-right extremists.  Not sure if you qualify, but pretty sure you fit in there somewhere. #TrumpDeathToll100K<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Thank you for participating in the end of the Trump-farce WH occupation. History books will forever record how you desecrated church property for a political photo-op just after gassing peaceful demonstrators that Trump was afraid to face.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN Gets pretty difficult to keep straight when most ALL the ANTIFA suspects so far have turned out to be alt-right decoys.  But then THIS is exactly what you &amp; your mentor PUTIN have been planning, ya? Chaos, propaganda and an authoritarian police state. #TrumpDepression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Thing is when a DIVISIVE political figure poses with a religious symbol he knows nothing about for a photo-op, people question his sincerity.  He also seems to have re-enacted the Hitler pose almost perfectly. Also, he is leaning towards authoritarian FASCISM, so there's that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTomCotton You &amp; the entire @GOP have DESTROYED all vestige of law and order in our government.

<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell Perhaps if you allowed US Congress (at least) to see the full un-redacted Mueller Rpt w/302's, we MIGHT believe you, but clearly the Trump-regime is HIDING the real evidence.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse THE People's HOUSE - the WHITE HOUSE is posting tweets promoting VIOLENCE against citizens. REPEAT: POTUS is threatening armed violence against US citizens.  The US is now OFFICIALLY a Fascist DICTATORSHIP.  #TrumpDeathToll100K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence If ONLY you and DJ.Trump had taken pandemic seriously instead of worrying about economic impact to your re-election, 101k US citizens would NOT be DEAD!  I think that GOD must to be curious as to what to do with your "prayers" after causing the NEGLICIDE. #TrumpDeathToll100K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thanks for admitting, ONCE again, that REPUBLICANS require the ability to FIX elections through voter intimidation and restricting access to ballot box.  YOU are the MINORITY party in the US, and you, DjT, have totally DESTROYED GOP electability. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Please, PLEASE help DjT to completely shut-down Twitter AND Facebook;  would be the best thing you've done for Democracy since you (almost) stood up to Trump in '16 as he daily insulted your father and wife in a very personal  dubiously based tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @yoyoel DA! How can Ruski's get inside of mail-box? IS PROBEM!  #TrumpGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod J'accuse A.G  W.Barr of Epstein killin' most foul!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP DjTrump and close GOP co-horts have certainly taken this "opportunity" to further divide the nation and strike DEEP DISCORD.  That is the Republican way of opportunity - EXPLOIT a PANDEMIC for perceived political gain and FINANCIAL Shenanigans. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @MarkMeadows @DevinNunes @realDonaldTrump @jack OH.. BOO-HOO snow-flake. Make your own right-wing batshit-crazy comment platform, where ALL LIES are allowed, and disinformation rules; then  have at it with your sicko-GOP buddies. Meanwhile, DELETE your account. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 .@RodRosenstein has consumed so much Trump kool-aid in the last couple of years, I'm sure his testimony will be thoroughly vetted and adjusted by AG Barr and other DjT consigliere's before presentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @FO_Coalition Hard to believe anything that comes from the mouth an such corrupt politician who uses / abuses US taxpayer funds to promote his political career while defending the Saudi killing of journalists and other autocratic government actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Truly a stupid call to align yourself with DjT's "total exoneration" which is NOT A REAL THING, the Mueller Rpt shows that he is GUILTY of massive COLLUSION. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry   https://t.co/nvJsVDq5Gg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Question: How many people have you caused to DIE with your bogus hydroxychloroquine HUSTLE (invested much)?  You truly are one of the sleaziest of the Trumpanzee pundits, both RACIST and one-dimensional. #FoxNewsLiedAsPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden NOT the proper MAGAT-response, G.  Everyone knows DjT (&amp; GOP) are prolific purveyors of LIES &amp; propaganda. Trump must force media platforms to publish his LIES w/o any fact checking. Even though 100x more focus would be made of any Dem' gaff, the sheer vol of GOP errs overwhelms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltshaub @twistopherrobin Disgusting as it is, if Grassly were to man-up, effect subpoena's and what-not to try to force a hearing or vetting of the matter:  after bouncing around through appellate courts, etc. he knows SCOTUS would side w/Executive plaint. Also EASIER to do nothing (GOP default setting.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp Humph;  WHO woulda thunk that handing over the world's largest BULLY PULPIT to one of the world's most prolific and degenerate bullies would be a GREAT idea? Could it be SATAN!!?? -- nah, just Republicans (&amp; Russian consigliere's).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thank you for ADMITTING that the true objective of REPUBLICANS is to spread PROPAGANDA. free of truth, and loaded with disinformation for the purpose of STEALING ELECTIONs. #TrumpIsAnIdiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz That is sweet as saccharine! GET A ROOM! It will then enshroud two of the most disgusting, corrupt, degenerate half-wits in the universe, and IF the world were fortunate, a lock would then secure your fate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @Twitter Today you revealed to the world that even as you ACT the part of earnest spokesman for Trump WH, you are IN FACT a vile lying unchristian merchant of disinformation and EVIL for the most disgusting president in US history.  Good show!  #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump has reduced @twitter to a cesspool of LIES and DISINFORMATION.  Now, having overseen the NEGLICIDE of 100,000 US citizens, he continues outrageous and libelous attacks on his political enemies. #TakeTrumpOffTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU are totally UNFIT to sit in the Oval Office.  YOU are responsible for the death of TENS of THOUSANDS of PEOPLE. #ResignNowTrump  #TrumpGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume Right, manly-man Brit! Real leaders don't give an " F " about leading the nation out of a pandemic!  They s/b only concerned with looking like they are rebelling against the state, doing EXACTLY as they please; GOLFING and claiming personal VICTORY! #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich and don't worry, Barr will be checked by the 'strong pull' of justice within DoJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren IF YOU are looking for a lessons learned from US response to the PANDEMIC, the MOST OBVIOUS conclusion is that "PRO-LIFE" is NOT a term that can ever be claimed by #GOP or any re-open fanatic/conservatives.  #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricG1247 Seen? Not so much.  Felt and heard speak, definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 @1SnoozyQ Great analysis. But the last issue, "Why doesn't Mueller speak-out NOW" is the most frustrating.  Honest,  upright and true to his word is admirable IF Barr's DoJ / American justice wasn't sinking into chaos and political quagmire as Russia &amp; DjT continue to torpedo the ship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Now do this heart-felt analysis on TEN of the 300 RACIST and/or disgustingly MISOGYNISTIC things that DjTrump has said or tweeted in the last 10 days...waiting. #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden  https://t.co/nvJsVDq5Gg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Are plutocrats that play the stock market like a CASINO with special dice LOADED with INSIDER trading tips considered conservative? Is that what you call yourself - "Conservative"?  BTW, Trump doesn't like your chances in the fall - better resign before he has Barr indict you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Skip the feigned concern and honorable intentions.  You need to IMMEDIATELY SUBPOENA records and officials involved in these firings, especially Pompeo on the SD IG!!!  There is clearly GROSS MISCONDUCT afoot at the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr CONGRATs on your accomplishment of putting COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED 'conservative' (right-cray-cray) JUDGES into lifetime appointments this week.  Besides assisting Trump to further DESTROY DEMOCRACY, thats ALL YOU DID. #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBWolfsthal @michelleinbklyn So true. Since this was posted a few hrs ago, there's already a new Biden-gate re: "black"... with Senators chiming-in....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell DECLASSIFY the FLYNN-KISLYAK conversations then.  YOU don't get to just selectively declassify little tidbits that assist in Trump's assault on FBI or DoJ.  Declassify the whole frigging Mueller Report and 302s, or you are just another RUSSIAN ASSET.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR Y'all #GOP trumpanzee operatives REALLY are gonna need an alternative line of attack to try to keep the oval office occupant in place, seeing as how Trump is the most DERANGED, economically and humanistically challenged IDIOT ever installed as POTUS and all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercedesschlapp @JoeBiden Great words of advice coming from a ludicrously deranged white supremacist #GOP political operative.  NOTED #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Thank you for clarifying that you ar NOT ONLY a sycophant, but also a very phony Christian and are as DERANGED as the dotard in the WH. #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Thanks for the 'heads-up', but it has been OBVIOUS for 3 years now that Senate Republicans (and entrie #GOP) will DO ANYTHING to stay in power, including the complete DESTRUCTION of DEMOCRACY to bolster their dear-leader, even though they know Trump is a deranged POS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 1 point for each THOUSAND people you have killed with NEGLICIDE.  Given you pandemic response, you'll soon be at 200% stable-genius. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelJMorell Trump's pick of Ratcliffe is specifically to STIFLE all intelligence gathered about his several consigliere's in Saudi, Turkey, Israel, and RUSSIA  -- to suppress the release of info to congress and other eligible parties.  It's ALL about control - personnel matters be damned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuancyClayborne If you ingest a sufficient quantity of lysergic acid diethyl amide (LSD) you will come to know the true meaning of this and ALL profound matters (for an hour or two, at least).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronmyers @CNNPolitics Th statement is a diplomatic word salad; IN REALITY, Trump is trying to force all states to reopen schools ASAP - health consequences be DAMNED - just to support his reelection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Lovely words @FLOTUS, as DjT PUSHES to send ALL kids back to school immediately to help his reelection; your death or severe illness a small sacrifice for helping the KING-baby to stay out of prison.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McFaul Motivations for Trump-regime NEVER involve "what's good for U.S."  but rather 'what's GOOD for us (DT, Putin + consigliere's)" as you well know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump You're thanking Trump for killing 100,000 people with his NEGLICIDE, and now you are applauding his plans to re-open economy, UNSAFELY, with NO TESTING or contract-tracing plans which will lead to hundreds of thousands more deaths. Pro-life? NEVERMORE #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeSington Astounding amount of info on that subject from @CaslerNoel on this podcast:  https://t.co/4yh4YjCzqE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Absolutely! He should double his dose, since he is so convinced. He and @IngrahamAngle are SOoo convinced, you'd think they "own stock" in the company!  He and all the MAGA followers should also start drinking clorox on a daily basis, and purify this mess of a country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiaFarrow $$$. and also probably on account of Putin told'm to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom AT THE MINIMUM, he needs to qualify the end of that statement with "... any longer".    since he's REPEATEDLY used his office PRIMARILY for PARTISAN political purposes since he took over and started stifling all Meuller investigations and indictments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jadedcreative "The Apprentice".  The concept seemed good, but the tasks were sophomoric, and a GROSS, fake corporate exec was the ringmaster.  I already knew this host was a failure/fraud in NY real estate, but I thought I'd try to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffFlake Right - just as EVERY Republican should have been horrified by the DAILY travesties dictated by the deranged POTUS since January '17, but instead have relished in the destruction of US democracy in favor of POWER and $.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT So "being best" of you to try to infuse grace into the RACIST @FLOTUS who supported Trump in birtherism and then MOCKED children in cages with her "I don't really care" ensemble.

<|startoftext|>@tedcruz The mantra of MAGA and Repubs since DjT has been that college is for cucks.  The #GOP despises higher education unless it for plutocrat kinder, or universities totally committed to a white-evangelical agenda, so there's THAT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP Implying that Republicans are just FINE with it? Of course they are.  Let Trump and his authoritarian regime CRIME at WILL!!! US Constitution be damned!  ANYTHING Trump does, including killing 100,000 citizens is FINE! #TrumpLiesPeopleDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Fantastic that y'all highlight this CNN, since everyone in America's TOP CONCERN is how poor misunderstood, media-battered WH occupant TRUMP's image is fairing, and what he plans to do to stay in position to kill a hundred thousand MORE citizens (at least!). #TrumpLiesPeopleDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecAzar You mean when Jared involved himself and  Pharma cronies to monetize  the action? Or when the Trump-regime examined CV-19 strictly from the perspective of his re-election impact? That's all the evidence I can find to support your statement on immediacy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Figures you would keep close tabs on RT.  Is that where you get all of your instructions from the GRU, or are they received via RandPaul? We know Trump gets his weekly agenda items from Vlad-the-poisoner directly in his cell phone calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Lawrence oops - he did it AGAIN #DerangedDonald #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington what's all that blue stuff in the air?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Rather, it seems that you did EXACTLY what PUTIN told you to do -- NOTHING -- for months, and then deliberately made your LAME response to the pandemic a CULTURE WAR &amp; disinformation campaign. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley How nice for YOU! MEANWHILE, authoritarian dictator Trump is firing all inspectors-general interfering with his criminal behavior. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR that'is killing hundreds of thousands of citizens.  If you can't check him, definitely TIME to RETIRE! #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you frigging KIDDING? Zuckerberg is IN BED with the Trump campaign, and Doresy bends over backwards protecting your violence-inducing, RACIST, health endangering tweets that constantly violate even @twitter standards. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump "I will NEVER LIE to you" Ms. McEnany lied, as she took an oath to Americans, continuing to spread disinformation and falsehoods and generally prevaricating when the UNTRUTH of what she says is just too OBVIOUSLY a LIE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Also, some have asked if Trump has STOPPED beating his wife, but there is no hard evidence he ever did...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley AMAZING what happens when the POTUS actually READS the DIB.  Can you imagine CARING that RUSSIANS were invading the US election process and infrastructure?

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson @SenatorLoeffler Don't worry, I'm sure the AG got word to her that this 'investigation' would only cover select  "&lt;100% trump-loyal" congressfolk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Cool, CNN - you are doing your BEST to make this into a real-live story! But I'm afraid Putins-Puppet is just a moldy piece of soggy wood.  But you just keep clapping your hands together and providing click-bait, who knows? Fairy tales can come true, just like "her emails"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Sure, right after the Senate holds hearings on why Trump completely disregarded numerous warnings on CV-19 and took the advice of your mutual comrade, Vladimir Putin, to let hundreds of thousands of Americans DIE. #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Sounds like another confessional tweet - you know that he has consigliere's whom play the market with long positions  OR SHORTS just 'ere T makes some market-MOVING-twits that he alerts them too in advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Kremlin-Kevin speaks the truth according to PUTIN and the Trump-Russia conspiracy.  ALL the answers that AMERICANs NEED are inside the un-redacted MUELLER REPORT/grand jury testimony -- which AG Barr &amp; the GOP continue to suppress.  STOP LYING for Vlad-the POISONER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimStrassel Gee, if ONLY the un-redacted MUELLER Report was released along with grand jury info - NOW THERE would be a treasure trove of ALL the relevant information and EVIDENCE --- but some AH at DoJ is BARRing the release. Trump should demand it ALL BE DECLASSIFIED!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang @fromthebunkerjr Right. And suddenly, ALL financial pundits, conservative and MSMedia will suddenly join in a daily chorus about how the deficit and nat'l-debt are the great DOOM awaiting the US (except, of course, any WS bail-out money required).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don't have to go to COLD case files to find ACTIVE LITIGATION vs defendant TRUMP!!!

<|startoftext|>@ZandarVTS Right. Lot's of noise suggesting there is a "long arch of justice that will prevail"; MEANWHILE the GOP Senate &amp; authoritarian/Opus Dei champion AG Barr, laugh it off and keep the DoJ under thumb as they grant the dotard free reign to continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @SecSebelius Amazing!  Pretty soon all those stable-geniuses will get the connection that taking down your umbrella in a rain storm can lead to getting soaking wet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Don't worry - according to DoJ insiders, Barr will charge Obama with TRUMPED-up BS indictment even more obscure than McCabe's in order to discredit BO's HUGE election-campaign bump for BIDEN.  GOP-dirty tricks will surely PREVAIL, with the help of the MOST CORRUPT AG is history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Are their Vegas odds on the expected SCOTUS outcome? I expect that 5-4 FOR an " executive privelidge ruling" would be a pretty SOLID bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Glad to see that you are correcting any impressions that patriotic Americans might have gotten during the impeachment process that you might stand up to the DOTARD in the WH, and instead come out with further evidence that you remain a belligerent EVIL PRICK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YES YOU ARE the BIGGEST POLITICAL CRIMINAL in US history and are in fact a poisonous, traitorous ACTIVE RUSSIAN operative continuing to bring down the US in order to repay your billions of debt to Vlad-dad Putin and his oligarchs. #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @EsperDoD @SecPompeo Definitely a confederacy of dunces!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, I heard that you got an A+ from PUTIN;  Harasho comrade, Harasho!!!  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Just what we need - another CROCK of sycophantic BS from State.  You and Trump have made the US a laughing stock and GREATLY diminished our standing in the world and peaceful prospects for all.  But PUTIN is plenty-pleased with you BOTH, so there's that....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @SecretaryRoss He's been hunkered down at his Palm Beach Estate for several weeks diligently working on commerce strategies that will fully exploit the CV-pandemic to the benefit of oligarchs -- betwixt frequent naps, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReddogOHIO "Investors" (traders) have no where else to park all their tax-free funds; bonds / money market returns are minuscule - so they bet the long side and hedge with plenty of puts (if wise) and periodically make BIG$ with huge market moves (esp. w/inside info). It's a crooked casino.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol You KNOW it's more nefarious than that... GOP SPECIFICALLY don't want any city folk or 'ethnic' folk to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeChatfield Good point - but terrible analogy.  Trump has been working around the legislature since 2019 -- and with the aid of GOP-biased-SCOTUS has been fundamentally avoiding all congressional oversight and congress' power of the purse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eden_Sarbanes Jarvanka work without wages! - but make no mistake; dashing about the world (w/staff and security) in order to finagle real-estate funding while on secret foreign missions (all on taxpayer million$) requires some serious assistance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews I don't know how RU SANCTIONS work (for Crimea invasion and '16 elec). Does Congress control them or can he unilateral lift 'em?  Sure seems like he'll SOON be pushing for reversal of them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert idk - seems like a lot of toxic people whom s/b sick have some natural-toxic immunity; but I hope she at least helps him to get rid of that disgusting grandpa-Munster beard thing he has going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We can tell how excited you are!!! You even called PUTIN immediately to tell him how you got W.Barr to do your dirty work--just like when you told Russian's Lavrov and Kislyak in the WH about firing Comey back in '17!  When are you gonna call for REMOVING ALL RU SANCTIONS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Isn't there anything Senate Judiciary (albeit Dem's minority) can do to IMPEACH or at least register some form of CENSURE against Barr? This is so outrageous, I feel like DoJ is a complete farce and we now live in an autocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump You &amp; all trumpublicans can spin, toss &amp; turn the Flynn story around as much as you like with corrupt AG Barr as your circus ringmaster; the fact remains that FLYNN and TRUMP conspired with Russia to overturn sanctions in return for '16 elec help - BOTH are traitors to the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Absolutely! I understand that sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska has infiltrated KY Rusal aluminum plant to launder rubles and devise nefarious ways into US infrastructure. There must be a big investigation into that!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Perhaps you could do a little more thank a quick thank-you; perhaps you could work to STOP the #TrumpCoronavirusTestFailure.  MEANWHILE - u r signaling a yea-vote for unqualified selection of Ratcliffe for DNI?  Going all out to protect T and Putin on your way out of the Senate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Enthusiasm for Putin's ongoing antics to destroy USA is quite the thrill-ride for sure.  Just hope there are a few citizens still alive to see who survives the #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PostOpinions Oh - that's just the beginning of the let's avoid...game. Expect a massive push for getting over ALL things TRUMP related as the GOPlutocracy tries to recuperate from DjT  and the #Trumpdemic in 2021 and beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @SpeakerPelosi Can't help but think it's also a PARANOIA thing with T; he's afraid someone will find any discarded mask of his and be able to analyze it for: 1) Make-up rubbed off  2) DNA (for rape discovery)!!!  3) recent pharmaceutical residue (e.g, Adderall)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan "Missing in Action" best describes the oval-occupant during the CRITICAL 1st days of this pandemic.  Also MIA, the entire Republican party which has allowed the Traitor-in Chief to mislead this country to promote the  #GOPGenocide .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waltshaub Can't help but think T got some serious 'internal' feed-back that SHUTTING CV-TF down right now displays major  INCOMPETENCE, so he 'pivoted' to keep it alive (but he'll muzzle all CV statistics/discussion to the press he don't want to hear).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidMuir @realDonaldTrump Nice softball questions with NO follow-up when he gave BS or obviously FALSE responses!  I hope @ABC and Disney have BIG bonuses for you for assisting the Trump reelection campaign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 So, according to GOP-world, he is definitely IN, ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 I expect their are deeper levels of nefariousness involved in Trump's NOT wanting information of MANY WARNINGs by CDC, WHO and others during the months of Dec-Feb to be released - the period in which he basically followed Vlad's advice to DO NOTHING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Sure - the cure to the country's ills right now is to make DjTrump DICTATOR for LIFE &amp; consolidate ALL POWER under the executive.  He could then designate fiefs with little corrupt overlords such as you to fully plunder any national wealth. BRIBERY must be LEGALIZED! #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Right.  This IS the TRUMP campaign strategy, America: TRUST the DEVIL YOU KNOW is CORRUPTly engaged with multiple world villains -- why gamble on the unknown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent "Serving" up a big slice of far-right conservative judgments with a heaping helping of national treasure for all  plutocratic GOP patrons, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance This whole deal with unqualified judge confirmations ... WTF!?   How is it possible that our democracy allows such a BLATANTLY POLITICAL system of establishing justice (judges).  Was this really the plan formulated by 'founders', or has it been terribly corrupted over time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Yeh, and if @ewarren were presumptive nominee, we'd be getting mass quantities of strategies and daily CV defense PLANS, but, ALAS, we have Biden, so the msm must produce alternative 'thoughts' to spice up the news cycle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU are personally responsible for the DEATHS of 70,000 US citizens due to your incompetence and DELIBERATE NEGLIGENCE. #TrumpCoronavirusTestFailure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump You are admitting the part where DJ dotard and Jarvanka have being working full time, behind the scenes, to manipulate and hoard PPE production for political manipulation and MAXIMUM corporate profits to GOP donors.  Thanks for the inside info. #GOPDeathCult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier Sure - we'll take a look at that possibility right after Trump authorizes the release of his tax-returns and the Mazars documents about his numerous financial entanglements with Russians via Deutsche Bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can't wait to see the full disclosure of how you manipulated the military to divert flights there so you could make EXTRA CASH looting the US treasury.  You remain the #MostCorruptPOTUS in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash Cover invoked by altruist who KNOWs his candidacy is a camouflaged special-op for the PLUTOCRACY to dissuade voters from THE REAL cure for Trump. A humble candle-in-the-wind against the monstrous fascism that is the DT-regime (which includes your sponsors - the evil Devos family)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump .@NicolleDWallace has more integrity and honor in her left pinky than You could ever dream of attaining given your corrupt and criminal biography. You are just angry that she exposes TRUTH about the #TrumpGenocide and your failure in fighting CV-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Wow - I think you just discovered a ginormous mother-lode (NO pun intended re: Ivana Trump's rape by DjT) for the Dems to mine.  Totally mine-blowingly rich discovery of gold; much more than all the gold lame' in Trump tower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newrepublic Right. If only Dems knew how to broadcast mega-LIES each day and do a CLOWN-side-show like Trump and the GOP have been doing for three years; then we would have a real horse-race! Of course, democracy might be forced onto a ventilator by then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman If we get any further into hypocrisy land, we might even spy the GOP and the plutocratic right in front of us, albeit, an unbeatably well organized cartel of hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He CAN"T stop himself. To DjT, EVERYTHING (including pandemic) is an opportunity to be exploited for pure political &amp; E$PECIALLY FINANCIAL chicanery. He has refused to act as POTUS for all Americans since 2017.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA I expect that if Mueller grand-jury testimony PLUS any FBI CI investigation were made public, quite a few avenues of corruption would be clearly revealed (especially with RU/NRA) HENCE, the perennial Barr cover-up &amp; SCOTUS deference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @GenFlynn #KremlinKevin and other emissaries of Putin have been at it for days now to warp the view of TRAITOR Flynn in efforts to 'soften' a pardon for him (&amp; Stone, Manafort) and eventual dropping of RU sanctions. SO TRANSPARENT! #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @ryangrim Just seems odd to me that this story is being spotlighted and sponsored so enthusiastically by frustrated bernie-bros and sisters like Sarandon - along with all the Russian bots and affiliates (like the GOP).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Now do a profile of Trump.  Could include a lot of the same plus hundreds of thousands of deaths due to intentional neg-licide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecondLady @foxandfriends Remember, bible-studies teach, how there is a big SIN called "LYING"? Hard to believe you can maintain your holier than thee ever-presence with a true heart when, in fact, for PURELY POLITICAL PURPOSES, you are lying for your sycophantic husband who just didn't want to p-o Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyRichter As you progress in the movie, you'll see the superintendent character has some cause for this, though maybe a natural Jackman feature?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller Still the plan to UNDO it all.  Putin wants all sanctions lifted and Trump needs to please Vlad.  PARDONS for Flynn, Stone, Manafort required to eliminate possible cooperation testimony against any RU conspirators or complicit GOP; conservative media setting up the framework.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash Nice of you to reach out to the regular folk for $$$ to help fund this Billionaires-for-America campaign to keep the plutocracy strangle hold over US alive and thriving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash Malignant hogwash.  You are simply running billionaire interference against only possible remedy to Trump-which is Biden. I suppose it assuages your guilt seeming to be ANTI-trump when ya know it's just about securing Plutocrats control over the economy. 60,000 dead thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Unfortunately, US citizens are tied up trying to crawl out from under the oppressive, authoritarian, &amp; genocideal Trump regime - thanks again for your efforts to keep that despot in full charge of the nuclear arsenal and CV-19 response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul @justinamash Suggest you consider @CheriJacobus about the subject  https://t.co/8n2EMRTCpf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Just one of those confession/self-own tweets where he acknowledges the GOP/RU modus-operandi of adding diversionary candidates and topics to confound and warp electoral college results (as with Stein).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Thank God they are there to judge the politically correct way to engage in "me-too".  Obviously, their OWN (&amp;DjT's) clear respect for women sets a glorious example, and BY NO MEANS do they ever indulge in any HYPOCRISY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 Mostly it's about being a 'mini-me' to trump - to show the boss that @VP, like T, won't be intimidated by CV and is 'above the hoax of this epidemic' and feels no need to re-inforce any libtard social distancing guidelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast On a crowded flight home from Maui one evening years ago, a last ray of sun was shooting thru cabin windows such that I could clearly see hundreds of particles of dust, droplets, or whatever(?) calmly floating about in the air, and I thunk: omg...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington Have no evidence, but It seems likely Pence just being "mini-me" for Trump whom also refuses to wear a mask or show any respect for social-distancing guidelines. Probably thinks it helps trump&amp;he to seem "above" the mess, and probably interprets T as expecting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Another genius idea from daddy / Putins-butt-buddy DjT:  ignore daily briefings and "let CV-19  'wash-over' America", then have jets fly over cities to remind folks their is NO TESTING STRATEGY;    ENJOY! #PresidentClorox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @IvankaTrump The comparison of your manufactured political-slur on Biden to the ACTUAL DOCUMENTED GRIFT and SELF-DEALING being shown every day by Ivanka &amp; the rest of the #TrumpCrimeFamily is ludicrous.  Barr's barring Trumps from indictments is the only thing keeping 'em out of prison!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm That along with AG Barr's continued foray into all possible avenues of Executive oversight pretty much make Trump a king. Is this a great country or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliehonig The thing is, this "well known anchor" @MariaBartiromo was ONCE an esteemed business reporter at @CNBC, but she COMPLETELY SOLD OUT to Murdoch seven years ago and has been a TOTAL TRUMP sycophant and propaganda pontificator for him on Fox-business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness @FoxNews @SundayFutures COOL- you are TOTALLY on-board with the Trump-Barr attempt to REWRITE history and deny the very obvious RUSSIAN invasion of US (w/help of Trump, Stone, Flynn, MbS, and a cast of hundreds of other criminals)! I expect the pardons 2begin flying SOON!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington just look at his tweets - he's obviously hold up in his boudoir/tanning-tent 'live tweeting' fux'n'fiends all a.m. or last night's tivoed Hannity...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Did ANYBODY in the world, ESPECIALLY at the NYT, ever believe that Trump was,  in fact, either STABLE or a GENIUS?  If so, ya NEED to get your eyes/ears/BRAIN and basic HUMANITY checked!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/oGSZIhDZDq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Other issues .. probably the biggest of which is that they watch friggin FOX-Noise that disseminates daily doses of toxic DISINFORMATION to their viewers every day. Y'all are definitely in on the BLEACHING of America and the spread of the #TrumpVirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockyMntnMike It was apparent from the first episode of "Bosom Buddies".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington T's super bro-man❤️ce with KJ-u has always seemed 2b one of his more deranged public performances  -- is it all in pursuit of that ever-elusive Nobel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ 50%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oops - got caught flipping after you had already FLOPPED spectacularly (again, and again). You better keep MEDIA propaganda support on a faster speed dial roster, to keep the DIS-INFORMATION campaigns in sync!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @parscale Man who commands dozens of Russian trolls on Facebook to do Trump disinformation is an EXCELLENT source for medical and social commentary for the GOP. #GOPGenocide needs strong leaders like DjT to reduce the number of US voters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonFlan X-specially dumb, because so many SENIORS (e.g., me mum) are DEVOTED to US Mail and look to it each day for their lifeline to the world.  Sure, T - espouse cutting USPS off at the knees -- see how many VOTES that gets you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews @weijia  https://t.co/9bokQkgc6d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Ya know, Ly'inTED,  ever since the GOP joined TRUMP on his ADDERALL fueled meth-flight into DERANGEMENT-LAND, the HIGH-road goes through  all sorts of convoluted dimensions. #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews @weijia GEE, do you think the fact that TRUMP recommended that US citizens POISON themselves with household cleaners is "controversial" ?  Fake News! #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Yes, because then I don't have to read tedious stories about Trump inc/China billions in loans now DUE , or McConnell/GOP systematically destroying the US with partisan politics during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surgeon_General I.E.: The deranged dotard  WH occupant #TrumpIsNotADoctor.  In fact #PresidentLysol, as PER USUAL, is issuing dangerous disinformation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee Fantastic.  I can't think of a better "test subject" to prove that CV-19 is perfectly survivable.  Definitely go to VEGAS after that and gamble with horde at reopened Trump International Hotel/Casino!!!!! DO IT!!   Please, for the sake of MAGA!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @POTUS This administration "committed"? There must be one helluva trillion dollar boondoggle involved wherein the #TrumpCrimeFamily gets some hefty bonuses.

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Did you DIRECTLY Short ETFs with China-related companies BEFORE this tweet, or does your broker just have everything thoroughly hedged these days? Always interesting watching the S&amp;P just before/after Trump's financial tweets &amp; your own market movements #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kris_Sacrebleu I expect there are also deep entanglements between Russians, several key GOP lawmakers, and Federalist  Society overseers -- but all evidence carefully secreted away by Barr's DoJ/FBI/CIA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RockyMntnMike I'm wondering how far I can go to 'qualify' his signature on the check with colorful accolades before it might be considered un-cashable?  It IS in the memo-section...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ya JUST DON'T GET IT, do you??? Every stupid-ass tweet is one more nail in your political coffin.  Even my evangelical kin are not buying your dotard-in-a-pandemic excuse of NOT being a solid LEADER.  Willful disruption and chaos for your buddy Vlad-the-poisoner? #TrumpIsALooser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahkendzior And that Seurat work is huuuuge (in real life)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Thus the OFFICIAL GOP RESPONSE to CV-19 is to promote INSURRECTION in states requiring SOUND MEDICAL POLICY business restrictions.  $$$$ over LIFE. Shut your lying mouth about abortion while you sponsor death and destruction in the US. #GOPDeathPanels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @CNN Thank God! So tired of hearing the delusional deranged dotard putting out propaganda and trying to start a civil war in the US.  Shame on you and the PUTIN-puppet-potus for your constant EVIL output. #TrumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews WHY MUST YOU try to sanitize the outrageous statements in support of GENOCIDE uttered by this man? He didn't even really apologize - it was a calculated diversion from his DELIBERATE PLAN to KILL CHILDREN for TRUMP.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RayGarc72738880 @TheSandman24 @DrunkMattGaetz @seanhannity Amazing, especially, because he received hundreds of million$ in real-estate laundry bonuses from Ruski  oligarchs along the way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN Press Sec job involves YOU STANDING before American people and providing HONEST ANSWERS about WH actions.  We don't need another friggin' media critic -- that is all that Trump does all DAY. #TrumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN @SenThomTillis If ONLY you cared about US citizen LIVES as much as you love BS-propaganda polls -- with a little further help from Putin -- you might actually get a 2nd term. #TrumpLiesPeopleDie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SecAzar @HHSGov Fantastic. Another PUTIN consigliere.  Y'all are definitely advancing Vlad-the-Poisoner's ongoing agenda of having the sleaziest goons assist the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate to bring down the US while assisting Kremlin money laundry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Sure - presidents should be more Trumpy &amp; brand everything for maximum political gain - the underlying intent or sobriety of the matter is irrelevant.  Also, they definitely should take FULL advantage of promoting personal business and subsidizing with taxpayer funds. Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC I'm afraid IT is TRUMP whom is destroying himself - country is collateral damage. #GOPGenocide   https://t.co/skFqrZ6s42<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Yes, to the extent that the DEM agenda was to SAVE LIVES.

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Every frigging thing about YOU, @GOP and Trumplethinskin is VERY SAD and VERY DANGEROUS.  Y'all are directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands due to combination of incompetence and fealty to PUTIN. #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney Nice of you to deflect Trump's claim of having the power of a total AUTHORITARIAN DICTATOR into a Fed v. State thing.  In fact, thanks to GOP backers, Trump has been acting as an INFALLIBLE KING ever since impeachment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbsnewspath @NatalieABrand Twump can think all he wants about all this while he practices putting in the Oval, but he has NO SUCH POWER.

<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ @realDonaldTrump @VP How much quid pro quo involved in this little arrangement? Another guaranteed "Nay" vote in next impeachment of #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes @ChuckRossDC COOL! Then it's definitely time for counter-Intel findings and M.Rpt grand jury interviews to be declassified &amp; offered to the public so we can understand ALL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED with Trump and his Russian consigliere's to clear up errors &amp; misconceptions. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm 'm sure the market rise has NOTHING to do with hedge-funds / proprietary traders SHORTING and putting the shit out of the S&amp;P a few weeks back, and now just doing a SHORT SQUEEZE/covering this past week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh - don't KID yourself. THE "Enemy" of America is out and about each day CONSTANTLY dis-informing citizens and being a ginormous ass that we are forced to watch if we want some real medical info and guidance. #TrumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump On the Money! Exactly the kind of sentiment that a good disciple of LUCIFER would have.  #TrumpBurialPits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump While DIS-Informing the public about CV-19 &amp; pushing snake-oil remedies you are also trying to disrupt Dem's nomination?

<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ @lowrad57 Didn't you get the memo? As chief law enforcement officer, Barr certifies that  EVERYTHING Trump does is 100% legal &amp; must be faithfully adhered to, no matter how ludicrous or unconscionable.  Also, he endorses any magical cures suggested by T. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Trump is trying to ENSURE we have NO IDEA how he allocates the Cares Act funds.  No doubt MOST of this money will go to cronies and consigliere's. Congress must mandate SPECIFIC amounts to be spent where it actually HELPS CITIZENS, something GOP knows nothing about. #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake Aside from the obvious Bill  Barr commitment to theory of unilateral EXECUTIVE POWER over ALL (not to be questioned!), the AG must also have some specific ALLEGIANCE to PUTIN in his motivation.  Is that part of the secret Opus Dei platform?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO Right - I'm sure there is LITTLE chance that majority of funds will be sent to specific cronies/consigliere's of the most corrupt POTUS in history with no disclosure. Why should taxpayers worry about that? Better we just trust  DjT/GOP, renowned for their general public interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Ms. McDaniel, we ALL know  (incl. Trump) that GOP wins many states through MASSIVE VOTER SUPPRESSION!  National GOP and SCOTUS conservatives are desperately using the pandemic to favor 'R's by making it impossible for citizens to vote. #GOPVoterSuppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash Right. What America Deserves is for Trump to have been removed from office, along with his Ukraine-extortion accomplice @VP - then a RESPONSIBLE adult (@SpeakerPelosi) would be LEADING the US through this pandemic.  But GOP &amp; "conservatives" (plutocrats) on SCOTUS prevented this,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNBCnow @blakehounshell Great time to sell all individual stock long positions NOW!  Then, I'm sure it will be much easier for KL&amp;hubby to just do a few major puts or ETF short sales positions here/there to profit from the coming volatility - esp with all the inside info &amp; cues from Trump tweets, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein @GreenPartyUS Yes - all the progressives should get together to ENSURE Trump gets another 4 years-life(?) - mostly for the Kremlin's benefit.  Putin will have carte blanche to continue destroying the US. Hope you are getting plenty good rubles outta the deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle So this makes it all ok? Now that the market is roaring again, good time to sell more - quick before the S&amp;P downslide resumes...  what a crock! #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Right.  Also, every American MUST be forced to take a dozen doses of Hydroxychloroquine by order of Trump and fox-news.  I'm sure you will take FULL responsibility for the results of your May-DAY call to action! #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends REASON it doesn't work out well for REPUBLICANS is they are a SMALL MINORITY of the g-pop.  When citizens are able to vote, they elect truly representative politicians, NOT PLUTOCRATS. The "voter fraud" argument is ludicrous and statistically insignificant. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Under the Federalist Society's proud patronage, SCOTUS and much of the judiciary is now FULLY PARTICIPATING in keeping a GOP YOKE on the US to ensure ultimately, deep  conservative Republicans will keep vital control of this "democracy" (masked-plutocracy), pandemic be damned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader So EXTREMELY Trumpian of you - LIAR  who accuses others of lying.  Why are you so obsessed with this subject when you should be working to ensure free elections &amp; other government stuff that is RELEVANT in this PANDEMIC, HERE in the US. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani So just how much money ($$$$ ka ching! $$$$) do you and other Trumpy consigliere's have invested in companies that will profit from this unproven drug regimen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker "...comes in the name of the lord..."  Do yo really think that whomever wrote this gospel meant that any philistine or judas that "pretends" to be a Christian is exalted?  Better reflect on that charlatan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump CONGRATULATIONS on your promotion to WH press sec. TRUMP requires someone who is a complete SYCOPHANT and whom will prevaricate, gaslight, and LIE repeatedly w/o shame.   You fit this bill PERFECTLY! #kayleighmcenany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is the day, by virtue of your "TONE" and "LEADERSHIP SKILL" that you definitely became a president.  In fact, #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER, by any standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @CarrieSweet2017 "WE" the people are controlled &amp; manipulated by GOP US Senate, SCOTUS, and countless R-controlled State legislatures/courts to ensure GOP retains power at all costs. They don't even bother to gesture towards constitutional democracy anymore.  I fear "we" get no say in the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman As per USUUAL, the GOP is all about VOTER SUPPRESSION.  Even during a pandemic.  GOP does NOT want citizens to vote.  Period.   Shameful.  #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CillizzaCNN Or - he should go with a "magic 8-Ball", maybe? I understand that works really well with pandemic advice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeromeAdamsMD @soledadobrien Can't tell you how embarrassing it is to watch you kowtow to POTUS Trump &amp; his dangerous medical advice and LACK of  leadership skill.  I know this is a premium gig for you, but your CREDIBILITY is KAPUT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Gee - I hope you'll still be able to make your TEE TIME! Oh, I forgot, you and Melanie are playing "doubles" with models on the new WH court you had taxpayers buy for y'all.   Must be Nice! #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JYSexton EXACTLY. Perhaps, at first, mostly incompetence and stubborn reluctance to take threat seriously. But DT/regime immediately pivoted to financial opportunities and political chicanery once they realized the full magnitude of the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterbakernyt @djrothkopf @maggieNYT @npfandos @charlie_savage But the good news is: Trump's TONE is still somber, sometimes, during press briefings...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer I.E., Propaganda WORKS!  If POTUS is going to give "hope" via DISINFORMATION and pie-in-the-sky solutions, no amount of TRUTH-SEEKING by the press will offset it.  Great point. #FoxNewsLiedAsPeopleDied<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @LaraLeaTrump Will be extremely entertaining to watch all-y'all spinning and/or deliberately LYING about the obvious FACT that DJT is directly responsible for killing tens of thousands of US citizens by his incompetence and deranged mishandling of the epidemic. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RalfusJ But the GOOD news is that his secret share of Rosneft is fairing very well today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Right, because at this juncture, the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE at hand for you is enhancing the riches of fossil-fuel corporations (including those in your portfolio (including Rosneft?)) and your murderous consigliere's PUTIN and MbS! #TrumpMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Just wait till the lawsuits against fox-news start examining the depth of YOUR complicit lies and disinformation associated with this plague.  Millions of devoted FOX watchers were unnecessarily exposed because of your network.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meenaharris I would counter that EVERYDAY while Trump inhabits WH is just another Deranged-Groundhog-day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKatiePorter Right On!  It's very easy to imagine DT/Mnuchin sending vast sum$ to shady businesses for his personal benefit or rewards to consigliere's that will have NO BENEFIT to general public.  Especially if he gets an infrastructure bill beyond the current authorized 'stimulus' bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSEveningNews Nice that you give the softball interview with this man who is CLEARLY NOT DOING his JOB - no questioning how he DIDN"T READ the 3 page Roosevelt Captain'e etter PLEADING for HELP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @tedcruz So the president WAS IMPEACHED - for doing ILLEGAL treason-based CRIMES.  IF ONLY TRUMP hadn't done that...MEANWHILE, Trump GOLFed and GOP adjusted their stock portfolios for WEEKS after end of trial.  POTUS did nothing but DENY Covid-19. STOP with the BS! #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Blessed would be a Senator from Florida who helped his state fight the #TrumpVirus by insisting the Gov. institute a mandatory lockdown instead of constantly fellating DT and trying to act righteous.   Common Decency 101<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr It's called PUBLIC SERVICE and careful editorial practice related to the public-GOOD!  They do NOT want deliberate DISINFORMATION make the #Trumpdemic worse than it is, so they have to edit out the Donald's campaign-BS parts of the pressers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC I would have given generously to PRE-Dec'17-golf-with-Trump Lindsey, back when you were a man who stood for solid conservative principals. But since you became total sycophant to  #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER and part of his pro-kremlin enterprise -NO WAY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ALSO: GOP Senators &amp; DT were fully briefed in Jan -- instead of warning you and I, they adjusted THEIR Stock portfolio$$$ and laughed w/ Trump about CV-19 being a "hoax" and instead went golfing for weeks and weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karentravers Notable that @ABC continues to hype Trump as very presidential.  Your local affiliates air your little reports that carefully screen out the plethora of belligerence and incompetence he predominantly exudes in the pressers (and all other things).  DISNEY luvs those low-taxes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricLiptonNYT WTF! His "tone" may occasionally swerve into presidential-mode for a few minutes, but his ACTIONS and INACTIONS remain totally 100% narcissistic personality disorder incompetent TRUMPian!  #TrumpPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle Oh, are you referring to the EXISTING CALAMITY that was especially fueled in Florida and "red states" that largely watch FOX News, and were deceived by pundits like you declaring there was NO Emergency? Please stop with the trumpoganda ! #FoxNewsLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Odd, it seems that the entire US government has been distracted by the never ending antics of one Putin-Puppet-POTUS since he was installed in '16.  Then there is the constant GOP push to end ACA and otherwise devastate HC. #moscowmitchmctreason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Has anyone heard anything about Barr meeting with Congress tomorrow on 'Stone judgement intervention'? Several weeks ago it was scheduled for 3/31 -- but I can't find any follow up info -- I expect he will have postponed for Covid-19 if at all possible...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1215Deb Where could he get ideas like this - or that Russia s/b considered a greater friend to US?  https://t.co/oLtmLPbhhY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol This conversation is probably pretty mild mannered vs NUMEROUS previous Putin transactions.  Are there memorandums on any of them? We heard about some filed on top-secret WH servers.  Will we ever know the extent that DT has betrayed US to help Kremlin? I DOUBT IT....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_sipher He is not TRYING to get it. Since forever, he has been directly spouting any information or DISINFORMATION /propoganda that boosts the status of RU. He is clearly acting on behalf of PUTIIN; Mueller knew it, GOP knows it, FBI knows it - they let it pass as DT quirkiness/opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Right on Ronna! We all know that #GOP is the only OFFICIAL HISTORY REWRITE team.  Your efforts in  #TrumpVirusCoverup along with Fox News has resulted in the spread of the virus. Also, your recent #GOPDeathPanels strategy is amazing v. your "every life matters" pretend-mantra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader You are spinning faster than a JPL mach-5 test accelerator Kremlin-Kev.  Dem's greatly improved the legislation to make it FOR the PEOPLE as opposed to the USUAL GOP Corporate bailouts to donors.  All because the #TrumpVirusCoverup resulted from his major initial response FAIL !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go Not so much dementia as pure Kremlin-spin.  Trying to rewrite history that millions who died in Russia due to Stalin atrocities was somehow all part of WWII efforts w/Allies.  I'm sure DT gets this stuff directly fed to him from Vladdaddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump @VP #TrumpPandemic   https://t.co/wD5vww53TB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump @VP You are right that the REAL DONALD TRUMP is working OVERTIME on HIS PUBLICITY and campaign aspects of the pandemic -- trying to change the narrative from his MAJOR FAILURES when it counted most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume Um - because he is TRUMP? You might want to check out his twitter feed. It is full of narcissistic self-serving BS tweets personal ego-crap, ESPECIALLY anytime LEADERSHIP is expected.  ps: #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Some in government find fault with every possible vehicle for the TRUTH when they know it devastates their planned propaganda narrative. Some in government go about defending inactions of the worst POTUS in history while enabling his continuing corruption. #GOPDeathPanels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley LMAO! As much as the WH occupant is an incompetent political clown whom endangers the lives of all US citizens, major decisions HAVE to be made by governors and ANYBODY else. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tribelaw @SpeakerPelosi just stated something to this effect on @maddow, that Congress WILL do it's oversight despite SS.  I sure hope this is true.

<|startoftext|>@imillhiser I got this in mail yesterday, also. Immediate reaction was 1) THESE are NOT ideas/guidelines that TRUMP has been publicly pushing about for weeks. 2) Government PROPAGANDA machine at work to make it APPEAR that Trump participated/sanctified these guidelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm sure the fact that they are MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS to your various slush funds will have nothing to do with you &amp; Mnuchin plans to REWARD them with BILLION$$$$ after already making sure they pay NO TAXES. #GOPTaxScam #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Damn, I missed it. But I hear it was just as awful as every other one of your other disinformation &amp; "kiss the A of dear leader" campaigns.  #TrumpVirusCoverup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AddieWoolf Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller It's a short squeeze because the mega-bill to bail-out corporations / Wall street will probably pass today.  When reality sets in the the next day or two, the shorts will re-establish themselves and downside will resume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitziForPelosi Trump is going to do a 2 hour "virtual town hall" on Fux-news today, so damage will be limited to FN viewers and magats (only 40% of g-pop.) Though the "re-open business" angle will no doubt enjoy a swell of re-inforcement that will further endanger us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mog7546 I HOPE the provision that any such use of this "discretionary fund" will not be made PUBLIC for 9 months -- that is the MOST INSULTING part. (obviously most of the money will go directly to Trump/cronies).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardKurtz Sure, let #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER appear on TV for 2-3 hours a day; the most powerful man in the  world should freely spew DISINFORMATION and TERRIBLE POLICY OPINIONs when US citizens need real medical and existential info.  And of course he mostly LIES while at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes You should move to Russia with your GRU consigliere's. I understand that they have completely contained COVID-19 (per Putin).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What is it about LEADERSHIP that is totally foreign to you? Is it that your cues are all coming from Putin? There is valid medical reasoning for mandatory shut-down. ANOTHER TRUMP FAILURE. #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 4 inch "platform" shoes in the early 70's...ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Typical #GOPBailoutScam logic. Exploit a pandemic to get a $500,000,000,000.00 into Trumps hands for personal discretion with NO OVERSIGHT, and hundreds of billions in corporate bailouts, while skimping on any help to TAX PAYING citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Seriously, why hasn't Barr been impeached? He has been clearly involved in multiple instances of unethical, if not ILLEGAL behavior.  Is it the simple partisan 'vote' arithmetic that GOP Senate would protect him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw Anyone can see by anecdotal evidence that, in fact, DT has probably netted billions in extra revenue due to his graft  and payola acceptance.  Of course, if he were to provide 5 years of tax-returns that show evidence of the loss, I might be persuaded to feel sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance You should know better than that Ms. Alene. OF COURSE DjT would be willing to sacrifice ANYONE in his family if he thought it would help his reelection and/or finances.  He is a total sociopath.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes WOW - for ONCE the NYTimes which has coddled and nurtured your presidential aspirations since 2015 dared to criticize you because your actions are KILLING US Citizens?  Shocking! #GOPDeathPanels  #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddPDeere45 @CNN @MSNBC @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @FoxNews Any CREDIBLE news source knows that these DT-dominated press briefings are just a shite-storm of disinformation and a clown show for Trump's personal grievances.

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney EASY - tell #MoscowMitch to DROP the ridiculous $500,000,000,000.00 GIFT to Trump and his consigliere's that he wants to give anonymously.  GET the GOP back on the page where you will #BailOutPeopleNotCorporations, and there will be an easy deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro WRONG - it is not the time to offer a $500,000,000,000.00 #TrumpSlushFund to Mnuchin to anonymously hand over to the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate.  GOP waisted time.  Don't let them NOW ROB US BLIND!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Nice bunch of words ignoring the fact that GOP is pushing for a straight out half-trillion dollar GIVEAWAY to #TrumpSlushFund .  Why don't you try for ONCE in your frigging career to put #PeopleOverProfits and Corporate giveaways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CongressmanHice Sounds like Putin's advice is being disseminated by the mega-folk in full force now.  Yes, by all means - ignore the scientists and health experts and obey the oligarchs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich RIGHT - Dem's need to give the BIG FAT BLANK CHECK to #MoscowMitchSlushFund so that Trump and GOP can favor billionaire cronies and consigliere's with tens of billions in un-accounted for bail-out $$$ (most probably going to DJT, himself).  R i g h t ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi IMAGINE if we didn't have to wonder whether every frigging thing that Trump sponsors seems to primarily benefit HIMSELF; if only we could review his TAX RETURNS and other financial information so we didn't have to question his every motive. #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Simple solution: Trump needs to re-assure citizens that he will not take bail-out funds for your over-rated, taxpayer subsidized hotels. #MoscowMitchSlushFund<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn This is how and why #GOPBetrayedAmerica .  Trillions for corporations and billionaires (who pay little or NO taxes).   Blah BLAH BLAH - #GOPCorruptionOverCountry is the ever-present theme in #MoscowMitch's Senate. O blah dee, oh blah da - life does NOT go-on due to TRUMP errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley THEN STOP LOADING your #GOPCorruptionOverCountry bill with PORK for Trump and Corporations who just will use the money to issue bonuses to CEOs!  No way you GD a-holes are gonna use this plague for more CORPORATE WINDFALLS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Or to put it more precisely, #MoscowMitch  favors #GOPCorruptionOverCountry, putting together a bill which is a GINORMOUS give-away to WS and #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER, which means the bill was DOA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HolmesJosh If ONLY we had a Senate majority leader whom wasn't playing beer-pong w/ Fed Society SCOTUS justices last weekend when we needed him.

<|startoftext|>@CNN I guess since dear-leader Trump has declared Putin a friend and relies on him for strategic foreign policy advice, CNN is going to go ahead and accept Kremlin / GRU propaganda as fact.  Seems a bit like journalistic malpractice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You and the other traitor-tots should definitely re-open TRUMP-U as a populist medical training school for wonder cures. COVID-19 and windmill cancer will be wiped out in just a few days, no doubt. #TrumpLiesPeopleDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kovertkatie501 Not sure they deliberately 'planned' this scenario, but certainly good ol' Moscow-Mitch &amp; GOP friends will fully exploit this opportunity to denigrate the poor while rewarding the wealthiest, especially key donor CORP'S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler @TuckerCarlson The truth is that you made HIGHLY unethical if not ILLEGAL trades in your personal account with inside information -- no matter WHO actually executed them.  Unless Georgia citizens endorse crooked Senators, you need to RESIGN.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marwilliamson @TomPerez Jeese, my lady. How many "Jill Steins" does it take to keep DjT/GOP and Vlad-dad presiding over the US for (at least) 4 more years?  Just stop your side-eye-voodoo and let the country heal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Thanks for pointing out how TOTALLY FANTASTIC the real TRUMP is!  That's definitely the big important thing:  to BOLSTER his BAD POLL numbers since he completely screwed up US initial response to the pandemic which cost lives. Leadership FAIL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr TRANSLATION: putting more PORK  in it for GOP-favored corporations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaBashCNN ALL in this together? Trump consistently makes it clear that his priority is the health of the DJIA. corporate sponsors, and his re-election campaign. He could lead by shutting the  frick up and letting real experts talk; NO ONE believes his BS. Don't magnify DT's gas-light.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich Right-wing propaganda specialist GOP-splains how "dishonest leftwing news media" is why conservatives are skeptical.   Classic spinning the FAKE NEWS that is 100% attributable to DjT /gas-lighting consigliere's. Y'all are just greedy idiots who don't care about anything but POWER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWPUSA I'm sure CJ Roberts is mighty pleased (if not directly responsible) for this deferral action.  He won't have to be SHAMED about the obvious fact that @SCOTUS will screw democracy and cover for Trump/GOP 5/4 if this case had to be decided in the near term (before elec.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard I'm sure you will get plenty of opportunities on FOX and RTV to dispel your Kremlin talking-points to re-elect Trump for Putin -- so how about you just sit tight for now and let real Democrats debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLGLASS2 NOT at first - but later, if on deathbed, "they" would say that a new test came in pos if they thought it would be better GOP-PR before election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMcClintock CLEARLY YOU are NOT a resource that can help defeat COVID-19.  Hope you can justify your vote against the legislation to your constituents who suffer or have fallen family members.  TYPICAL REPUBLICAN a-holery! #GOP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sifill_LDF @LOLGOP Judge J.

<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey The latter, I'd wager. Trump just can't stop himself from blurting out the TRUTH despite major admin. efforts to obfuscate the issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pauljimerson Mucho elegante, unlike his trashy distant cousin - the Monterey Pine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Nice quote, but the Donald caused major disruption to TESTing by trying to make a personal profit off it, as per usual.  Everything Trump does is for personal gain at the expense of US citizens. #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence One true sentence in this tweet (the first). Thank GOD @JoeBiden came forward with words of assurance for US citizens.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump vis a vis #PresidentBiden speech, like getting reassured by the burglar that he will look into a new locksmith for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidPriess @LauraWalkerKC Were you out of communication with the world during the Senate Impeachment hearings? Of course Moscow Mitch is going to play it this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm I.e., Trump consigliere's will precisely tell him when to trigger the "buy" signal w/some policy after they have taken the maximum profit out of 'puts' and market 'short orders'; then after they have then repositioned all of their (and DT's) accounts, they will give him a cue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Thank you for providing US and the world a bunch of sycophantic MALARKY about DjT with ABSOLUTELY NO GUIDANCE on constructive steps that will stop the pandemic.  YOU KNOW that travel bans are about as effective as a band-aid against cancer.  TESTING!!! #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader AS PER USUAL, you are completely USELESS as a legislator preferring to direct all your energy to being a sycophant to #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER and designated driver for the Kremlins directions to the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegoodgodabove No no, you silly omnipotent fellow, you are just super MYSTERIOUS in your adverse ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan I read words ... words, words of PRAISE for DJ Trump. NOTHING of any value whatsoever to help your constituents and all US citizens deal with the crisis at hand.  You remain a perverted disgusting sycophant to #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Every frigging thing the #GOP does is partisan, 24/7, including this stupid tweet wherein you try to balme the media.  #Trumpdemic of stupidity is just the final disease that put all y'all over the top of political disinformation and propaganda peddling to steal elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Great strategy.  It's fantastic that you're so comfortable in your own racism to use this obvious defamatory suggestion to deflect from TRUMP/GOP INCREDIBLE FAILURES and DELIBERATE MISSTEPS in fighting COVID-19 #Trumpdemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mog7546 I expect the worst of his offenses was performing miserably in run for congress; he's pretty much USELESS as a Kremlin asset...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPaulGosar ALL y'all magat Republicans want to kill people however you can: deprive them of healthcare, take away their social security, poison the air &amp; water.  We know you want to send them to die in Syria protecting Saudi assets for Trump's buddy/financier MbS. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins Unfortunately, your contribution as a powerful woman Senator has been to ALWAYS DEFER to RICH WHITE MEN (e.g., McConnell, Trump)  who are committed to keeping women subjugated.  I hope ALL young women look to you as the example of what NOT to DO with their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump EVERYONE, including your MAGA supporters, know your tweets are BIG FAT LIEs (to 'own the Lib's'). Many psychologists also suggest you PROJECT your OWN shortcomings when you attack others.  This PERFECT TWEET sums it all up. TRUMP admin is MOST CORRUPT in US history! #NeroTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJillStein So you went ahead and handicapped the race in favor of PUTIN / Trump in a couple of swing states:  NICE WORK! YOU are DIRECTLY responsible for the devastation that has befallen the US because of TRUMP regime -- but then, as a KREMLIN ASSET, that is exactly what you wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wanna know who is making you LOOK Bad? You wanna know who is FAILING US citizens with his idiotic political approach to a virus? LOOK squarely into a MIRROR #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarbMcQuade Thank GOD for this ethical judge.

<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert This will be true as long as LAND controls the electoral college as opposed to elections by voting citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LisaMarieBoothe @edhenry @FoxNews Yes, if she means a DYSTOPIAN future where earth has been totally ravaged by climate change and civilization has disintegrated into a hell-scape of fascist authoritarian oligarchs ruling over sick and dying populations.  #ImpeachedForLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tweetmommybop @ProudResister Finally - he "deleted" the tweet.  I think he is a bit over anxious to be considered a profound millennial-political "influencer"-- figuring Sanders has a lock on primary. And, perhaps, (dare I say it?) a bit of Bernie-bro wannabeism/envy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @donnabrazile RUSSIAN propaganda disseminator says whaaa? Is it on behalf of Putin, or Kremlin-favorite DjTrump that you are pushing Sanders?  Perhaps it's about making Vlad-dad happy enough for the Mormons to continue plans for NEW TEMPLE in MOSCOW? #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNBCnow BY "coronavirus slowdown" the Fed means Trump ORDERED Powell to CUT or "else" - to help combat his re-election prospective shortfall...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill @GOPLeader YES, an absolutely CLEAR SIGN that Trump is setting up @VP for a big fail so he can REPLACE him with a more attractive VP candidate (e.g., Nikki Haley) as he tries to salvage his re-election prospects.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump #TrumpVirus has infected the GOP / 40% of America for four years now.  It is especially unfortunate because it was diagnosed as a US health crisis way back in 2015, and yet Republicans refused to treat those infected despite the clear signs that it results in total derangement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @VP #TrumpVirus   https://t.co/PfH3EazNMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @VP So the great plan is to put YOU in charge - the first thing you do is censor information that is getting out to US citizens to ensure that the deranged occupant of the Oval "approves of the message". Great strategy. Of course, you realize DT is just setting you up for a big fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins The GOP strategy is ALWAYS to strip funding from the most vulnerable, while politicial elite play golf or travel the world at US taxpayer expense. Your insistence on subsidizing the #TrumpCrimeFamily and keeping them in power for the sake of the GOP has led to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSYCH_HYPE Except his climate change denial has helped the stock market (fossil fueled economy) go up  up  up.... COVID-19 ignorance is weighing HEAVILY on financial mkts - hence his gas lighting strategy WILL have to change. #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio #GOPTraitors deny SCIENCE and health-care. DISINFORMATION is the only commodity you offer US citizens.  YOU LIE, especially the Putin-puppet in the WH.  NO ONE believes DT.  It's only political as people demand some CREDIBLE government action - NOT gas-light and false statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump The @maddow show on 5/25 (opposite debate circus) was even MORE thorough, with profound infectious disease expert @Laurie_Garrett for the interview!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Spending hundreds of billions of non-budgeted funds pilfered from national defense /military family projects to DESTROY the environment for a totally USELESS vanity monument. Nice!!! #DerangedDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekCressman Makes trumpian sense! Pence will be so busy praying away the virus that Trump will have to draft Nikki Haley for Veep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer I guess you missed the part where DjT personally destroyed all REAL WH communication and expertise in anything except for COVERING-UP Trump family CORRUPTION.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatashaBertrand Bottom line - are the real 'powers that be' gonna let him get away with a rudimentary quashing of foreign intelligence that offends or exposes Trump / consigliere's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong "Deranged Donald" works well.  But a moniker that would really vex-him constantly is something to the effect of "Low-IQ Donald".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Vs the GOP who want to charge you for the internet (w/plenty of CONTROLLED, right-biased content) devastate the environment / climate by subsidizing fossil fuel , &amp; charge MORE healthcare and end pre-existing condition coverage -- as a bonus, you get an Addarral charged POTUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller Makes sense except for the fact that 95% of VERY INTERESTED Democrats have had NO SAY in picking the "front runner" -- I am sickto death of the early/minuscule states (especially CAUCUS states) getting to DEFINE the future of US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump If US taxpayers wanted pics of the Taj Mahal, we could get them FREE from the internet rather than paying $138,749 for your added expenditures -- especially since you provide ZERO value for the money other than the ever-present international TRUMP-self-dealing disgust !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh were not power-rammed onto court for nothing. SCOTUS has shown to be consistently faithful to GOP for 3 years now. If that means obfuscations / obscure rulings to protect DjT - democracy be damned. But beltway press / pundits already know all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 Lucky for Larry David that SNL will soon enter summer hiatus. Corporate media will love the pairing for awhile but will eventually go nuclear against Sanders to preserve GOP Tax cuts, etc. -- making '2016-but her emails' coverage seem quaint by comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treasonstickers Sure, but what has he done for us lately? MM held the Senate hostage to a controlled impeachment hearing allowing no new witnesses nor evidence to be entered into the record, thus ensuring GOP Senators could look away and vote for DTs 'acquittal' with minimal political fallout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmclaughlinSAIS @vermontgmg As far as Trump is concerned, he views all "intelligence" as SPYING on him and his authoritarian brethren around the world.  He is DETERMINED to CONTROL this info for his personal interests (or "interests" of his consigliere's  Putin, Eregon, etc.) as the GOP looks on silently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler Try as you may, it has been thoroughly DOCUMENTED in the Mueller Report that there were numerous instances of Trump campaign COLLUSION with the KREMLIN.  Trump and all his Putin-friendly consigliere's  such as yourself, WILL NEVER "pardon" these FACTS. #Trumpocrat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews He considered leaving his DREAM perch as AG wherein he controls many serious levers of democracy allowing him to steer it towards a complete religious Autocracy (as aspired by his 'OPUS DEI" brethren) and decided 'Nah-I'm good'. #BarrResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Right - Opus Dei star Barr is going to resign his DREAM power perch wherein he is  molding the US judiciary and Executive into a far right religious wonderland of unbridled control UBER ALLES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Oh yeh - he's gonna go look for some of Obama's old golf balls at Ellison's range up in Rancho Mirage.

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Consigliere's of a feather SURE DO STICK together. Got to keep all that CRIMINALITY in da family, and gotta keep da family close. Unless you gotta "whack" one of 'em now and then, like Epstein - Ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do you think your trumpettes actually believe these LIES you have tweeted out already a hundred times or more? Just stick to your white-supremacy -- that's is all that keeps you in power, FOR NOW. #ImpeachedForLife #ImpeachTrumpAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise Dems are funny that way - they just WON'T ACCEPT continuing CRIMINAL actions of a Putin-Puppet-Potus as he continues to jeopardize national security &amp; judicial independence. DT threatens DEMOCRACY and steals from the military while destroying the environment. What's the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby .@KellyannePolls has to be doing SOMETHING around the WH to (barely) justify the 100's of thousands in salary and expenses...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOUR apostrophe-TYPO is actually ok with respect to the fact that this day is meant to honor ALL OTHER PRESIDENTS in US history (NOT YOU) therefore it is their possessive.  (I.e., You are EXCLUDED!) #PresidentsDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidgura . @MariaBartiromo gave up even 'resembling' a journalist a decade ago when she moved to fux-business-noise.

<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Unfortunately this describes 3/4 of my bio-family...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley THANK you for agreeing that Attorney General Barr MUST be held to account for his interference in CRIMINAL investigations and OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE.  It is definitely time for you to INVESTIGATE the A.G. and then to #ImpeachBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent YES, but ONLY in the parallel universe of OPPOSITE-land, outside the time-space continuum - perhaps in the dreams of Schrödinger's cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley JFC!

<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes NICE! You must have done a California fly-over on one of your jaunts between Moscow &amp; DC conducting the personal errands of Putin-puppet-potus DjT.  You really ought to visit the state some time and see how we really feel about you and the prez. #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP @PressSec Yes EVERYTHING is FANTASTIC! Especially at US Dept of Justice!!!  Complete LOSS of confidence by all citizens in US law enforcement because of politically TAINTED Trump intervention and AG Barr-Vlad-Puppet investigations! #GOPTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Also in on the ruble-rewards of kowtowing for the kremlin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics @ABC Clearly W. Barr believes HIS JOB is to undermine investigations into Trump or his GOP consigliere's and quash any that he hasn't been able to suppress - like the many Mueller spin-offs that he quashed.

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Get a ROOM! US taxpayers have no interest in the love-life of the grifter couple who is enabling the most CORRUPT POTUS in history; Y'all are robbing us blind with your travel expenses while you PAD YOUR WALLETS on world junkets. #TrumpCrimeFamily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Barr:  SHHHHUSH SH  SHHH!  Don't speak! Don't TWEET! "It was hard enough to completely obfuscate and distort Mueller findings! How the hell am I going to COVER-UP all the Trump/consigliere crimes if you keep TELLING PEOPLE!" #BarrResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremynewberger He's been not only threatening, but actively working to destroy the entire state of California for three years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance You know AG Barr was installed by 'Fed Society' and related GOP operatives, and he is part of the CABAL that is protecting GOP / DJT at all COSTS!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This will lead to W. Barr's FIRST Impeachment, and YOUR 2ND IMPEACHMENT. Congratulations on being first president to be impeached twice in first term!

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast BUT since DT was "acquitted" and both #MoscowMitchMcConnell &amp; AG Barr have decided there was absolutely "NO COLLUSION" in their infinite wisdom and power - Trump has no choice but to PARDON this poor victim of Mueller's witch-hunt, NO?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein PLEASE, PLEASE insist on a Judicial inquiry into AG Barr!!! How can y'all allow the DoJ be turned into banana-republic style authoritarian enforcer for would-be DICTATOR TRUMP? How many investigations into DjT has he quashed? Barr is a shameless shill for INJUSTICE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp The thing is - thanks to #MoscowMitch and the GOP/Federalist Soc. cabal running DoJ (&amp; MsM) the authoritarian Trump-regime IS now COMPLETELY IMMUNIZED from any oversight or 'reigning in' of any kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump READ the frigging TRANSCRIPTS!! They clearly show Pres. Trump tried to extort Ukraine president! Why can't people just do like you say and READ the TRANSCRIPTS!   They CLEARY show your guilt - even the highly EDITED version you released! #ImpeachedForLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz FANTASTIC to see you living the HIGH life! Bet there is gonna be lots of extra criming and ass-slapping  with all-y'all  in the #Cult45 cabal there at merde-lago this weekend!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mayawiley @TheEliasRework SERIOUSLY!!! Which branch of Gov't initiates an action like that? I've tried to CALL attention of this by letters to my  @SenFeinstein of Judicial Committee but get non-responsive feedback.  Who can do something about this GINORMOUS crimp in the DoJ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Is that a shot a li'l @marcorubio Junior?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump It will read on your ETERNAL permanent record, as one day (quite soon, actually) there will be a consensus that DjTrump is running a CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE from the Oval Office, and several GOP congressmen are DEEPLY involved, my "friend" of the prez. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod I'm quite sure you DO exist, but are entirely misrepresented by those who co-opt your name and purpose for their own man-devil agendas (as has been done though out history). But you are right, your name has become meaningless, especially in all things politic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Don't worry Traitor-Tot-no.1. Satan is still watching after his ward, your daddy. The grand bargain that was struck by the Trump-family with the EVIL one is strong.

<|startoftext|>@SRuhle Oh - can't blame her for being a cockeyed optimist! I too "hope" things will happen -  e.g., I will win the lottery and become financially independent. Hence,  ALL important financial decisions I make should be based on that HOPE, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytdavidbrooks Stop being an insufferable prevaricator for the GOP.  You KNOW perfectly well that #MoscowMitchTraitor blocks all meaningful legislation.  NOTHING is being passed by the Senate except for the appointment of unqualified right-wing judges. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWPUSA He MUST be being protected from prosecution by AG Barr right now, ya?   He SO frigging REEKs of chargeable CRIMALITY - something is amiss at US Justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump YOU are an absolute DISGRACE to the republic and the US Constitution.  Your actions in disrespecting citizens during your solemn duty as a juror in the #ImpeachedPresident 's trial will forever be on record and noted by patriotic Tennesseans in next election. #GOPBetrayedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr ONCE AGAIN you disgraced the US today.  Your mischaracterization of the Mueller Report speaks volumes of your gas-lighting on behalf of, and allegiance to the Kremlin. #AmercansFindTrumpGuilty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins There is NO LOW LOWER than DjTrump - every day he creates a NEW LOW in public service and American values and the #GOPTraitors who continue to wash his balls in perpetual sycophancy contribute to the demise of democracy that is the Trump regime. Shameful, #ComplicitCorruptGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And Fed Chairman, J.Powell, is keeping rates artificially low, along with other financial gyrations to allow the bubble to just keep expanding. If any Dem prez put that kind of pressure on FRB the GOP would go ballistic. We now live in a Trumpworld hellscape in the making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @SpeakerPelosi I'm sure you are MORE disappointed DT is surviving his impeachment for CRIMES against the nation; you would have made a great VP for an alternative GOP nominee. But now you must reside in the CORRUPT shadow of DT as more and MORE illicit actions are revealed. #GOPTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorahODonnell @CBSNews .@CBSNews anchor shows her partisan colors as she endorses the preferred candidate of CORPORATE MEDIA to America.  I guess TAX CUTS are worth the dismantling of democracy in your view.  Politics$$$$ in the age of Trumpism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer DJ TRUMP ripped apart this country and continues to engage in CRIMINAL activity and CORRUPTION all over the world.  Who does that? #GOPTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @EsperDoD You are DESTROYING beautiful desert areas and environment for a WALL that is useless, while stealing money from military families and strategic national defense.  IDIOCRACY in action. Btw, your "new wall" blew over in a slight windstorm the other day. #ImpeachedForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Let's evaluate: Tearing up a piece of paper that itemized blatant disinformation and political propaganda  vs Tearing up the US Constitution, selling out to the Kremlin and covering up treason by worst CRIMINAL POTUS in history?  Tough call! #GOPCowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Another crock of words sculpted by DISHONEST WH employees who continually bleed US taxpayers so they may spread about Trump manuer and propaganda, just like the slate of lies that they represented as the SoU. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Dear traitor-tot no. 1: Daddy hiding behind the images of brave and honorable citizens to HIDE his UGLINESS and personal FAILURES as potus is deplorable, as usual.  We anxiously await Trump-family's imminent demise so we NEVER have to listen to your BS again. #GOPTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Says heretofore great legal scholar who completely SOLD OUT to the CORRUPT, TREASONOUS DjT and his GOP consigliere's all working for a fascist agenda to end US democracy.  Not much credence will be given to your brilliant deductions - ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSEveningNews @NorahODonnell .@SenatorCollins has shown total allegiance to #MoscowMitchTraitor in every effort to curb DT's criminality - which is to say she does NOTHING but gaslight citizens.  Thanks, CBS for helping her do that. She goes down in history as completely complicit in Trump Crimes against US!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Chaffetz is ALSO the big-ah who made public the Comey letter-re: new HRC investigation back in '16 - an act for which HE should have been prosecuted for releasing classified info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio YOU &amp; the rest of Trumps criminal consigliere's are definitely the unfunny PUNCHLINE. Y'all must be punched out of your seats and will be shunned by civilized citizens as the true scope of DT's criminality and foreign entanglements (especially Saudi and RU) come into the light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Typical msm-pundit caution to Dem's; of course, this ONLY applies to Dem's. MsMedia goes OUT of its way to cover-up / rationalize EVERY frigging CORRUPT &amp; DERANGED thing TRUMP does, but will call foul-play on D's at the slightest provocation. We must all GO TO HELL to battle DT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader HE HAD THAT.  THE ONLY thing that deplorable  GOP Conrgess accomplished was to raise the deficit by trillions each year in a huge tax give-away to wealthiest billionaires &amp; corporations. Slick GOP also tried to eliminate affordable health care - but TG for J.Mccaine, U FAILED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley You will always be remembered for your creepy and dubious legal support for the MOST CORRUPT and TREASONOUS POTUS in US history, as democracy lies dying on the field from right-wing sabotage.  GREAT LEGACY! #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, US taxpayers are keeping tabs of the tens of million$ of dollars you have enriched yourself with at OUR expense, while acting ALWAYS in your own (&amp; Vlad-dads's) financial interests while destroying democracy. #GOPComplicitTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski Great string of PERSONAL conclusions / justification of planned vote AGAINST democracy today. However, you completely ignore the REALITY that Trump is obstructing all normal process, and DjT's a CRIMINAL, clear and present DANGER to US interests, foreign and domestic. #GOPCowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani How is it possible that YOU have not been INDICTED??? Is it CORRUPT AG Barr holding back SDNY, or what??? #GOPCowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP The KREMLIN is extremely pleased with you today! You're doing exactly what's required to end US democracy. Y'all must be so proud!   I'm sure DjT will have them forward a few laundered rubles your way to assuage any gut feelings of horror you must be feeling. #GOPCowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenAlexander Alas, it is confirmed.  The GOP has KILLED democracy. You COULD have ended your career as a patriotic hero. Instead, you end it as an asterisk* to the end of America, as we pass all control to the Kremlin: Putin, his pal DjTrump, and other GOP consigliere's. #GOPCowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenRickScott Sure - YOU of all the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry Senators want to be sure and sweep this under the table a-s-a-p!!!! You are also involved in the Trump/Giuliani scheme to extort Ukraine.  Now, making IOWA campaign propaganda spots to hurt Biden? Shameless and probably illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ YOU have HAD IT!   AZ is going to be DONE with YOU in just a few more months.  I'm sure you have a cushy lobbying job to look forward to - just hope you're content to GO DOWN in HISTORY as personally enabling the greatest anti-American CORRUPT POTUS to get away with murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh WE ALL HEARD  you essentially declare that a POTUS is an infallible DICTATOR that may commit ANY CRIME to get reelected.  PERIOD.  You are an ENEMY of American justice and democracy. #dershowitzlogic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP WoW. Imagine the DjTrump dilemma!. A Don Jr., Ivanka, AND Eric problem!!!  These kids have already been busted for corrupt and illegal activities, and we haven't even begun to expose their criminal activities of the last 3 years at US taxpayer expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Kushner's opinion is COMPLETELY irrelevant. The only reason he is not in federal custody right now is because he is protected by Trump and AG Barr from prosecution.

<|startoftext|>@ScottforFlorida @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Damn! Don't put up with that - RESIGN!!!! No need to worry about covering-up for the worst CRIMINAL POTUS in history - RESIGN!!!!

<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP 7. #GOPComplicitTraitors are 100% aligned with Kremlin talking points on Ukraine, and are making them freely to the detriment of democracy  8. DjTrump has committed continuous violations of his oath to the US constitution since the day he was installed in the WH by election fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @CNN You should hold a press conference wherein a CNN reporter could be directly redressed for this! Oh, that's right - US taxpayers have gotten 0 press conferences from you; we just pay you $186,000 a year to tweet lies and go on Fox-noise and lie some more for the most #CorruptTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski Yeh, but what about that thing where Hunter swindled investors at a "Soho" building by deliberately lying about %of sales -- er, oops, NO, I guess that was another Trump kid scandal daddy paid to  have disappear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler @SenatorRomney @realDonaldTrump Y'all are spinning a crazy yarn there, lady.  But Americans are not liking your #GOPCorruptionOverCountry angle at all. In fact, ALL Y'ALL #GOPCowards better get real about the constitution and democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @IvankaTrump Incredible! The princess-royale is talking almost like she has real economic insight! Too bad she is just reciting BS talking points as she galavants the globe on US Taxpayer funds, doing her personal business.  Quite the chip off the ol' block(head).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Right, it's right there - even in the carefully redacted "perfect call" readout you had released, ALL critical elements for articles of  #impeachment are outlined.  And that's just the TIP of the ICEBERG of your CRIMINAL behavior and fealty to PUTIN that requires #RemoveTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump If YOU have even the slightest ACTUAL REGARD for protecting the US Constitution, you would immediately vote for witnesses, and then vote #impeachment and REMOVAL of one CRIMINAL Putin-puppet-potus, DJTrump, from the WH!<|endoftext|>

In fact, HE WAS INSTALLED as your occupant by interference from his Vlad-dad PUTIN! #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ It is true that AZ voters DID NOT ELECT YOU, and they NEVER WILL as you have shown yourself to be a disgusting sycophant to the worst CRIMINAL POTUS in history.

<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst 12+ hours of testimony about the devastating national security failures of the most CORRUPT POTUS in US history, this is your take?

<|startoftext|>@thegoodgodabove In retrospect, perhaps you should have suggested that Adam&amp;Eve partake of a lot more fruit from the 'tree of knowledge' in their diet, rather than kicking them out of the garden after just one byte of an apple!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz Great act.

<|startoftext|>@JonFlan I am sure that (in his rationale) CJ Roberts will avoid 'partisanship' by simply 'DOING NOTHING' thus allowing Moscow-Mitch/GOP to run the trial as expeditiously as possible to get to DT exoneration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DingoMurphy @Acyn and seems to be mixing his red meat maga-talking points with his actual criminal act confessions ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli @barronsonline Don't get me wrong not trying to nitpick - I expect there is all kinds of nefarious activity going on - I saw an article a few months ago I think in Vanity fair, about possible Trump-tweet related stock manipulation that was being investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli @barronsonline Yes, or just bought the stocks.  Going 'short' is a specific strategy of SELLING shares of the stock now, and buying back later at (hopefully) a much LOWER price.  Brokerage houses have to arrange it because you are borrowing someone else or house shares...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli @barronsonline Exactly! When traders "short" a stock they are betting on it going DOWN.  If DT's friends had shorted LMT, they woulda LOST a lot of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli Except in this case, BA, LMT (Lockhead) and other defense stocks went on a tear to the upside -- so I expect the DT consigliere's went LONG at Merde-Lago!  (They go "short" on the S&amp;P just before T announces that Chinese talks are OFF again...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @ewarren What was that about pee-pee? Lev has THE TAPE? No, - it's just Traitor-Tot-1, doing one of his racist schticks trying to convince magats that he's clever.  The Doofus and Butt-gum act is getting very old. #ImpeachedForLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LIAR LIAR Pants on fire going on your 16,000th LIE since inauguration. BTW, how's that $100billion inauguration fraud investigation going @ SDNY? #ImpeachedForLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance You know that Roberts will take the most "conservative" approach possible, which in his mind, here, will involve letting GOP 'do their thing' with minimal judicial input or intervention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse no, no - that's just a bunch of adderall-dust that DT sneezed up. #ImpeachedForLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Right - as opposed to Trump-GOP pocketing billion$ of dollars for selling nuclear technology to Saudis whom have similar abysmal human rights records, and - in fact - openly murder US journalists . . . which account was it that Trump deposited that MbS billion? #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce Not as long as GOP remains what it is - party of white supremacist fascists promoting plutocracy at ALL costs, with the HAMMER of FOX-news (et. al.) constantly disparaging TRUTH, JUSTICE &amp; the American way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_Schaeffer A billion dollars here, billion dollars there, guarantees access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews That is one helluva white-supremacist combo that I will NAT-ZEE! #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 Another Boomer gone bad in the 80's? or just recently?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz Good one - but I think a much more apt analogy would be "find me a person who holds on to their financial entanglements with RUSSIANs as tightly as DjTrump!" #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Clearly Trump can continue to rely upon #MoscowMitchTraitor to keep his nefarious acts as PUTIN's puppet-potus completely COVERED UP!  How's the new "aluminum plant"(Ruble laundry) that Oleg Deripaska gave you in exchange for your sanctions relief?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realKTMcFarland @WalidPhares @LeeSmithDC @laralogan @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump I know you had to resign because of your LIES and cover-up of Flynn/Trump's RUSSIAN involvement, but I thought you had some credible nat'l security insights. I see that, in fact, you are just another DT/GOP shill, disgracing yourself on TV with pure BS! Reality TV-Pres? #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimKardashian Thank you for affirming the fact that the US definitely NEEDS a hefty WEALTH TAX!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Boo (sniff) Hoo (snuff) take another snort, #SniffyMcAdderall, it is cleary the only thing that keeps you functioning at all in public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Incredible little speech about Iran yesterday! Incredible because there was nothing "CREDIBLE" in any of it, just lots of LIES &amp; blaming OBAMA with more LIES!!! The "SNIFFING" (from adderall/coke snorts?), SLURRED words and dilated eyes...classic #DerangedDonald !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kris_Sacrebleu Yes! - if you like noir-ish realism in your TV stories, which I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiskyLiberal Yes, but Trump aides did a spectacular job adding a chorus line of military and lighting effects to maximize backlighting DT's "presidential" IMAGE! (virtual use of smoke and mirrors)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mimirocah1 @CarrieSweet2017 Will we EVER get information on the multiple cases referred by Mueller (identified, but redacted in report)? At least what/whom involved? Years from now, perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce Can't wait for televangelist-trumpers to start milking that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueZen54 @TheUSASingers Right. Any of the meth-based pharmaceuticals can definitely stimulate the Mars' instinct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAstinWalsh It seems that Vlad may have advised T to cool it for awhile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Really - holding the fire of your daily Dem demonization and sycophantic demagoguery concerning Putin's-puppet-POTUS? Really inclusive of you, and completely disingenuous, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGComedy Believe me, w/o all-y'all comedians angles &amp; schticks during this and some other oppressive political eras, things woulda been waaaay bleaker (for me at least!). Thanks a million times for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio The only way Americans will come together is with CREDIBLE leadership from a patriotic POTUS, NOT a megalomaniac dotard acting in his own self-interest and openly despising 70% of the country daily -- with a complicit dishonest GOP headed by sycophants such as YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Food for thought from the party backing a megalomaniac self-dealing dotard who has gambled many American lives speculating that Red Sea Alliance consigliere's will be highly rewarding to his and Kushner's bank accounts. #IMPOTUS3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBiegen @pipybur1 @dc_tribune Silly - this was largely personal business, where DT &amp; Jared are congratulated by a cabal of "red sea allies" about US progress towards war w/Iran - then moving on to next phase of nuclear technology sharing in lieu of billion$ of loan payments. Minor personal financial matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pipybur1 The part where he knows the witnesses will make Trump out to be totally GUILTY, &amp; several Senators who do not vote to convict will lose their seats - a price he can't afford. He also can't afford to muddy up DT any more, or oust him for pure GOPower political dynamics. Coverup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPaulGosar @dmedin11 KEEP DIGGING deeper dummkopf! If you are going to LIE and disinform AZ citizens, at least do it in a way that is less obvious.  I know you and Hair-Twitler Drumpf idealize the uneducated and stupidest of US citizens - but just not enough of them to see y'all through. #Impotus45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Did you mention that #MoscowMitchMcConnell is 100% partisan at all times EXCEPT when he calls on Democrats to support the corrupt Putin-puppet-potus in his endeavors to destroy democracy?  No, think you sort of glossed over that part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Can NEVER be stressed enough!  #MoscowMarco is lining up with #MoscowMitchMcConnell to ensure that PUTIN and other Trump consigliere's are never held to account for the destruction of democracy accomplished by their Puppet-POTUS for just a few "donations" of rubles/$$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPaulGosar Isn't the deliberate spreading of false information from a congressman a felony?  SHOULD BE.  At a minimum, you need to RESIGN! #ImpeachAndRemove all complicit Republicans that are bringing down democracy with LIES!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rezamarashi No one suggested to follow the mega-deal MONEY? I'm sure there is no way that Saudi influencers may have affected Trump's decision making on Iran policy. *cough(red sea conspiracy)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump As with ALL GOP politicos:                                                  POWER  &gt;  democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Well done bunch of #PompeoPropaganda -  magnanimous words about readiness after a swipe by Jake at Obama admin Benghazi handling?? Sure --  absolutely contributes ZERO credibility to either CNN or Pompeo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews BREAKING: NBC News manufactures story to divert  attention from the imminent military / foreign policy DISASTER created by #IMPOTUS  to a 'Dem's in Disarray" headline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence Most importantly, you forgot to mention that #IMPOTUS desperately needed a diversion from the ever pending #ImpeachAndConvictTrump thing thats happening. Also, Saudi's MbS made him do it, or else Jared Kushner's financial shenanigans will be revealed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw Heaven forbid that any documents (emails, etc.) or Mueller grand-jury testimony ever are UN-redacted to reveal the involvement of J.Kushner, MbS, Netanyahu or other nefarious middle-east Trmp-consigliere's in the Iran-war-mongering strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_Schaeffer Exactly! Any Trump-admin/GOP policy must remain "fluid" in case any interesting monetary angles come up that might pique the Donald's interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump STOP your GOD-Damned wining and do something to protect this country from North Korean &amp; Russian missiles, and Big-Pharma's gouging of consumers like you promised!  You still have a chance to redeem your FAILED presidency but it is quickly passing. #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Yeah, but pretty much EVERYTHING is about 10x more expensive than it was in the early '70s -- one could buy a decent HOUSE for $30k in early-'70s California.  Those days of great "columbian" (wasn't really that great) @$40/ounce  ("lid") passed many decades ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ATT @CNN I know! Any company who DELIBERATELY puts on SERIAL-LIARS like @KellyannePolls &amp; @RickSantorum and lets them gaslight US citizens about the horrible CORRUPT Trump regime on a daily basis is obviously going to hell in a hand-basket (as will everyone DT has ever endorsed!) #IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4AnimalLife @SenWhitehouse Amusing to see legal beagles tweeting that Roberts will keep the Sen impeachment trial honest; you know his conservative-mandate requires him to allow GOP to hide any evidence/witnesses that inform public of blatant criminality or impeachable acts; GOP can't be seen as complicit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @Trump @TrumpChicago @TrumpDC @TrumpNationalNY @TrumpTurnberry Can't wait for ALL y'all to get back to your basic talent of 2-⭐️ hotel accommodations and dubious-timeshare hawking -- just as soon as each of you complete 2-7 years in federal custody (maybe a little more for Dad!) #Impeached45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASavageNation This guy sounds like the same friend - Jim, I believe his name is -who tells President Dotard little stories he likes to convey at times during his daily ramblings, when he has run out of totally deranged things to tweet about...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Congress will have to determine that! I expect Pompeo to be called in for hours of questioning as to why you cut security funding at the embassy and failed to protect it after deliberate provocations - whether Iran was responsible OR NOT! #Benghazi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile Because old-school "conservatives" must rely on Republicans to stay in control in DC.  Roberts must ensure that the avalanche of information on DT's true crimes remains hidden from US public to assist #MoscowMitchMcConnell to keep GOP Senate &amp; DJT in positions of essential power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorelei_CA that'll NEVER happen as such - Trump (admin) may announce new strategy or sanctions, but will blame any current policy failure on: 1) Obama 2) Pelosi 3) HRC 4) KJU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mog7546 I know there are still a lot of Trumpy R's in cow-hampshire, but not enough to get him into Senate...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SherryMacDona12 I expect that the FBI (w/ full support of AG Barr) are "investigating" her for exactly this reason -- she will be a much easier target for assassination than Epstein was in custody!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSEveningNews I'm sure you were too busy concocting other PRO-Trump/GOP-agenda features (something I see every night, especially on your national-news releases to local affiliates) and just don't have the time to spend on actual news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Damn, another great excuse for you to END ALL SANCTIONS against all your RU oligarch friends?? (since your and Vlad-the-Poisoner's plan to blame Ukraine for '16 election-hack IS NOT WORKING!!!). #ImpeachedNowRemove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew Unfortunately, NO one can figure out exactly what that "position" is; she is a communication-huckster who pushes TRUMP lies and other GOP propaganda on COMPLICIT MEDIA venues -- so the WH thinks she is doing a fantastic job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timkaine "Congress" is full of Republican Trump sycophants who won't do ANYTHING to stop his continued failures as POTUS. Time for Democratic Senators to react STRONGLY to stop this insane presidency -- MORE THAN TWEETS! Make a GD statement on the floor and MAKE GOP &amp; the nation  LISTEN!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodbye56789 The answer to that question resides with #MoscowMitchMcConnell and the rest of the GOP who are actively participating in PUTIN's invasion of US democracy. Obviously they have related Russian oligarch entanglement$ that preclude their objections to Trump's treasonous behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington After their incredible journalistic achievement in GAS-LIGHTING the nation about Ivanka's contributions, at this point @CBSnews is simply 'trolling the libs' with in-your-face RACISM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill The hill: Could you please run your political ads DIRECTLY from RUSSIAN-TV, perhaps some messages from Vladimir Putin?  That would requires less verbal BS from the likes of @TulsiGabbard and other Kremlin consigliere's! #ImpeachedDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump SURE, hair-twitler - blame the victim of your treacherous scheme to divert attention from the FASCIST approach to impeachment you and #MoscowMitchMcConnell have devised. Withholding evidence, and invoking FALSE WITNESSes will not save you from the HELL before you. #Impeached45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJentleson Every time I start to feel like it will be 'fine' if Biden gets the Dem nom, and I can vote for him, he opens his mouth and lays another verbal rotten egg.  He's doing the GOPs work for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump For your thoughts and prayers, God shall reward you with an eternity filled with screams of the millions of innocents that you have enabled to be murdered by your greedy relationship with the NRA (and Russia!). #ChristiansAgainstTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FaceTheNation Thanks for assisting the TRUMP CRIME FAMILY to get away with its continuing "paid family" fleecing of US taxpayers.  Totally shoddy journalism with no point other than glorification of one of the most despicable people in this world - princess royale' wannabe @IvankaTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Rubio speaks with fork-ED tongue! Deciphering your tweets quoting biblical verses that reflect your deep anxiety for hanging out with those on the evil side is tantamount to "la la la bladimundo-rebONZO!" #ChristiansAgainstTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard I'm sure that the Kremlin would be delighted to have you as their new puppet-potus should Trump fail in '20 or is finally forced to resign; but mostly they are delighted by your planned political shenanigans as a Jill-Stein-like  SPOILER for the Dems!  Spasiba Bolshoi; Harasho!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @CIA IF ONLY you were being TRUTHFUL. In practice, you are constantly undermining intel agency reports and guidance involving Russia, and especially the Saudi's, whom you are PROTECTING for TRUMP!  Everything you do is FOR DJT as foremost priority, no matter how it fails US/democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MomsThoughts @HillaryClinton Exactly! JB just handed Fox&amp;Fiends, et. al., week-fulls of fodder for "what is he hiding?? or justification for GOP not calling any witnesses"  TALKING POINTS.

<|startoftext|>@sandibachom @AdrienneC123 @nypost Given the dubious leadership of DoJ head, AG W.

<|startoftext|>@brianstelter GEE, you think THAT's bad??  You should check-out what F&amp;F have been doing  spreading KREMLIN TALKING POINTS re: Ukraine, and then allowing Trump to retweet/reinforce them ad nauseam for weeks, potentially DESTROYING US democracy!!! #FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Unless Flynn gets a 'light sentence', he will get pardoned by Trump, just as will Roger Stone. The power hungry GOP will 'be troubled' but totally allow all of it. As long as Trump is in power, with notoriously faulted AG Barr, there is no "US" in the DEPT. of J--STICE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn It would be great if you would do THAT rather than acting as belligerent destroyer of democracy as you have in 2019!

<|startoftext|>@brithume Right, it's ALL about the "culture war".

<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson Watch the LOCAL news affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC  --the little "National News" segments re: Trump &amp; #Impeachment provided by the networks are always EXTREMELY deferential to WH view and provide little detail of the extreme actions of POTUS / GOP as they dissemble democracy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham @CTmagazine @POTUS @BillyGraham Thank you for clarifying this.  We ALL know that true Trump-GOP-evangelicals are completely aligned with Putin's plan for a fascist Dominionist state for "cultural" reasons.

<|startoftext|>@FaceTheNation @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Nice that you interviewed the princess royale' about daddy's personal feelings.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump EXACTLY! True Trump/GOP-Evangelicals do not bother with ANY SILLY literal teachings of Jesus Christ!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thanks for putting PROOF into history that you were TRULY the FIRST TOTALLY DERANGED POTUS!  Congratulations on being the first to be impeached in first term! YOU are #1 on the WORST US presidents EVER list! #ImpeachmentDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis It's amazing that FoxNews mangement think this is effective propaganda -  to have an obvious IDIOT like TOMI out there rattling her mouth off in her disgruntled mean-girl manner.  Do folk in mid-maga-land actually believe she has a clue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump IF ONLY y'all believed in Jesus Christ! The fact is, GOP took CHRIST out of Christmas &amp; everything else you stand for the day you nominated DT.

<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn Y'all LUV to throw around the term "duly elected" like it has such gravitas.  Yet EVERYONE knows that the '16 elec was fraught with shenanigans of GOP voter-suppression, Russia, and Facebook malfeasance.

<|startoftext|>@MaryAReed Good catch - I thought I was making-up a word ("de-ist") to avoid making a christian religiosity slight; I didn't realize "deism" connotes the specific 18th central intellectual movement that actual seems pretty wise, upon investigation!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheLoyalO I'm sure this has NOTHING at ALL to do with the NEW MORMOM TEMPLE project in Moscow (approved by PUTIN in 2018) though that did seem to have quite the sedating effect on Romney's anti-ruski stance ever since...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope the BED BUG problems have been fixed by then. Or is that the Dural shit-hole property problem? ? ? ? That's right,  the BUG problem at Merde-lago is surveillance by you, Chinese nationals, GRU and whoever else has a few bucks to "donate" #ImpeachAndConvictTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexzfinley To destroy US, DEFINITELY much more cost effective to spend a few million rubles bribing a few dozen key GOP congressmen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So PUTIN's advice (via Lavrov) to combat impeachment is to aim your deranged BS at a heroic teenage girl?  YOU are definitely gaining traction to be VOTED Time's WORST HUMAN on EARTH: Donald J Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom Trumpty-dumpty did give away TRILLIONS and TRILLIONS of US tax funds to the richest; IT is keeping the stock market floating on ARTIFICIALLY charged LOW interest rates.

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr So says the a NYC traitor-tot, who left his wife &amp; kids for a SAN FRANCISCO-reject harlot; spent his life groveling for crumbs of love (but only gets GRIFTING-leads from deranged-dad); not so great insight into US politics - in fact, totally asinine BS!!! #ImpeachAndConvictTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 YES! The 'Rosneft' question seemed to disappeared from reporting long ago - but DT's intense personal interest in fossil-fuel solutions for everything is far too great to be just the usual GOP/Oil industry symbiotic relationship and donations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrice_Brost1 ALL the Time! My obscenity filled rants are probably a couple of times worse than yours -- but I won't look at him long (block his face with remote) and ALWAYS fast forward through any repeats of his blathering idiocy that I have already witnessed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCrapo You know what is NOT WELCOME NEWS? Your blocking RUSSIAN interference in US elections.  Is it the building of NEW MORMOM TEMPLE in MOSCOW that makes you &amp; Mitt so friendly to the Kremlin these days? Or are you just a Putin-Puppet TRAITOR by nature? #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Where's that pic of Trump squatting in his gold-lame' NYC penthouse suite, where he CLAIMS to be a deci-billionaire (though we know that's another LIE) while trophy-wife #3 and their kid 'Baron' luxuriate in the disgusting opulence of gauche pseudo-high-tone decor? #impeachment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonSCampbell Of course - that goes without saying.  Republicans had already vowed to impeach HRC before she was even elected.  Republicans are ALL about POWER and could care less about the rule of law or anything resembling justice. It's just'ice' to be hurled at D's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce Somewhat evolved no-trumpers like Scarborough (&amp; J.Rubin) are still dedicated to US governance by Plutocrats - hence the desperation to turn people away from EW or any other slightly progressive candidates.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just trying to repair the continual damage you keep inflicting on the US.  Don't get TOO excited.  It is basically just NAFTA 2.0 anyway.  TOO BAD you have completely ruined your reputation with Mid-west by your ECONOMY KILLING TARRIFs!!! #ImpeachmentDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Details, details -- the bottom line?  RUSSIA Investigation of Donald J. Trump was TOTALLY JUSTIFIED.   #Russia , if your listening, DjT's GOOSE is COOKED - time to abandon the dotard-baby-schmutz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes You are right.  A LOT more congressionalal investigation of items in "the Dossier" is essential.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @brithume @BretBaier The IG report that confirms that the RUSSIA investigation was entirely WELL FOUNDED?  Just let Lavrov fill in the details of how PUTIN wants you to to fire Christopher Wray, or preferably, POISON him with the Novochok they are delivering to you today.  #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden Don't be silly -- Barr's memo is TOO wordy for Trump to read.  KellyAnn musta just given him a verbal summary of Barr's memo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So happy that Lavrov will be stopping by to deliver NEW INSTRUCTIONS for you from KREMLIN today! Just be careful not to let any of the Russian press (that you love so much) touch you, or leave any objects covered with Novochok in the oval. #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Thanks for that super spin for RUSSIAN propaganda!!! Lavrov will stop by and say "HARSHO" and deliver Trump &amp; GOP consiglieri's further instructions from KREMLIN today!  #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ONE INDISPUTABLE FACT: 1.

<|startoftext|>@politicalblond Don't forget the 'donations' of oligarch rubles -&gt; NRA -&gt; GOP (another Mueller spin-off investigation that remains 'redacted') that has to involve dozens of 'em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus And yet somehow, I believe the ol' adage  "there is no such thing as a FREE lunch"  probably still applies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregpmiller Of Course! Since Putin no doubt wrote the script for the whole Ukraine shakedown scheme, certainly the Kremlin would want to monitor the goings on to ensure Giuliani and other Trump consiglieri's were executing it properly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrangenFuhrer @IanMarfleet @Helenhs @GOP @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @LindseyGrahamSC @DevinNunes Fux-noise is not even trying to be subtle about it anymore, with Carlson, Hannity, and the FnF's coming right out and endorsing Putin / Russia above NATO or other western allies.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'll bet he promised you and Jared a special favor or two to make sure you don't fuss about the SAUDI SHOOTINGs or any other RED SEA CONSPiratorial antics... BTW, how's the nuclear technology transfer going to the worlds greatest terrorist state?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce Biden is ALL ABOUT attracting SWING-voters who may have voted for DT in '16.  He wants to assure them that Dems are not the "pinko-socialists" that right-leaning media frame them as -- he figures he will survive offending progressive primary voters...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani GREAT TIP - starting with YOU and DjTRUMP!!!!

<|startoftext|>@gregolear Pandering in full gear - yet I doubt she will ever capture that MAGA crowd enthusiasm; she better just hope for a VP nod under Mitt.

<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton Dera John: In case you haven't been paying attention, FOXNews has recently begun a MAJOR disinformation campaign to denigrate NATO and push acceptance of the KREMLIN's plan to destroy it - which PUTIN appears to have directed DjTrump to do. He will SOON dictate a US withdrawal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis From Tucker's latest pro-Russia takes to F&amp;F's gentle anti-NATO suggestions, it appears that the Murdoch empire is going FULL TILT towards PUTIN's agenda of destroying western alliances.

<|startoftext|>@thehill This is THE HILL* that Trump&amp;GOP have chosen to die on -- The Hill that is complete DISINFORMATION or certainly a provocative UP-HILL climb from the TRUTH.  *(Not associated with "theHILL" Republican news-site/blogosphere)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reeskylr @UROCKlive1 Especially infuriating because you KNOW (several sources at least informed speculation) that Trump family/consigliere's finagle short term trading gains buying or shorting the market in front of DT's speculative tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein You and AG William Barr have certainly done your best to encourage and enable those adversaries (especially Vlad-the-poisoner-PUTIN).  Your 25A candidate DjT is still going strong thanks to y'all - hope the Fed Society at least gives you a gold watch or somethin' for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton PUTIN is especially thankful, today, to YOU, DjTrump, Pompeo, W.Barr, and all the other Republican officials who have conspired to let the KREMLIN have total reign over US foreign policy.

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @KDFildesMBA @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump Great PHOTO-OP with the troops to try to distract from #ImpeachmentDay that is coming?

<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 And watch: the DEFICIT will suddenly be labeled by financial pundits as a MAJOR THREAT to democracy and US PROSPERITY - just in time for any 2021 Dem congress/prez to justify GOP blocking every major legislative effort that doesn't favor corporations &amp; billionaires.<|endoftext|>

In anticipation of a possible Dem takeover of spending priorities in '21, time for Plutocratic Pundits to strategically crank-up the "DEFICITS are the GREATEST PROBLEM facing US" angle so GOP can feel justified blocking all spending bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudgeJeanine Well it's 5pm somewhere in the world so I would guess you are three-sheets to the wind from martini's made with Beefeater Gin shaken with Conspiracy-Vermouth with a POTUS-chaser?  #ImpeachmentDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader I would quickly reply: - '16 election was stolen by GOP voting suppression and Russian/GOP FAKE NEWS on Facebook. - He has given millions of RACISTS a champion - He is NOT getting ANYTHING but death &amp; destruction accomplished via his traitorous executive orders, etc.  NEXT LIE???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson Oh but didn't you hear?  Bloomberg will forego the big $400k presidential salary package (as did DjT (?)).   Pay no attention to the fact that if he wins, he gains control of hundreds of BILLION$ in discretionary WH spending and priority over government allotments...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You live in a cave of your own misdirected ambition.  The US has now been fully exposed to the fact that Trump and the GOP have been working for 3 years now to subvert democracy &amp; enable PUTIN PUPPET DjT to help the Kremlin destroy NATO and the US.  U R a SHAMELESS TRAITOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer @MrWednesday11 Finally, COMING OUT as a proud white-supremacist/"evangelical" who believes that authoritarian Putin/Russia is the RIGHT means to suppress/ELIMINATE ALL MINORITY opinion or ethnicity in order to preserve White Power &amp; control in the US and around the world. Democracy be damned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olgaNYC1211 @FoxNews Ol' Tuck is just gonna go ahead and COME OUT as a proud white-supremacist/"evangelical" who believes authoritarian PUTIN/Russia is the key to a future where all minority thought (and folk!) may be controlled or eliminated as needed to preserve ethnic purity.

<|startoftext|>@davidcicilline @onus_J_tweed Right, the UNSPOKEN alliance between white-supremacists/"evangelicals" that believe authoritarian Putin/Russia represents the key to a future "pure" society where all minority thought and races will be controlled or eliminated is itching to COME OUT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpTurnberry So sad to see the great landmarks of the world held hostage to disgusting exploitation by the most corrupt, racist, divisive corporate scam artist (DjTrump) of the 21st century!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah_K_Brooks Carlson is just "coming out" openly as an advocate for the unspoken EVANGELICAL/WHITE-supremacy movement in this country that believes authoritarian PUTIN/Russia is key to the future of a "pure" society where all minority thought and ethnicity will be subordinated or eliminated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalblond Or, the Kremlin knows it can catch more flies with honey than w/vinegar. More likely a honey-pot angle that goes beyond under-age prostitutes to substantial sweet campaign coffer fulfillment; always the greatest GOP temptation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnKennedy @realDonaldTrump Louisiana Russian-Asset Senator says WHAT??!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins @ProbSolveCaucus So glad to hear you actually favor some things in support of US democracy. Your ongoing actions of meeting with Trump to reinforce the Republican conspiracy with Putin / Russian oligarchs to undermine US foreign relations seem to show a much darker side to your Senatorial agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePlumLineGS At some point, the great CONSPIRACY will boil down to an overt ALLIANCE of the current US REPUBLICAN leadership with Putin/RUSSIA to undermine US foreign policy for the value of MONEY / political power maintenance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terryadvsr @mog7546 @snband4 I'm sure that all the rubles that turned into dollars going into the coffers of GOP Senators, Rep's, and miscellaneous R-Superpacs (with a little assist from the NRA) had nothing at all to do with this proud new alliance...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo YOU HAVE LOST all CREDIBILITY.  Evidence shows that you are totally involved in the Trump/Giuliani plot to help Vladimir Putin destroy US foreign relationships.  Time to RESIGN Mike.  #PompeoIsACoward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews I, a US Citizen, claim that CBSNews is totally on board with the Trump/RU plot to enable Vladimir Putin to control the world, and override ALL US FOREIGN interests for the pure sake of preserving the corporate plutocracy of the GOP. (sounds crazy - but IS IT ???)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregolear This exactly; @chucktodd and other journos predicting that despite all the obvious evidence, "there is just not enough there for the Senate to convict" -- ultra-infuriating!  Pushing the GOP narrative that Americans aren't on board with impeachment to influence the zeitgeist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn You are one of the MOST REPULSIVE US Senators right now, an advocate for racism, divisiveness, and DEFINITELY a TRAITOR to US National Interests.  I hope you suffer the same consequence's that all DjT consiglieri's will need abide: a hefty prison term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delavegalaw Why aren't congressional committees doing more to directly INVESTIGATE BARR??? He is obviously as corrupt and dirty an AG as ever there was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dscc I loathe DjTrump, but the Democrats are doing a heck of a job re-electing him with their HORRIBLE debates wherein many poorly rated candidates with no possible chance of becoming president are making Independents gag at a future Dem president.  Dems are completely blowing this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurdOnTheHill Putin has won because the entire GOP has deferred all  power to him and his OBVIOUS PUPPET - DJ.Trump.  Whether its leverage through KOMPROMAT, generous RU/NRA/GOP "donations" or whatever has y'all by the NUTSACKs - YOU GAVE away US DEMOCRACY to PUTIN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Apparently there ARE MORE GOP congress-schmucks who are PAID by RUSSIA, including our own MINORITY GOP-LEADER, KKKevin McCarthy.  Each your ruble-cake slowly, Rhorbacher, Nunes, and Trump.  The oligarchs are being stretched!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakesmustache If ONLY - I pray your querey is more than just hope here.  But it seems that until MoscowMitch gives the signal to abandon Trump (probably having negotiated some resignation deal &amp; a viable GOP replacement 20-ticket in the interim) ...NONE will budge from their power-center-hold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera When did you become a complete sycophant to the Putin-Puppet-Potus who is the most corrupt criminal divisive racist fake-US-prez in history?  Before or after the Murdoch kompromat was presented, or is it all just for the BUCKS$$$?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CitizenKayS Oh, but of-course, Mueller was NOT ALLOWED to "follow the money" trails in any conspiracy investigation, so our benevolent DoJ, as supervised by Barr and @RodRosenstein , kept the WORLD safe from any investigation of the corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhiKuro @DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Has that little matter of the MbS dismemberment party tapes ever been fully cleared up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC I expect some NEW RULES were handed to Graham and Trump from the KREMLIN, and a little boost from Erdogon's  'MbS tapes' definitely OVERRIDEs  all US foreign policy objectives and HUMANITARIAN  concerns.  DAMN the lot of'em!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brett_mcgurk @ForeignAffairs I'm sure it's been in the works by a consortium of 'interested foreign autocrats' for some time -- DT does NOT come up with this kaka-foreign policy on his own.  Perhaps Erdogan's subtle hints about the MbS ordered dismemberment tapes finally paid out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson One of DT's most disgusting and outrageous moves YET!.  Oh, but "Impeachment" has been an inconvenient political process for BOTH parties, so the Russian/Saudi controlled POTUS remains free to allow US foreign policy to crumble, and GENOCIDE to ensue. Absolutely OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO Hopefully DjTrump and his closest consiglierrei's are plotting a useful RESIGNATION strategy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillBeverlyhill GOD I pray someday all these Trump-crime-family GRIFTER-TRAITORS will be held to account, and be forced to compensate US taxpayers for their total useless livelihood, 1/17 through 12/19-(when DjT will be forced to RESIGN!!!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @LindseyGrahamSC SO obvious THAT Graham is a victim of kompromat! Seemed so in '17, but good-faith pundits insisted that he was just being politically wise against the Trmpster reality... BUT LINZ's complete fealty to Kremlin agenda REEKS of KOMPROMAT!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller WOW!!! Score ONE-Big one HIT (out of many, MANY direct-question MISSES for @chucktodd !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC @TheRickWilson Just keep rounding up the GOP to endorse a Romney/Haley ticket -- it's the only 'R'-survival strategy for the '20 election!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @GOPChairwoman Just keep tethering yourself together very tightly with the Trumptanic.  It will be a pleasure to watch you go down with that corupt STINKING, sinking ship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs BOTH - a magat came up to me in airport yesterday and noticed I was reading "Proof of Conspiracy" - started arguing with me. I told him my theory GOP will turn to MITT/Nikki ticket after DT is forced out. But he said there is an LDS prophecy that last US prez will be a Mormon...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum @anneapplebaum Agree completely, except that your characterization of DT being a "successful businessman" is extremely over-generous; IT has got to be the sleaziest criminal time-share salesman ever to escape prosecution / bankruptcy through Russian mob connections &amp; political consiglierei's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Sure! 3 years of DT destroying US foreign policy interests on behalf of the Kremlin, destroying domestic tranquility with direct attacks on US constitution/democracy &amp; racist divisions; NOW obvious criminal extortion activity-- let's think about the best interest of our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraWalkerKC Not really my idea, I got it from the attached tweet, but I couldn't get a source cited...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraWalkerKC  https://t.co/HPQ9FSgRqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraWalkerKC Is it possible, that one of those ellipses (covers) a stipulation by DT that Javelins must NOT be used against RU tanks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Wonder if he will cooperate on investigations into selling Saudi US-nuclear technology?  Could be he'll wanna 'take the fifth' on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani SPEAKING OF DISGRACING AMERICA, It's now pretty obvious that DT-sychophant AG W.Barr has suppressed the IG investigation into your dirty shenanigans with NYFBI-field office in Sep/Oct 16 to revive HRC email-nonsense to intimidate Comey. The demise of US under Trump began there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucy_persona @NBCNews Yeh, but that was 2 long years ago - before they kissed &amp; made-up, and apparently, at least the dotard fell in love (though perhaps unrequited).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rath_22 @Arriadna @HuffPostPol Oh, sure, I can totally see that. Pence-reads: "... Javelins ...  blah blah... THOUGH; ... extortion demand ...yada yada... Biden investigation demand ... must compromise with Putin...yada...repeat extortion (7 times) ..."     Nope - nothing to see here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WebOften @mhmck I can totally envision that DjT (via Vlad's command) would stipulate to Zelensky "Javelins must NOT be used against RU tanks" -- but I expect any clear evidence of that would 'BLOW UP' this scandal (real good!) to ginormous new heights. Perhaps a 'redacted' part of call read-out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillBeverlyhill For a long time, everyone was twi-wondering if DT/RU held KOMPROMAT on LG, but calmer heads insisted there was just a political-survival-strategy to his sycophancy; but his most recent TOTALly pro-putin activity definitely reeks of the kompromat-theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonFlan Definitely number 2, in so may ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senjudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @TheJusticeDept For Jesus' sake Linz. You're already knee deep in Putin's conspiracy with Trump. Every one said KOMPROMAT, but others insisted your fealty to DT was just pure personal politics. At this juncture -doing Putin's bidding to undermine Mueller? - I think the KOMPROMAT argument holds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@costareports Gee, he seemed pretty comfortable holding up the Sharpie-altered weather map for hurricane Dorian as Trump gaslighted the world about  its Alabama impact; quite content to display credible agreement with DT's lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhmck Haven't heard about that part of the "phone call" or other reporting; do you have a citable source for the the Trump qualification of non-use against RU tanks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StateDept @SecPompeo Thus, the official DoS position is to be part of the "Alliance" with Russia to promote Christianity in the world as opposed to US national security interests? Fantastic. Explains AG Barr activities and the evangelical fervor over traitor Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems that Putin has pretty much ascended to "king of the world". AG Barr doing his bidding, along with puppet DJT (&amp; subservient subjects Pompeo, Giuliani, etc). Zelensky starting to capitulate...Dasvidaniya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mimirocah1 In Barr's defense, it's a lovely time of year to be in Italy. What better season to be dining on the piazza on taxpayer funds, while you rework Kremlin strategy to relieve US sanctions for '16 elections...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Really? My internal poling shows NRA-funded-GOP champion Trump's approval sinking into the depths of Hades so deep, that y'all are trying to conjure @VP from hell with Styx-ambassador @NikkiHaley as a compliment to save the lost suburban womenfolk! Happy salvation! #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm SURE this means a molehill of soybeans to President Xi knowing it's coming from LAME DUCK Donald, the pupput prez-i-dunce of US, who is soon to be IMPEACHED or lose in '20 election BIGLY!!! #IAmTheWhistleblower<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @vicky8651 The rat-publicans will be the LAST to desert the ship (when they hear the timbers shivering in complete surrender) -- but up till then, they will be plugging every hole using every piece of shite they can muster or find to keep their livelihood &amp; control of WH buoyant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle 4th Qtr 2019: By EXECUTIVE ORDER, DT has virtually decommissioned all windmills (for fear of wm-cancer) so Dems are forced to tilt at the Russian-puppet in the WH, his crooked SoS Pompeo, and his ginormously-corrupt AG Barr of the DjT-INJustice Depart, his chief consigliere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar @LindseyGrahamSC When Lindz first joined cult45, all evidence pointed to some kind of kompromat, maybe? - but sober-pundits convinced us,"No - its just pure political strategy for SC Sen to jump on the trump-wagon".  BUT, his pro-active verve, at this juncture? MUST be something more nefarious...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Nov 9 '16, I wrote my PA-evangelical-sis a NASTY email, furious her state had put DT over the top; knowing she had voted for him.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What is this, your 300th tweet in the last 36 hours? Perhaps you should try "being US President" for a few actual hours in the WH -- I know it's a strange and highly problematic concept for you, but probably the only thing that might save your ample, IMPEACHABLE  derriere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL Is this over-the-top AUTHORITARIANISM? I can never tell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregStohr Probably way out of my league to ponder, but I can't believe CJ Roberts would enable a SCOTUS decision to over-rule or drastically curtail 'Roe' if the decision came within the election year.  JaneQPublic and Quasi-Republican voting women would rebel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjcreigh @thewebbix With a drunk-POTUS, the US would be in a much better place; his METH drug of choice, Adderall, (or whatever the hell he snorts) fuels his non-stop hate and worst impulses.  At least he would SLEEP MORE, and tweet less!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterbakernyt @GabbyOrr_ Perhaps NYT journalists who like to champion Trump for whatever reasons, should occasionally read WAPO reports just for a bit of perspective...  https://t.co/swrEl0Zhtp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness Perhaps you should try quoting someone who is not a well-known  DjT-SYCOPHANT! Maria SOLD HER SOUL to Murdoch/Trump-TV inc. years ago; she was once highly respected on WS but now she is a TV-JOKE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_Schaeffer To be fair,evangelicals traded Jesus and his inconvenient teachings for a pound of white-supremacy-dogma decades ago. Trump was just the champion who brought IT to the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader 1. Irrelevant, 2. Republican/Trump appointed IG 3. The transcript clearly identifies at least 3 Impeachable offenses.

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani QUESTION: Are felons allowed to have twitter accounts in PRISON? If not, it is going to be extremely hard for you &amp; Trump to continue gas-lighting your maga-folk into  believing such alternative-fact-gobba-ghoul! (Vast majority of Americans already knows this is BS)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein You stoically enabled the MOST CORRUPT AG in American history to suppress investigations of the biggest criminal, tax evading POTUS in history -- so Trump wouldn't tweet @ you and hurt your retirement package.  The world is burning, but hope you're comfy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @KamalaHarris Fantastic to see that you are ALL-IN on GOP-DEFLECTION strategy while Ukraine was targeted by Putin and his corruption-puppet Trump, compromising US &amp; NATO defenses. You leaned NOTHING as UN ambassador; still a hack from the Styx of SC.  YOU WILL NEVER be POTUS nor VP, traitor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Helenhs Since Trump is less &amp; less re-electable, and Pence as well, me thinks GOP masterminds are cooking up something like a Romney/Haley replacement ticket for '20.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Believe me, I tried to raise the question/alert her to husband-son's peril in comments on her new twitter account, but after a dozen quick 'likes', I feel her staff muted me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC That's mostly on account of AG Barr &amp; all y'all GOP-Russian sycophants managed to suppress the juicy stuff in the Grand Jury testimony, and the several *redacted* Mueller hand-off investigations. By the way, Vlad called to say "Spasibo!".  https://t.co/ZdCq9yu1ZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Vlad called, he say 'be sure to save Pompeo/SD texts in case needed for kompromat'. Oh, call was back in July.

<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfJohn Remember when shortly after election Rudy was holding out for Sec of State nomination? He would have been awesome! - but unfortunately I expect Trump was advised he could never pass security clearance / Senate confirmation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytmike There are numerous great journalists working at the NYT, but somehow, at some level of enterprise mgmt, there is ALWAYS an overriding agenda to preserve the  candidacy/presidency of DJT, if only for extra clicks, bucks, or love of lower tax-rates for corporations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise Trump has been exposed as a totally corrupt TRAITOR to US defense interests, using taxpayer funds to EXTORT personal political gain -- but y'all are diddling about unfounded process concerns?

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn OBVIOUS verifiable CORRUPTION and obstruction of VITAL US (&amp; international) defenses have been exposed; and you are diddling over a 'process' question?

<|startoftext|>@robsolonhamer @IsaLeeWolf Standing in grocery store-lines in 15/16 I was amazed at constant tabloid headlines (esp.

<|startoftext|>@gregolear @LincolnsBible @Meowrowrie One could see, during Barr's confirmation, that Fed Society alum-inati (Rosenstein, McGahn,etc.) skillfully enabled his entrance to play Trump-champion to deflect ALL the Mueller Rpt &amp; other investigations that would be bound to the surface in the near future.

<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli You know the entire evolution of Barr's nomination/confirmation into AG has got to be riddled with highest level assistance from Mercer cabal, Fed Society etc. Coordinated effort to fiercely protect DJT and GOP-control of gov't, no matter how obvious the crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump For once, a least one sentence you wrote was NOT a lie or BS line (the last).

<|startoftext|>@senrobportman Total BS;  R-Senators (w/#MoscowMitch) BLOCK all major legislation. What you WANT to do is defund SSA, fix Trumps mistakes in backing out of trade agreements, protect big Pharma and relieve Russian oligarch sanctions. #TrumpImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis As I'm sure you'll have tweeted by the time I get to it my feed, Rudy rocked-it with plenty of flop-sweat ranting for 16 minutes, FnF couldn't shut him up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio As with ALL congressional inquiries, Trump WH, GOP and DoJ stonewalling for weeks on providing legally required documents. BLATANT ABUSE of POWER. Even now, when caught. they're obfuscating on turning over information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Not to mention this involves military aid to Ukraine in its HOT WAR with Russia in its eastern provinces. The DELAY another benefit to Putin, detriment to NATO and US protection.  Then there's the kompromat created in the Trmp/Guilliani actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert NEW RULE:  If Maga-folk think a THING that Pres. Trump does is FINE - it may no longer be considered a high crime or misdemeanor by congress or the free press.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Sweating up a storm SPINing your tales on 9/25 FnF - trying to deflect how you and DT intervened in Ukraine over months to take advantage of the novice President. Your trials for various corrupt acts involved certainly explain your flop-sweat. Sing it at Sing Sing. #RudyColludy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Amazing you can make it thru each daily FnF and NOT be drinking.!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule Sure, then ALL info will be filed into bin#13. Never trust a Republican serving during the reign of DJT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgoodlaw Transcript of the phone call is likely only a PORTION of of the whistleblower complaint - I will be looking for the full complaint to be given to IC.  But it will be interesting IF Trmp/Barr's "transcript" actually matches the real call/transcript.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CongressmanRuiz Thank you. I now am refueled with full confidence in your great work for Riverside County!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner If the whistleblower investigation successfully encompasses misdeeds by @VP that were likely involved, maybe "today is the day Nancy became PRESIDENTIAL".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews Seems like the little $770 million in military aid intended for Euro Defense Initiative that was cut from Pentagon budget (in order for DT to build his vanity-wall) is one of those kind of 'continued withholdings'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller You know the whistleblower complaint is about much more than this one phone call!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule That would've kept DT out of the race at least as effectively as any real requirement for candidates to provide tax returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisPower1 Kinda reminds me of the ol' Mueller Report roll-out; threads of lots of wrongdoing, but somehow all the real 'substance' (grand jury testimony and major redactions) just out of reach (thank you AG Barr).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod That's why we invented you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristopherJM Lost in the "call" fixation is the fact that Trump IS    defunding more than $770 million from Euro Defense Initiative (EDI) started by Obama to shore up European defenses after RU’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 (to pay for border wall).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs Also, this notorious transcript is probably just a small part of the entire whistleblower complaint -- they want to appease with this morsel to stop the floodgates from opening on DT's prolific crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyKremer And this is how the TRUMP women #BeBest. You must ALL be so proud of the dotard in chief!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McFaul @SecPompeo Of SPECIAL interest is the $140million extra payment to Ukraine 'promised' (?) beyond the $250mil defense funds previously allocated. Seems to be coming out of State Dept. Funds. Where? From the budget that was suppose to be for combatting RU election meddling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes I.e.; bye bye democracy unless DT is so humiliated he resigns (not likely).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenPence @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Very interested in your take on how Mike's meeting with Zelensky helped MAGA!  His role as bag-man for DT in his plan to extort an investigation into rivals is definitely going to DEFINE his FUTURE, he needs to navigate this very artfully.  https://t.co/swrEl0Zhtp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillBeverlyhill Trump is 100% in league with Fossil-Fuel interests (including Putin's vast empire). Major contributors, plus I expect he has personal investments.  He has NO interest in hearing (or saying!) anything about climate issues that will (no doubt) identify FF industry impacts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McFaul The golden rule in DC and the ms-media is that Dems must always be 100% ethical and honor all political norms or they will be railroaded outta town.  Reps, however, are feisty scoundrels if they push ethics and norms -- a bit brazen but - "it's expected and O-K".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@orangepeel18 I expect 'the whistleblower complaint' shenanigans  are another tip-of-the iceberg of Trump/Putin collusion surfacing. The Trumptanic may have veered TOO close this time and will start sinking unless Barr/DoJ/GOP can suppress or override ALL the evidence -- very hard to repair.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 Nah, suggesting $250 mil in military defense aid (previously agreed upon &amp; vital to defending Ukraine from RU aggression) might be withheld - UNLESS DT get's back a little somethin-somethin' -  is just part of DT's incredible dealmaking skill! Not extortion or impeachable at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien @MittRomney @marcorubio The Mormons are definitely trying to expand their franchise in Russia (new Temple in Moscow approved) and the evangelicals are also in the new unspoken 'christian'-right alliance with RU; they have cause to temper their concerns here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericgarland Right - there were quite a few 'plates in the air' in July including the $770mil cut to the Euro Defense Initiative to help defend against RU invasion (cut from defense budget for the "wall").

<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go Or perhaps the $140mil was more of a bribe after Trmp was forced to pay out the $250mil by congress.  https://t.co/VxOYQy1pwW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tombellin @MikeHogan767 @EricBoehlert Since your comments, I've been reading about how this mess works. ANY major controversial bill MUST have a super-majority in the Sen (60) to avoid filibuster-no matter who's prez. Been that way forever. Dems had 60 for a short time in '10 when ACA passed. GOP isn't embarrassable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombellin @MikeHogan767 @EricBoehlert Your argument is well taken from an academic POV. Nonetheless, in reality, you know politics hasn't worked that way in DC for decades. #MoscowMitch  &amp; GOP always threaten a filibuster if they don't like a bill, and WIIL do it if brought to the floor. Not right, but 'what it is'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockyMntnMike Only thing of interest is wether DjT puts out one of his market-moving BS-tweets (e.g., "Great progress with China on tariffs, yada yada..".) just before the bell to cause a HUGE surge to make her look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew Sent professional (snark-less) letters to both DoJ &amp; my @SenFeinstein several months ago detailing concerns about AG Barr and recommending an IG investigation.

<|startoftext|>@tombellin @EricBoehlert I think i found it: Filibuster in the  Senate is a tactic used to prevent a measure from being brought to a vote without at least 60 votes - Dems had only 57 Senators in '09.  Am I wrong about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombellin @EricBoehlert Hard for me to find the exact tactics they were planning to use, but Senate Republicans forced near $150 billion additional tax cuts to the House bill, which had more closely followed the Obama plan. (maybe in those days B.O. was just natively trying to be bipartisan?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombellin @EricBoehlert Sure, he could have refused to compromise with GOP, then NOT pass any kind of stimulus package, and just go ahead and let the US economy collapse.  That would have taught us all!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HRCFanGal @MiekeEoyang @alexzfinley @RepAdamSchiff Exactly - I doubt help w/Siberian forest fires was the primary subject of this call - $770 million subtracted from military budget for OBAMA's EDI, would be a 2-for for DjT, and no doubt greatly please Vladdad.  https://t.co/ZdCq9yu1ZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Speaking of funding this "wall", I doubt this call was REALLY about forest fires in Siberia.  Perhaps somethin' somethin' about $770 million dollar cut to military projects in Europe to help defend Ukraine from Vladdad?  https://t.co/ZdCq9yu1ZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atDavidHoffman I doubt this call was about Siberian fires much, at all.  https://t.co/ZdCq9yu1ZN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atDavidHoffman Military construction projects the Trump administration is defunding to pay for border wall includes more than $770 million from an initiative started by the Obama administration to shore up European defense after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Very hard for me to comprehend how the multiple Israeli parties involved in election "form a government", but if Bibi ends up out-of-power, DT will surely distance himself as completely as possible to avoid being associated, or cause of the "loser" out of total self preservation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Unhappy?

<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes Isn't the red-X a symbol of ultra-right white-supremacy folk on twitter? Didn't realize you have gone so far into the movement, but I guess all the DjTrmp sycophancy has led you there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi MEANWHILE, your throwing a constant wet-rag on the valiant house efforts to impeach Trump, Barr, Kavanaugh. etc. is extremely discouraging and will lead to 4 more years of DjT &amp; bad foreign policy.  Very bad speaker, BAD speaker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm sure @NRA, major political donor &amp; illegal vehicle for Russian oligarch donations to GOP will advise you to DO NOTHING but BS "mental Health" initiatives. Y'all are gas lighting US while thousands die from assault weapons of mass-destruction in the hands of disgruntled gents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiercefreckled @MonaSigal Oh silly, only the Emails of HRC are of any concern to GOP, NYTimes, and all other MsMedia!  With regard to Trmp-regime, it's just a slight administrative faux pas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulEDawson This is indeed horrendous. What makes it worse, major #MoscowMitch &amp; DJT donor, S.Schwartzman (CEO-Blackstone Corp) has been profiting from building roads so land can be turned into soybean fields for China (after tariff war they stopped buying soybeans from mid-west USA)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump GREAT! Now do RUSSIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #LiarLewandowski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Never270  https://t.co/dGWru61WMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Never270 The hearing got off to a rocky start - thanks largely to the R-congressfok and CL being a complete AH. But after late afternoon session Berke questioning he had been nailed for massive lying and clear obstruction in a huge takedown. Shame on CNN for this BS take!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Well i'm sure it will be quite a close call between her and DjT, for his incredible act of stepping into the DMZ for a photo-op with KjU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood Not sure what current contract status is, but:  https://t.co/dGWru61WMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf Don't forget that CNN had actually employed this guy - though maybe that gig is over?  https://t.co/dGWru61WMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Dear Ronna Romney Russian-asset McDaniel: I know the GOP now considers Russia an ally and partner in crime. You and your Mormon friends are especially expanding your franchise there. But the fact is they are a US enemy that DT deliberately colluded with - it's ALL over the M.R.!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 DT lied his way into the presidency in '16 (aside from extra-help); I think he actually believes he can redouble the lies and win again in '20.  Hope you are right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonFlan Finally was able to view the 2nd half of hearing and what a HUGE diff -- the 'junior' congress folk and the consultant really nailed some homers!  Since it was only shown on PBS-twitter, as far as I could find (?), too bad very few people probably will see that part(!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! - afternoon session was 1000x better than a.m. committee questioning (especially the very awkward first hour) The younger congress folk and the consultant really nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs As with the pundit shows I enjoy - 'DVR' it all, and watch on at least a 20-30 minute delay. Then FAST FORWARD thru all the disgusting Trump speech/chopper-talk clips (most played over &amp; over) that are disgusting. Works REALLY great to FF thru all GOP speeches &amp; BS Q's (&amp; Ads!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonFlan I wish the Dems had asked questions more precisely and with EXACT MR reference/text available. They should have known he was going to obfuscate whenever possible. I thought staff/lawyers were going to do the questioning and skip the 5-min congressional political-posturing crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon If only -  ethics of the good ol' days (2.7 years ago). I believe under the new Trmp-doctrine, EVERYTHING, in the US (including the military) is available for sale or hire for the right 'payments' directed towards the chosen one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Isn't his survival based solely on presidential prerogative? No matter HOW much criminal or unethical behavior? Trmp will never fire him for such trivial matters (to him).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naretevduorp After all the hoops DT went thru to get Kennedy to resign to enable a DEAL with Fed Soc darling BK such that SCOTUS confirmation would be ensured (despite shady political/frat boy baggage) in exchange for guaranteed 5th or 6th vote to favor Trmp/Exec Br on all votes -- of course!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minhtngo @mommamia1217 @ChrisCoons Then Sen Coons helped his friend, Sen Flake call for FBI investigation - but FAILED to ensure it was thorough. It was obvious at the time that no witness interviews were being conducted. Bottom line, he helped WH &amp; GOP gaslight America that this was a real (&amp; bipartisan) vetting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CP_Numenor @ThunderBay43 @wtp__2020 I've been in a quandary since his rise began in '15, other than obvious racist-angle. He's such a completely egocentric buffoon who spends 90% time at rallies talking about himself. As it's gotten worse over time, it's increasingly depressing  knowing so many Americans like this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLewandowski_ So you are prepared to sit smugly and gaslight US Congress and the American people so as to deny justice concerning the most corrupt and compromised RU-asset POTUS in history.  Fantastic - enjoy your future in infamy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyKadiK And just as sidekick @morningmika did her best to disparage Clinton's terrible terrible 'e-mail sins'  daily in '15/16 elec coverage, she will find a similar tedious smear to malign Warren or Harris if they ascend further to the nomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke MOST shameful of all is the way the Republicans (including quasi-NO-TRUMPERS like your hubby @gtconway3d) shamelessly injected the incredibly flawed &amp; compromised BK into a SCOTUS seat on behalf of Fed Society's GOPlutocracy preservation scheme..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkbjournalist Wow - seems like quite a tepid consolation prize!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericgarland Aside from possible nefarious intent, seems MSM just panders to obvious audience attention grabber-stories. The entire RU/Saudi deliberate elec sabotage, etc. is Jjust too complex for JQPublic to wanna comprehend. Until it's made into a blockbuster movie it'll be under the radar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I LUV how you keep preparing magats to find out from your TAX returns or Deutsche Bank records that you are NOT - nor have you EVER BEEN a BILLIONAIRE!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Geeez - I had no idea @ChrisCoons has gone so far into the dark-side -- his gas lighting thoroughness of the Kavanaugh-FBI investigation was a BIG clue I guess.  Didn't realize he is a 'blood for oil' advocate, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis In this scenario I have to hope that de facto-NSA Putin's advice 'trumps' the MbS/Saudi directives coming in from the neocons -- must be quite the quandary for DT since he usually takes his cues from FnF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Are you now ONE with your garments and couch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Very interested in hearing RIGHT version of the truth behind GOP thwarting all real FBI investigations with a cabal of Fed Society alumni:  WH (McGahn) DoJ (Rosenstein) FBI (wray) ALL for favorite frat bro Kavanaugh. (&amp; why did Justice Kennedy resign abruptly.) Thnx #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueVotr @SenatorCollins Aunt Clara (from "Bewitched") conjuring her last incubus for #MoscowMitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 He needs a get-away to chat by phone with his de facto NSA Putin to see what his next move in the gulf should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller Didn't Rod Rosenstein pretty much shield the Kavanaugh nomination process on behalf of DoJ? Maybe DT is alluding back to that previous help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rexthetvterrier Also checking for messages I see. Great to see you out'n about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayawiley I'm pretty sure that old Fed Society pal @RodRosenstein interpreted his DoJ role as QUITE the OPPOSITE (and helped old pal C.Wray hold back the FBI for old pal D.McGahn orders) - I sense a pattern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle DoJ ALREADY came to his rescue during Ford - hearings; Rod Rosenstein stood guard with fellow Fed Society pals to ensure no incriminating evidence or opinions surfaced; meanwhile BK old friend C.Wray made sure to follow Fed Society/D.McGahn's WH orders not to investigate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sure - there's ONE BIG OPINION you need to have BK hold for you  (a.k.a. the reason you forced Justice Kennedy to resign) is that "DjTrump executive power overrides all unconstitutional actions, criminal investigations and abuse of power - no matter how severe". #KavanaughLied<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DebbieClarkFin1 @brianschatz @Shan73198 Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman is a close ally of Trump and has donated millions of dollars to McConnell in recent years. They are building a major road in the Amazon enabling access to areas being burned to grow soybeans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @gtconway3d Also, I don't see much mentioned about other long-time Fed Society pals C.Wray (heading FBI) and R.Rosenstein (standing guard for DoJ) who followed D.McGahn's specific WH order NOT to investigate additional witnesses and severely limit scope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Presleytal @blueWRL @JoyceWhiteVance Meaning Justice Dep - DoJ perhaps a better mnemonic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 Not sure about that; C.Wray (head of  FBI) &amp; R.Rosenstein (standing guard for DoJ) were long time pals of BK and followed fellow old-pal D. McGahn's WH directive NOT to investigate. Temp was so high at Ford-hearings, S.Collins &amp; other GOPsen's might have bowed to public pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blueWRL @JoyceWhiteVance Not to mention that ol' BK-pal Christopher Wray was in charge of FBI then wasn't he? And ol' pal Rod Rosenstein standing guard for JD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Sometimes heroes Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein were instrumental in ushering in their ol' Fed Society Pal also, as I recall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrylitman @RodRosenstein and third musketeer and sometime hero: Christopher Wray.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump .@amjoy is doing very well, thanks, and consistently hosts a show filled with excellent reporting about your incessant corruption &amp; misdealing as POTUS.

<|startoftext|>@ResisterSiano Floored me with this tweet; at first I thought DT said that (again) today (9/11/19) during his ramblings at the Pentagon. Certainly plausible he would repeat an old lie...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs @TheRickWilson @EggExodus I'd argue he could easily pick Nikki Haley.  He desperately needs help with the suburban-ladyfolk-vote.

<|startoftext|>@KyleOrl @TheRickWilson Sure he can - the 'evangelicals' will stay with him no matter what BUT DT badly needs electoral help with the suburban-GOP-ladyfolk (lookin' at you Nikki).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cburgoyne @TheRickWilson Agree - "Evangelicals" will stay with Trmp no matter what, but he needs BIGly assistance w/the suburban-GOP-ladies ...(look'n at you Nikki)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake I'm sure #PABPresident  super LUVed the anti-Iran warmongering, but HATED any plans to actually fight. Typical bully-mentality (talk loudly but carry a small  stick).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyblueblood "In coordination" with US? Sounds like plan for a another US military intervention in the middle east.  Do you suppose this is just strong-man election speak, or is it an actual Trmp/Kushner strategy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonFlan Dem. pace moving to formal impeachment is frustrating, but I do understand the effort to bring DT's numerous FINANCIAL crimes into play. JQPublic doesn't seem to care that much about the complex RU/foreign intrigue and obstruction, but they WILL GET DjT being an obvious CROOK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake Maybe because he's been alerted that there are at least two blatant &amp; clear cases for the upcoming articles of impeachment involved in this 'situation'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karoli I'm just a bit relieved, this may be the asset that DT and AG Barr are dying to uncover for Putin enuf that they did that special executive order authorizing Barr to declassify any IC intelligence on the RU investigation he wants. ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dutchwouter777 .@RodRosenstein: he appeared to be valiantly defending Mueller investigation from DT's constant threat. But in the end - he was just part of the conspiracy with AG Barr (&amp;GOP) to misrepresent &amp; mute the MR to shield Trump from real accountability.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson I'm convinced that in DT's small brain (when it is functioning) he truly believes that any international problem can be settled by a ceremonial event hosted with a big dose of Trumpian-glitz, some glad-handing and his mere presence/speechifying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I wonder if the congress will add "TOTALLY DERANGED" to the articles of IMPEACHMENT being drafted?  Maybe a bit more officious language is required, but the basic grounds are that you are definitely TOTALLY DERANGED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOfficerTatum Not really. Trump supporters are well known by close friends and family as being Maga*ts.

<|startoftext|>@PressSec The dotard-in-chief is out of control. The reason real policy changes are not prevalent in the media is Trump's pathological obsession with his infallibility. We realize, however, that Trump is creating a fake-hurricane to cover-up his administration's many real-news failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @jimcramer Oh, SORRY - the ginormous GOP/Trump-TAX-SCAM, in conjunction with your deranged tariff war, have left the Fed crippled to fight inflation. Oligarchs at Deutsche Bank will be needing you to pay a higher interest rate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer Nice try maga-press.  It matters little that there is some reasonable excuse to Trmps confusion about the ACTUAL PATH of the HURRICANE; the amazing political issue is that he is PATHOLOGICAL LIAR in continuing to defend his misstatements and doctoring of weather charts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EWErickson That is a a heartfelt, almost poetic conveyance of your sincere dedication to short-term profits$$, no matter what the damage the future world may bear.  Ka-ching, baby!  $$$!   F-the future!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @CNN Perhaps the stable-genius #SharpiePresident could do a Trump-U-style geography course to CNN, NWS, and NHC.  DT's hurricane rating scale ("Dorian 1st cat-5" ?) definitely needs further explanation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@415holgate Definitely! The real question, are DjT, traitor-tots or any of Trmp-cronies (e.g. C.Icahn) directly profiting by market moves through carefully timed stock options purchases (shorts AND longs) just before ea tweet???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Woman who inherited her fathers wealth fetishizes her love of guns and threatens the population like a terrorist if they attempt to regulate fire-arms is now offering 'morality lessons' to Hollywood.  Check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 I expect there is something much more nefarious than just the DjT-idiocracy at work; the fossil-fuel industry will PROFIT from more electrical-energy-producer fuel requirements.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump STOP! You have been caught in a BIGly series of LIES! Just stop digging the hole deeper and deeper, unless you plan on staying deep down in the earth, permanently! #SharpiePresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Just imagine the rest of your life you will be identified as one of the greatest PUBLIC SHILLS for DjTrmp. As his place as the most corrupt POTUS in history is cemented, bought and installed by Putin, you will always be a footnote. Congrats on that. (Sen. LindseyG. is jelly!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump In the REAL WORLD, you LIED repeatedly, had to be corrected by NHC, then LIED to cover up your earlier LIES, altered official maps and gave a false weather report.   I.E., another IMPEACHABLE offense. #SharpieTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oops!!  Sooo close - you ALMOST found a map that supported your DANGEROUS ERRONEOUS Tweet about Alabama being in Dorian's path, but this is not a National Hurricane Center map - you forgot to cross out the disclaimer on the bottom of the map. SO ANOTHER IMPEACHABLE LIE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WordswithSteph Gosh - I hope it doesn't get on your PERMANENT RECORD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Right - except the national weather service had already clarified the hurricane would NOT GO NEAR ALABAMA before you tweeted and then lied, altered maps and LIED and then LIED more about it to cover up your earlier LIES. #Sharpie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet @Sir_Bradford I certainly hope it contains NONE of the flavor of the current "Justice Dept."; DoJ under AG Barr has a distinctly foul, bitter, possibly-toxic aroma.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill Wow - how almost patriotic of #MoscowMitchMassacre, other than the fact he  KNOWS DjT will not be offering to sign any significant gun control legislation that might "upset" their mutual #1 client - the NRA . Certainly no background checks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Yes #MoscowMitchMassacre, we ALL know that you favor full government sponsored subsidies to multi-national corps and Russian oligarchs, ONLY. Every frigging thing you do is in promotion of a US PLUTOCRACY, paid for by US taxpayers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @AlanDersh You and your GOP consiglieri's have continuously thwarted FBI because, from the beginning, it was obvious to IC that y'all are part of a Russian sponsored cabal sacrificing the US for a few million dirty Rubles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Re: Trmp afraid of NRA? Great discussion on show today; it seems like the answer to this mystery lies hidden; we get no clue about Mueller referred investigations and other nefarious financial connections between NRA, GOP and RU, all which remain "redacted" from public knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA @Walmart The "FREE MARKET" has determined selling guns/ammo with NO restrictions is very BAD FOR BUSINESS.  Vast majority of Americans want reasonable gun safety measures in place to keep 2nd amendment protections WELL REGULATED.   Free markets are not available for political SALE$$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN #MoscowMitch knows that the LAST party DjTrmp will talk to (before himself) on any legislative gun-measures will be LaPierre/@NRA who will have gotten him to agree to sign NOTHING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cspan @VP On behalf of Irish-Americans who categorically DESPISE D.J.Trmp, please cease &amp; desist your relentless sycophancy to the most corrupt POTUS in history. Relations with Ireland will greatly improve with the end of this treasonous regime. Please reimburse US taxpayers for this trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankthorp Convenient passing of the public-pressure "buck"; you know the NRA has already been assured by both Trmp and #MoscowMitchMassacre that nothing serious will be done on any gun legislation. Later, Trmp will just blame congress for nothing getting done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markknoller @StateDept @VP Certainly he deserves this special reward from the Trmp-Putin-regime, especially after his work  prepping Ukraine for possible withholding of US military aid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump HELLO ? Mr President of the US of A -- you are suppose to be WORKING FOR ALL AMERICANS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon Second that!! I'm a cable-news junkie, but usually 'DVR" programs so when I watch shortly thereafter, I can fast-fwd thru any DjT speeches or blurbs - especially repeats or collections.  He's just TOO revolting to hear or look at (even as I ff, I block image w/remote).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 By "meaningful" he means they will come up some BS proposal to spend millions on a bogus 'mental health program' that will then be used to selectively disarm perceived political enemies of the GOP or prez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Is that based on the FBI and DoJ policy that nothing perpetrated by white Americans is allowed to be considered terrorism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🙏👎  https://t.co/remnWqjxS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 1) How many times do we have to explain to you that YOU ARE NOT GOD?  stop trying to "bless" people.  2) Proof you are definitely NOT GOD:  Alabama IS NOT in the path of the hurricane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse On behalf of AMERICA:  STFU and pass some decent gun control legislation!!!!  90% of US in favor of reasonable background checks  Trump need to cease his kowtowing to the corrupt NRA!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol In the end, many Republicans who KNEW Trmp would be an unfit POTUS voted for him anyway - knowing that GOP+Trmp would amount to EXTREMELY FAVORABLE TAX and regulatory environment. The 'DjT craziness' was just a price to be paid to maintain the plutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Shipp Of course not.  AG Barr as has taken great pains to ensure all of 'elite' politicians &amp; wealthy 'Johns' involved in Epstein's rape-racket are COMPLETELY protected.  Especially HIMSELF &amp; DJ TRUMP. Unfortunately, this means a few Dems also get away with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein So you 're saying that it is FINE that AG Barr completely misrepresented the MR and LIED about his findings to a gullible TV audience of millions, because one could always read the TRUTH if they are really that interested? ...sure that seems like US Justice hard at work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn But MORE IMPORTANTLY, you're thankful to the NRA for their continued patronage and HUGE campaign contributions!$!  We know you will ALWAYS KEEP GUN Manufacturer PROFITS first and foremost in your policy making agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU and the GOP with YOUR damned dependence on million$ in NRA DONATIONS (including Russian oligarch contributions) ARE the PROBLEM! Law enforcement by the LAWLESS AG Barr and your corrupt admin is a JOKE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity You know -- I like Hannity, but he is always having interviews with some Ass-hat CLOWN who blathers on and on about his poles.

<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara "Russia kicked out of G8 (now G7) because Obama was humiliated by Putin",  Actually, the greatest mission of his RU-sponsored presidency has been to eliminate Ukraine invasion sanctions.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Must really piss you off that one of your FAILING resorts is not getting paid rent &amp; golf cart fees this trip; I'm sure you will figure out some other grift. No doubt you will claim any minor storm damage at Mara-lardo or Doral will require millions in taxpayer funds to repair...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rschooley I WAS certain that robust institutions (FBI, CIA, DoJ, Congress) would eventually expose/correct the corrupt (if-not TREASONous) acts of DT.  At this juncture, pretty much resigned to his getting away with murder for the sake of POWER with the sad complicity of said institutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Can't wait for the IG report on the shenanigans at the NY-FBI Field Office in Fall'16 wherein you participated in sabotaging the FBI &amp; Comey by leaking HRC email contrivances. Or has the Trmp/GOP-protection racket under AG Barr managed to kill that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReaperKat @NicoleKenza .@JudgeJeanine does not really BELIEVE any of the crap that she regurgitates -- it's just part of the right-wing-schtick she makes million$ for drunkenly bellowing each week, while hoping for some lucrative gig in whatever DjT/GOP/DoJ slot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Many people suspect that you are making a ton of ca$h manipulating the stock market with your distorted/lying tweets about China, etc. Please have Traitor Jr. provide a record of your SHORT and LONG positions for the last 2 years to clarify this issue for possible impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimsciutto Trmp &amp; his consiglieri's have been engaging in market manipulation and insider trading for 2 years now.  Of course, no oversight of illegal transactions will ever occur thanks to GOP/DoJ. Remember DT's arrangements with special advisor Carl Ichan (before forced to resign 8/17) ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Thank the Devil &amp; GOP that Trump remains free from any constraint to plot with his Russian overlords to diminish US international interests for the sake of boosting his own bottom line a few mil$!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calsanad @jean_whiting @Stop_Trump20 Does look like a younger, slimmer version of Barr - but trust me, the AG is busy getting 'ALL the DoJ horses and ALL the DoJ men/lawyers' to appeal this decision to SCOTUS where the planted Trmp judges will over-rule!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker @AOC Great point Walker.  Now let's review how the GOP has single handedly attempted to destroy every vestige of democracy and human rights that the GG sacrificed for.

<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein Is this how you justify to yourself that you were "just following orders" as you stood silently by W.Barr reading misleading DoJ statements about the exoneration of DjTrmp in his "Mueller Summary", allowing a clearly compromised Russian Asset to continue to hold power in the WH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @Lawrence @MSNBC It would really "own the libs" if all y'all Trumps just released your tax returns and Deutsche Bank loan docs!  That will PROVE you guys are completely UP'n'UP!  Do it! #DeutscheBankLoans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @smilingoutloud2 As always, he is not at all interested. SPECIFICALLY, DT does not want to bear witness to anything that contradicts talking points of key DONORS &amp; cronies in the FOSSIL-FUEL industry (&amp;Vladdad!!!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Russia continues unwelcome aggression in Ukraine and other regions, not to mention attacking the US directly by invading our electoral process.

<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump To your point, EVERYTHING DjTrmp has done in both the US and the world in the last 3 years has been incredibly disrespectful and totally destructive.

<|startoftext|>@MikeSington I know MsM must cater to MAGA-folk to ensure WH access and a sense of public neutrality. But I've noticed a HEAVY trend at @ABC news/entertainment to be especially pro-trumpy in last year. US news segments shown by local affiliates are always done with maximum positive DjT spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMA @seanspicer @DancingABC Fantastic! So inspiring to see a holocaust denier and deplorable racist Trump sycophant get an opportunity to dance for big $$$ and celebrity on a Disney Channel.  @ABC is really going full MAGAt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren 1) San FranSisco? SF International (SFO) is about 35mi south of San Franciso. SFO is pretty damn clean last time I checked. 2) I think I can speak for vast majority of SF residents who would agree that your presence in that fine city is the worst possible exhibit of human waist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "SORRY" is the new name for Trump properties that will be seized after your massive criminal enterprise is finally fully exposed. This is yet, ANOTHER IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE: name calling and endangering a US congressperson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Let me add, ahead of every racist tweet and/or chopper-talk press gaggle that presidunce Trmp inflicts on America today, that he is not actually orange with golden fleece; it's all an illusion done with dyes and make-up (3 hrs). Also, not a billionaire nor a stable genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst Yes, we all saw how you bravely stood up to that silly school teacher and REFUSED to address meaningful gun control legislation! You are definitely standing up for the rights of gun manufacturers to make maximum profit$$$ while citizens cower in fear for their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP Average income in YOUR neighborhood? Not mine. In fact, because of Trmp's deranged trade-wars and tariffs, the average family is in the hole about $5k more than 2 years ago. The GOP tax-scam also created the worst deficits in US history - all for the top 1% &amp; multinational corps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington Or, as my gal Joni M. put into lyrics back in '98 "happiness is the best face lift"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If "the Mooch" is attacking for his OWN PERSONAL GAIN, then he's absolutely the exact embodiment of everything DjT could ever aspire to in WH staff. PERSONAL gain is the heart and soul of the GOP and Trmpism - that is why you are perfect for each other. The 'fake news' loves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadedCreative @JuddLegum As he began naming cabinet position nominees after election, it became apparent to ALL in the GOP that despite the foul taste, DjT was key to bringing the SWAMP directly into FULL power in gov't -- he would sign-on to all Republican legislative efforts to enact a true plutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Thank God the face of the Republican party, strongly and bigly representing ALL of the GOP, is the overtly RACIST and subversively fascist DjTrump, the most corrupt and divisive WH occupant ever!   Keep the plutocrats in power - vote GOP for your demise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump W-O-W! 'Quantitative easing' spelled &amp; used correctly in a sentence? Kudlow must have written this for you after he sobered up on Monday morning.  His drunk appearance on FOX was hilarious! Tweet-threats to the Fed are always a good reassurance to citizens that everything is FINE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are right-on as usual!  Your poll numbers just keep getting better EVERY TIME YOU TWEET about them!  I think you should tweet about them 10-20 times a day, always explaining that any underperforming numbers are "FAKE NEWS"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcamillegray @j363j @glennkirschner2 @NikitaKitty @DMRDynamics @brontyman pretty simple, follow the money:        rubles -&gt; NRA -&gt; $ -&gt;GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OH please give us the inside scoop of how you have picked the rest of the "BEST PEOPLE" in your tremendous cabinet.  You must be the most amazing people picker who has ever packed a peck of precarious criminals into the WH!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNewsSunday Nice that @DanaPerino accommodated this 'drunk talk' interview, unfortunately, this Kudlow-person is a paramount figure in handling the world's largest economy and it's NOT at all funny that he hasn't a clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports A couple of folks from the NRA called and reminded DT of the tremendous debt he owes them (not to mention the Russia/GOP kompromat that might be stirred up...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Have any Fox-noise 'talent' actually come forward with a direct endorsement of 'proud boys' or other white supremacy activists?  Sounds pretty close to the surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst Thank you for calling Trump out on his racist tweets.  You are smart enough to know that one has to keep the racist-dog-whistle at a very high pitch, so seemingly patiotic citizens can feign to support the president, even though they know he's a totally corrupt racist fascist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Apparently his advisors told him putting @IvankaTrump on the ticket would hurt GOP victory odds despite his hope for a smooth transference of royal power. (he is clearly 'losing it' and would resign shortly after re-election).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets His number one 'real estate priority' is to complete the annexation of Crimea by mother-Russia. To finalize the transaction, he needs to get US out of business of sanctioning oligarchs for it.  I think he will be greatly rewarded with commissions (etc.) on this deal when done..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Spoken by the advocate for fully-fixed GOP elections. The GOP/NRA/RU nexus won't even allow the FEC to investigate the obvious influence of Russian oligarch contributions to Republicans.  HUGE rudimentary campaign finance violations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump More like 'beauty &amp; the beast (within)'. I see you're enjoying nature before daddy-dearest and GOP/RU-cronies destroy the last natural vestiges with destructive environmental policies.  You must be especially proud that they are now trying to kill off endangered species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Dear deranged DjT-sycophant Ted: NYT's had plenty of bad headlines lately, often when indulging in pro-trmpoganda. BLOTUS himself is disavowing fox-noise today because they sometimes report actual news (BAD POLL no.s). Stop being such a snowflake. The DjT-regime is a horror show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke We need an ASSAULT-style weapon ban.   Enough with the band-aids for this national cancer. Mass shootings happen when civilian killing weapons-of-war are easy to obtain by any ol' disgruntled American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio TOOOO LATE!  You have been hanging with mango-mussolini long enough to be totally entwined with the fascist racist; you and the rest of his GOP sycophants will be together in hell with DjT for eternity, due to your cruelty and deliberate endangerment of innocent children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLewandowski_ Right! - you are running on a platform of "WitchHunt!". Perfect. People of NH are smarter than the usual red-hat hooligans who support DjT. They know how to READ, and having read the Mueller Rpt., they KNOW there was plenty of Collusion and OBSTRUCTION! Stick to tax-scam - safer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham Maybe, if such "Christian organizations" are't involved in business where PUBLIC funding (taxpayer) is involved. Certainly no adoption or social services programs.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump IMPEACHABLE offense No. 48 of Russian-installed WH squatter.  Derangement is strong in this dotard! #TestTrumpsMind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Now #LeningradLindsey, you need to focus on trying to help #MoscowMitch get out from under his "aluminum plant" (Deripaska-ruble/$-laundry) dilemma.  Vlad-the-poisoner is counting on you and his several other GOP/NRA/RU assets to enable this invasion of the US economy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillCassidy As a gastroenterologist, I'd think you know the best course of action would be to immediately ZAP a cancerous polyp like DjTrmp; in this extreme case, a removal of this whole diseased GOP colon is probably required.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardTHardy He knows eventually tax returns or other financial info will be revealed that show, maybe, he is worth a few hundred mil after netting liabilities; he is preparing his red-hats by telling them it all went away w his election - poof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Of course - the magical solution to any &amp; all global ills involves a showy pageant with the stable-genius; at a minimum it fills his calendar with presidential photo-ops that require beaucoup taxpayer bucks and minimal brains.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mike_P_Williams Apart from the usual lying/gas-lighting, part of a strategy for blaming 'politics' when, inevitably, his tax returns or other financial info becomes public that shows DjT is NO billionaire (?).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJopinion So #MoscowMitch can bring the damn bill to the Senate floor and debate/negotiate the kinks, if any.  He needs to stop acting as chief protector for the Russia/NRA/GOP cabal that is intent on crippling the US however possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @rmsylvia You know the princess-royal' is a daddy-whisperer, only.  She has had a tremendous effect on ... well, keeping Jared as head of all US foreign policy for one thing, and... and really that's about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein Incivility in the US right now stems directly from the racist words, idiotic tweets and deranged actions of the Russian installed POTUS. Thanks to your support of conflicted AG Barr in misrepresenting the Mueller Rpt, the country continues to suffer the destruction of democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO @realDonaldTrump Following your coverage of Trmp's rambling and totally disingenuous speech denouncing 'white supremacy', I see you are still desperately trying to make him seem 'presidential'.  Good luck with that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The BILGIEST HUUUGEST red flag warning of all needs to be assigned to one deranged and clearly demented DJTrmp, holder of the nuclear football/codes.  Time to 25th A him, immediately. #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews The scene from 'Chernobyl' where the gov't officer orders a babushka to leave her farm; when she philosophically &amp; practically objects, he then kills her main food-source, her faithful cow, in front of her -- one of the saddest scenes I have ever watched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile @Equinox @soulcycle Jewish community is safe, for now, as DjT needs them to keep the evangelicals waiting for Jesus' return to Jerusalem (of corse after that, totally expendable).

<|startoftext|>@Sarah_SKG_1983 Or how the decades-long objective of plutocracy champions @SpeakerRyan &amp; #MoscowMitch to drastically cut taxes on corp.s and billionaires found a cooperative WH co-signer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Maybe nothing nefarious (involving others) happened in Epstein's cell.

<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee Be sure to give Vlad-the-poisoner his puppet-Tmpy's hugs and kisses and grab 'em by the p****, and don't forget to pass on the US Intelligence secrets that AG Barr uncovered for GRU inquiry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Alternatively, you could read the Mueller Report, review the extensive work of non-partisan investigators and come to the obvious conclusion that DT worked closely with Russians who got him over-the-top into the presidency. DT has multiple corrupt foreign deals &amp; entanglement$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse ODD - virtually every Trmp-regime cabinet position is filled with a Secretary who HATES their department, and is doing everything possible to destroy missions. That's beyond the fact that they are ALL HATEFUL people, and use "HATE" as general policy whenever possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman NO Way! Support the GOP approach to healthcare, wherein unless you can afford to pay HUGE premiums to your HC insurance co., you get NOTHING!!! Especially if you have a pre-existing condition: the Republicans promise to take your HC away entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Correction:  "AG William Barr, who has authority over the MCC facility, condems HIS prison for failing to "adequately secure JE".  DO NOT ATTEMPT to paint this corrupt public official as anything less than complicit in two of the greatest DoJ frauds in US history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hobie_SHRED @JenniferHouse15 @CindynEncinitas E.g., info on Kremlin assets unearthed by AG Barr after DT's executive order allowing him full access to IC files for FBI/CIA "investigations".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein Also amazing how certain soft fatherly voices can pontificate and create a narrative that is total disinformation, and sell it to the body politic as exculpatory fact. Looking at you, AG Barr and his DoJ posse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC I'm very much assured that after paying public lip-service to the 'pursuit of justice', AG Barr will forthwith announce perhaps some low level jail-error, but  senior DoJ was blameless, and certainly NO reflection whatsoever on DjT or the GOP.

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn In the photo, DjTrmp is giving a big THUMBS UP. He's proud that his stochastic TERRORISM has caused this child to become an orphan.  Republicans are ALL represented by Trmp -  another TROPHY for the NRA/GOP cabal that is slaughtering Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz Spasibo #MatryoshkaGates !  You make the Russia propaganda campaign so much easier for GRU to better buffer Puti-puppet Trmp from #TrumpsBodyCount focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump "- #4"  is probably correct, however,  IF SO, then "- #1" will be the official answer that AG Barr will approve for any IG report/public disclosure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @RawStory Now that @SpeakerRyan (Paul) is on the board of Fox Corp. (Foxnews parent), I wonder if he approves / encourages the policy of white-supremacist programming?  I'd hate to see any damage to his great legislative record of pushing tax cuts for the wealthiest and ginormous deficits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews So great to hear the machine-gun-bacon guy gas-lighting about the vague area of mental health in order to divert the conversation about SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL.  This disruptive Senator is a major shill for the NRA and is endangering American lives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdquinn Right - like he was gonna 'drain the swamp' - but has done nothing but dredge up horrid creatures from the depths of the Okefenokee for all cabinet posts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanUhl Admits to watching MSNBC??  Wonder why he never rage tweets about @maddow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics_PR .@SpeakerRyan (Paul) joined the board of Fox Corp (parent of fox news) in May.  I guess he could make his sad legacy even more deplorable by sustaining the increased white-supremacy theme of the network, or he could move to DELETE IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SpeakerRyan became a Fox Corp board member in May.  His new gig involves either approving or DELETING the white-supremacy going on at Fox News.  How much more damage can his troubled legacy endure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FedSoc @DonaldKochan @Chapman_Law @NiskanenCenter Great! A lively academic debate on climate change, consideration of venue, standing issues. MEANWHILE, the HOTTEST JULY on record and the polar ice caps are melting; BUT fossil fuel corps. still get public subsidies and make ginormous profits. Is this a great country, or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Speaking out your arse per usual.   1) You know this is public info, available to anyone 2) HATE that mob boss DjTrmp &amp; GOP/NRA consiglieri's have engendered in the population is just beginning to rise; we are not going to let y'all keep murdering us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Oh, now, I'm sure these two little campaign stop/photo-shoots only cost taxpayers maybe 30-50 million dollar$ (AF-1, security, etc.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scavino45  https://t.co/ymKm0SDXgK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scavino45 Amazing that presidunce Twitler actually came out in El Paso and congratulated himself on how beloved he was in the hospital and how bedazzled they were by HIM, again it's ALL about HIM!  You never answered the question - did you pay El Paso the $500k past due bills?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo Your continued support for this despot is an embarrassment to US.  You have utterly failed in holding Saudi and this prince accountable for Khashoggi's murder and numerous other civil rights abuses. Clearly there are major nefarious financial entanglements with the Kuschner/Trmp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins 'Extremely disappointing that people expect action on Gun Control'?  You must definitely not be running in '20.  Dozens of people are being murdered in mass killings by 'assault style weapons' everyday -- I think the time has come for politicians who give a damn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@normative That must be it, because from my anecdotal evidence, it sure seems like Twitter &amp; FB (at least) go waaaay out of there way to placate Trmp &amp; the 'right' (wrong) side.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scavino45 Man that's great, 'cause the entire thing is ALL ABOUT the Trumpenfuror, isn't it. I hope you got some great pics/videos for your campaign ads. The whole trip can't have cost taxpayers more than $10million. btw, did you pay El Paso the $500,000 past due bill you owe them??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SollenbergerRC At first I thought 'NO', most maga*s wouldn't mind - but then I realized NRA would immediately arrange a 'primary challenge'. and suddenly DT could have a problem. GOP would go into crisis mode to pick loyalty, thus - t'will never happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @KellyannePolls Cut the crap and divorce yourself from the  God damned NRA!  The Russians oligarchs are not going to be able to fund GOP contributions thru them anymore anyway.

<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @Yamiche We have never been in a more perfect pre-"the Emperor has NO clothes on." situation. 65% of the US and nearly ALL congressional and other gov't officials (incl.

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump The princess-royal' attempts to change the US narrative that daddy's racism inspired a gunmen to murder innocent civilians in El Paso.

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity I just don't see why any candidate (except DjTrmp) would NOT want to come onto a show on Trmp-state-TV, hosted by a DjT-sychophant that is proposing the US become a vast police-state run by one all-powerful fascist racist POTUS! what's-a-matta-for-dem??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnBarronknows @OleanderNectar @Kris_Sacrebleu I'm sure they get the timing down a lot tighter than that.  I'll bet he called C.Icahn minutes before he tweeted about new tariffs last week - after the market had just recovered since his last assault on Fed rates.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Yeh, to a simpleton-non-lawyer, I don't understand how sensible 'gun safety regulations' could be deemed unconstitutional when the 2A of US constitution specifically refers to "in order to maintain a well regulated militia" ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu I'm sure that several of the 1% people in the Trmp's inner-circle were alerted to 'go short' or buy S&amp;P 'put' options just before he sent out tweets to reignite the trade war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hullboydan Would love to know how much Trmp and his WS buddies actually profited from this by 'shorting' the over-heated S&amp;P (in their own trading accounts) just before he reignited the China trade war with a simple tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington Oh yeh, that hood is really nice! OK, whats the catch - big foundation prob.s?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kris_Sacrebleu @OleanderNectar Don't worry, I'm sure DjT and some of his Wall St.  buddies heavily shorted (/bought puts) against the over-heated S&amp;P just before he tweeted about starting new China sanctions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera The majority of Americans DID NOT VOTE FOR Trmp; he never once attempted to unite Americans, ALWAYS opting to DIVIDE US.

<|startoftext|>@ABC Thanks wonderful-world-of-Disney-news. Must be broadcasting from fantasyland today. Yes, Pres. DjT stumbled thru this teleprompter speech that called on America to do better, but FAILED completely to acknowledge his own culpability for the tragedies and offered NO CONTRITION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roshan_Rinaldi @MeloniaSherban I had thought he had avoided his cute little white-power symbol (with thumb&amp;index-finger) in the speech, but I see it now, right there at beginning of this clip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorahODonnell Is it that you are a Republican, desperate to rehabilitate DjT for next election?

<|startoftext|>@NorahODonnell @weijia Sure - everything is FINE because DjT stumbled thru some words written by Conway or some other erudite staffer.  Let's see how long it is before he resumes his usual tweets or maga-rally racism and white-power hand gestures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pj1414 I thought of #MatryoshkaGaetz for the mad maga FL congressprick, but could work for Romney. (refers to RU nesting dolls).

<|startoftext|>@r_graus @fras99 Exactly. The circle of life won't end so well for one of 'em in the real world. As beautiful a "Serengeti" was filmed, I couldn't watch much because of the pain of seeing 'nature' in its rudimentary survival of fittest reality. (I know, I'm a snowflake).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Unbelievable. Just read about your joining w/Cheney &amp; company to overturn DC handgun ban in 2009.

<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 And believe me, the only real 'immigration reform' he is interested in discussing is extreme limitations on all but euro-immigrants, and more importantly, appropriating tens of billion$ for his vanity WALL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepPeteKing @SenBooker @POTUS BLOTUS' stochastic terrorism directly links him to the massacres performed by red-hat-magats with assault weapons sponsored by the Trmp-GOP/NRA.

<|startoftext|>@emptywheel I'll take a wild guess that if DjT brings up anything in his little speech tomorrow along the lines 'we will study possible domestic terrorists' - he'll 'both sides' it and emphasize antifa as the major concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Rubbish. The killings can be directly attributed to Trmp's stochastic terrorism. YOU definitely have a mental health crisis in your brain, and are in complete denial. Your invocation of God &amp; family to cover for @NRA shows the idiocy and desperation of your tiny evil soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Words of wisdom from heavy-duty recipient of massive donations from the NRA and other weapons pushers.  Your ceaseless efforts to enable maximum unregulated gun sales, including assault weapons, is the core issue at hand - stop trying to gaslight with your GOP talking point BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonWDC He did just send out one tweet about lowering the WH flag, so, I guess that'll have to do for the grieving/outraged nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGlassman312 @gtconway3d It's that "machine-gun bacon" thing, and all the million$ he has accepted taking from the NRA that is throwing me off.

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Thank you! The 'Lucrezia Borgia' in you is finally emerging into the full sunlight.  Make it swift and simple -- everyone knows that he's just a few cheese-burgers shy of eternity anyway!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ Unfortunately it IS out there, and being riled like a furnace subject to the bellows of racist dotard DjTrmp.  More ominously, the GOP/NRA have enabled the US to be flooded with easily available military style weapons that white supremacists use to follow dear-leaders orders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger I sure wish the 'whole story' about the Russian/NRA intersection with the GOP would emerge.  I don't believe the MR went into that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman What is disgusting and wrong is THE GOP that has worked extremely closely with the NRA to thwart all sensible gun laws in exchange for BIG donation$ (and somehow the Russians are involved) and the result is endless death and destruction in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr How about shirking off your NRA donors for once (it's falling apart anyways) and pass the sensible gun legislation that you have been blocking??? Oh, I forgot #MoscowMitchTraitor, that would piss off Vladdad who enjoys the US violence immensely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls STFU Conway.  Spokes-shill of the racist hate-america-regime  does NOT get to set the terms for discourse.  Immediate WH Executive action on age limit/background checks &amp; banning assault rifles is demanded.  Otherwise, the bodies will just keep mounting on your score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney I hope Putin is pleased with how his American consiglieri's  are protecting the NRA &amp; racist fascist puppet-potus.  How's the new Moscow temple coming along?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Thanks, CNN, for framing the racist russian-asset inserted into the position of POTUS as 'caring and presidential'.  We don't want the truth to get out that DT's fascist bully-pulpit ranting is squarely behind the murder of hundreds of innocents by white supremacists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @GovAbbott Sounds like a good plan, if every memorial is televised so that  the victim's grieving loved ones are able to make direct appeals to Abbott and the NRA to cease supporting the sale of assault rifles that have lead to the massacre of thousands of innocent victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondandSilk @BetoORourke STFU beeyotches, Trmp is directly connected to the dirty politics of racism and fascism and y'all are just opportuni$tic enablers of the most corrupt and indecent POTUS in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein But the good news is that with the dedicated efforts of AG Barr and the Federalist Society, y'all have successfully protected the GOP and its racist leader, the Russian-asset DjTrmp, from real accountability.

<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA @29Sinclair Incidentally, Trump also HAS a serious mental health problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO It would be an excellent idea for US to discuss Trump's mental health.  He needs a thorough psychiatric evaluation to determine whether his racism is just a political strategy, or he is actually a demented psychotic imbecile. Thanks for the proposal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Walmart But most importantly, you continue to profit from selling weapons to crazy folk all over the US, while not paying your employees enough money to afford HC.  What a great American company you are NOT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Trmp and his band of corrupt GOP-sycophants deliberately stoked and developed this incident, along with multiple others occurring in connection with your white-nationalist movement. Y'all imagined it and gave one of your trained disciples a weapon to kill with.  YOU, Matryoshka!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein There is a criminal POTUS sitting in the WH that engendered this attack. Extremely corrupt AG Barr facilitated DT's hold on power with your joint press bluffing and suppression of the actual Mueller findings.  In many ways, this blood is on your hands that stood idly by Barr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Well it really is all about him - just NOT in the gracious way he thinks his benevolence offers.  His hate-filled maga-rally racist words ARE directly responsible, along with GOP/NRA symbiotic relationship of death and money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @EPPOLICE @ElPasoTXGov @mayor_margo You standby and collect mega-bucks from NRA donation$$$.  Your failure to allow the passage of any meaningful gun safety legislation required by 2A - for a "well regulated militia" has led directly to millions of DEATHs - today, 20 more dead in your own backyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst Your heart is with them while your greedy brain is cashes in NRA donations to buy your vote against sensible gun regulation.  PRO-LIFE? Your direct congressional record says that is BS - you are an angel of gun-death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes I'm sure if YOU were DT's DNI, you would stomp out all of this climate change silliness - block reports of Greenland ice melting, etc.  More importantly you would suppress any intelligence that Russia, Saudi, or other foreign influencers have gotten to Trump and the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney The EXACT part that is preached to by one dubiously elected president, DjTrmp, weekly, at his fascist&amp;racist hate rallies. That hate, combined with GOP/NRA/RU? conspiracy to flood the country with military-style weapons puts the BLOOD squarely on all y'all's hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr IF ONLY there was something you could have done besides collect millions in NRA donations and pray. You might want to check your in-box for some legislation that could be passed to save American lives?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VP America is deeply saddened by the complete fecklessness of the Trmp-admin and GOP in preventing gun violence and sensible regulations. The GOP/NRA/Ru monster again reveals its blood lust.  Do your damn constitutional duty to "regulate" the militia and allow Americans to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkr_on_the_web @DrGJackBrown Dictionary-com def: the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted: The lone-wolf attack was apparently influenced by the rhetoric of stochastic terrorism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @EPPOLICE @ElPasoTXGov @mayor_margo You "stand" with them, and "stand ready". What is that suppose to mean? Your "stance" on open carry and sensible gun legislation is why El Paso is down and dozens are dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go Exactly.  Especially with comrades like Carl Ichan and Goldman Sachs players in "his close circle of advisors" that are expert in derivatives etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @RepRatcliffe There was nothing slanderous about reporting the facts -TRUTHFUL facts - NOT the GOP alternative-facts wherein DjT gets to install an unqualified loyalist so that he can intentionally DISTORT IC findings to protect Trmp, Jarvanka, and Putin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbMcQuade  https://t.co/9sR70GmBzZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbMcQuade Guess i've become a conspiracy-theorist, but I find it hard to believe that DT is not up to something nefarious that would prohibit such a good and smart nomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr You might hope so #MoscowMitchMcTraitor, but DjT will just do an executive-order and steal the money to build his TRUMP-VANITY-WALL since he can't get Mexico to pay for it like he promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney @BernieSanders Rational people understand that your daddy is personally responsible for lying/guiding the US into the disastrous Iraq war - resulting in ME disruption and up to a million deaths. Speaking of daddies &amp; soviets, your dear-leader DjT is REALLY in lust with Vladdad Putin -go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnKennedy You and have straddled the US with trillion dollar deficits ad infinitum with your GOP-tax-scam that benefitted only multinational corps and billionaires.  You DO NOT EVER get to talk about the trillions in debt until you reverse this travesty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchring51 amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @rengels11 How about giving us the REAL inside scoop about DT &amp; AG Barr's plans to basically put a giant muzzle on the IC to prevent any further investigations into all Russian, Saudi, or other foreign influences on Trmp &amp; GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler Remember the 2015 Republican debates and what a circus of craziness that was? (I'm sure you are extremely familiar).  It's early in the process;  candidates have to different themselves on policy -- at least they were not ad hominem attacks like the GOP race.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianstelter @RepRatcliffe If only 'reporters' and numerous major media organizations had spent a few days 'vetting' DjTrmp before 11/16, instead of celebrating his anomaly-filled candidacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesAGagliano Somehow Barr's blatant early mischaracterization of the Mueller Rpt, public-perception-bending claim of 'total exoneration' months before he would release the redacted report, then the failure to hold a decent pressconference about it --he's a loyalist stooge to Fed-society/GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rep_Hunter Can't wait to vote your felonous arse out of office, if you aren't in prison by then.  BTW, aside from your stealing money from vets directly, your vote for the fake-wall-emergency is also allowing DjT to steal billions that was meant to be spent on military families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JABat49 @Genie2 @realDonaldTrump In 2018, Mormons got permission to build a NEW TEMPLE in Moscow.  Seems like Romney has been quite gentle in his criticism of DjT / Putin since then...(mustn't piss-off Vladdad!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @kwelkernbc Guess she got the news that Trmp will have Ivanka replace @VP Pence on the '20 ticket?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MomsThoughts Don't worry, I'm sure if Anderson Cooper eventually asks her about 10 times whether she wants this endorsement, she will somewhat disclaim it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood @GlennKesslerWP @eisingerj @kevinwack It's been clear since his political appointments of Goldman Sach's (and the WS) folk that DjT is TOTALLY in the swamp w/them.  I'm sure any thorough investigation of DT's and other trading trans. would show they often profit by adjusting positions before his market moving tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows "THE TRUTH is OUT THERE": Putin-sponsored  POTUS, working closely with AG Barr and GOP sycophants, malign public servants who were concerned with the invasion of US sovereign interests by Russian GRU. Extent of financial involvement and/or kompomat involved remains a mystery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 'Charitable contribution$' (of others people's money) to certain DA's (e.g., Vance) and political campaigns, and the constant threat of retaliatory lawsuits.  SDNY can STILL be suppressed by AG Barr, but NY state AG/courts cannot - so only real hope is there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Sure, if the TOTALLY USELESS sanctions that were established can really be called sanctions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Were they mad that RU is not getting the respect that DjT thinks it should be entitled to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby I won't show the link because I like to #IgnoreTrumpTweets but I saw he just tweeted some nasty remark applauding a robbery of Cumming's Baltimore home. Disgusting as ever, always searching for a new low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naveedafridi @JuliaDavisNews Something like that - but Putin knows DT is a useful stooge and feeds him a 'history' that supports his (Vladdad's) expansionist ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaHol Just another no-trumper effort to persuade Dems to nominate a candidate that will lose so that they can keep reaping the '401k benefits' of the GOP remaining in control -- but with a feeling moral rectitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaDavisNews Obviously ignorant, but I was wondering if this is some sort pro-Russian-expansion-propaganda angle to laud Putin's 'reclamation' of former USSR territory because it was once (in his mind) part of the great nation-state of Russia. (?)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Hmmm...  who used to have a 9pm show on Trmp-TV that would usually spend at least half his time, every night for 8 years taking cheap shots and prevaricating about President Obama?  I think he was fired by Fox for being a serial sexual-predator/misogynist (as will Trmp in '20).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianstelter Loss of viewership of @CNN debates might be because of the incredibly bad format and moderator questions.  I had to turn off after first 30 minutes as it was entirely demoralizing and vapid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rxjef77 I'll check into the fray in about 5 months... Right now the Dem debates and all the related pundit analysis is a lot of unpleasant rubbish, embellished with the foul odor of contrary social media memes and schemes. (while hoping a couple of my fav's will survive!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRCC Don't worry Republicans. if it looks at all close, Vlad-the-poisoner Putin will install Trmp (again). Also, he will have his oligarchs send $100s of millions in dark-money pac contributions, so no need to fundraise -- your money just goes to Jr.'s and Jarvanka's legal bills!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren As with EVERY allegation out of the mouth of BLOTUS DjT, clearly a projection of your own sleazy guilt about getting your disgusting gig at Trmp-TV.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio ONE PARTY, the GOP, headed by Russian asset DjT, is doing everything it can to aid &amp; abet the GRU plans.

US congress will never allow it. Keep the hell out of US cyber-space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul What are you - a frigging GOP coffee-boy? GOP-TAX-scam was total giveaway to billionaire donors and multi-national corporations that YOU VOTED into LAW w/o objecting that it must be paid for.  Don't come crying to voters now about the TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICITS YOU CREATED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Time for a new hashtag; #ComradeCornyn is lying while he is aiding and abetting #MoscowMitchTraitor  to allow Russian, Chineses and Saudi tampering of US elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum You're presuming that it was EVER intended to be anything more than a trillion dollar giveaway to top billionaire donors and multi-national corporations.  GOP w/financial industry lobbyists knew and designed it to work just that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters i.e., "Fed cuts rate by 25 baisi-points to AVOID an un-ending twitter RANT by POTUS who needs an inflated US stock market going into '20 election."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Your entire debate format was HORRIBLE. Moderators constantly trying to set up progressive v. 'moderate' candidate roughs with little sound-bytey questions that don't offer any real info for the viewer, especially since your response time-limit was too short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimMurtaugh Must have been one of those Trmp-hotels or Kushner properties -- I hear they are completely rat-infested and have multiple health dept. citations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader The correct dichotomy is plutocracy vs. democracy. The GOPlutocracy wants to be sure to keep most ALL of the money, and definitely ALL of the power in the US.  The future of our country is most definitely in peril.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning @edokeefe The 'take' that corporate-media definitely want you to settle-on.  "If you don't nominate a centrist who will promise NOT to raise our taxes, we will divide the Dems 6 ways to Sunday!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Thus thou are surely due for 6 MAJOR pleas for redemption - you have 7 deadly sins to account for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes We see very clearly your "cultivating sources" by bending over backwards to show every possible deference to presidunce DjT, boosting his erratic tweet-storms, withholding harmful WH stories or putting out false narratives like "Trmp not under investigation", fall '16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Awwwe - do you miss being in the cross-hairs of US Justice system? Don't worry - congress will get back to you with subpoenas shortly.  I'm sure that NY attorneys will also be in contact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Try it for awhile - see if the MAGA-racist high you get from Trmp is actually an extremely toxic influence in your life. At a minimum, I'm sure that it will improve your chances of eventually entering the gates of heaven by 10,000%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis At whichpoint, Doocy, Kilmeade, and Earhardt turned to the camera and apologized firmly "sorry, for our full participation in WS - our Bad!" No? That part didn't happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Obviously, the ONLY child you would EVER try to rescue from peril is your own extremely idiotic SELF, because you are in fact one of the most spoiled, self-righteous ignoramuses in the world; but thanks for the great parenting advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Infantry0300 @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Rudy will be extremely fortunate if his epitaph does NOT read "Committed Treason for Trump".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Lobbying to replace Pence in 2020, or just trying to save a little grace with never-Trmpers while you still smooch mango-mussolini's derriere, your take is plenty of nothing.  With that,, you WOULD be a great candidate for Trmp-VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Highly ironic that you are touting the Republican goal of spending $100s of BILLIONS on 'national defense' while you are simultaneously ceding the US to Russian and other foreign influences.  Seems like exactly what Kremlin wants #MoscowMitchMcTreason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera It's all part of the Trmp-2020-race-war election campaign being primarily promoted and cheered-on by Fox-noise. You, especially, don't like it, because, when it comes 'down to it', YOU are one of the 'undesirables', no matter how much orange-spray-tan you have on your nose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta At this time, literally every statement that comes from DjT's mouth or Twitler-digits must be expected to mean the exact opposite of whatever it is; i.e., Trmp lives in opposite-land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins So that means you will be casting a "Nay" towards confirmation of Russian-Interference-running DNI nominee Ratcliffe! Also, please demand #MoscowMitchMcTreason bring a vote on election protection measures that have been brought forth from the house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis can you imagine, if Buttigieg started really gaining significant nomination-traction, where F&amp;F would go with the whole 'gay' aspect of his background?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenvilleNews Right - aside from totally humanizing and excusing the killer and his family, you also pointed out that 'Mike', the gun-seller, is a nice guy.  Thanks for this total white-wash of a story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Or, to frame a bit more clearly: In a defensive rhetoric filled speech #MoscowMitchMcTreason failed to explain his resistance to protecting US elections from Russian/other foreign invasion, and does not explain the substantial campaign contributions from Deripaska and VM vendors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costareports @MittRomney The Mormons obtained approval to build a new temple in Moscow in 2018.  Other than initial announcement, there is little public info; but MR has been very 'respectful' of DJT and limits his RU criticism ever since.  Can't p-o Putin!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr There is something about siding with the Kremlin, Deripaska, and Russian-asset DjT that tilts the scale towards your being #MoscowMitch, and not at all interested in democracy, unless you let the Senate vote on election security, traitor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greta Give a partisan hack whom has shown 100% devotion to Trmp/Putin-aganda, and been happy to denigrate the IC; give  him a chance with one of the most sensitive assignments in the US.  Look how well that worked with W.Barr, worst AG in history--and he was technically qualified!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows Your personal endorsement makes it 100% clear that Ratcliffe is being chosen for DNI to run more Russian interference against the IC. A ginormous loss for democracy. BTW, thanks for coming to the support of E. Cummings, as it is clear #TrumpIsARacistRapist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein Now, thanks to the extremely dishonorable efforts of you and AG Barr to mute/obfuscate Mueller findings, DjT will be installing a political protector for himself and foreign adversaries (e.g., Russia!) in his nomination of Ratcliffe to DNI.

<|startoftext|>@julianzelizer @realDonaldTrump DT will happily invoke a total race-war; certainly he will fan the flames enough to at least create a few race-riots, and then frame the narrative (w/substantial help from Fox) as a white v. all other races for 2020 MAGA theme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollieWolfen Yikes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins If you actually have ONE ounce of patriotism left, you will deny confirmation of Ratcliffe to DNI position. He is clearly unqualified, and in fact will cherry-pick intelligence to accommodate the whims of Russian asset DjT while forsaking  US security interests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr As far as we know, your family hasn't paid a dime in US taxes &amp; in fact cheated the US gov't out of hundreds of million$ though illegal tax-avoidance schemes. Along with all the millions y'all are pilfering for hunting/golf vacation security - you need to be stripped of all HC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Seems to be a pretty wide-spread consensus that the Russians and other foreign 'bad actors' are gonna impact '20 election. I can NOT agree that it is best for congress to avoid impeachment, and hope for a solid DT election defeat, especially with the appointment of DNI Ratcliffe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @GeorgePapa19 @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness No surprise that you are a perennially sycophantic Trmp cheer-leader in your over-paid position on Fixed-business-news, but your willingness to assist in fabricating FBI-conspiracy theories is gonna be career-defining!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollieWolfen Vlad-the-poisoner is no doubt at it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepRatcliffe Clearly you will be a DNI (if confirmed???) who will deny Russia interferes in US elections and will shield DjT from any information that offends him about his Vladdad.  Question is, will you help defend this country, or continue to support Trmp's effort to destroy US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LincolnsBible Pretty sure that most (especially Todd's MTP) will be 70% devoted to the "Dems in disarray, worried about moving towards impeachment" theme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 Trmp goes WAY beyond the 'dog-whistles' of occasionally chiding US urban areas, as some R-Potus's have done since the late 20th century.  He is quite open about detesting 60% of US population who are not entirely devoted to his malignant-narcissistic authoritarianism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Are you sure you checked with cheeto-benito before writing this? Pretty sure Vladdad is no friend to LGBT folk. Also, better get some guidance from loadstar Pence on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenStabenow @Gotherrific It is really depressing what has become of GOP leadership.  NOTHING is ever legislated to help regular citizens or to benefit democracy. #MoscowMich ONLY brings items to the Senate floor to protect multi-national corporations, billionaires, or Russian oligarchs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, the Dems are finally absorbing the multiple instances of high crimes and misdemeanors that are shown in the report, and realizing you are definite a corrupted and criminal blotus, who must be subjected to an #ImpeachmentInquiryNow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mueller had plenty of facts about how you LIED and gave incomplete answers on your questions.  You were TOO CHICKEN to testify, as you can't stop LYING.  Mueller said you are not patriotic nor an honorable man, as all non-magats already knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tucker08087 @guardiannews This is why AG Barr un-recused himself.  He will definitely stop all efforts to examine anything Trmp or other high level Republican related.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@page88 @soledadobrien @marcorubio The LDS was given permission to build a NEW MORMON TEMPLE in Moscow in 2018.  I can find little public info about this, but Romney has been "pretty polite" towards DjT and RU ever since. Co-inkee-dink?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien @marcorubio You will notice MR has been very quiet about Russia, and pretty timid about criticizing Trmp since 2018 when the NEW MORMOM TEMPLE was approved for Moscow.  He doesn't want to p-o DjT, or especially Vlad-the-poisoner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul You need to go back to elementary school. In the US, we are encouraged to be good citizens. We are strongly discouraged from offering aid and comfort to an enemy combatant (what RUSSIA did in '16 elec. attack). In fact that is called being a "TRAITOR" which is what you &amp; DjT are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @GovLarryHogan @MarkSanford @WalshFreedom Sure - but that would directly conflict with the Trmp-GOP strategy of having the 2020 election be a ginormous race-war.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FedSoc @JoelNolette Y'all must be so proud that you managed to get AG Barr confirmed in time to propagandize the public perception of the Mueller Report, and carefully protect the criminal POTUS in order to save the GOPlutocracy as it exists today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chucktodd Since the Bush-Cheney years, the MIC has been fed the 100's of billion$ it requires for ME wars/weapons; the need for a Russian straw-man enemy has diminished.

<|startoftext|>@RWPUSA @USATODAY The thing is, you KNOW that AG Barr will step in to protect DT or any high-ranking GOP names that JE identifies, and prevent ANY public disclosure of such (not so much for any Dem's involved).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 I would love to see ONE NYT or WaPo story posted with a headline to the effect of "Republicans remain fully committed to protecting DjT from numerous instances of criminal and otherwise impeachable offenses".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Somehow, this tweet does not seem to absolve you for the divisive racist doctored video you tweeted out yesterday - in fact it pretty much admits YOU are an ABOMINATION to the lord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBI I wish we could have confidence that AG Barr and the WH will not thwart all REAL efforts to stop Russian or other foreign disruption of our election. WH has made it clear that they will suppress all meaningful public disclosure of threats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CharlesPPierce Part of the 2020 Trmp law&amp;order campaign.  Then, if (GF) re-elected, new laws / executive order will call for 'death penalty' for any instance of 'presidential harassment'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Don't worry - AG Barr is going to protect tRUmp and any GOP "associates" of Mr Epstein from any meaningful scrutiny.  Are you included?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martina 1. Since the Bush/Cheney yrs, the military-industrial-cmplx  has been able to get the $100 of billions it must be fed from middle-east wars, so RU not needed as foe. 2. Also in 21st century Putin has reformed RU into an autocratic plutocracy which aligns perfectly w/ new GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Nice that you put out a tweet describing actual news-worthy testimony from the hearing. Was EXTREMELY disappointed in the 7/24 ABCnews feature run on  local news affiliates on that basically just described Trmp claiming he was exonerated and it was all an expensive waist of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace @glwoods3377 If you have @peterbakernyt on your DWH show today, give him the 3rd degree over his smug take on the hearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @brianstelter Perhaps CNN should put on one of its multiple daily "both sides panels" where paid sycophantic Trmp apologists like Rick Santurom can explain it all away as Trmp derangement syndrome, or @KellyannePolls can present the "alternative facts" of the sitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Team_Mitch Isn't Deripaska funding your campaigns? Or is that just money you take on the side for relieving RU-Crimea invasion sanctions on him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Different investigations -- I understand you have ORDERED your corrupt political-protector AG Barr to do these investigations (which is illegal, of course - another IMPEACHABLE offense!).  Now, what about investigating child trafficking associates of Jeffrey Epstein???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilippeReines Exactly. I doubt that a majority of Americans watch cable news at all (even Fox) and only get a few DC-based headlines, just before 6pm LOCAL weather report.  Any news-headline about "RM testifies to instances of obstruction" will be the first impeachable crime  they hear about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Oh, I got one.  "Mr. Mueller, would you say D.Trmp is the greatest POTUS in history, or merely one of the top 3?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Dodge, deflect, LIE, divert, LIE, start a race-war, LIE, LIE, dodgy-donald, LIE, rape, LIE, divert, start a land-war to deflect .... somehow, someday, YOUR CRIMES will catch up with you.  Today??? #MuellerIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateDems @senatemajldr Has the Senate Ethics committee examined the relationship between Deripaska and McConnell?  Seems like some BIG $$$/ruble exchanges may have something to do with it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh my - you are going to have to work out a whole new plan of attack by your GOP-house-rats, Jordon, Gaetz, Gomert, etc.  YOU SURE SEEM SCARED of the TRUTH !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Which old phony witch? The witch who colluded with multiple Russians to allow his coven to be installed in the WH?  The witch who wants so bad to mate with Putin, he is willing to make love to KJ Un?  The "hunt" part is over, it's time to burn that which at the stake!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul This must be why you voted valiantly against the GOP-Trmp-Tax-scam that drained trillions from the Treasury to deliver it to multi-national corp.s and billionaires - NOT.  NO??? !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli Tell her he is the same guy who played Anna Faris' neighbor in "What's your Number"; he was totally adorbs in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffMerkley Your tweet to God's timeline (and Mueller's ears?) !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @Rick_Gorka Oh Rona, "the WITCH", the Caligula-inspired-sorceror was found years ago; it's just that GOP operatives, AG Barr, the Trmp-regime-coven and the DoJ have successfully contrived to keep it ALL HIDDEN from the public, and DjT protected from his duly earned burning at the stake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyMurray Has the Senate Ethics Committee looked into the extensive links between Oleg Deripaska and @senatemajldr McConnell?  Seems to be more than a casual relationship (involving million$).  There are serious election-power-grabbing "reasons" why GOP doesn't want to prevent this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spiritdance33 It's got to be Wednesday somewhere in the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristinegWP @USATODAY So basically the GOP-JD-cabal to protect DjT from investigation results, and the US public completely IN THE DARK about his numerous alleged major crimes and misdemeanors is working perfectly! Herisho! Herisho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @BorisJohnson Hooray!! Now there are super racist clowns bringing down the free world on BOTH SIDES of the pond!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, you have made  ALL of the GOPlutocracy's dreams come true, albeit, by bankrupting the US Treasury by trillions to do it.  The rich are sooo happy - how could anyone of the rest of the 99% of the Americans you are stealing HC from possibly complain? #ImpeachNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw To wit: a candidate commits a crime that enables him to be elected POTUS.  When discovered, DOJ OLC opinion says "can not indict'; If same political party is in power, no congressional investigation or impeachment. Criminal &amp; complicit congress hold power 8 yrs. Perfect formula!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmilyRafi2020 I'm mostly an Irish/English mutt, but my 1/24th part that is Nez Perce declares, more than all else, that DjT can go to bloody hell with his white-nationalism, and get the hell out of the presidency!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nedprice Not to mention the fact that he LIES so regularly and predictably, NO ONE (not even red-hats) can really believe a thing he says - so what is the point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics_PR He won't be accommodating or creative in his testimony. The real question is, will he be HONEST when questioned about the interference of AG Barr in the investigation &amp; subsequent public pronouncements of findings. Will he testify truthfully about 'memos' he wrote to Barr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Glad to see @Disney is going to just go ahead and line up behind the racist and treasonous Trmp-regime in gas-lighting the American public. This woman spits out GOP propaganda like a bulimic barracuda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington Where the hell did DT ever get the idea to nominate Ross, other than he's another loose-end figure in the swamp of Russian oligarch friendlys who participated in facilitating the '16 election hacks?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepLizCheney So the family getting their assault weapons to shoot the innocent visitors?  Gaslight all you want on Sunday news shows, you represent the worst of the worst of the US.  You spread disinformation of the same quality/quantity as any manure spreader, but smells worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So are you releasing your bulldog AG Barr to mute him, just as you have done for 4 months?  Never has a POTUS been so afraid of TRUTH and JUSTICE!. Few people are truly aware of how DEVASTATINGLY GUILTY you are of multiple high crimes and misdemeanors, my Putin loving traitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Just hope he gets a couple of head-line generating moments where he quotes from the report that highlight the OBSTRUCTION (at least) w/o being totally overwhelmed by GOP congressmen gas-lighting the sitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Would like to believe this, but since YOU verifiably LIE MULTIPLE TIMES every DAY, and are personally responsible for the biggest PROPAGANDA campaign in US history, NO ONE can believe a word you say -- not even your maggots. #MuellerIsComing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Opinion-peice comes to a truthful conclusion, but based on complete BS. The reason DjT has no fear IS AG Barr, whom has completely obscured the MR findings and misrepresented them for 4 months. He continues to block the truth, and will mute the hearings however he can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump LIES, lies.  The fact that you make these claims on Trmp-state-TV, with the notorious @JudgeJeanine (one of worst propaganda spewing DjT-sycophants) tells us everything we need to know about your complete disingenuousness. Come to Jesus and STOP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Better keep this sweet pup away from your toxic dad!  Dogs can sense when people are inherently evil; that's why a certain carrot-colored-caligula does not like them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood Also, 'normal politics' aside (as if ANYthing is normal w/Trmp involved): Can't help believing that in next year, at LEAST ONE of the many major crimes / indiscretions that DT is in the middle of, will finally extinguish his credibility as a viable candidate..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Republicans are dead set on transferring maximum wealth to their DONOR class and multi-national corporations, EXPLODING the DEFICIT (!) by trillions, and then trying to steal social security and medicare benefits form the rest of US to offset their plunder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @SenBillCassidy So YOU are definitely gonna go with a PRO-facist agenda. Good to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife So glad to see that sweet 'Valene' forgave the evil 'Abby" for stealing her twins; one of my fav' 80's shows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Remember that great GOP Tax "reform" law you passed w/Ryan's help in '17? The promise that it would raise the wages of ALL workers as it helped the economy? Well the RICH DEFINITELY got RICHER, but now you are blocking legislation that helps those below. SHAMELESS POS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kris_Sacrebleu I expect DjT lets his close cronies know when he is about to make a market-moving tweet (e.g., re: tarriffs or specific publicly traded co's) so they can adjust stock positions accordingly, then (ka-ching!) make some fast bucks, but eventually the 401K-Repub's support will drop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @smithsonian @amhistorymuseum "SEND HER BACK - SEND HER BACK ...(9 times) " is another bit of history recorded at Trump rally on 7/17/19, when fascism became part of the official agenda of the POTUS.  As a 1st generation immigrant who attained citizenship yourself, any thoughts or public statements?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janet_yackle Sure; life-time government worker, @senatemajldr McConnell and his wife @SecElaineChao have lined their pockets with plenty-enough plunder around their positions to have personal retirement security and medical care for decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin How is the development of the NEW Mormon temple in Moscow going? Since it's approval in '18, I can't find out much public info, but @SenatorRomney seems to have grown quite cautious about criticizing Trmp or Putin in last couple of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WordswithSteph @SaraGideonME The GOP coming out of the closet with Trmp as the new white-supremacist-party isn't helping her chances?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien @nytimes Trump and his fascist regime do not CARE about 'people everywhere'; they only worry about losing GOP protection against retribution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Really, really BAD take on the sitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MmeScience @JoyceWhiteVance I know the standard answer is something like - "well, the congress has the power of oversight &amp; to impeach if needed...". But what IF (heaven forbid) Dem's had not won back the house in '18, the country would be uncontrollably subject to a criminal POTUS for up to 8 years!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawleyMO Great switcheroo, using the term 'cosmopolitan' with the well-known racist branding for 'urban'.  You truly represent the worst of the worst in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MmeScience @JoyceWhiteVance PLEASE! As I have heard others say, when a POTUS has performed a major crime to WIN the presidency, how can he not then be indicted for that very crime, and be allowed to hold the illegitimately acquired office?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis Proving to all that F-news is in NO-way Trump-State-TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnyDeutsch On @Morning_Joe this a.m. I hear you questioning, specifically, why @MittRomney is so reluctant to be upfront about DjT racism.  Is it possible the NEW Mormon temple project (approved for Moscow in 2018) has "tempered" his criticism of Trmp (&amp; Russia!) for fear of riling Putin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullFrontalSamB Great show last night - especial 'the Shrill Show' segment!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney There's a good first step.  tRUmp is lying about not basking in the warm-glow of the racist chant only because he found out it is a blatant EDD violation for any business.  Now if only YOU were patriotic enough to disavow carrot-colored-caligula!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Oh you play it like a fiddle Rubio.  Hint: Read the Mueller Report and then just stop defending the corrupt, illegitimate Trmp-regime with your vapid 'Dem's do it wrong routine'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP_Politics Thanks for the heads-up, AP, but this is total BS!  Anyone could see DjT was basking like a crocodile on a sunny rock as the crowd chanted, and he allowed them to go on for quite awhile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@415holgate Don't worry; Deripaska has very deep pockets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 The thing is, Barr seems to have successfully shuttered the investigation into TrmpOrg/campaign finance violations, &amp; several other Mueller spawned investigations-so will we ever even know? It appears that Barr is extremely corrupt, and there is NO oversight/restraint mechanism .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rupertmurdoch He will certainly never stop as long as your Trmp-State-TV channel (Fox-noise) keeps supporting his racist efforts with propaganda and blatant lies that support the deranged WH occupant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Hate to have all those sheep-GOP go on record for NOT impeaching? Isn't there at least a small possibility that the acres of evidence of Trmp's massive corruption, high crimes and misdemeanors will lead to eventual humiliation and resignation, when made public during  I-hearings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul OK then. You, McConnell and DjT are now the official champions of "climate change!"  Have a great, sizzling summer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkWalker It's ok.  The entire GOP now wears the badge "RACIST" with great pride, and in fact the truth is finally out.  It's your party now. Deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaynordlinger Okie-dokillie!. It has become very obvious that the entire Republican party now wear the term "racist" as a badge of honor and a value to aspire to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Exactly! I'm supposed to report for jury-duty next month, but I don't see why I should need to observe any threats from a judge if I refuse -- but, of course, as just a 'little guy', I'm sure my arse will be landed in jail in short-order.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedlieu Stop trying to put this on voters who will be stepping up en masse in 15 months to an almost surely-RIGGED ballot system.

<|startoftext|>@marcorubio You must desperately search your bible everyday, repeatedly, to try to find solace in the fact that you continue to support and defend the most ungodly, vile, racist and corrupt POTUS in US history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump As you know, it is the GOP in congress who BLOCK ALL legislation the Dem's pass - unless it is something that helps the wealthiest of Americans (or Russians).

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Smarter than this?  Rivera continues to be a total sycophant to DjT who is the most racist corrupt piece-of-shite BLOTUS in history.

<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney Thank-goodness Putin is no longer a member of the Communist Party in Russia, since the GOP is TOTALLY COMMITTED to helping Vlad-the-poisoner destroy US democracy.  GOP is all about kleptocracy, plutocracy and autocracy - YAY!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JCrongeyer You can bet the bank that if a Dem is elected prez in '20, it will become priority#1 of the GOP, echoed by the msm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL Ok; but it seems like the term "communist" is thrown around as a term of degradation, like "pinko" in the 50/60's by people like J.McCarthy and L.Graham today -- so far removed from actual meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL Not too sure about this take. By the time Vlad-the-poisoner took power in 2000, "communism" as a true party ideology was dead; oligarchs, headed by Putin, took advantage of the failed-state to virtually steal all national resources. In power, he's been an authoritarian plutocrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump GEE, sure changed his story from his entire election campaign up through and including his inauguration speech where he proclaimed the US was a terrible dystopian hell-hole.

<|startoftext|>@Comey If we could expect a truly fair election, I'd agree. However, the GOP is determined to allow continued Russian (&amp; other fgn) sabotage (like you did in '16), and the JD, headed by corrupt AG Barr, is suppressing all legitimate testimony'investigation into the current WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CortesSteve @WajahatAli I refuse to watch @CNN because of the absurd "both side panels" during which idiotic Trmp-apologists like you sit there and come up with BS and/or obfuscate the VERY RACIST shenanigans of the DjT-regime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Wussy Republicans, afraid of being 'primaried', refuse to actually read the Mueller Rpt which outlines multiple impeachable offenses by Trmp.  LG was once a strong foe of Russia, but I guess he is now owned by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume Apologies for calling Trmp a racist.  He is a xenophobic white-supremicist who despises people of color and has repeatedly shown malignant discrimination in his actions as both a private fake-billionaire and as BLOTUS.  Check the Trmp-TV archives; you'll find plenty of evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski Why don't you just be 100% honest, and become the first US GOP Senator to call for an impeachment inquiry?  DjT has proven himself to be totally corrupt, devisive and (if you actually read the Mueller Rpt) guilty of multiple high crimes and misdemeanors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinDr .@MittRomney has become quite the Trmpanzee sycophant, especially since 2018 when the Mormons got approval to build a new temple in Moscow.  He certainly can't upset DjT or Vlad-dad at this juncture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump ALWAYS with the DIVIDE and conquer.  Yor are SOOOO transparent.  I pray for the day the US no longer has a divider-in-chief as head of state. You're dedication to Putin 's plan to destroy our country is CLEAR. #TrumpIsARacist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiproytx WOW o WOW! Republican who dared to (lightly) criticize Prez. Caligula's blatantly racist tweet!  Too bad DjT will have to have his magats 'primary' you to hell, but thanks for trying to be a real congressman and patriot. #TrumpIsARacist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Nice way of stating PR's ONE major accomplishment: GINORMOUS TAX CUT for billionaires. The fact that this bankrupted the Treasury seems to have escaped you.

<|startoftext|>@CNNPR @realDonaldTrump @CNN You'd think all those super dynamic panels you have with PAID Trmp-surrogates arguing how all the racist, misogynistic, and traitorous actions of Trmp are just "fine" would ratchet up the horse-race ratings-factor.

<|startoftext|>@KDFildesMBA I expect the Trmpenfuror liked his cover story, ok, but was NOT at all IMPRESSED by his level of emotional rage/fury when delivering it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake Thought that sounded a little close-to-home; the fact that Barr even brought this up implies to me that some powerful WH/JD lawyers/advisors told him that this was WAY TO CLOSE to engendering a constitutional crisis/gov't meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HawleyMO @realDonaldTrump This is a total crock of shite!.  Big Tech bends over backwards to enhance politics for conservatives.  The fact that they sometimes close down or limit sites that are deliberately promoting false-hoods, racist memes or violence is hardly a bias, and you know it.  DISINFO-101<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL Assuming the Dem's win Senate in '20? @senatemajldr McConnell is never going to allow any legislation that offers the benefits of the ACA to ever come up for a vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mog7546 I suppose there is a 50-50 chance he would not fly-away under home arrest (until very close to trial, at least), but the idea of his knocking about his mansion(s) for months (or years!) while his lawyers delay and appeal the inevitable is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump *correction - the day you were shoe-horned into the position of POTUS by SA and the Russians.  You were never really elected, and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You ARE personally RESPONSIBLE for the incarceration and TORTURE of thousands of legitimate asylum seekers - and NOW YOU are TROLLING the LIBs about it on twitter? Un-fuckijng-beleivable, Herr Trumpenfuror, even for you. #TrumpConcentrationCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anitanash53 My best guess is that there is a cabal of plutocrats/top GOP-donors who are working with the 'Federalist Society' (source of many GOP judicial picks, McGahn, Rosenstein, Barr) to ensure that Trmp and the GOP are protected; elections enhanced as needed to maintain control of US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Thanks @VP for reassuring the US that the Trmp-regime is totally behind giving child-rapists and those who enable them a green light and minimal consequence.  I'm sure it is a "personal" issue w/DT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I could definitely envision almost ANYONE being POTUS other than the HIDEOUS BLOTUS that inhabits the WH these days.  You ever notice how DJT's beady-eyes are growing wider apart? Utterly grotesque.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You forsook the USA for Russia many years ago, and continue to destroy western civilization as directed by Putin.  You are ignorant of the US Constitution. Total Fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackKingston Being repelled and dismissive of fake-potus DjT is totally PRO-American and anti-authoritarian despot.  Why do you continue to try to support the most CORRUPT WH in US history with your awe-shucks sycophancy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Isn't that sweet; prez. DT's ball washer making the princess- royal' seem to be relevant in politics after spending millions in taxpayer funds for personal business trips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Trumple-thinskin raw-dogged the Amb. just as he does to any woman of any age he can get away with. Sycophants like you are enabling the world's most CORRUPT and perverted infantile-tyrant to maintain control of the nuclear codes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakehounshell @IanKullgren Sounds like he is confident his own kompromat will keep him secure w/Trmp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan GOP has nearly totally successfully kept ALL the TRUTH about DjT high crimes and misdemeanors from the public. Unfortunately for y'all, the TRUTH is OUT THERE! Have fun trying to shame an American war hero and true patriot for your Trumpenfuror.  Wear your onesie for effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT Trump will "tweet" that they will create a terrific, fantastic HC plan RIGHT AFTER '20 election, and Repubs will all say, "Yeh, whatever DT sys". Then in '21 Trmp will tweet "we tried to fix HC but Dem's won't come up with new legislation, SAD".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, you and @senatemajldr McConnell have worked seamlessly together for 30 months to destroy the environment, give trillions in tax breaks to billionaires/corporations, add trillion$ to the deficit, and make America an alt-right nightmare. History will cast you both as villains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemWrite Unfortunately Russian oligarch's love him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, the POTUS uses commerce, lawyers, judges, executive orders, and anything else he can to hurt and DIVIDE Americans at every juncture, especially when it benefits his bank account. It picks winners and losers, and uses bully-pulpit to BULLY the US like a 12yo halfwit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill "The Hill" helps Gabbard spread Kremlin dis-information to demoralize democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Every frigging thing about your Trmp-regime CORRUPTION is a first. You continue to refuse to uphold the US Constitution, and dare to tweet it out for all to witness. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Good to see the loop is complete.  You, the most corrupt POTUS in history &amp; his sycophantic AG (who was placed by GOP operatives to squelch the Mueller Rept) are all working AGAINST the US Constitution. #ImpeachmentInquiryNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Prioritie$...amazing the way things change with the burdens of wealth and celebrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaRules @SpeakerPelosi Trump has to be de-ligitimized in every possible way, to the fullest extent possible within the Constitution and law.  Every day he remains in office he commits new offenses against humanity and the environment. With RU help, he may get elected again. STOP the MF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecretaryAcosta Wow! Learning from Barr how to weave a tale of incomplete facts to absolve yourself and complicit GOP? You deliberately let him OUT of Federal charges, knowing he was an active predator &amp; intimidating witnesses.  How much was this worth to you, monetarily speaking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lildevil1_X @415holgate Yes, apparently DT successfully got BARR to un-recuse, after finding out about all the NEW evidence found at Epstein's Manhattan mansion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump But MOST importantly, the GOP &amp; DjT are enabling billionaire oligarchs and multi-national corp.s to save TRILLION$$$ in taxes, while creating TRILLION dollar yearly deficits! Thanks GOP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju @evanperez So did he LIE, succinctly, to the public on 7/8, or did "something" (i.e., Trmp-fury) new come-up? Will JD make an official announcement, or keep secret, like Acosta did in FL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows The "spectacle" part of this will be where idiotic trumpanzee GOP congressmen try to bring up "investigator issues" because they know the TRUTH about the systematic COLLUSION w/Russians and multiple instances of OBSTRUCTION of Justice are going to undo Trmp &amp; y'all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls In related news, the most corrupt GOP administration in US history continues to aid and abet Russian interference in US elections to distort voting in key swing states.  Also, we are all going to die, eventually, anyway, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasie @Morning_Joe Of course; McConnell will summon all the king's horses and all the king's men to stop the challenge. More importantly, he will summon all the dark Russian super-pac money in the universe along with any and all GOPlutocracy resources to defend their realm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard So this is the Gabbard/RU-GRU playbook for 2020 being revealed? Create strife and division in the Dem ranks by pushing false accusations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @SecretaryAcosta @POTUS Investigate the hell out of Acosta.  He has dirt and DJT and won't step down/Trmp won't fire him. Trmp is kidnapping kids; God knows what DeVos is doing with them.  #ImpeachmentInquiryNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Fully agree. All who are ardently protecting sexual predators (such as DjTrmp) need to be vigorously prosecuted, especially when they help cover up the crimes as do Acosta, Barr and most of the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife @PinkNews I would take Boris Johnson over Trmp for POTUS. DEAL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter You have made it very clear, on more occasions than DjT has verifiably lied, that YOU will GO DOWN on anything pro-magat-Trmp. Bon appetite, lost one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owillis In order for @chucktodd to get the right ratio to promote his "both side do it" theme, he always has at least 3-2 Republicans (kinda like gerrymandering effect on elections).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBChirpy @matthewjdowd No doubt interventions are possible and being examined for any workable method -- but probably will have to be done in deep JD recesses; much as Trmp/Barr would love to publicly intervene or pardon, IT WON'T Poll at all well, which is more important to DT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Just keep trying to turn the focus on the investigators through this disinformation campaign. The extent of involvement by certain GOP senators in colluding with Russia to attack the US remains to be fully revealed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Coon's performance in 'legitimizing' the 1/2-assed Kavanaugh FBI investigation to appease Senate Dems/the public was pretty disturbing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The things ya see on Fox!  https://t.co/Nx8l2ZbhtW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Darroch is NOT saying anything that all sane American politicians have said (including many Republicans). He is absolutely being truthful. The only people who DO NOT say such things about DjT are those afraid of his 'bullying' them out of office. Trump is trash, and you know it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cate_mccoy So, totally impeachable by the GOP, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump Americans were appalled at seeing the wannabe 'princess royale' wondering about the G20, trying to act like she has any real purpose other than bilking governments, like her father, for personal financial gain.  A TERRIBLE representative for the US! #IvankaResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife @washingtonpost This seems fraught w/peril...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Absolutely - thank you President OBAMA (!!)  for bringing us successfully out of the worst GOP caused recession since the 30's. Hopefully Dem's will gain control of WH soon - before Benito Cheetolini brings us down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRMoffitt She should read 'Revalation'.  There are already several beasts in that book that are perfect surrogates for DjT and his devotion to the end-times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics Remember that time you asked Trmp what happened to all his "inauguration funds", or when is he going to pay DC and other cities for campaign protection expenses? No, because you just like to ask stupid horse-race questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler It seems that  90% of Trmp's daily actions are ALL about his image/campaign material since day-1. He barely has enough time to be sure all his coffers are being properly filled by "supporters".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC Yeah, to clarify, evangelicals believe in John 3:16 (personal salvation) and tend to IGNOR virtually every other teaching in the New Testament. All those pesky references to "the meek" and kindness to strangers do NOT FIT with their stronger white-supremacy philosophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephMillerShow "us"? You gonna patch-in from the nether regions? Get back here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_Agarn @realDonaldTrump Despite Trmp's constant trash-talk, @CNN has been on the Trump-train since the beginning. "Panels" with absurd, PAID-DT-surrogates like Rick Santorum are constantly asserting that all the stupid, treasonous, misogynistic, and racist things DT says each day are "fine".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Photo shopped, of course.  But it is really nice of you to have had the army set-up the fighting vehicles/Tanks for the GOP-VIP guests ONLY to enjoy! Probably cost tax-payers only a few million for that one part of the show..#TrumpParadeFail .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Incredible! Stuck to the teleprompter and stumbled though someone else's BORING history out-takes (several wrong), obviously having no clue what he was saying. The fact that he didn't ad-lib into usual RACIST and partisan diatribes there in front of special GOP-VIP's is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer Yeh, sure DT stayed on script and read of a bunch of historic words that SOMEONE ELSE wrote, and DT didn't really understand.  Also, 99% unrelated to the spirit of July-4th.  Also, completely contrary to his policy and "executive orders".  Also, BORING!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@towner_terri Damn! Just when that Nobel Peace Prize was within inches of DT's grasp...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyWinkle1 Definitely read though DjT's rich history of extremely offensive, traitorous, racist and misogynistic tweets -- you will get quite a clear perspective on why the most CORRUPT POTUS in history is so "poorly regarded" by most Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethRoseSC Thank you for this pic.  After watching the tainted Trmp DC spectacle and feeling totally depressed for our country, this pic reminds me of what the 4th is truly about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkVSerrano @BetteMidler As you well know, Mark, it's always been one of Trmp's go-to lines for degrading women (one of his many misogynistic ways) although,  since he has been pushing 300#++ himself for awhile, he doesn't go there so much anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics_PR All this info has been known for about 2 years...just now opening an investigation? We have already seen video of the meeting Trmp had with GSA about this that he denied having.  Of-course, Barr will close down any real investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @MailOnline You really are the perfect advocate for Trump, Lou.  How come DJT is more butt-buddyish with Hannity? You're sturdy white-supremacist advocacy and plutocratic economic approach is totally trumpy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I noticed the crowd of your hand picked VIP-GOP ticket holders at your "big event" were ALL yawning most of the time. Your campaign will be needing to reimburse the $90million this big-gun show has cost US taxpayers. TOTALLY MISSED the point of Independence day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewGondzur @rudepundit Also, you will need to ' * -except DJT ' on the singing part since he never learned and/or forgot the words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylieatwood I think the military should have positioned the fighting vehicle such that the guns are pointed toward the podium, to remind DT that the fire-power may need to be turned on him if he dares to politicize the mall 4th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump HEIL DJT! Never allow any dissension in the ranks. That would be w-a-a-ay to democratic and bipartisan. BTW, when Mueller testifies he will be describing the MANY instances of COLLUSION and OBSTRUCTION - just as the report says. Many, many, impeachable crimes. Happy #4thofJuly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo Yeah, uh, that democracy thing? The GOP is gonna have to move that down to Smithsonian storage-room-B on account of they're moving on to a more might-makes-right authoritarian regime motif...  Tha-anks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Did you find Trmp's Adderall stash and eat 'em like tic-tacs? Seems like you have a few wires crossed, but maybe that's just the state of the GOP these days: Geriatric Outpatient Psychopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lincoln will be eyeing you with contempt.  Everything about you is the exact opposite of Honest-Abe, Lying-Don!  If it happens to rain on your parade, we will know that Jesus is also sending you his deep-disdain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump $90,000,000 MAGA rally, paid for by US taxpayers? DjT is the most corrupt, racist and traitorous fake-POTUS in history.  Everything he touches turns to shite. The 4th will be celebrated by patriotic Americans all over this country keeping Russian asset Trmp out of their thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader As leader of the House GOPlutocracy, assisting to transform this country into a complete authoritarian fascist state headed by a demented drug-addicted despot working for Russia, your comments are taken for the shite that they are worth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This works both ways; since you are so ANGRY about "presidential harassment" you should RESIGN!!!!! Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeloniaSherban Nod need for deep analysis; when DjT says or tweets ANYTHING it has a 90% probability of being a bold-face LIE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSYCH_HYPE "Russia, if you're listening, Moskova-Mitch has a dark-money super-pac for you...I'm sure you will be mightily rewarded"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmainct @RepAdamSchiff Wow - the DjT has elevated the murderous dictator of a regime that is starving his peeps to make bombs - FOR NOTHING in return.  This is really m-a-g-a!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmainct @SenBlumenthal @realDonaldTrump Yes he has been screaming about the CRISIS he, himself created, by his vile alteration of asylum seeker admittance procedures. Rock-on grandma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenBlumenthal Most Americans ARE weeping and/or are enraged by Trmp-regime's abhorrent treatment of asylum seekers.  But we are helpless and relying on CONGRESS to do their job to enforce the US Constitution; IMPEACH the MF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulkrugman Something tells me that park police or SS will keep baby-dotard balloon FAR away from Trmp's political rally; seriously tho, this whole 'event' seems like a set-up for political violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Absolutely agree.  Unfortunately, DJT does something nearly every day of his presidency that would be considered "grounds for impeachment" by GOP if Obama or ANY other Dem had done it. The Trmp WH occupancy remains an uncorrected national disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Gee - I recall you saying the same things about current BLOTUS until you joined "DjTeam-nazi"; I hope you realize you will NEVER be able to wash-away the stank of the Trump presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddPDeere45 May the 4th NOT be WITH the sick and corrupt Trmp-regime on this occasion of mourning the death of US democracy!  https://t.co/EzoVLin4pR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife @washingtonpost Darn, I was looking forward to his "live tweeting" Mueller testimony that day...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiproytx @realDonaldTrump You are proposing an absolute violation the US Constitution.  You need to be immediately removed from office for suggesting this sedition, and violating your oath of office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NatlParkService May the fourth NOT be with you.  https://t.co/EzoVLin4pR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NatlParkService Americans are looking to enjoy OUR National Parks this summer, but the "Trumpenfuror DC political rally" is going to deprive US of safety and services -- just as your sick gov't shutdown did in January.  You bring shame and want to America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleMisiak "power hungry"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 I hope this is true.  I'm just about to give-up on the Dem's for letting the Trmp-crime-family run amok in DC with no OVERSIGHT whatsoever, or at least incompetence in trying to do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahHuckabee @AOC @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Still out there LYING your ass-off.  You will never be able to wash the stank of the most corrupt POTUS (&amp; crime family) in history. The majority of Americans despise tRUmp and did not vote for him.  When the REAL Mueller Rpt is revealed to PUBLIC, DjT will be kaput.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bing_Chris Desperate times call for desperate measures.  If 11/3/20 polling in Ohio shows Dem pulling a few thou ahead of DJT, a little "tweaking" of the machine results would be essential to Putin/GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouthatNYT @mattyglesias Wrong premise.  Trump ran as an 'outsider' who could fix the rust-belt economy with his magical orange pixie dust, but MORE IMPORTANTLY, he ran as a full-on RACIST, and that's why he won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Thank goodness! The funds have been running low on the various Trump corruption trial defense funds. It will take at least that much to get through 3rs quarter legal bills just for Jr., Ivanka, and Jared!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Your 1% base is quite happy to offer up a few mil in order to keep the trillion dollar tax-cut. It's just a small insurance premium. Congratulations, to the GOPlutocracy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer They can now add "if you cheat an election, corruptly bilk the US treasury for billions for business cronies and family members, YOU GET to be POTUS!!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichieFed @NickAdamsinUSA Perhaps a special little open-air jail-cell, under the watchful eyes of GW and Lincoln, where tourists may mock him and throw peanuts during the hot summer months, and everyone can totally eschew him in winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickAdamsinUSA He definitely deserves a special place at Mt. Rushmore -- perhaps an honorary porta-potty that is labeled the "Trump Presidential Commode".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBP @USBPChief Sounds like you are not "seeing" the fact that openly racist fascists are in charge of the concentration camps you have allowed the Trmp-regime to install at the southern border.  Your entire department is culpable for the horror that is occurring; history will remember you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics "...politics shaped by perception" is an ongoing theme at CNN.  FOX-noise is clearly outright propaganda, where as CNN has a more nuanced "build up the maga-worldview" by ridiculous panels of Trmp-apologists and puff-pieces about the most corrupt POTUS (&amp;family) in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjsmokkieBOY57 @VanityFair "The Media" has totally boughten-in to the notion that DJT, a virulent sexual predator, is just that more entertaining to cover as a celebrity prez., ESPECIALLY because the GOP is fine with it. When the next Dem is elected, any hint of sexual-scandal will lead 24-7 media outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh dear! Looks like the Trump-crime-family Inc. has been busted again for violating the law.  Much harder to make below-the-table "campaign donations" to see to it that Ivanka's and Jr's' corrupt business dealings are NOT indicted when you're POTUS -- better resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Are the same secret investigators that are looking for Obama's birth certificate responsible for this amazing intelligence find?  DJT is this biggest LIAR in history - thanks for keeping his dis-info campaign in full speed 'the Hill"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan READ the frigging report you dim-wit voyeur.  Multiple instances of COLLUSION are identified. But because Manafort and other trumpsters failed to cooperate, a conspiracy w/ RU government is unprovable. You know perfectly well DJT is a Russian asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gettv Really love her bad girl performance as 'vile' cousin Miriam in "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @IvankaTrump And "the Hill" offers a special salute to nepotism and normalization of the most corrupt crime-family ever to have been installed in the WH.  You must feel so maga-nificent about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPresage I'm sure Mueller is 'shaking in his boots' knowing that the great anti-trmp deep-state-coup is ALL about to be exposed!  He will be so fearful that they find the secret deleted 'texts', he will take-back all suggestions of DJT obstructing justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I can just imagine the cutesy interviews where she expresses the wonder of working with such a genius as DTJ, while the reporter and she both jokingly agree he is quite an unusual president, and set aside all the lies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I think that the odds are much better that you will become the next Queen of England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I'm sure @IvankaTrump is a lovely person when she is alone with her liberal Democrat friends; the problem is that she was nepotistically placed in a position of power w/o any qualification and she is promoting her father's fascism with impunity, along with financial self-dealing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PARISDENNARD @IvankaTrump I would love to see an itemization of the million$ in expenses that US taxpayers have been paying for 2+ years (while Ivanka 'took no salary') as she shamelessly promoted her and Jared's financial self interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronlebeahm1 #unwantedivanka is kind of amusing today, but 'twitter', like US politics, is tentative and foul of late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton "Idea taking shape" means it is something that came to Herr Trumpenfuror in an ambien-dream that 'John Dennison' has now leaked to one of his pet NYT sources. Just hope he doesn't get BLOTUS to TWEET IT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraWalkerKC Sounds like it's time to eliminate all those pesky Ukraine invasion and US election interference SANCTIONS, so that DjT and his petrol-industry cronies can get on with big$$$ deals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump A true "confederacy of dunces" to be sure. A TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT to the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Try addressing your concerns to McConnell - he is the COG of "congress" that is completely laying down carte blanche for DjT to do/say whatever he wants - to protect his GOP-empire; destroying the US constitution in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahHuckabee Historic kowtowing to a murderous dictator by a corrupt POTUS who just wants a photo-op. A true confederacy of evil-dunces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USAmbKenya Dear Leader Trumpenfuror not allowing visa's for "s-h" countries? Y'all are a total embarrassment to the citizens of the US. Resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howroute Alcohol creates a real drag on the nice amphetamine buzz he gets from Adderall - it's definitely diet coke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJeffries Honestly, Mueller is going to say as little as possible. Intense loyalty to GOP/JD solidarity will prohibit him from offering up much of anything negative. IT'S UP TO CONGRESS to ask key-questions that RM will have to answer truthfully, especially regarding 'charging decisions'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsBreaking Don't worry, if Trmp doesn't offer up this rotten tripe, @chucktodd /NBC news will serve it up plenty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Precognition of 'riding the snake'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn I understand 'Chase' was quite sympathetic to NAZI's in the day. I'm sure you will be more comfortable with an institution like that. Of course, we know, you keep your BIG bucks in off-shore accounts anyway, and I'm sure you also know Russian oligarchs who can "bank" for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Oh dear - is prez. DjT's senility a communicable disease?  I can see how you caught it with your mouth to rear admiration of the orange blotard. BUSH negotiated the troop drawdown and you KNOW IT! #LindseyGrahamResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR Once again, you show a complete misunderstanding of history.  We all know you are vying to inherit the MAGA-crown after Trmp's final humiliating term; showing that you can dis-inform so blatantly must be part of that great quest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @TheHillOpinion Is 'the Hill' a legit news org. or just a GOP dis-info pass-thru? Hint "gop-tripe".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Well the princess royale' really knows how to throw a bunch of words together to sound almost like she know what is happening.  She definitely has a career ahead as one of the faux-blonde talking heads on Fox&amp;fiends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTomCotton You definitely need to READ THE CONSTITUTION. We all know you have been 'jonesing for' a war with IRAN for YEARS. STOP!  Keep your hawkish warmongering in your pants, dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Desperately trying to bend the law towards your racist and totally political agenda.  It's a really good look for a POTUS (NOT!!!!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @MSNBC Better stop tweeting insults and figure out how you are going to explain to Vlad-dad why you haven't stopped all the RU sanctions from the original Crimea invasion.  Putin is PISSED! (not in the way you like). #AdiosTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amconmag You might also want to avoid the clear current IDENTITY that you support policies that lead to family separation and tragic deaths of asylum seekers -- it's kind of the OPPOSITE of CHRISTIANITY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickhasen OFCOURSE! The GOPlutocracy has been tremendously fortified for decades to come.  One of the most import and blatantly POLITICAL decisions ever (rivaled only by Bush v. Gore)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atDavidHoffman @Lawrence @DonnyDeutsch Deutsch has some real 'Madison Ave' street smarts, but he also has a very clear "don't you dare nominate a progressive" personal interests in protecting his friend&amp;family assets (i.e., DON"T TAX ME!!!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman DON'T forget the big important TWEET from your prez. antichrist TRUMP who let us know that families dying at the border due to his inhumane and illegal refugee repellant strategy is BORING!!! #GOPConcentrationCamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Have you double checked that Manafort is remaining loyal to your butt-buddy DjT? Better dangle another pardon as Mueller is going to talking TRUTH about all your team's dirty Russian dealings to the public soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCrongeyer @MaddowBlog @Dry_Observer Apparently the counter-intelligence investigation determined that, in fact, Trump and several GOP congressmen are highly compromised by RUSSIA, but since this info will be highly disruptive to control of US politics, IT MUST NEVER be PUBLICLY REVEALED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC OH hell girl! Why don't y'all just come on out and declare the US is now a fascist dictatorship with KING Dotard at the realm and a Senate full of racist plutocrats dictating ALL LAW; there you go, you're welcome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins Separating families, caging children in dire conditions, refusing asylum. This is the 2019 GOP - the party of unChristian suppressors. Congratulations. People are dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joniernst Thank God! You are finally going to refuse those wretched Ethanol and other farm subsidies in IOWA! Grassley may be mad, as his corporate farm may get less cash from uncle Sam - but WELL DONE! Free markets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU will NEVER be respected as president, and certainly NEVER be associated with any kind of patriotism since you are clearly a Russian asset working to undermine EVERY decent thing in the US &amp; world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryFalwellJr @drmoore WWJD? The first thing he would do is immediately denounce and condemn ALL charlatans that dare to speak in his name while advocating cruelty towards refugees.  Hopefully he will soon be lecturing you, in person, before referring you to a sub-terrestrial ultimate destination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump As usual, you are in an Adderall-fueled fever fantasy ... Meanwhile, children are suffering and DYING due to your cruel refugee prohibition strategy.  You are the true personification of Evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics Well, DA!  Trump only needs a strategy to stay in the WH several more years -- he could not care less about where the US and the world is when he slips away to his secret Crimean retirement location when necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Winning the contest for most deplorable? The only thing @EricTrump and his demented wife are winning is a place in history as two of the most despicable, corrupt, fascist and toxic citizens ever to be allowed anywhere near the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew "Raising concerns" ...?  Both Chao and McConnell need to be thoroughly investigated and indicted for major crimes involving grift and influence peddling - but of course, being DC GOP 'royalty' they will not even be censured a little bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradMossEsq The answer to the question "Was it your intention to leave obstruction charging question 'up to AG Barr'" ?? Is going to be pretty damn dramatic; if Mueller refuses to answer or totally obfuscates, then the hearing will end up being a farce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joefaz DjT has been having more of a long sweet 'wet-dream' since Barr charged-in and completely short-sheeted the entire Mueller report. Hopefully the NIGHTMARE is just starting as the public learns of considerable high crimes and misdemeanors that have been covered-up by GOP/Trmp-TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Whats a matter now, whiney baby dotard? Did you hear Mueller is going to testify and blow the lid off of your and Barr's COLLUSION COVER-UP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Which one of multiple "Top" officials that are (no doubt) guilty of these crimes? Do I really have to read your news-lite article to find out? It doesn't really matter --  the entire Trmp-regime could resign, but as long as DJT remains, we are doomed...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Using tax-payer paid resources to celebrate the anniversary of the worst plague to hit the US in decades.  For the record, the Trmp-crime-family vies for the most toxic, foul and corrupt group of nepotistic public figures in history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markknoller @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS Sounds like a fantastic briefing of manly-tough-talking BS with absolutely no value to anybody but the butt-buds involved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDanCrenshaw Yay - beat those war drums!  GOP definitely needs a new war to take the focus off of their miserable legislative record and the unbelievable CORRUPTION on their part, especially one totally impeachable POTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio You DELIVERED YOURSELF to the EVIL ONE - you have enrolled yourself in DjT's debts, and now expect Heavenly Father to rescue you? I don't think the system works that way, Marco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Kind of makes you question your sycophantic loyalty to the POTUS and the GOP that are TOTALLY ENABLING PUTIN to devastate the US, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeetThePress It is so much nicer if we just refer to these places as "summer camps" for perspective refugees. Let's try to give the Trmp-regime vast lattitude in framing how he wants to imprison people w/o cause; mustn't raise the spector of blatant fascism that might upside the other side...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MotherJones @AriBerman McConnell and the Federalist Society haven't performed laser-focused political shenanigans to pack SCOTUS for nothing!  The GOPlutocracy must be protected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Liz_Cheney @AOC Liz, have you or your mentor-father ever apologized for maliciously lying to US to initiate the Iraq war--in order to boost petrol-industry profits--that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths? We'll listen to your lecture right after that apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Don't worry Mitch, America see quite clearly that your ONLY agenda is to protect the current PLUTOCRACY at all costs; appointing right-wing judges and avoiding any legislation that actually helps US people. History will hold a special place for your complicity with Trmp/RU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobcesca_go @Salon Great piece; I was thinking that the news that the GS interview did not receive high viewership ratings is sort of a mixed message -- most of the country just doesn't want to follow the collusion story, preferring to keep their GOP/Fox-crafted ideas on the subject pure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 To me, the most bizarre/alarming public DJT behavior is his chronic attitude that ALL foreign policy is just a matter of his interpersonal relationships with world leaders - as if that's all there is to it - especially knowing that his attitude will be fully informed by bribery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LGBTResistance2 A couple of weeks ago I wrote a polite e-mail to my rep @CongressmanRuiz (Riverside CA) asking his position and strongly suggesting an 'impeachment inquiry' BUT got a polite response itemizing the "somber responsibilities of impeachment" but refusing to make any commitment...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @GStephanopoulos The only DJT "financial statement' the US is truly interested in is the list of actual property holdings that are not mortgaged to the hilt such that they may be forfeited to the government for the multitude of financial crimes and tax fraud committed both in and out of office!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you spent 1/1000th of the time you are POTUS working on ANYTHING that is NOT ALL ABOUT YOU, America could be greater, but alas, you do not give a rat's ass about anything but power and $, rubles, or bitcoin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you are attacking a US news paper that suggests the IC is doing a great job defending us against Kremlin -- you literally are denying this to curry influence with Vlad-the-poisoner-Putin, AGAIN? Anything you will not give-up to mother Russia? ANYTHING?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, you haven't done anything but sow deep discord in the US population and signed the GOP-tax-scam that benefitted your billionaire cronies and multi-national corps. ONLY.  Just keep spilling the truth about all your COLLUSION! It plays well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCPalmSprings I am very curious how much monetary compen$ation you rec'd from the Trump political campaign for the BIG PLUG your 5pm news reporter did for his campaign kick-off campaign, or whether your news team has decided to BACK Trmp for other political/financial purposes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Frankly, your PERVERTED SEXUAL embrace of 'old glory' on several occasions is a much worse desecration of the flag than burning!  The amendment that needs passing is to ban any criminal tax-dodger from ever being allowed to run for prez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DNCWarRoom From everything I've read in last 2+ years, the Trmp-EPA has been actively working to deregulate all inconvenient environmental restrictions and do as much damage to the environment as any corporate financial opportunity might suggest is possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgoodlaw Gee. if only there had been some counter-intelligence investigation into whether DT is in fact a Russian Asset while serving as president - IC professionals could share w/each other directly any concerns about DT leaking details to Putin/oligarchs - and even the American people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Please explain your deep new affection for Russian infiltration of the US political system.  Does the Mormon Temple Moscow project influence your (&amp; Mitt's) new found temperance for Vlad-the-poisoner-Putin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows MEANWHILE, the GOP-freedom caucus just keeps toiling away, obstructing justice at every possible turn.  Must be a great feeling knowing that you will go DOWN in history as one of the great malicious enablers of the MOST CORRUPT POTUS in history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN I know that she shamelessly stands beside the most corrupt and corrosive POTUS in history (even though often seeming to despise him, as he ignores or pre-empts her).  She joyfully participated in 'birtherism' w/DT and has never apologized for that. Plus, she is a feckless c**t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated @HallieJackson @seanspicer It is as "far of a stretch" to say you set a new precedent in LYING as press secretary is as it is to say that DJT is the most compulsive lying POTUS in history (which is NO distance at all -- in fact there is no space there).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico The only thing she has in common with Jackie-O is her knowledge that her husband is a philandering prick.  Too bad Melania doesn't have half a brain or a heart to lend any value to the pathetic DJT presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @HillaryClinton @POTUS More importantly, the American people are extremely sick of your disgusting political antics that provide no value other than to protect the most corrupt potus in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 The one thing Trump has yet to deliver for Putin (as discussed by Flynn and Kislyak before &amp; during inauguration) is oligarch SANCTIONS relief.

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 The only lives who have been 'improved' in any way by DJT, simply because he signed the GOP-tax-scam-bill fashioned by Ryan, McConnell and banking lobbyists, are a few hundred billionaires who believe vast increases in their OWN personal wealth as an upgrade.

<|startoftext|>@CBSAllAccess After the disgusting propaganda spewing interview with AG Barr by @CBSThisMorning on 5/31, I will watch as little CBS as possible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Even more awkward? DJT destroying the US stock market and economy to enhance his racist agenda with illegal tariffs that just serve a new tax on US citizens. #TrumpCriminalInvestigations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump IF ONLY!!! You and your evil @VP have shown America and the world that YOU ARE NO FRIEND to LGBTQ people. In fact, you have shown repeatedly that you are doing everything you can to hurt and demonize.  Trans troops have a million times the patriotism and yet you vilify. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lori_alvord I imagine just a little co-operation from Manafort could have provided substantial help in this, but a pardon dangled keeps the conspiracy neatly tangled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dandrezner Astonishing to see that this ghoulish incel advisor is going beyond the nazification of US and is now bent on destroying the economy as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill IF the poll is at all accurate (?) it is definitely a testament to the power of Trmp-regime propaganda and other Fox-noise/GOP obfuscation of the actual findings of the Mueller report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson It sure seems as if some actual cooperation from Manafort might have helped a LOT in determining this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington I expect that's true, except when he is about to issue some market moving tweet about tariffs; I expect he 'discusses' that with selective friends and hedge-fund traders so they can set up positions in advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Crime? You are definitely an expert in crime.  How many hedge-fund traders did you alert before issuing your latest corrupt tweet about tariffs? We will soon find out in the #TrumpCriminalInvestigations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule Only if he is looking to gain weight from a lot of empty calories &amp; HIGH trans-fats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 I expect the little exposure to MR/findings that a majority of US citizens get is from watching local news (waiting for the weather).  Any exposure to the real contents via TV news segments on congressional hearings, etc., will lead to a major zeitgeist change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Of course this is right. The entire plan hatched by Barr&amp;Co. since pre-confirmation, was to suppress the true story contained in the MR. The roll-out has been disinformation and gas-lighting to the max. Any revelation of actual contents is devastating to DjT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I expect you tipped of your buddies involved with hedge-funds or other stock trading knowing you will cause a significant drop in the market on 5/31...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieOGrady He is clearly flying HIGH on the lord, or something even stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNSNick My curiosity was aroused by the people who pushed through his Senate confirmation. Of course I have no proof, but expect 'Federalist Society' JD attorneys/justices KNEW they needed to profoundly offset the upcoming disclosure of Mueller's findings to preserve the GOPlutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning @JanCBS Basically you just allowed the AG to continue the Trump-admin  propaganda campaign to exonerate the president. CBS is acting in step with GOP to preserve the corrupt president in obvious self-interest.  The fall of democracy and rise of a virtual plutocracy serves you well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@applPiprogress @Hope012015 @CNNPolitics How odd - it turns out Vlad-the-poisoner-Putin also had a long-running disdain for JM who was no friend to Russia.  Co-inc-i-dink?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You continue to defile the US and the world with your idiocy about tariffs  and unprecedented cruel behavior towards asylum seekers. #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 So in addition to paying for all the Secret Service leases (required to protect Trmp/family) the Gov't now gets to pay DjT HOA/co-op fees?? I sure hope they liquidate it quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickPonticello First guess, obviously, would be Democrat. Concern for all humanity and the environment is no longer an R-kind of thing.  If I really was interested in such an account, however, I would read a few of their tweets -- I've discovered quite a few FALSE profiles are out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartpstevens Great article/take on the situation.  I would stress that a few Repub's in leadership positions (e.g. Moscow Mitch) are providing tremendous cover for everyone in the GOP because of clearly selfish motivations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Even IF this was true (it's NOT) real professionals would never allow such petty personal politics to influence their judgement.  But you, being a low-IQ narcissistic con-artist, could never understand such professionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianefallon I fully expect they will side w/executive branch argument -- not so much for useful idiot prez DjT, but to preserve the GOPlutocracy to which all good Federalist Society judges and justices are fully committed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegoodgodabove Though I may never completely comprehend you, it seems right now that you are very much like Mueller -- unable to use your own great power to SMITE the MF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP The GOPlutocracy has spoken! You minions must get in line with your corporate overlords and the billionaire class and worship US as required!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiveThirtyEight Another way to obtain a great number of GOP votes would be for Dem's to seriously temper their disdain for white supremacy!  Good people on both sides, yah?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera What are you a toll taker on the GW Bridge or something? Seems like a career you would be much better at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So there was definitely EVIDENCE of the conspiracy, but insufficient? Does that have anything to do with the fact that you OBSTRUCTED the investigation and dangled pardons to silence Manafort and Stone??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump It's your dear leader president Twump that is on strike. Meanwhile, GOP Senate will not advance any constructive legislation, so what is the point? BTW, Mueller Report points out numerous instances of collusion, and 12 DEFINITE instances of  OBSTRUCTION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Also on  in 5 minutes, check out @maddow on MSNBC - I bet it will be super awesome tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Are you acting as press sec. for Barr, also now? Might as well since he is just a lawyer working for the WH.  He will need plenty of your special spinning skills as he uses his new investigative powers to hand over American assets to Russia, as DJT has requested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJudgeMoore I do fear greatly for all my adolescent nieces for fear they might run into you at the mall, but that is about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr The only bias is that Mueller appears to have gone out of his way to NOT INDICT you, Jr., and other treasonous members of the corrupt Trump crime family, for fear of causing a BLOTUS meltdown of nuclear proportions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrentBozell The good news is it presents a wonderful new challenge for Barr, and the numerous Federalist Society lawyers, judges and justices to devise new ways of suppressing the actual MR findings and provide other distractions to protect the corrupt Trmp/GOPlutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich Did Callista leave the Vatican wine cellar unlocked for you last night? WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilgoret95 @joanwalsh Barr will be interviewed by @CBS tomorrow (will air on Fri a.m.) during which time I am sure he will perform incredible gymnastics to once again absolve DjT and then turn rabid on FBI/CIA investigators.  He is 100% all in for Trmp and GOPlutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The AMAZING thing here is that you think your MAGA-folk really subscribe to opinions of killer dictator KJU just because you two are in a sweet authoritarian love triangle w/Vlad-the-poisoner? You are truly deranged Donald.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudgeJeanine Good work - you seem at least 50% less drunk this week. DjT and the GOP continue to not only COVER-UP, but actually suppress the true findings of the Mueller Rpt.  All the fox-horses and all the fox-men can not keep dumpty-tRUmpty from being a traitorous Russian asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets I'm sure he will be doing Vlad-the-poisoner a great favor when he determines the CIA assets inside Kremlin who disclosed Putin's 16 election shenanigans; another special note to be delivered by Rand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Did you give special thanks to @senatemajldr McConnell for this fact? Sure missed it in your headline about "Congresses" ineffectiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse What part of the document's DOZENS of citings of Trmp campaign interactions w/ Russian operatives amounts to "No Collusion"? DjT just admitted two days ago that Jr. called him before 6/9 TT meeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios Can we at least "impeach" @PressSec Sanders? She should have been indicted by Mueller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod So in maga-land, a swipe by li'l rocket man at big Joe B. is considered a great political score? The coveted KJU-endorsement? I would love to see polling as to how many T-supporters actually view KJU positively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar Exactly! He also need to keep alive story of "discrediting" the agencies since much of the counter-intelligence info about his multitude of criminal shenanigans has not yet seen the light of day; DjT, w/Barr's help, needs a permanent smokescreen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus Don't you luv the way she invokes the 'feminist foul' routine anytime she needs to wield a weapon on any perceived detractor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBarri To be fair (though I really HATE his tRUmp-kisser politics), His acting on Ray Donovan was pretty spectacular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marceelias I don't pretend to understand the nuances of Israeli politics at all, but it is a testament to the general wisdom of American Jews that they can see through the hollow corrupt shell of DjT no matter how much he panders, and see the putz for what he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani drunk tweeting at 9a.m.? Musta been quite a night at the Schmucksbury!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianbeutler Meanwhile, this selective information release will gobble up all the 'news space' that remains a void because of continuing obstruction in presenting documents/witnesses from the Mueller investigation, all out of public sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump NO, it's just that they want the pure white Republican'ts to be able to rejoice, along with R. Mueller, about how totally innocent you are! Let him speak the praises of the totally non-obstructive POTUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Thnx to 'Rep's' obstruction...MEANWHILE...when GOP controlled the House, you passed TAX SCAM ceding trillions of US treasury funds to multi-national corps, AND you effectively shielded the most CORRUPT POTUS in US history from ALL investigations and enabled RU election hacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emptywheel It's a lot more than just "Trmp-TV" indoctrination.  Barr was carefully inserted as AG by McConnell &amp; the network of JD "Federalist Society" alumni (McGahn, Rosenstein, etc.) dedicated to the protecting useful idiot POTUS and the power of the GOPlutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wa wa wa -- how the low-IQ baby responds to being accused of his obvious display of a #TrumpTantrum.  Also another impeachable offense, btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Democrats came equipped with plans for INFRASTRUCTURE, but unfortunately, due to #TrumpTantrum's in the rose garden (again!), the US does not have a president willing to perform the duties of his office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Great theory.  Unfortunately, your being the most extremely corrupt, racist, and traitorous president in US history is also weighing quite heavily on your poll numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins What a crock of sh$#!! You and the entire GOP is involved in the cover-up of the worst treason and corruption in US history.  It is clear that many GOP congressmen are involved with the money laundering scheme, but the world will soon "out y'all"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Great Headline/Tweet 'the Hill'!  Is this part of a new GREATEST historical FALLACIES EVER uttered by anyone series?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crampell 1. DjT is financially 'in deep' with Russian oligarchs / questionable fgn entities. 2. RU financial tentacles also reach to some key GOP players. 3. It's all kept under wraps to allow the election interference to continue and GOP control to proceed unabated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delavegalaw @HouseJudiciary I doubt it; It appears all 'Federalist Society' attorneys, lawyers and judges around Trump (McGahn, Barr, Rosensrein, etc. )have formed a pact to protect the GOP-head despite his clear criminality.  The Plutocracy must be preserved, even if it costs some personal reputations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNavyMomPA Especially bizarre pathological lying in light of the fact that most people have heard multiple times that he was warned about Flynn, and he knows there are numerous video clips of people testifying about this...but he thinks his "base" listens/believes ONLY his tales?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBeatWithAri @Karamo Your entire show was incredible today, especially your commentary on Barr - but I do question your assertion that "the Chicken came first." do you have any direct evidence of that allegation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast No -- they really should just poll the "real Americans" in the heartland, and only if they are magateers; then DjT could grant himself another 2-10 years by Executive Order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance @matthewamiller Remember when Barr (at first) refused to meet with Sen. Klobuchar before his confirmation? BIG TELL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP So @Jim_Joran knew all about it? Thanks for the heads up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP So Gym Jordon knew all about it? Thanks for the heads up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein @lachlan She is quite sensitive to any such direct criticism of her open love of Kremlin talking points and 'mutes' me each time I point that out to her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJRosenstein I was impressed by your adherence to truth, justice, and the rule-of-law during the Mueller investigation, then, at the end, you revealed you were totally willing to sacrifice ALL for the 'Federalist Society' rule to defend the GOPlutocracy at all cost! History will not be kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaitMarieox Thanks for reminding us that the rapist-in-chief has not yet been impeached.  Good Catch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Yes, it is astounding, especially now that the US Justice Deprtmant is now acting as a 100% Trmp/GOP protection racket, even ratcheting up plans to abuse power and investigate/charge anyone who has ever questioned their authority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So glad to hear that you truly believe TREASON deserves a long jail sentence.  While you are serving time for your numerous treasonous acts against the US, it will comfort you to know justice is BEING SERVED!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Explain to me how you were colluding with NY-FBI field office to force Comey to "reopen" the HRC e-mail investigation a few weeks before '16 election, and how the IG investigation into this has been all covered up by the Trmp/Justice Dept. Very curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn How DARE anyone try to hold the designated heir to our great King tRUmp to account for his actions?  Such interrogation will NOT BE TOLERATED by the sniveling sycophants of dear leader!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimsciutto @WSJ Could you please give me a rundown of the main uses of the $700billion budget that is allocated for US defense each year? Seems like there might be some funds in there for such important defense strategy - or has that all gone to "Wall"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Tweet after tweet, you prove once again that you are a very LOW IQ prez who does not understand anything about economic policy (or anything else, for that matter). #Resign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Jeez - what do they need, an EDICT, penned in Blood, from white-new-world-patriarch Vladimir Putin himself?  Let him know, he'll arrange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eligit Your words to Dem ears; I am super anti-trump, but I really don't wanna hafta "settle" on a candidate just yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins @mkraju Since the treasure-trove of curious information about the NRA &amp; GOP participation in Russian collusion has not yet risen from the redacted MR shadows and unknown spin-off investigations, I'm sure Sen. Conryn is EXTREMELY anxious to declare "case closed".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert Perhaps if the Dem's just figure out a way to bring Beltway traffic to a halt, they could implicitly threaten the GOP to do the right thing? Any other suggestions Gov.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Once in a great while, like in advocating for Puerto Rico, you roll off the GOP/Trmp-train just a little.  But here you are clearly channeling NRA and whacky-far-right taking points. Bad Geraldo. #PutinsGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmasher2 Tough call, though the pull towards the "rule of law" is strong, the fate of the entire GOPlutocracy is at stake; his commitment to the Federalist Society agenda is probably stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan William Barr is simply following the 100% partisan lead of the GOP which is united in protecting the most corrupt, divisive, treasonous and mentally-ill POTUS in American history.  ALL y'all will be held in contempt in the annals of history!! You are evil personified. #PutinsGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm sure you &amp; McConnell "fixed" all these ridiculous tax-loopholes in your big tax reform package, no? NO? American citizens have been subsidizing your slick life of "rich and shameless" for decades. #BillionDollarLoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You need to do a reprint of the book YOU didn't actually write, but rename it "The Art of the SCAM"!!! #BillionDollarLoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethWReid also, another tax-deduction (as if he needed one)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethWReid Adderrall has similar effect when snorted daily, &amp; easier to get via prescript.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @politico Odd -- I ALWAYS get a "hypocrisy alert" any time you tweet something. McConnell is not interested in passing any legislation that doesn't directly benefit his corporate donors or the GOPlutocracy. Right now, he just wants to confirm young ultra-right leaning, unqualified judges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife @politicususa Has he been 'fired by tweet' yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanbehar And the Rpublican party went enthusiastically along for the ride; in fact they carefully protected the president from any investigation in order to preserve power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeloniaSherban Time to delineate how Trmp-radmin must now withdraw all Crimea Invasion &amp; '16 election interference Sanctions, as begun by Vlad-dad/Trmp strategy session in phone conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g00dneighbour @davidfrum @TheAtlantic Agree; they came for the "billionaire celebrity" -- but STAYed for the enthusiastic policy of white-supremacy, a much stronger attraction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisPower1 I understand that they have backed off the whole "fair and balanced" theme. @Foxnews is now just an open proud SHILL for Trump-Propaganda, acting as Trmp-TV, just barely pretending to be journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottforFlorida @CoryBooker Next thing you know, they will actually want to register people who have embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars from Medicare and stuffed it into off-shore accounts! Awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g00dneighbour @davidfrum @TheAtlantic But they may be unnerved to find out he barely makes any income from his fictitious billions, and is in fact fully loaded with debt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swin24 @sambrodey I'll hazard a guess that Gaetz, whom seems to be channelling the stance of Vlad-dad (often as not), will win the influence game on Venezuela.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pauljvergouwe @WillFletcherROC @sadydoyle Good point, though the 'power corrupts' story-line has been employed multiple times already. Not to go too far into fan-fiction, but perhaps the ultimate winner-kingdom could be 'Democracy' though lately that seems to be a ridiculous fairy tale.  Power finds a way to prey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillFletcherROC @sadydoyle Especially Daenerys' change of temperament from one fighting valiantly for a pre-ordained right of ascendancy -- to that of conspirator in a cover-up of an inconvenient truth; it's an attack on her fundamental character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightWingWatch Finally, a universal theory of everything that makes perfect sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianschatz @samstein In fact GOP will very actively THWART any meaningful discussion on such matters on behalf of their resource-exploiting corporate benefactors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler One has to wonder how many hedge fund managers/traders DjT alerted before he sent out that sweet tweet about raising China tariffs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 It's just another case of "watch what he DOES, not what he SAYS". Pretending he wants lower oil prices is gas-lighting consumers. DjT, fossil fuel industry corps. and autocratic allies (esp. SA, RU ) are very happy with higher oil prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshNBCNews @NBCNews TG! Wouldn't want this royal off-sprout to endure a belabored Americanized debut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebrown22 @realDonaldTrump I wonder how many hedge-fund managers/traders (including those for his own account) DT&amp;Mnuchin alerted before sending out that sweet little tweet that he knew would send the S&amp;P on a deep dive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL @GOP @SenateGOP Yes; they will block all moves to remove DT prior to that, but as long as '20 election seems relatively sound/uncontested (and he loses), the constitutional crisis of enabling DT to remain would be too great for even the GOPlutocracy to endure the public backlash. Maybe naive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PogoChrestman Ffs, she barely dodged a perjury charge w/Mueller; she is not going to directly lie again (about a verifiable matter) and will always go with the 'don't know/don't recall' line whenever possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@npfandos Especially since the constant theme of both JD and Dem's in charge is always just to delay, delay. delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 He musta strongly wheeled 'Maximum Security' on top...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jljacobson @realDonaldTrump Putin &amp; oligarchs goal in getting Trmp elected (Tillerson installed, etc.) was to get US RU sanctions relief. The benefits of deconstructing US democracy from within &amp; undermining world standing/order are ginormous benefits. DjT clearly working his hardest to achieve all of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP YOU politicize a heartbreaking choice of mothers facing inviable pregnancies, claiming some holier-than-thou mandate, yet are directly involved in imprisonment/torture of thousands of asylum seeking children, and doing nothing to stop the genocide. FAKE Christian!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC I guess you missed the briefings with the gang of eight?  Y'ALL knew what was going on and hid it from the American people, especially @senatemajldr who threatened Obama with retaliation if he warned citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LandonHall @jmartNYT Last time I checked, Wyoming has only about 600k residents, and probably 80% of those are Republicants, so good luck with that.  Every voter in WY has about 10 time the power as  a voter in CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sugarcubedog @PamKeithFL @danmonaghan Right, Barr is Bush's man, one of the many "Federalist Society" picks (e.g., McGahn, Rosenstein, Kavanaugh, other conservative SC Justices) all endeavoring to protect the GOPlutocracy at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon Only on "local propositions" where the pollster was obviously working for a corporate entity with a stake in the outcome of the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What is absolutely clear, is that the GOP is acting in total concert with DjTrmp to hand over US sovereignty to Russia (or any other corrupt foreign power) for just the right amount of cash to BUY IN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Only4RM @JoyAnnReid Unfortunately, it seems pretty clear the Federalist Society-stacked "courts" (especially SCOTUS) are going to rule in favor of the Executive branch, when they get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremynewberger and if he follows it up with a directed insult to the questioner, you know it's a really really really bigly LIE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Pretty sure he worships a golden idol (gold plated, at least) created in his own image.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WashTimes What exactly is in Trmp's tax returns that he cannot divulge? DjT is restricting his participation in the normal political process, and he, alone, is the one candidate depriving himself of electors if he refuses to participate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lrozen Doesn't congress still have to approve eliminating RU sanctions or is the US now totally in 'autocracy mode'???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenSasse I knew the correct "question" to that answer because I see your name&amp;pic frequently on twitter due to your "slightly concerned" BUT ALWAYS straight-GOParty-line votes on important matters supporting the ongoing destruction of US democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Trmp tweeted about the call and mentioned the "Russian Hoax"  https://t.co/RAPpxEZm0r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanSarandon I'm sure you will work very hard to ensure Trmp gets maximum disgruntled-D-votes if a candidate emerges that does not meet your purist standards, just as you did in '16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden This question will be answered in detail when Mueller testifies in the House Judicial Comm., since you are obstructing justice and interviews in the Senate. Also, try reading the frigging report; you will see Mr. Chair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaVigeland Is he talking about the Dick who created the false narrative about Iraq-WMD, lead Bush-43 by the nose into the middle-east wars that have killed 100s of thousands of people, and created permanent chaos there to boost BIG Oil industry profits? Oh, yeh, he's a swell guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien The JD used to at least care about giving the "appearance" of impartial, blind justice and adherence to the rule of law -- but that has been completely thrown out the window in the era of Trmp.  Now, JD is just a big power broker, protecting the GOPlutocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Your father is a stochastic terrorist who is conducting genocide at the southern border and elsewhere in the world.  Shame on you and your corrupt family for creating death and destruction all over this planet just so you can line your pockets with blood money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden Absolutely the most shameful performance of your life Lindsey Graham. You HAVE NOT EVEN READ the redacted report(!!!) while you are the head of Judiciary Committee? You need to be impeached along with the entire corrupt Trump-Putin-regime acting as POTUS &amp; Co.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepThomasMassie Cool! Another congressional RU surrogate spewing Kremlin talking points. I've heard the same nonsense from T. Gabbard, so it is now a bi-partisan effort. Any American caught trying to influence Russians would be imprisoned for life in RU with no real trial at all, so fuck-off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoortjeSchoute Though RR appeared to be the valiant protector of Mueller investigation &amp; interested in real justice, in the end, he was just another protector of the GOPlutocracy, along with Barr, McGahn, Kavanaugh, and other alumni of the Federalist Society operating in JD.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeetThePress @SenRonJohnson Sorry, missed the show.  Did you discuss exactly what the 4th of July field trip to the Kremlin was all about?  Did Vlad-dad give you any more talking points?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli Barr was deftly inserted into the DjT-regime by Federalist Society members including Don McGahn and Rosenstein to "land the plane" and protect their useful idiot and the GOPlutocracy.  He is a master of political shenanigans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @ArthelNeville @LelandVittert So glad to see you are actively managing the Trmp-TV network to ensure only the best propaganda is fed to your magats.  'Twould  be terrible if any actual truth were delivered to the people; they would turn away from you in a NY minute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmasher2 @realDonaldTrump He has high expectations that AG Barr will protect him from all this pesky investigation &amp; litigation  -- so far the plan is working...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myizonorion @TalbertSwan You REALLY need to read the New Testament and stop living in the world according to Trmp.  The only character he comes close to exemplifying is the antichrist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews Maybe some time you can be interviewed by an ACTUAL journalist who is not on your right-wing-terrorist-state-faux-TV-network.  That I would watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicky8651 Sure they do. The plan is: 1. Give all deference to Health Ins. Corps. &amp; big pharma 2. Put all people with pre-existing conditions into a 'special pool' that will be totally unaffordable to consumers, but call it "pre-existing condition coverage" 3. problem solved! maga.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise God you are a gun-worshipping son of a gun.  NO ONE needs an AR-15 to defend themselves.  More innocent people killed by weapons of mass destruction today.  Please go to hell, do not pass go, do not collect $200 dollars from the NRA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cspan Are you frigging kidding me?  I had to watch 20 minutes of a disgusting Trmp-magat rally which you pre-empted this WHCD for? Could have gone to State-TV (Fox-TRMP-fake-news) for that if I wanted to get nauseous!!. Extremely bad programming decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Just read that you are a "NO" on cannabis legalization.  With prescription-opioid crisis killing million of Americans, that's a big "NO" vote from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSington definitely "or what"   !!😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Once again using a government funded account to post political propaganda for the extreme-baby-caging-right wing.  You are such a disgrace to the US and a proven LIAR. SHAMEFUL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvilBobJ As he stood there, before all the real dirt started coming out, I read the look in his eyes as: "I know I am betraying the USA-please don't hate me-but my loyalty to the GOPlutocracy and the Federalist Society demands I protect our useful idiot potus".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mog7546 You could see it in his eyes as he stood behind Barr at presser; a mix of hostage and: "I know I am betraying the USA-please don't hate me-but my loyalty to preservation of GOPlutocracy and Federalist Society demands I absolve our useful idiot DjT".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HydroCabron @gtconway3d Exactly! Especially if that will aid McConnell / GOP Senators to maintain control!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisAlbertoLaw @Boiarski Won't fall for bots / twitter trolls, but JD/AG/FBI are doing a damn good job in making me lose complete faith in US democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff I guess Vlad-daddy prefers Wayne as head of RU satellite ops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennycohn1 Great; especially in light of new reporting that some Florida county may definitely have had it's equipment hacked in '16 and (?) FBI won't even tell them which county??? What's up with that? Thanks for your constant efforts on these matters!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @JoyceWhiteVance @NicolleDWallace Excellent show today! I hope Congress takes the cue y'all suggested that immediate hearings w/RR are done on this.  RR is seriously compromised and complicit in Barr's misrepresentations of MR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bornabrit1 Hate to be a conspiracy theorist, but I'm pretty sure RR, as well as Barr, B.Kavanaaugh and many other JD officials are active members of the ol' boys club 'Federalist Society' which are very dedicated preserving a virtual plutocracy in the US; protecting their useful idiot, DjT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owillis A 'sphere' implies they actually have dimension -- be assured this Venn diagram is a very flat circle with no depth at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews The only reason this might be true is that he has a habit of often NOT paying the obligations he has signed as a matter of regular business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 .@senatemajldr McConnell might lose next year, but he don't care. He has already socked away millions in ?funds, along with his corrupt wife, and rammed through GOPlutocatric judges enough to sabotage the US for decades.  He is a worse villain than the tRUmpenfuror.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker Trumpanzee doing bidding on behalf of the Kochs says what? How's that Foxconn con going on? You, Reince and #DerangedDonald really pulled a fast one, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMRegister @joniernst @realDonaldTrump @brianneDMR I.e., JE, a super Trmp sycophant is putting the GOPolitcal spin into high gear to cover his impeachable abuses of power and obstruction of justice offenses, and the DMR is playing right along. The FISA court abuse nonsense is a red herring that has been debunked repeatedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert You don't think Trmp going out on the WH lawn and ranting answers to a few questions is sufficient? He obviously prefers to leave out the middle-man, Bagdad-Sarah-Bob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum It's fine; he's a maga-nazi just participating in political discourse. He's white, so nothing to see here folks, move along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeleeb50 I've heard that he does NOT lay out the entrails of sacrificial offerings as clearly instructed in Leviticus just before the men w/men reference.  Can you imagine the sacrilege?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Learned that lesson in Nov.'16 -- BIG TIME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@putinsclown I'm sure that Barr &amp; GOP will still strictly adhere to this theory when a Democrat next gets elected POTUS, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I Think is about your 10,000th VERIFIABLE LIE. #ImpeachDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham @PeteButtigieg I am very certain that God is watching you and your antichrist-like leader Trmp inflict evil on asylum seekers and is planning a very swift reckoning with the devil and y'all in hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onecaliberal @olgaNYC1211 @NetNewsBuzz @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC No, even if you were being sarcastic, you are right - Romney used to be much more of a hawk on RU.  But I conjecture the 2018 approval by Kremlin to begin temple construction tempered his feelings dramatically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onecaliberal @olgaNYC1211 @NetNewsBuzz @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC I notice that ol' Mitt has greatly tamped down his anti-RU rhetoric now that the Mormons are in the process of building a new temple in Moscow.  Don't want to upset Vlad-dad TOO much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jack @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @Twitter So you are going to suspend Trumps malicious and and criminal violence inciting tweets? It's about time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Still waiting for the IG investigators report about your preview on Fux-news about the HRC emails that were drummed up between you and the NY FBI field office 10/16.  You need to be indicted for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeDelMoro @VaughnHillyard Oh really? Huh, I don't remember the answer to questions about how Pence lied about Flynn lying to him about chats with Kremlin operatives. Guess we'll need a separate investigation into that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter All patched up with your disgusting BLOTUS? How sweet.  If only you had half a brain to help him out of pending impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker Clearly you haven't got anything to assault anyone with other than all the dirty money you have netted from the Kochs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauljimerson Sure, I keep one hidden down at China Beach, thirteenth rock from the bottom of the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauljimerson You found my little summer place in Seacliff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang At least until the future SCOTUS decision in Trump v twitter: "Bots are people too".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianefallon The thing is, with Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh confirmations, he is right about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTheWriter1 It is painfully clear that DjT is going to block all attempts at investigation (especially allowing witness testimony to congress). Judiciary and FBI will not enforce subpoenas. If 'impeachment' will allow some formal legal access to witnesses and documents, it is now ESSENTIAL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathysm32176 @bjcreigh Agreed. It has become painfully apparent that the judicial branch of gov't as well as all the FBI / law&amp;order folks are NOT going to hold him accountable for continuing obstruction.  Can only hope DT gets voted out and meanwhile, get some amusement in his personal breakdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 Trmpism has tentacles worldwide, especially with operatives like Bannon and whatever Cambridge Analytica has become.  Just tell magats to shag themselves and/or block, and continue telling the bloody truth about DT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKJ65 @SpeakerPelosi Whether there is a technical 'impeachment' in the works, it's critical to immediately hold  hearings; the headlines that will ensue from Trmp's continual corruption exposure will drive eventual impeachment (or not if he 'innocent' (doubtful)).  Pelosi knows this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mueller bent over backwards to avoid indicting your treasonous kids and cronies out of political deference.  YOU refused to testify.  Y'all COLLUDED and OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE! #ImpeachDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Right after the media finishes exploring the question of why the traitor-tots were not indicted.  Hopefully SDNY and Manhattan DA will SOON correct this miscarriage of justice! #ImpeachTheMF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinWhitelaw1 I.e., if it impacts ANY profits of fossil-fuel based industries currently in favor by Trmp-regime, then science must defer to corporate greed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoriC_FOX5DC So nice to see that after a bit of a scuffle; some fears Rosenstein was a little too un-tRUmpy, the Federalist society is all back together and celebrating the triumph of the GOPlutocracy in gas lighting the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper .@morningmika: Something tells me that @chucktodd will take up "the OTHER SIDE" of this argument to ensure that both-sides get out all of the alternative facts needed to keep WH access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You do attract "the best" sexual predators and truly incompetent sycophants to your realm.  TG congress still has enough sanity to keep your most outrageous picks from being confirmed. #ImpeachTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn @CNN hank God the GOP stepped up and made sure the US KNEW it was being invaded by Russia - er, NOT - apparently @senatemajldr BLOCKED all possible action, on multiple occasions. #ComplicitGOPT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonaSigal I fully understand your mistake - I would have probably done the same thing.  I think it is highly unethical of the publishers to hide their politicized version of the document behind the 'official gov't looking' cover!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonaSigal Looked up the Amzn/Kindle options for ordering the MR. There are various versions with alternate "intro's"; they all look like gov't issued version.  Shame on Amazon for putting the Simon &amp; Schuster version first; S&amp;S never mention Dershowitz is a major political advocate for DT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump BUZZER (wrong answer) Oh, sorry, you misread the Constitution (or were given BAD advice from Rudy since you don't know how to read).  Article 1 'powers' enable congress to asses your extensive criminal and unpresidential behavior as high crimes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markknoller And all shades were drawn on the motorcade windows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee @whca Your family has developed an incredible knack for LYING to the end that y'all are obstructing justice in the US on a daily basis.  Very sad! Sarah is lucky Mueller didn't slap her up with a felony 'lying to the FBI' charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allyson747 @RonanFarrow @MittRomney It gets vary little press attention, but the Mormons began building a new TEMPLE in Moscow in 2018.  Since then, Mitt seems to have greatly tempered his objections to Russian political operations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila He can't get too aggressive against DjT -- he will risk the wrath of Vlad-dad now that the Mormons are in the process of building a new temple in Moscow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 A couple of real cracker-barrels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Of course, Mr. hero of the 'Federalist Society' wants the GOPlutocracy to know that it was he who keeps them in power by averting the totally impeachable obstruction DjT was risking.  He was also the hero who rammed in two SC justices to guarantee the 'right' legal control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Mueller report clearly shows serious high crimes and misdemeanors eligible for impeachment proceeding to begin.  I strongly respect your candidacy, especially re: your pragmatic intellect -- you should lead forward on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio You REALLY NEED new READING GLASSES!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG! You are finally admitting your Russian buddies did something? I hear Vlad-dad and the Oligarch are celebrating their '16 victory for you and planning another one in '20. Harasho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer Thank goodness we can expect Giuliani, Fletcher, et al, to provide the warp-speed-spin that it's all a huge miscarriage of justice; that Vlad-puppet DJT is completely exonerated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump Yes, we must all join together and celebrate for the RICH to get RICHER, the middle class and poorer Americans must sacrifice.

<|startoftext|>@politico Barr needs to add some grit to his Trmpian claim of "spys" in the IC. 'Freedom Caucus' will act as congressional stooges for the Federalist Society's fortification of Trmp/GOPower hold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera I sincerely apologize on behalf of AG Barr &amp; the DoJ for BLOCKING the TRUTH about the full extent of Russian Collusion that DjT and his crime family were involved in. Totally un-American and Obstruction of Justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You and the Trmp-propoganda network need to apologize to your subscribers for misleading them about the full extent of corruption occurring each day in the DjT regime. The full Mueller report will clearly identify the treason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecNielsen You have cemented your place in history. A solemn marker that will forever be a source of deep shame for all decent Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shossy2 Right - to the extent that there was any public 'litigation' of DjT's refusal to release taxes, it was 'settled' by his promise to release after audit. There is no way that every year since 2015 is under audit, not that that is really any sort of obstacle to release of info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exxonmobil WOW; after dozens of years of knowingly polluting the earths atmosphere for profit, NOW it occurs to you to research a fix? Really astounding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyArquette @NancySinatra @RaceAndRomance You can be assured that all of the Federalist Society members running DoJ (Barr, Rosenstein, McGahn, etc.) have shared the detailed info that is needed to cover for their useful idiot/head of the plutocracy: DjT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@politico I'm sure the longest "audit" in IRS history is over now, so DjT can complete his oft made promise to release his 2015 taxes, as stated on multiple occasions (that was the settlement of the 'litigation').<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KattyKayBBC I.e., "How about Dem's just let the GOP keep their pre-mature victory lap, carefully crafted by political operatives to publicly exonerate DjT, and simply ignore the fact that there is a completely corrupt foreign asset that has been placed as POTUS".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @CNN Sure there may be some really questionable ethics and justice delayed in not releasing the Mueller Report, but the important thing that @Comey, Rosenstein, and Barr understand is that the GOPlutocracy MUST prevail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC You can not be fixed and must be replaced! GOP has been unable to come up with ANYTHING better than the existing ACA which was really a republican plan to begin with! GOP/Trmp have sabotaged it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThePlumLineGS .@NBCNews : for the 500th time - there is NO Mueller Summary, yet!  Even Barr had to back-off and reclaim the Barr memo as his own, personal summation!  Stop trying to taint the jury pool.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomJChicago It would be great if this was all true, but I think more likely that at this point AG Barr is just CYA-ing his way out of a possible OBSTRUCTION charge against himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unpersuaded112 Even if they were really going bankrupt, i'm sure it would just be a ploy to avoid legal judgements, then the core institution would quickly reconstitute under some other corp. entity to continue their political shenanigans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DGrand Well said. I think @LindseyGrahamSC may be concerned he is one of the 'peripheral persons' whose reputation may be at risk within the real Mueller Report AG Barr wants to redact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs Real Mueller Rpt may show no indictable conspiracy, but I expect that chapters that discuss activities of supposedly 'peripheral' figures (Jarvanka, McConnell, Pence, Paul, Prince, NRA, ? etc.) could be of extreme public interest. Hard 'No' to such redactions!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus @ericgarland Also, Barr is an astute GOPolitical operative; I expect he will redact as much POTUS damaging info that he can get away without needing WH review. I also expect him to explicitly redact material he can on any GOP(eripherral) characters like McConnell, Paul, Pence, Prince, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwelkernbc @realDonaldTrump Are you frigging kidding? "What questions do Dem's have about Mueller Rpt?" WHAT REPORT???? No one has seen it.  Very shoddy propagandist take!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mimirocah1 Right; congress/citizens would have been yelling bloody murder since Sunday. But confidence that the "strong gravitational pull of justice within JD" would keep experienced/respected(?)

<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard Gosh darn it; every time you give me hope that you are in fact a patriotic American, you issue another kremlin sponsored tweet. As you well know, the Mueller report is being suppressed/covered-up by GOPlutocrats hiding the truth! Russia is an enemy of democracy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewEuropean Sorry, silly question from the states:  Isn't the union jack pattern completely reversible? What's the top?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@putinsclown Perhaps in 15-25 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Lies. Republicans have NO PLAN for health care, are in league with big Pharma to allow them to gauge consumers, and want to remove protections for pre-existing conditions.  Not to mention they are now trying to cause 20million+ people to LOSE their HC insurance. Disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcthiessen So, basically like highly partisan GOPolitical appointee AG Barr has claimed, POTUS is totally above the law, can not be investigated. Now any member of congress who does so can be disenfranchised? EXCELLENT! Right out of fascist/authoritarian playbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@911CORLEBRA777 @thespybrief @LouiseMensch @JamesFourM Lock him up. Lock him up.  ? But seriously, shouldn't there be some real repercussions for this rather than a lot of incredulous news stories/tweets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTIGOPMVMT Great idea to force this term into the discussion. There is such ridiculous negative baggage with the term 'socialism' (that is not really what democratic socialism is about).  But since we seem to all have to label things for political discussions - get a better label!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr He just delineated a series of TRUTHFUL FACTS about the KNOWN collusion of the DjT campaign.  Just wait till the public is able to see the entirety of REAL Dirt that is contained in the well-hidden Mueller Rpt. #IStandWithAdamSchiff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Trmp (along with many of his cabinet/cohorts) has been aggressively and openly engaging in blatant self-dealing, financial exaggeration and public promotion or degradation of select business for 3 years now; GOP/Maga folk just don't give a rats ass.<|endoftext|>

The report that may never see the light of day as plutocratic GOP forces suppress REAL facts &amp; findings? Sure, nothing to see here folks ((xcpt CORRUPTION x infinity)) go ahead &amp; vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frank_Schaeffer I'm sad that Barr, Rosenstein, McConnell, and other powerful plutocratic government forces are stifling the TRUTH within the REAL Mueller Rpt (whatever it might be). Maybe DjT is just a dupe, but clearly his campaign committed multiple crimes they're hiding fr/congress &amp; public!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Y'all are liars. GOP/Federalist Society political plant AG Barr declares DjT is vindicated. But the undisclosed ACTUAL MUELLER RPT has hundreds of pages of high crimes and misdemeanors involving campaign collusion and IMPEACHABLE OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE offenses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can't wait to read the Mueller report to see how your campaign punked the world--pretending to collude with Russians all those many times &amp; places; covered it up, but left just a few crumbs to mislead FBI. The chapter on pretending to sell Saudis nuclear info will be killer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AC360 Wow -- wow. Soft-ball underhand pitches to Bannon so he can absolve DjT and you both can wrap up the NEVER SEEN MUELLER Rpt as, "nothing to see there, move along". Useless disgusting interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill It's well documented that many in Trmp campaign lied, stole, talked with multiple Russians.  @KellyannePolls was just the ever revolving "spin doctor" to obfuscate about it all, which she did over and over, alternative fact after alternative reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetsyDeVosED You have made it very clear that your ONLY priority is to destroy public education in favor of evangelical private/charter schools.  Now you defund Special Olympics, while raising Dept. head salaries. Deplorable!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cspan @SenFeinstein @senatemajldr MM is acting in bad faith.  He is deliberately shielding DjT ,GOP and NRA from pages of specific damning evidence that he KNOWs is contained in the report.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytdavidbrooks NOBODY on earth owes DjT an apology until he personally apologizes to Obama about "birtherism", and about 3000 other people about devastating personal and political slurs and slanders he has NEVER apologized for.  Sit down and STFU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN CNN is up-front and ready to accept Trump political appointee W.Barr's summary of Mueller's report, without a thread of investigative interest in reading the actual report?  Trying to out-trump Fox-news!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Jury is still out madam press-sec. Why is Trumps JD refusing to show the REAL Mueller report?  Scared of impeachment much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi Any Mueller notes or discussion of the Russia/NRA/GOP connection for one bigie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Now it's time to see how the Russians have participated with the NRA and GOP to "enhance" your electability with illegal foreign campaign contributions -- I'm sure you will want to be exonerated of such charges as well. (?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreaking Oh, did you get a copy of that report?  Because NO ONE in US has except for the Trmp-appointed AG Barr, who has totally distorted it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@improper_ganda Our JD hero (?), Rosenstein is also one of these Federalists. In the end, he towed the party-line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omniJon1 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump There are dozens of articles on this - google it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamliptak Somehow this seems to be directly related to possible evidence of collusion? How can investigation be over w/o this info?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Thank God he had about 90 golf vacations at a cost of approximately $90,000,000 to US taxpayers (of which he personally pocketed millions) to ease his constant vexation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJDionne His Iran-contra pardon history was troubling.  Many pundits I usually respect insisted that once appointed, "the gravity of JD mission and professionals would compel him to be forthright". But I fear there is a strong pull of many in JD to protect the GOPlutocracy at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pamwise87666953 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Sure, just like in 2000 when Bush cut taxes on cap-gains &amp; funded Medicare-D w/o offset. The deficit exploded, and eventually there was a catastrophic financial melt-down of US economy in 8/08. Thank God Obama and Dem's dragged us out of that mess with little GOP help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJohnEli Sure; he fully utilized the "Rosenstein is for blind justice" aura he gained from repelling DT's attacks/calls to end Mueller probe. But deep down, RR is still a Federalist society Republican protecting the Grand-Oligarchy-Party as best he can within JD regs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrosen_nyu @soledadobrien Reporters and especially cable news are bored with the RU story; it's complex and hard to communicate. They are chomping at the bit to get to Dem's in disarray; candidate faux-paws, and the big primary/election battles for next 18mo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCo62 Are there at least 3 or 4 R-Senators who know what a fraud/problem this guy is? Probably. Will they dare to defy DjT in confirmation process? Probably not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Same overarching agenda laid out ad nauseam. The plutocracy is working with all available partners to shield Trmp presidency (much as they may despise him) to absolutely ensure GOP control over the gov't; at least the minimum requirement of seating judges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Absolutely right.  The 'truth' may yet come out though House oversight committees, but Trmp and the GOP will be screaming foul constantly, turning it all into a partisan issue; counter-intelligence inquiry be damned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis I continue to be amazed at your ability to watch this kind of tripe (even though it's obviously your job). FN just makes me nauseous every time I tune in for more than a minute or so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterbakernyt Oh I think you are gravely underestimating the amount of dark matter that is hidden from the public that will soon be oozing out.  Lots and lots of impeachable offenses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasie Totally heart-breaking, but beyond thoughts and prayers.  The GOP-NRA cable over congress has got to be called out and stopped from enabling mass killing in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpolitics Da!  Now is time to get rid of all silly sanctions on Crimea invasion and meddling in elections. Fat puppet-Trmp is doing fine job of now implementing Putins policies!  Heresho!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaurenWern Rosenstein was accepted by 'resistance-folk'; someone DT has bullied, but somehow stood up for truth, justice, etc. Hence, JD strives to make this APPEAR to be bipartisan.

<|startoftext|>@JoeConchaTV Will the full report have been made available by then?

<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 A slight nuance: beyond the white supremacy, the 50's were a time of economic opportunity in US. The "American Dream" was obtainable, houses &amp; eduction affordable, unions &amp; middle class strong; GI bill benefits, etc. Of course maga-folk ignore that R's (esp. Reagan) killed that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have never given away anything that you did not take HUGE credit for.  Usually you are donating other peoples money that you take charitable deductions for.  You make way more than this just going to #maraLardASS on weekends on US taxpayer $.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmurraypolitics @NBCFirstRead DjT is causing destabilization of the entire world politic, but NBC is pushing the angle that DPRK summit is a win for the prez, because he offers love and kisses to KJU (ruthless/killer dictator who improsons 100k's in work camps) in return for tamping 'dotard' rhetoric?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump DURING the part that "YOU" are featured on the great 4th of July holiday, most Americans will be completely TUNING YOU OUT, in favor of doing something truly patriotic, like PROTESTING the invasion of corrupt Russian puppets into the US government! #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope012015 Collins is sinking in Maine and desperately need to show independence from DjT. McConnell'l let her vote 'yes' on this anti-trmp bill as it is really just a show vote - bill won't be able to sustain the margin needed for veto-override; if it looked close there, she'll vote 'no'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmmaFrostResist Hoping the report/evidence  provides many answers to the central questions of collusion/obstruction - but just in case it is brief / muted, I put much more faith in public hearings that will occur over next several months to pour intense sunlight on the entire Trmp crime org.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife Of course - this is the photo-op that is going to finally nail down that elusive Nobel Peace Prize he 'feels' he so richly deserves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smerconish @CNN Can he call you as a character witness at his sentencing? Oh, silly me, of course he will be exonerated, or at best pay a small fine, then go back to his billionaire country club circuit to be glorified as a victim of over zealous prosecutors trying to make a name for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Wow, such brilliant analysis.  But rest assured that CNN is going to do EVERYTHING in its power to classify Dem's as TOO far left, TOO colorful and TOO nontraditional in order to scare independents and tamp down enthusiasm, as dictated by your corporate overlords.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SykesCharlie @gabeschoenfeld @BulwarkOnline Um, the Mormons are in the process of building a new temple in Moscow since mid 2018.  I don't think you will be seeing Romney p-o Trmp or more importantly, Putin, anytime soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GlennKesslerWP Is he deliberately lying about this, or is he literally that stupid about rudimentary world economics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradMossEsq Sure, some peripheral figures, perhaps. Somehow I don't think the political elites and billionaires involved are going to allow much real sunlight into this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pipybur1 Oh dear, I hope it doesn't totally upstage Trmp's next big photo-op with his paramour 'Chairman Kim'!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @GovKemp So how is the design of your new Chinese "Voting Machines" coming along? Figured out an undetectable executive back-door to ensure desired GOP election results yet? Kemp can help with some ideas on that, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Isn't he liable for slander at some point? Or is this just another of those things that DjT will get away with because the JD has decided to elevate the position of POTUS to 'unassailable king'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker Don't worry. Due to the GOP-tax-scam you and your multi-millionaire cronies pay almost no taxes at all.  The rest of US is burdened with paying your life-long wages from government jobs and subsidies for certain select corporations (socialism for the 1%).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley You are suppose to be informed on such rudimentary stuff, and you probably DO know better.  The investigation was in existence for years before McCabes actions based on multiple points of evidence.  As usual, you are just doing GOP gas lighting for political points. #Traitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paldhous @bri_sacks So is DjT just delusional or incompetent in his directives? Or does he just want to persuade magats he is a dick to CA for the political points he scores?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeMyGod He is going to be much too busy 'splaining' to the world why DjT is initiating war with Iran later this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafetyPinDaily As if FL needs any more political points w/trmpty-dumpty.  He will be sucking up to Floridians like they are porn-stars covered with secret-sauce prior to '20 election (if unfortunately he lasts that long).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsMollyRachael There is so much evidence of conspiracy that is already public info, it will be very disheartening if Mueller report does not go there.  But numerous other congressional investigations and SDNY/FBI investigations will eventually bring down the Trmp crime family, I am certain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 Very hard to read. Many pundits (whose opinions I respect) insist he is honorable and will absolutely 'do right' with Mueller report findings, and that the timing is just circumstantial.  But he has a history of GOP partisan acts as AG and his confirmation hearing was worrisome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE was one of the main offenses NIXON was charged with that lead to his resignation.  Best for you to follow the same path before you find yourself in prison, along with Dotard jr and Jarvanka.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Damn, I was hoping that the plaintiff would at least accumulate a couple hundred thou in legal bills first -- but I suppose his lawyers are working voluntarily anyway - payment to be accepted in the form of judicial appts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There are at least a hundred points of circumstantial evidence that support the fact that you are working DIRECTLY for Putin.  The only evidence that is missing is the recording of your private meeting at Helsinki that you refuse to disclose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He slurred so many words, I'm not sure what he said.  The main consequence of DjT's speech is that he has proven that he is utterly incompetent, largely delusional, and that he compulsively LIES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump "Russia - if your listening..." it would behoove you both to stop trying to OBSTRUCT JUSTICE, and confess to the elaborate conspiracy you had with Vladimir Putin &amp; Saudi prince MbS to undermine US election and many other felonies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Really helps to make the case that you are in on the conspiracy. Enjoying the rubles via generous RU/NRA/GOP donations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shareblue @owillis Must be why he let 'sounds of silence' fill the room for 20 seconds - later WH could overdub thunderous applause for a special DjT viewing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @ChrisRuddyNMX You allowed him to lie quite freely about the origins of Trmp/RU investigation and 'the dossier'.  Very weak and disturbing segment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennycohn1 I have never understood why FB isn't forced to require a bona fide source to be identified on EVERY news-item posting.

<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump That's right!  Unless congress gives you at least $55billion for the fantastic gulf-to-pacific cement border wall conceived by political-clown Roger Stone (and based on NO actual DHS recommendations) you must shut down the US government as directed by Putin, your puppet master.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahkendzior Also, what kills me: while we wait patiently for Mueller, SDNY, etc. to do a robust and complete job in their investigation / possible indictments, or as some say "wait and vote him out to avoid maga-blowback" - DjT/GOP continue to rat-f*** the US creating enormous damage for yrs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peggynoonannyc Words of matronly wisdom from a doomed republican access journalist. The country really needs editorialists like you to remind us of the gross deficit in conservative values that has become the accepted standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst @gillibrandny Hopefully you can help GOP spin DJT into realizing "the wall" is fine and now it's time to move on to lowering prescription drug prices, something Americans really care about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laurie_Garrett karmic co-ink-ee-dink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maziehirono Your last question was brilliant and Rao clearly contradicted herself in her response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78_MissSunshine @realDonaldTrump Nah, he'll save that for next week.  He is too weak to make that kind of probably unconstitutional declaration in front of the full congress. Instead, he'll announce by tweet, if egged on by Coulter or Limbaugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sfpelosi Also, you can bet that by early morning DJT will be back to tweeting his divisive abusive narcissistic little heart out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Perhaps before 2015, when DJT was a voting Democrat, but he decided to run as an "R" because it greatly enhanced his voodoo powers, so, yes.  I'm afraid Republicans now own that evil distinction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricBoehlert Did you notice this -- CBS touted DT's quote maligning Speaker Pelosi in a plug for FTN, not offering even a slight truthfulness qualification or response.  https://t.co/CMk7d6Y1X9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 I would counter that you are definitely 5 hours ahead of Washington. Where I live in California, we are 3 hours behind beltway shenanigans and I barely get a cup of Joe before the daily Trmp-shite-show is in full swing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ And now, he urges GOP to go ALL-IN &amp; bet its future on a maga-rally-chant to build a wall (excluding the Mexico paying part) that was invented by Roger Stone &amp; cohorts. What a great Republican!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericswalwell Lindsay betting the farm on a DT campaign rally-chant made up by Roger Stone &amp; cohorts tells you all you need to know about the 2019 GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltshaub You forgot the part where DT brings a real unicorn to the SOTU as a guest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SherryGlaser @nytopinion @nytimes @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Twitter enables DT with a sickening &amp; unedited bully pulpit to be sure.  But I think the vast majority of folk persuaded by maga propaganda do not engage in twitter;  FB, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesKnight777 "Slower traffic stay right" is not just a suggestion (as it is on US highways).  It is mandatory for survival!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Budz442Bud @SpeakerPelosi Exactly - I will probably watch as much as I can stomach just to watch N.Pelosi in the back; I read that she is going to try to control her reactions (for 'civility sake') but I can't believe she will let him get away with any blatant lies w/o at least a furrowed brow or blink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC Glad this, along with DJT's many other alleged crimes, is finally getting attention from prosecutors.  At this rate, US citizens are definitely going to learn the whole truth about our Kremlin installed POTUS by the end of his second term!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karoli Always amusing when RU surrogates &amp; Kremlin trolls advocate for peace with Putin, presuming appeasement is the most palatable option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich It is amazing the "hate" that this one person engenders.  Why is a movement inspired to hate him - just because he's racist, destroys the environment, cruel to animals, selfish, egotistical &amp; working for Russia to malign the US? It's almost as though he is truly despicable, yes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard Funny, this is the same argument I see on the profiles of numerous RU bots.  I didn't want to buy into the idea that you are Putin-asset just looking to be a Dem' primary spoiler -- but you are making it very difficult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow Serious question: If by '21, the D's regain control of the Senate &amp; WH, can tax policy be effectively changed to at least "up" corp. tax rates, or have R's sabotaged the lawmaking process sufficiently to prevent that from happening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donald_j_putin AC is extremely frustrated that T is not getting his giant imaginary wall-penis UP even after stroking it with 35 days of national agony. She's just urging him, in her sweet-shrill way, to take a national-emergency-viagra, destroy the environment &amp; deliver her tired ol' V an ogsm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Peek out of your entitled multi-millionaire bubble a little more often.  If you were to fully observe the disgusting excess of your class vis-a-vis the struggles of most Americans to eek out a living, you would definitely be trying to re-animate Karl Marx!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaceTheNation @SpeakerPelosi @margbrennan @realDonaldTrump Soft ball interview.  FTN lets DJT get away with evasive answers, then packages it all up to make him look authoritative &amp; presidential. Finally, you put it our with a tweet where POTUS is accusing Speaker Pelosi of deplorable crimes, with NO Qualification that he is LYING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Amazing how his 'good genes' stop the robust orange-ness just around his eyes so as to give them each a fish-belly white halo. Truly a miracle of nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom @RalphNortham Wonderful, altruistic tweet - I'll say just one slight problem: If Northram were Republican, GOP would be huddled about protecting him at all costs, and DJT would be considering him as new COS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Sycophant yields ALL Senate Judiciary power to dear-leader, despite the fact that DJT's wall is a total farce, and his leadership is directed by the Kremlin. WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@woodman267 @JuliaDavisNews Its been recently reported it is Not dad, but a business partner re: Trmp Tower-Moscova.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshNBCNews Sanctions - of course those are always reversed for Vladdaddy anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterdaou Easy - that means you just wear it inside-out and upside-down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Cool! So now we can divert another few hundred billion in taxpayer dollars to new nuclear weapons, thus ending any hope for actual infrastructure improvements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Of course! Everyone knows he just took the elevator up one flight to brief you about it, the day before you ANNOUNCED BIG NEWS COMING against HRC.  Silly media/DEMs!  #TrumpRussia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RF_P0TUS TG they don't list mental-impairment, or I could never honestly tweet about DJT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports This is outrageous! If Saudi does not return these suspects, The US must denounce and sanction at the highest levels!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr So to sum up your 4 tweet diatribe against enhancing VOTING rights, you/GOP are SCARED TO DEATH of a real democracy because YOU WILL LOSE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouDobbs @FredFleitz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Absolutely ludicrous!  You know perfectly well that POTUS is espousing theories that are baseless in fact and surely sourced from the Kremlin. It is essential that TRUTH is told by Intelligence agencies. GTH Dobbs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlaineBershad A circle jerk of contradiction, conflating 1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd person perspective, wrapped up neatly to disinform.  Amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jules_su Dem's need to focus more on 'Crime' - the GOP is getting way ahead in this area!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ndrew_lawrence Don't worry, the rest of the msmedia will also follow suit to frame ANY progressive ideas as "extremist-left" and declare there is no way they will be accepted by Americans, no matter how popular they actually are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi Are ALL people from Florida totally deranged, or is it something particular to you Rep. Gertz?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDanB95 @mkraju Since the Mormons started building a temple in Moscow last year, ol' Mitt has greatly tempered his stance on Russia, and especially his criticism of Vladdaddy's puppet (DJT).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Somewhat sane 'John Baron Trmp' tries to obfuscate 'the wall' premise to make it sellable to red-hats (if it ends-up mostly fence and drones). But then alternative personality 'campaign-racist Trmp' comes out when evoked by Coulter&amp;friends to supersede his own con-job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr So looking forward to your indictment! The SNL 'cold open' on that week will be epic -- you can "bank" some of your laundered rubles in your phunny S&amp;L on that for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardSchultz @WSJ I have heard so much "poor abused H. Schulz - Dem's are being mean to him" in last 4 days.  What I haven't heard is a single substantive campaign position on anything of importance to American people. Clearly this is a vanity project. PASS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC So you are getting your cues from Fox-TV too now? Why don't you do your job and investigate Russian influence in the NRA and the GOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 72f - Palm Springs CA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED -- (almost?)"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahPalinUSA Funny how "losers" (look in mirror) seem to think they are still relevant in the world.  Some even go to the WH with OTHER celebrity racists to meet with the RU installed president! (look in mirror)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBarri To which the Kremlin promptly replied, "yeh - NYET, Putin will meet w/Trmp" in Argentina.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe @HowardSchultz Oh Boy! Is this gonna be where you and @morningmika  fellate life into a celebrity billionaire candidacy just like you did for DJTrmp in 2015?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @DepSecDef Meanwhile, back in the USSR, you are applauded for your continuing OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE in not naming GOP members to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  Harasho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateofLate8 @RepDLesko I'll volunteer an answer since you can be sure Debbie won't. She wants to keep Republicans in power at all costs, and knows that if US citizens are really allowed to vote, GOP will LOSE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDLesko I know, DEMOCRACY is so annoying.  It works much better for the GOP when elections are gerrymandered, votes are suppressed or outright stolen by foreign interests to insure the 'R's  &amp; oligarchs stay in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod smite him up!   smite him up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aqualus ok - I think I am 'certifiably insane' after trying to figure out the test results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daniel_barker Not to mention the financial institutions/individuals that made tens of billions off of 'credit default swaps' that were manufactured by wall street &amp; caused the ultimate financial collapse in '08 requiring taxpayer bail-out.  Certainly this money shouldn't be taxed much at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheriJacobus Had to look up tweet as apparently I am muted by this entity though I don't ever remember interacting at all.  Sweet - I guess I'm on an enemies list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danagould He does sometimes - say "the wall" is built or being built -- but I suspect that there's something much more nefarious in his adamant demand for $5.7billion, as in "follow the money" to probable construction co. boondoggles he has planned (or already committed to).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardSchultz It seems that you are a better candidate for a new congressional "Un-American Activities Committee".  Good luck denigrating real popular causes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdickerson Odd, you mean DJT is caught in a prevarication? Also, it is Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelglassner So he stated a bunch of true facts you didn't want disclosed, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyschwartz Possible he is just ignorant, but more likely it is literal gas-lighting on behalf his (&amp; Vladaddy's) personal interests in fossil fuel investments &amp; energy corp. donors.<|endoftext|>

Thanks a lot @CBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frenchy2460 "Ha ha - people freezing! Global warming is a hoax, like the RU witch hunt" - quips the warlock-in-chief protector of the fossil fuel industry as he checks on his quarterly coal &amp; gas co. dividends and campaign contributions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pauljimerson It's a FL Wright original<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveRattner I'm sure this is just astounding to @SenMajLdr McConnell &amp; Paul Ryan.

<|startoftext|>@JulieBanderas @realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner Welcome to the big wide world of "enemies of the people" -- though the people in question are about 15% of the population (red-hats) that are extremely low information viewers of fox-news. ALL y'all better wake up and smell the white-russians you are serving!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Another total crock of BS from GOP, sponsors of the maga-rich american oligarchy, who were also CREATORs of the '08 Crash, and then greatly profited from the bail-out.  ALL the money goes up to the top in the gop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Can't wait to see BLOTUS out there digging post-holes. Maybe, with the help of a few magats, he can get a few hundred feet done before he is impeached.  That will be all of his new wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Congress does not pass multi-billion $ appropriations for a vague campaign rally-notion.  Put a REAL PLAN for border security/barriers on the table; debate and improve plan in committees. Do an environmental impact study - then we can talk. (This is how gov't works, btw)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Great idea! You and Trmpty-Dumpty could actually RESEARCH and SPECIFY sound border security infrastructure, and put into a BILL, rather than demanding $6billion for a campaign-rally-punchline!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidBrodyCBN @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Problem with Trmp playing chess? He can only think one move ahead, and he usually forgets that move because his adderall wears off and he has to watch Hannity on his DVR before his Fox'n'friends come on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi The country does not need a speech from a belligerent man-baby. The country needs to be open for business. The country needs to evict the Russian assets that are deliberately destroying it from the inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The American people are anxiously awaiting the speech from DjT when he humbly resigns as POTUS.  His reckless mishandling of US security around the world has had disastrous consequences. Time for him and all GOP-Russian assets to step down and/or be indicted for treason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Sad day indeed!  Trump has single handedly closed the US government to protect himself from investigation and further the interests of Putin.

<|startoftext|>@sarahkendzior I'm afraid a more cynical but unfortunately true evaluation done by GOP Sen's is that they are at greater peril of getting a right-flank primary challenger if they vote against the Trmpenfuror, as opposed to election defeat by Dem's in the general.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justDooDirty @JimVandeHei @GOP @senatemajldr Right; look at what a huge impact public opinion/polls have had on sensible fire-arm regulations over the decades. (vast majority support / ZERO impact).  It's all about DONOR money, and fear of potential primary challenges.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder There is still a little matter re: Khashoggi's murder; Erdogan threatened to release evidence (before DT announced Syria w/d).

<|startoftext|>@Helenhs @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @MittRomney @SenTedCruz @RonJohnsonWI @SenatorBurr @SenJohnThune @SenatorRomney I had heard it on some cable news show recently, so I "googled" it this a.m.- it's real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanSarandon @nytimes I see you reflected in every caged child's eye's in the border camps.  YOU are a blight on progressive politics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenhs @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @MittRomney @SenTedCruz @RonJohnsonWI @SenatorBurr @SenJohnThune Apparently the Mormon's are in process of building a new temple in Moscova which seems to be altering @SenatorRomney's "hard-line" stance on RU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historylvrsclub I'm old enough to remember when the idea of tearing down walls was considered a step forward for civilization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Stop deliberately being an A-hole. Border security will not be fixed by a ginormous continuous wall that Trmp&amp;campaign dreamt up as a campaign slogan.  What are the specifications for this $5.7billion boondoggle? There are none! #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quincyooo @AaronBlake The subject is Barr's report.  Try to keep track of who you are trying to disparage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quincyooo @AaronBlake Sure.  Can't wait to see his summary: "Nothing to see here folks, move along".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake Incredible. Seasoned Dem. politicians and pundits keep urging caution before impeachment; "wait for Mueller report", etc.  So after 2(+?) years of Trmp/GOP devastating the US for the benefit of US &amp; RU oligarchs, we may not get ANY real info on what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crewislife @mmfa THE fnfs also were advocating for the US withdrawal from NATO this a.m. Coordinating talking points w/Trmp &amp; Vladdaddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney Thank you Mitt, for revealing your fealty to corrupt GOP and Vladimir Putin with your RU-sanction reversal vote. For a NY-minute I had thought you might represent hope for a Republican party that desperately needs new leadership and a commitment to American interests. WRONG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli Hey, I'm sticking with my RU-colludophobia! Don't @ me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seth_hettena Hard to believe Jarvanka will pass on another swanky state-paid vacay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Let me just give you a clear brief SoU li'l Ron: The state of the union is 'CHAOS', it is suspected that the POTUS is a Russian Asset determined to spread discord both in the US and abroad. DT, with a complicit GOP, is determined to do the bidding of Putin and diminish US. SAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich Here is the SoU for you Newt: The US is in a state of chaos due to the installation of a Russian asset as POTUS. The GOP is assisting this man dismantle important government functions and world leadership role. DT is doing everything possible to stoke division and racism. SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonMaloy "... a long time ago".  2016 is soooo early 21st century! Time to move into the roaring 20's where history can be repeated again with no regrets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAtlantic @NatashaBertrand Yes it was really reassuring that he pushed back on Trmp, stating that he wanted Mueller to finish, and it's not a witch-hunt. The fact that he stated he wouldn't recuse if recommended by FBI ethics, and won't necessarily release ANY of the Mueller Report? Not so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenvogel Special shout out to @SenatorRomney, Mr. Tuff-on-Russia, for going along with the new GOP-RUSSIA caucus.  Harasho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@99joemal But he seems so pleasant, somber &amp; professional as he declares that he will ignore any ethics advice re: recusal from Trmp/RU investigations, and that he will circumvent unpleasant Mueller findings by leaving out of his own final report.  What could go wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney @SnowCollege SO - Mr. Tough-on-Russia has turned into another Putin bitch-boy.  Are you now going to introduce a Senate resolution to withdraw from NATO? Perhaps the US should just seek to become part of reconfigured USSR?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahrren If only! - when this day happens, America will truly be great again (after cleaning up the slimy swamp stank DJT has spread all over the place).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politiCOHEN_ Lost in the cray-cray from several months ago -- didn't GSA alter plans for new FBI building because DJT ORDERED them to not disrupt his little corner of the DC hotel district?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity It is clear to any sane observer that Russians have compromised Trump and he is doing Putin's bidding. All y'all who keep denying this are obviously involved in the conspiracy. Just keep on keeping on, see ya in the big-house. #TrumpRussia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heatherscope @GOPLeader Gee - how could anything about Trmp's tantrum gov't shutdown be political?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWalker Imagine if multi-millionaires reaped the rewards of civil society &amp; paid NO taxes, BUT where hard working folk worked multiple jobs, paid 35% taxes, and gov't kept cutting back benefits and services; -- oh, no imagination required, that's the current system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karoli @crooksandliars I tried watching live but got nauseous hearing GOP Senators drone on and on about Barr's indisputable bonafides. Decided to DVR so I can later watch and fast-forward thru the BS and watch only the salient questions (most all from Dem's, no doubt).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WOW! You PAID?  This must be the first time in years that you gave anybody something rather than stealing money from charitable causes, or costing taxpayers million$ for your Merda-lardo golf trips! #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LIES 9,10, and 11 for the day. #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LIES 6, 7, and 8 for the day. #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsFlo Why are Progressive Ad characters always dressed like Butchers? Is there some aspect of the 'insurance business' you are trying to reveal with this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins The compromise is to get treasonous @senatemajldr to bring already approved House bills to the Senate floor!  #TrumpShutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeDelMoro Fantastic! To ensure this will happen, he just needs to recuse himself from the RU/Trmp investigation(s), then his confirmation should be a shoo-in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KasieDC @MittRomney @kasie Wow, for a NY minute, I thought Romney was heading for true leadership status in the broken GOP -- how quickly he has become another sniveling sycophant for Russian-Asset-1 in the WH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe, sometime, just for once, consult with some actual military strategists rather than just taking marching orders from Putin or Hannity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@towner_terri That's nice.  Now all he has to do is assure the Senate, IN PUBLIC, that he will recuse himself from the RU/Trmp investigation(s) and he is a shoo-in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju Frigging @JudgeJeanine should be charged for a crime for being complicit in this obvious attempt at witness tampering!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myserenity69 @realDonaldTrump Spray on some cheeto-dust and it could pass for a photo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Tough talk on King.  Now you might want to take a look at the racist-in-chief, DJT.  Not only does he invoke white-supramicist language and policy on a daily basis, but he is a frigging Russian Asset destroying the US!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigRozniecki Trmp stating that he had a 'great conversation' with Vlad-daddy is totally reassuring. If Puti was happy, DT promised something pro-RU-oligarch and anti-American interests for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chucktodd @SenTedCruz #MTP hasn't aired yet on left-coast. I HOPE you interviewed Cruz extensively on eminent domain issues. Probably the only thing that Texas voters really need his opinions about.  Is he fine with all the Rio Grande adjacent landowners being victimized for stupid campaign wall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenRonJohnson Great performance on @jaketapper lying and obfuscating for Trmp-regime re: Russia.  It has become very clear that YOU are a key participant in the CONSPIRACY to undermine US democracy w/ hostile foreign government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJoniErnst You can make a clear statement that you do not support racism by joining Senators willing to re-open government w/o funding Trmp's RACIST WALL.  Trmp-regime immigration policy is totally racist and killing children!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Based on your constant support of fascism and racism, you know in your heart that you have totally abandoned the guidance of JC.  Your fealty to DJT will weigh heavily on your goal to enter the kingdom of heaven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile To the casual observer, THIS HAS ALL BEEN OBVIOUS for YEARS! I know the 'wheels of justice' turn slowly, but this RU asset has been sabotaging US gov't and foreign engagements for 2 years now. Just long enough to enable US plutocracy to cement its reign thru tax-policy &amp; courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olgaNYC1211 Since Russia keeps redefining (expanding) what it thinks its borders are, this should be interesting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neeratanden @RoseAnnDeMoro Each time I see this kind of @BernieSanders campaign BS, I am reminded of how much of a weight it added to assist the gropenfuror in stealing presidency. At this point, as much as I admire his political ides, his POLITICS are toxic - I will not likely vote for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSerwer Apparently he was distracted, when snorting some meth, and forgot the clause about illegal drug entry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorDurbin @senatemajldr Is just trying to protect  POTUS from doing 'veto' which will 100% lay fault at his own feet for shutdown.  He is protecting his power-broker at the expense of US government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAndyHarrisMD Banks don't take kindly to "eventual" payments.  Are you going to personally write letters to correct all the credit report downgrades? Is it really worth causing a US recession over a stupid campaign slogan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbydphillip Technically, if this is the exact quote, he rehabilitated his lie with the use of a double negative ("I didn't know...nothing about it"), ... the defense rests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump YOU have the power to end the shutdown - join other GOP Senators in telling McConnell to bring bills to the floor, and stop being a sycophant to the gropenfuror!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janellj86 @SenJohnKennedy It's all propaganda (trmpoganda?).  Republicans are not interested in anything but defending DJT's dimwit rally catchphrases to protect their power.  They have no interest in sound governance of US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler US Taxpayers: $30-100,000,000,000 for full steel southern border wall Coyotes/wall breachers:  $159.99 for cordless recipro saw.  problem solved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang Also, sometime recently, Dem's "told him" they want the wall to be 'steel slats' - a talking point he has repeated several times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AoDespair If Trmp has his way and $30-100 billion in taxpayer funds are spent building this wall (devastating environment along the way) the fact that it can all be easily breached for less than a hundred dollars worth with of recipro-saw blades is definitely a spit-take!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_youhadonejob1 Gee, I thought the great gift of JC and the whole new-covenant thing was about repairing the public relations disaster of Old testaments' vengeful God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sensiablue Q: Are these lawyers enlisted at tax-payer expense? Not sure whether to be psyched or outraged by this news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOVTWINE killer! (I mean in the good way)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar @PressSec So Sarah just endorsed adding 3500 miles of steel slats across northern border w/Canada, and another 1000 mi along Alaska/Canada border? Apparently that's where the greatest number of would-be terrorists might immigrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju Wow, nice way for @MittRomney to smooch orange-julius arse while hinting he might vote to open gov't. Such bravado!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson @SenatorLankford Nothing to see hear folks - collusion is a delusion just like alt-facts-girl-friday Conway claims.  What campaign chairman HASn't shared it's internal polling data with the RU-GRU - happens all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Glad to hear that comrade Veselnitskaya (RU adoption facilitator) is getting indicted, also!  How many other folks from your June 9th '16 meeting will get this honor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbremmer Fully agree, ironically, it still rates as the WORST Oval Office Address in history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 (s/b Jan 8?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Disingenuous BS, as usual.  YOU are totally complicit in this unjustified shut down caused by Baby-Trmp's tantrums about failed campaign promises. YOU COULD HAVE passed border wall legislation last year with total GOP control - but - did NOT. #NoWallNoCompromise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WORST OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS EVER! #NoWall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeTravis Fox-noise folk luv to wring-up opposition to Dem's, so this will present plenty of fodder for evening pundits to try to skewer the response. Deal!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Bill O'Bill, it must be so frustrating to you not to get to participate in the full-on Trmp-TV propaganda campaign, along side the master of public disinformation, DJT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KattyKayBBC @RichardHaass Meanwhile, it would be helpful to get a reading of the original phone-call "agreement" made between Erdogan and Trmp that led to original Syria withdrawal announcement 'tweet'.  What was this bargain about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecNielsen I suggest that congress make it a crime for cabinet secretaries to deliberate spread disinformation &amp; blatant LIES to the American people. Motivation for you to cease and desist your persistent prevarication.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KassandraSeven Oops, time for Trmp to expand border wall requirement to include 3500 mi along Canada. Looks like we will need Russian steel to accomplish it all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neeratanden I expect the deliberation went something like: "Should we forgo all that ad revenue for the prez to pontificate?" "Sure, why not; we already gave him billions in free air-time in last 3 yrs" "Well, he is the leader of the enhanced US plutocracy our corporation is beholding to"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccaballhaus @JBFlint Deliberation: "Should we forgo all that ad revenue for the prez. to pontificate?" "Sure, why not; we already gave him billions in free air-time in last 3 yrs" "Well, he is the father of the enhanced US plutocracy our corporation is so thankful for"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MauDebbieWilli1 @TeamPelosi Also, I thought Trmp had declared all gov't employees had to forgo this years big 2.7% cost of living raise (cause gov't is broke) -- but his political appointees get a $10k raise????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samstein I'm sure that once he shows the nation exactly what steel fencing is, and how effective it is for stopping ALL illegal entry to US, we will finally come to appreciate the magnitude of this grift of taxpayer $ he is trying to pull off with some RU steel magnate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Hopefully he will be wearing his Tariff-man costume to protect him from thousands of terrorists that might come in though any number of nearby airports or seaports!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @kasie McConnell could get the same message out by just putting bills on floor, letting them get passed, and then letting Trmp veto -- but he is protecting Trmp from himself because it would then be clear to ALL Trmp is the problem -- no cross blaming Pelosi.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GrahamCLester Great analogy, but means if he is impeached, or 'expires' in any way, he will become even more famous and exalted -- oh boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaShanneStokes The fact is that Trmp can not complete one sentence w/o adding some kind of falsehood to it - then he usually repeats it for effect. I doubt Mueller/GrandJury will care that much about those kind of lies - just the lies where he prevaricates about his (probably) treasonous acts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Once again, the Hill "dishonors" the country by quoting absolutely inane and hypocritical words from the president as if it's real news.  Every time you present this dangerous psychopath's opinions, you are demeaning and degrading the entire US gov't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Karma_Incarnate During the few minutes of big press conf. that I could stomach watching, I marveled at how Trmp kept redefining what the fence might be, what it could be made of, and other completely abstract notions about it -- but exactly $5.7billion MUST BE ALLOCATED NOW!<|endoftext|>
