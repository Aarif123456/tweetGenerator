<|startoftext|>@Opus_Energy @BorisJohnson Yes the owner had been on phone all day trying to sort it, customer service is shocking and they have the calls recorded.

<|startoftext|>@DHSCgovuk @DailyMailUK Isn‚Äôt it true t Freedom of information request from the department of health couldn‚Äôt confirm that you have  on record any proof Covid-19 exist ? @DHSCgovuk  Not isolated it.

<|startoftext|>@sweenaldo79 Get stuck in to the police ? That‚Äôs what they want every week, no one has been arrested for a criminal offence that will stand in court. They are pushing people for this. The footage should give some justice there is not much people can do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallifraxYT Today it wasn‚Äôt and the propel haven‚Äôt changed their way since the first week, the police have dramatically.  It not an anti mask protest either. It‚Äôs about freedom, unlawful, lockdowns, the right to work and lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallifraxYT He‚Äôs was marching like the rest, no coincidence the one throwing punches has his badge numbers covered. I was driving past today with kids at the start and they was out for trouble in the past it has been peaceful and families there as well having a peaceful walk through city<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself, fear isn‚Äôt good for immune system. Take care, get some fresh air, natural light and a good diet üí™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius Vermin, everybody has a story and a reason, shouldn‚Äôt judge. Sure you wouldn‚Äôt like to be judged ? People people have their own history and experiences and reasoning, a lot of older people there, families, Ex police, veterans, NHS I have spoke to many over past months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself then, immune system is the first thing you need to worry about not groups of people or humanity, all illnesses are dangerous, I got rushed in with serious Case of quinsy because couldn‚Äôt get doc appointment and antibiotics all they wanted me to do was isolate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself then, immune system is the first ting you need to worry about not groups of people or humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews You class them as Vermin you are entitled to your free speech and opinion maybe they have reasons why they are protesting like they care about their freedom and children‚Äôs futures. I know NHS staff who have attended many protests now in Liverpool, London and Manchester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews This is if we are going off numbers and data ? Which seems you are because other than the numbers you are hearing on news there has still be no proof they have even isolated COVID-19 this can be found in freedom of information requests from department of health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews There is no data, protests have been going for over 2 months and no data has proved spread. The numbers are going down in Liverpool.  They have mass tested quarter of city and less than 1 percent positive so looking at them numbers 0.5 percent attend a protest pretty low risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the ones with caps and badge numbers covered are the ones you send with orders of brutality @MerseyPolice ? @LivEchonews  @RadioCityNews #Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Notice the one throwing punches has his badge number covered ? They are the ones sent with orders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Not true because I and many others have walked through the city each week with kids and many other people of all ages with family have and I don‚Äôt see anyone causing trouble.

<|startoftext|>@helldoon @LivEchonews Great turnout  6 weeks there has been protests for and cases going down in city. So no data to say they do any harm hey.  Just like the London ones that got accused they would spread the virus ü§î<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@100Dianne @simondolan Until everyone wakes up to the PCR TEST.  Nothing else need to be spoke about.  inaccurate test = inaccurate data = inaccurate decisions   Understand how a PCR Test works 1st   https://t.co/jeX34HAmSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Dianne @simondolan Why do people debates on here without actually doing their own research, then common sense, what is a case ? The main thing, we are going off a PCR test. The inventor stated is not fit to test for virus. So if an inventor of a plane said it‚Äôs not fit to fly would you fly on it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I know we are keen to know more about some of the people you prefer to mix with. Fancy talking about these ? bet yous have some story‚Äôs üçï  https://t.co/8VrWhH6nR2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool However he has gained some exposure and voice from many others. He is clearly passionate about what he does and is speaking form his soul.

<|startoftext|>@This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool All the negative comments, like this video won‚Äôt get noticed, he‚Äôs clearly grabbed some attention here, over 300k views and over million on IG and Facebook, so let‚Äôs be honest @RishiSunak and the rest don‚Äôt take notice of anyone on here and probably never even see their own post<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btrftg @This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool He does his own and has a big following<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmakennytv Well said Emma  And why any person in the world disagree with you, lead‚Äôs to think only one thing, as we know. There is an agenda and it‚Äôs that simple. So we are banging heads against walls.  All we can do is wake more people up and hope they don‚Äôt live in fear<|endoftext|>
