<|startoftext|>@Opus_Energy @BorisJohnson It’s being dealt with legally now and you will be getting hit for loss of earnings, distress, breach of contract.

<|startoftext|>@Opus_Energy @BorisJohnson going to the papers with this, on phone all day back and forward and bills are even fabricated now, getting charged for us of electric when the shop was closed for 3 months.  She has offered to make payment today and they would sooner let her suffer and no be able to operate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Opus_Energy @BorisJohnson Yes the owner had been on phone all day trying to sort it, customer service is shocking and they have the calls recorded. Couldn’t wait to disconnect her and she has 4 witnesses who seen her offer to make payment. Now she has to pay the extra connection fee, good as a scam.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IWTheDarkPrince @SkyNews They not sort they know what they are doing, they give scraps then when they say there is a spike in January they blame us then use the business to control. Mass testing and vaccine push.  That’s why letting people into stadiums<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KnockerClarke @McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews According to the same data they are locking us down with, not having it both ways. If the data works is right then follow it, if it’s not right then we should be locked down in first places less than 1 percent of a quarter of city have tested positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DHSCgovuk @DailyMailUK Isn’t it true t Freedom of information request from the department of health couldn’t confirm that you have  on record any proof Covid-19 exist ? @DHSCgovuk  Not isolated it.  And also couldn’t provide any proof that the PCR test can detect it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nige_withabeard @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews What’s with covering the badge numbers ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Haha comical let’s see then  Biden is finished  Don’t be so naive and listen to MSM  There are many people trying to strike deals to not go to jail now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Them rules make sense as well  My daughter who’s 3 has to isolate as her teacher testers positive but her mum who work in a nursing home, myself works with Education and her brother who’s goes to the same school can crack on  Makes sense, so how does that work 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BLOG7O7LOL @McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweenaldo79 Get stuck in to the police ? That’s what they want every week, no one has been arrested for a criminal offence that will stand in court. They are pushing people for this. The footage should give some justice there is not much people can do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallifraxYT Today it wasn’t and the propel haven’t changed their way since the first week, the police have dramatically.  It not an anti mask protest either. It’s about freedom, unlawful, lockdowns, the right to work and lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallifraxYT He’s was marching like the rest, no coincidence the one throwing punches has his badge numbers covered. I was driving past today with kids at the start and they was out for trouble in the past it has been peaceful and families there as well having a peaceful walk through city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/zko8kMDZ4Y<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius Mine to take care 💪🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself, fear isn’t good for immune system. Take care, get some fresh air, natural light and a good diet 💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius Vermin, everybody has a story and a reason, shouldn’t judge. Sure you wouldn’t like to be judged ? People people have their own history and experiences and reasoning, a lot of older people there, families, Ex police, veterans, NHS I have spoke to many over past months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself then, immune system is the first thing you need to worry about not groups of people or humanity, all illnesses are dangerous, I got rushed in with serious Case of quinsy because couldn’t get doc appointment and antibiotics all they wanted me to do was isolate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Look after yourself then, immune system is the first ting you need to worry about not groups of people or humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews You class them as Vermin you are entitled to your free speech and opinion maybe they have reasons why they are protesting like they care about their freedom and children’s futures. I know NHS staff who have attended many protests now in Liverpool, London and Manchester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews This is if we are going off numbers and data ? Which seems you are because other than the numbers you are hearing on news there has still be no proof they have even isolated COVID-19 this can be found in freedom of information requests from department of health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews There is no data, protests have been going for over 2 months and no data has proved spread. The numbers are going down in Liverpool.  They have mass tested quarter of city and less than 1 percent positive so looking at them numbers 0.5 percent attend a protest pretty low risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the ones with caps and badge numbers covered are the ones you send with orders of brutality @MerseyPolice ? @LivEchonews  @RadioCityNews #Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Notice the one throwing punches has his badge number covered ? They are the ones sent with orders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McgrathSicarius @MerseyPolice @LivEchonews Not true because I and many others have walked through the city each week with kids and many other people of all ages with family have and I don’t see anyone causing trouble.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelYeadon3 @cheesetwist998 Give them a travel passport save money on vaccines and less change of any risk from side affects.  One would think that could be a solution.  Mass test with antibody test 🤔  Reality is they dnt want solutions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helldoon @LivEchonews Great turnout  6 weeks there has been protests for and cases going down in city. So no data to say they do any harm hey.  Just like the London ones that got accused they would spread the virus 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBernician He’s trying, probably more than anyone else is. Give him a break, yes it’s a long shot.

<|startoftext|>@cazfisher @emmakennytv Come on, surely not still asleep 💤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local community deprived of facility’s and think it will be just 4 weeks Oval closed for 90 percent of the year for very little testing activity.  It’s a shame it’s come to this and we are losing everything and no one will stand up. Sad times they be Allcock losing down next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WirralCouncil Some help yous have done for our community, local children and education. They have been deprived of facilities for 90 percent of the year, the oval wrote off for how long. Pretty sure you said was reopening track last week. When is someone going to actually stand up for us all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan disgusting, shouting at guests on TV for supporting @POTUS not letting them speak and you can sit their using reference “I know Donald Trump well”  Like the public shall listen to you. You also know Epstein well, any opinion on him ? No wonder your supporting Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WirralCouncil  ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WirralCouncil will bidston Astro turf pitches be closed. We use these facilities during the day for education purposes for 16-19 year old full-time football academy students ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson No doubt London be out first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Dianne @simondolan Until everyone wakes up to the PCR TEST.  Nothing else need to be spoke about.  inaccurate test = inaccurate data = inaccurate decisions   Understand how a PCR Test works 1st   https://t.co/jeX34HAmSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Dianne @simondolan Why do people debates on here without actually doing their own research, then common sense, what is a case ? The main thing, we are going off a PCR test. The inventor stated is not fit to test for virus. So if an inventor of a plane said it’s not fit to fly would you fly on it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I know we are keen to know more about some of the people you prefer to mix with. Fancy talking about these ? bet yous have some story’s 🍕  https://t.co/8VrWhH6nR2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniofOxford @OxfordPhysics This is the ransom for the business to get back to normal, so they become the puppets controlling the public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMalley16 @LE_ROCROC They’re all bent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simondolan It’s bigger than the government no court going to back us, it can only be won in person on the streets together with the same plan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>London going into Tier 2  Good few weeks behind the North  So if this all works @BorisJohnson @MattHancock that means   Liverpool should be out of Lockdown first before London 🤔  Let’s see the science and numbers work now then hey 🎪 #coronavirusuk #tier3 #tier2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simondolan @BorisJohnson @MattHancock Representing *<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simondolan Keep asking same question ? Who is repressing them ? Who actually is it who you are against ? Have you had any particular name dealing with their side ? Or just lawyers   Curious if @BorisJohnson @MattHancock etc even know or have any fear or opinion on this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simondolan And natural respiratory deaths are at all time low down a few 100 a week, wonder where they are going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuwMerriman @BorisJohnson shove your rule of 6 up your arse Boris . 666 👿  Your ok going grousing with 30   Not happening you’ve lost us all now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeOhweII @emmakennytv For sure  We are pissing in the wind. @BorisJohnson and @MattHancock are in someone’s pocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moolie61 @emmakennytv No chance, it’s not up to government now. People bigger controlling this and they will get what they want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Agenda you said it @BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool However he has gained some exposure and voice from many others. He is clearly passionate about what he does and is speaking form his soul. Before the negative comments maybe think about his point and if you agree that musicians need to get another trade then comment your thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool All the negative comments, like this video won’t get noticed, he’s clearly grabbed some attention here, over 300k views and over million on IG and Facebook, so let’s be honest @RishiSunak and the rest don’t take notice of anyone on here and probably never even see their own post<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btrftg @This_Feeling @RishiSunak @thoserats @cavernliverpool He does his own and has a big following<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmakennytv Well said Emma  And why any person in the world disagree with you, lead’s to think only one thing, as we know. There is an agenda and it’s that simple. So we are banging heads against walls.  All we can do is wake more people up and hope they don’t live in fear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simondolan @simondolan can you tell us ? Who are you personally up in court against ?  Who is responsible and speaking from their side ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson You be building new jails soon for you and the firm    https://t.co/9QrVgf0MeM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson You haven’t got a clue, we can get no momentum on our college programmes because of your pathetic PCR tests.   If the students keep getting tested, there will be positives for months and we keep having isolate. So don’t make out you care.   Jail for you    https://t.co/9QrVgf0MeM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yogica12 @DesmondSwayne Hahhahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan So I won’t be wearing a mask again unfortunately, quinsy is life threatening also and in the current climate where it is difficult to get the right care and medication I would warn people to take care while wearing a mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan Wore a mask for the 1st day the rule come out on the Friday, had sore throat the Monday.  Couldn’t get doc appointment, By the following Saturday I was rushed to hospital and on IV drip with quinsy for 3 Days. Doctors told me good chance a bacteria infection off mask caused it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITVNewsPolitics Did he just say common sense is the greatest tool we are following ? Hahaha How can our country be reassured with the clown 🤡 running the pantomime @BorisJohnson  #itv #bbc #COVID19 #CoronavirusAct #london #liverpool #Manchester #newcastle #northeastlockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Your in deep Boris We know it’s not you making these decisions, someone’s got you by the balls. Not sure what you have done or they have on you but your the chosen one now, however you and @BillGates make me sick with today’s live letter blatantly boasting murder to the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Hahah embarrassing  The person who runs the country is forgetting how important the rules are himself and getting mixed up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson What online ? and for what jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirDodgerRoyal @StevenJGPerez @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @GMB @TheDelticGroup @ArronMellors @petermarks100 Meanwhile government encouraging people to eat out to help out. OK THEN 👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarryPas @charliehtweets Probably of wearing masks that don’t work and being under house arrest.  You really think this is about saving people ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hypocrisy -  They do what they want when it suits. Plenty more examples out there. Does it not alarm people ?  #TrafalgarSquare #London #BorisOut #boris #COVID19 #FakeNews #TrumpTaxReturns #MondayMorning @BorisJohnson @SadiqKhan  https://t.co/zRsepLLHUX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funny isn’t it police stop because of social distancing ? which allegedly prevents spreading an infection that affects the elderly, meanwhile they are throwing a 70 year old lady on the floor.  If it was the other way around, this would be assault on an officer #TrafalgarSquare  https://t.co/QtSHa2ikCE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lulu_lindi @SkyNews Exactly 💪and if more people took IQ test in this country the amount of idiots would inflate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Should of used this one  Protect the elderly, yess just throw them on the floor. 70 year old thrown on floor by police. Sure if that was the other way round it would be assault on an officer ? #TrafalgarSquare #bbc @BBCNews #London @StandUpX2 #COVIDー19 #CovidUK  https://t.co/36TBeVlMpN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scotwilliams @gregjmchugh What was 2017-18 flu ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregjmchugh @scotwilliams Looking at the current stats got nearly as much chance of dying from an accident at home so least they are out the house today 💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotwilliams @plantbasedcards Lizard as a compliment<|endoftext|>
