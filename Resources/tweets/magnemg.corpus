<|startoftext|>@blitz_js @redwoodjs @echobind Thanks! Updated:   https://t.co/y6y7XyU3yz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Added AWS Amplify DataStore to the mix.  It can be used as a standalone vendor-agnostic GraphQL library, with offline-first capabilities, which the others do not afford.

<|startoftext|>Likely why Messenger is not written in @reactnative.

<|startoftext|>@KyleSGibson @DarkHor16612513 Oh yeah, true. So the liquidity issue was probably due to Bitfinex‚Äô money at custodian CCC was frozen (by govt) at the bank.

<|startoftext|>@KyleSGibson @DarkHor16612513 which would be different than a liquidity issue in Bitfinex caused by Tether having given them a loan which defaulted, for instance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleSGibson @DarkHor16612513 I think they mean that the liquidity issue in Bitfinex was caused by people withdrawing more than depositing..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleSGibson @DarkHor16612513 I think by ¬´unrelated to tethers¬ª they mean that the purpose was to solve Bitfinex own liquidity issues. (As the sentence states).

<|startoftext|>@markrhill @ExponentialView There is also some controversy here with what‚Äòs called ¬´parallel societies¬ª, especially in immigrant communities, and closed religious communities.

<|startoftext|>@markrhill @ExponentialView I cannot access the entire article. But I think it‚Äôs a general human phenomenon.

<|startoftext|>@markrhill @ExponentialView The tactic I mentioned is used by various state leaders around the world to direct attention towards external enemies instead of domestic issues, so they can stay in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markrhill @ExponentialView No, it‚Äôs just a strong hunch. In Norway we don‚Äôt have this political polarisation, and political advertising is banned. Attempts to introduce american style toxic political rhetoric was squashed in parliament. So it has a lot to do with the culture and debate climate one allows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen OTOH: TikTok uses remixing to great effect, and their ‚ÄúCreator Fund‚Äù enable unknowns to make a lot of money IF they are able to make a ‚Äúhit‚Äù.

<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen When all views are counted the same, you get a large quantity of content which is a mile wide an inch deep.

<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen To exemplify: In @Spotify, if a consumer pays $12 a month, and plays 3 songs that month, that money isn‚Äôt rightfully divided on the artist(s) of those 3 songs.

<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen But instead _their_ engagement/money is diverted to popstars who's content was played more by _other_ people. Is that fair, @Spotify? Is that fair, @tiktok_us?   https://t.co/0Y9AvH6h3H  4/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen This gives the already-popular a larger slice of the earnings, diluting the small. Network-effects of popularity make it even stronger.

<|startoftext|>@ljin18 @tiktok_us @Spotify @hankgreen Problem is engagement is measured in views/playtime, and all such are treated equal, and in a bundle.

<|startoftext|>@databrecht @leeerob @Jeff_Bledsoe @fauna Yeah. I was thinking about the upcoming standard called GQL.  https://t.co/2MoElZNanw Did you mean the same thing? If so, and you have a 1:1 mapping between it and FQL already, why not simply expose it for those that prefer a declarative approach?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@databrecht @leeerob @Jeff_Bledsoe @fauna Is there a language that currently generates FQL? I don‚Äôt want to roll my own. Waiting and hoping for GQL.

<|startoftext|>@databrecht @leeerob @Jeff_Bledsoe @fauna It probably made sense to be close to the metal when scaling (optimising; huge team).

<|startoftext|>@ghuubear @asxyzp Inspiration is not a reassurance of belief. It‚Äôs a new belief, which opens up valuable possibilities previously unseen, and that gives motivation.

<|startoftext|>@culturedcode What is actually the benefit of having the ordering in an Area, or under a Tag (when coming from a search), match exactly the ordering in the sidebar? I have never felt it gave more clarity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode @lysium Actually, come to think of it: that usecase is a bit different, tho. Because in that case the user hasn‚Äôt necessarily  made a conscious choice to filter by a tag first. If I understood it correctly? Having two inherently different kinds of tags all over would be confusing indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode @lysium That‚Äôs an assumption. Test it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesmentor @Yahoo Actually, the email might be legit:  https://t.co/XDNxSjIdgS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode Also, when filtering a view by a tag, that tag not displayed on projects and areas with that tag. Do you feel that causes confusion as well?   I would implore you to reconsider your view. My first impression was the same as yours, but first impressions are not always right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lysium @culturedcode I see. I already use both Areas and Projects. But the problem persists. Tags are still the supposed way to represent (GTD) contexts. Since Areas are supposed to represent areas of responsibility (GTD horizon 2). And since a task can potentially be done in multiple contexts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode Also, people would realise the tag was just hidden from the overview because: 1. they would still see the task when filtering by the tag. 2. when clicking into the task, they would see the tag listed there with all the other tags. Sounds worthy to test out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@am1no @culturedcode +1 on this. It would be especially helpful in the Anytime view, since it would reduce filtering by a tag from 3 clicks to 1 click!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lysium @culturedcode In what way did you use areas and projects to circumvent this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode I see. Actually, you could solve that problem with only allowing headings to separate tasks, and let the projects be at the top of the Area in their usual order (corresponding to the sidebar). Headers would then be for only subdividing tasks, just as inside projects. Could work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode I understand that concern. Maybe a small animation which would hide the tags gracefully (fade out and/or slide away to the left) would remove that confusion? It could give the user a ¬´WOW! They take minimalism to the next level, and unclutter my eyes!¬ª experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrinKerr @SteveBellovin Why though? (I think you‚Äôre right.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhaimes @nathanielpopper @coincenter No, their point is that it will lead to developing those providers of cheaper energy. Which would increase competition in the market, presumably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, @culturedcode doesn't it make sense to hide the tags you've already selected? So the view is less cluttered, and you may see the other tags better. #things3 #things  https://t.co/w97e5uWI0O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode I also miss headings in Areas. Any particular reason why it's not there? When Areas can have tasks directly, just as projects (which allow headings). It seems inconsistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@culturedcode Thanks, but not really. I am browsing around with my mouse, so my hands are not on the keyboard. It would also make me loose where I was at (my scroll position) in the previous list. The problem is most acute in the 'Anytime' list, which is long.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think Bitcoin will live on, and have a price for many many years to come. Even if it could stoop and get close to zero.

<|startoftext|>@QWQiao @DZack23  https://t.co/1xCDSdQNOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And KYC would be preserved. Even for transactions between individuals. It would entail some sort of permissioned ledger, where the proper ID of individuals/accounts can be determined reliably and registered (encrypted) on the ledger up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That way: Govt does not need a master key (backdoor) to inspect the ID of all parties in all transactions (with the risk of loosing that key), but may solicit the ID from either of the transacting parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Privacy centric #cryptocurrencies are to opaque for governments, but #public cryptocurrencies (non-anonymous or pseudonymous) are too public for corps and many individuals.
