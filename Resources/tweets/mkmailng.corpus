<|startoftext|>Rights groups claim that Chinese authorities have executed several of them in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another wave of violence swept across the region in 2012, forcing many Uighurs to flee China.  In 2015, around 100 Uighurs were deported by Thailand to China. The "forced returnees" reportedly faced severe persecution, torture, abuse, and even disappearances in China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a result, tensions between the Uighur and the majority Han Chinese have increased manifold in the past few years.  Violent clashes broke out between Han and Uighur communities in July 2009, killing at least 197 people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ethnic conflict  Pro-independence movements among Xinjiang's Muslim community have also been spurred by frustration over the influx of migrants from China's Han majority. Beijing has enforced harsher regulations against Uighurs and raised the security budget for Xinjiang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They demand a separate homeland or at least a greater autonomy for their region.  Wary of the Uighur separatist movements, Beijing has taken several measures to tighten its grip on Xinjiang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Uighur identify themselves as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang, which they describe as "East Turkistan." Experts say that many of the Turkic-speaking Uighurs feel closer to Central Asian states than China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most Uighurs view Beijing as a "colonizing power" attempting to undermine their cultural identity, political rights, religion and to exploit their region's natural resources.  'Original inhabitants' of their land<|endoftext|>
