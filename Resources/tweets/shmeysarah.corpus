<|startoftext|>@BinyominSilver1 @zkanSheol @HananyaNaftali yup and also Queen Esther's intermarried.  but if you have studied it, all the reasons of those stories were not the same as what we are talking about now. and the end result of all those stories is Judaism no other religions. there‘s no other religion in Jewish books.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BinyominSilver1 @zkanSheol @HananyaNaftali Jews = Jewish is Judaism, not by blood, nor an ‘ethnic’ or 'race' because anyone who adheres to Jewish teachings (Judaism) and runs all the Jewish order &amp; cultures, they are Jews/Jewish. who left it they are not Jews/Jewish anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BinyominSilver1 @zkanSheol @HananyaNaftali yup same as Christianism; Islamism; Budhism, Hinduism etc. if you draw it to the -ism line. but Judaism is not that simple.  Shintoism can stand as Shinto, as well as others. but Judaism is still Judaism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Glad2bAtheist if only based on surveys it is definitely wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glad2bAtheist all surveys are paid for certain interests and for a certain period of time, that’s why surveys is not a reliable method.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glad2bAtheist you last paragraph is not true because surveys are not a reliable method.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HikindDov @shmiranyc harassment is harassment, don't discriminate or be calcified. (mild) abuse is common &amp; is most often done by Christians.

<|startoftext|>@HikindDov @shmiranyc almost every day Jews are being harassed everywhere. but as I see, ‘executive’ Jews make a difference about the type of harass, being violent &amp; mild. and only pay attention to violent harass with physical assault. while the mild harass that attacks Jewish ideology is ignored...😖<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels once again. Jews are Judah, Jacob or Jews by DNA is made by Christian. Jews/Jewish is Judaism our book is Tanakh (Christian call it OLD TESTAMENT🤯)&amp; we ruled by Torah,  guided by the writings of the Rabbis. any Jews who‘s converted to another religion is no longer Jewish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels Jews is not by DNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels sorry, I don't trust Jesus. the fairy tales about him, he as a pioneer of antisemite and his evangelists is enough for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels even if there are still a descendant of Jacob which is very pure alias 100% flowing by Jacob's blood, but if they have embraced another religion they are not Jewish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels Jews/Jewish’s not by DNA. sorry if I explain though we’re friend here. Jews did not consider Jesus as a prophet, moreover as god (this’s very crazy thinking). Christian try so hard by many ways, the last by messianic judaism. BUt Jews/Jewish is Judaism cannot be mixed with other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liftdupbyangels Jews/Jewish Christian made by Christians. Jews is Jewish and cannot be attached to any religion. Jews who have converted to any religion are no longer Jews/Jewish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>tentu Mas Permadi jauh lebih mumpuni trhdp agama Mas sendiri drpd aku yg bukan, karena itu, maaf jika ada penulisan nama/surah yg salah. harapan aku, jk ada masalah selesaikan sendiri dgn bijak jangan terus menerus bawa2 Yahudi yg sama sekali tidak ada hubungannya. terima kasih.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>beda dgn agama Mas Permadi yg aturan ttg #cadar jelas dlm tulisan &amp; tafsiran: 1.Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/8 hadith 368 2.Sahih Al-Bukhari 6/60 hadith 282 3.Surah Ahzaab 33 &amp; Surah An Nur 31 yg ditafsirkan oleh bbrp ulama pendahulu adalah perintah utk menutup wajah kecuali mata. 4.dll..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cadar bukan Yahudi karena sama sekali tidak ada ketetapan/aturan/keharusan tentang itu dalam Taurat &amp; atau tulisan para Rabbi. cadar CUMA digunakan wanita Yahudi di pesta pernikahannya &amp; ini bukan Taurat tapi tradisi, krn ada acara pengantin pria akan menyibakkan cadar itu....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tentang cadar wanita Haredim diketahui eksis sekitar +/- 400 (empat ratus) tahun lalu, dan BUKAN sejak 2000 tahun seperti yg dikatakan Mas Permadi. dan mereka masih ada hingga kini, jumlahnya mereka cuma sekitar  200 orang. karena memang #cadar BUKAN Yahudi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>dia pikir, karena ‘suku’ Haredim orthodoks maka ‘suku’ ini adalah keturunan mula2/asal mula Yahudi. yg bisa dia gunakan sebagai biang kerok asal muasal #cadar  suku Yahudi lebih dikenal sbg 12 suku Israel, tidak ada Haredim disitu, karena Haredim adalah denominasi bukan suku..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>utk mendukung pikirannya, Mas Permadi ’ngoceh’ sambil memegang hasil ‘print’ gambar Haredim googlingannya. dia katakan ??suku?? Haredi (yg sjk 1950 disebut Haredim) dari ortodoks Yahudi, kemudian dia menghubungkannya dgn keberadaan ‘agama’ Yahudi 2000 tahun sblm nabi mereka..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryamChatha2 way of Jewish prayer, ritual &amp; content are very different with Islam. if there‘s a bit in common, all religions in the world have it too. by the way, why are you eager keep to try compellingly to equate Judaism with Islam? this’s very disgusting!<|endoftext|>
