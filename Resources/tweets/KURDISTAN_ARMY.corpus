<|startoftext|>@vvanwilgenburg The incident is not between the PKK and the KDP, but between the Qandil terrorists in the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Peshmerga forces within the borders of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

<|startoftext|>The terrorist attack took place within the borders of the iraqi-Kurdistan when the terrorists in PKK did not stop at a checkpoint of the Peshmerga.

<|startoftext|>Last week, the Qandil wing in PKK included terrorist elements in the protests in Kurdistan, and they carried out large and dangerous violence, especially in the city of Sulaymaniyah, but thanks to the security forces, their plans to intervene in the protests were thwarted.  https://t.co/8Ki2TTOS4Q<|endoftext|>
