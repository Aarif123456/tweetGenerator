<|startoftext|>@n00b54uc3 @snosrfr @KristinRehel @RondaTango @JimGaffigan China definitely could‚Äôve mitigated the impact of the virus at the origin, but they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet it out.‚Äù Their system is rife with denial and ignorance, until that ignorance can no longer be ignored.

<|startoftext|>@KristinRehel @snosrfr @RondaTango @JimGaffigan 30+ million have lost their jobs. 180,000 Americans dead.

<|startoftext|>@ShawnLarson23 @Jkburke21Jim @EdGreenberger @AriFleischer Oh no! An op-Ed article! So tell me, if this was the reason he held up aid, why didn‚Äôt he hold up aid in 2017 and 2018?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawnLarson23 @Jkburke21Jim @EdGreenberger @AriFleischer It‚Äôs a disproven conspiracy theory. It is also irrelevant to trump‚Äôs trial. It only provides context at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawnLarson23 @Jkburke21Jim @EdGreenberger @AriFleischer Aid can be stopped if there is a relevant foreign policy purpose behind it.
