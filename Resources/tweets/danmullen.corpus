<|startoftext|>@PopInABox_CS Sent a direct message 2 hours ago, no response... ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopInABox Still haven't received items ordered in October despite them being despatched weeks ago. Got a dialogue going with Customer Services but the website isn't letting me send a reply. Can't even start a new message. Not happy, clearly not going to receive my order by Xmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton I'd have Gus back in a heartbeat! #SAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtomskinner Careful Tom, you might upset his zero followers 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUK I had a message like that months ago and it actually got worse, not better 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Also, being able to long-press the icon in the top right is far from intuitive. The reason given for removing the swipe up for transactions on Android was that it wasn't obvious. (Not sure why when it's deemed fine on iOS.) The design criteria should be applied consistently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrissyAll @StarlingBank If I want advice from you mate it'll be about spreadsheets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Huge fan of Starling but I really dislike the white nav bar. Looks very dated, the way Android apps used to look in the early days. At least iOS users are able to swipe up for transactions, Android users still have that ugly green button! Marketplace, Help, etc now hidden away 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris77522682 @DominicRaab Cyberspace, not "space" space! Point taken on Track &amp; Trace though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN I appreciate you don't want to cut corners but I'd have thought an incentive for customers to commit for 2 years would be doable. If I decide to sign up, it wouldn't now make sense for me to go for the undiscounted 2-year deal, even though I'd be happy to commit for that period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN Only discounting the 1-year deal means I have no reason to sign up for the 2-year deal. Doesn't make sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN I was hoping for a decent 2-year deal on mail but there doesn't appear to be any discount over and above the normal multi-year discount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN I've been a free user for several months and have been waiting to see what Black Friday deals you have on this year. Very disappointed at the level of discount and the fact that you've tied the VPN in as a requirement for early access to ProtonDrive. I'll stay on the free plan 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman Perhaps you're one of the two they bring into camp a few days in? Keep watching to find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You could have saved a lot of effort by simply hitting the send button after you typed the first six characters of that tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I defy anyone not to laugh out loud at this sketch. Classic! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another sad loss, Des came across as a genuinely lovely person. He was on TV regularly when I was growing up and I can't remember ever seeing him without a smile on his face. I loved his chat show, particularly when comedians would have him creased on the sofa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NetflixUK I've read good things about @GillianA's performance in The Crown S4 but this is the first clip I've seen. Absolutely incredible! She looks and sounds EXACTLY like Margaret Thatcher! The voice in particular is scarily accurate. Looking forward to watching this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are they only legal when they're in your favour? Why can't Trump supporters see through this 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKBHD ...and I've been thinking it was my net connection for this past hour 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Leaf @paulsinha "If I said that I do apologise for it. I'm a product of working overseas where I was required to use the term 'people of colour' because that was a product of their diversity legislature. Sometimes I trip over my words."  I agree with @officialbarnesy that intention is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Yes, if he was referring to black players, absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulletRobinson @paulsinha I tend to agree. I'm just pointing out the difference between ignorance, bigotry, racism, etc. All can cause offence but I get more riled by those that intend to upset others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polymorph2 @ladbible It's pot 2 of 4. They are having four polls, the winners will go through to the final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha But he's specifically talking about the subset of managers that are black. If he just said "managers" it wouldn't make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Why isn't that acceptable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Reading the full article, there are a lot of ignorant comments. Not malicious but definitely ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Leaf @paulsinha My point is more that "person of colour" is an accepted term, which seems odd given "coloured" is not. There are much worse examples, e.g. Ron Atkinson. Where people use outdated rather than downright offensive language, perhaps education is better than sacking/public shaming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsinha I remember when the PC term was "coloured", now it is considered offensive. Yet "people/person of colour" is a term widely used today. In Greg Clarke's case, even if the term he used is considered outdated you need to look at the context. I don't think his intentions were bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpenreachHelp No, it's the Community Fibre Partnership form  https://t.co/pGC9lgLeWB I have submitted it twice previously and received the first email but the second never arrives. Trying again, it won't let me submit the form at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biffa50 @OpenreachHelp I'm in exactly the same position. Can't even submit the contact form on the Openreach website as it isn't working 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange how @realDonaldTrump and his team are only claiming voter fraud in those states where he lost. North Carolina is still counting postal ballots yet they've made no allegations of fraud there. The whole thing is beyond embarrassing now #USElection2020 #TrumpConcede 🇺🇲<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rcscribbler Sounds like a Manic Street Preachers track from the mid-nineties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwhoo It depends. The ICO keeps a record of complaints made against organisations. If they have previously advised them and find that they are still systematically breaking the rules, they can take action.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LEGAL VOTES are still being counted. OBSERVERS have been observing all the counts in every state in accordance with the law. There is no evidence of any systemic ILLEGAL VOTING. The "leader of the free world" is trying to subvert democracy 😡 #USElection2020 #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crabbers That's brilliant ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmarkbailey Especially if that project involves a brand new invention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very passionate speech and he's completely right. It's time for Republicans to speak up so Trump knows what he's doing is not OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a very odd "press conference" from @realDonaldTrump... embarrassing 😳 Full of lies and came across very desperate. #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesBlunt Think you've made a spelling mistake there James...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMcElhenney He got distracted bashing rats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DerrenLitten Wonder if he gets his orange foundation from the same place as Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, it doesn't have to be Democrats vs Republicans... @realDonaldTrump should have been made to watch this dignified speech from George H. W. Bush before being allowed in front of the press. Instead we get typically divisive, desperate and pathetic rhetoric. #USElection2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@prodnose I think they genuinely think the public will forget about his lockdown road trip but I suspect it will be fresh in the minds of many voters when the next election comes round. I find it the single most egregious thing that has happened this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt85174639 I completely understand that action has to be taken. I personally would go with the science at every turn but if you're going to take action, at least do it properly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, why leak this news to a couple of national newspapers on a Friday night when the formal announcement is planned for Monday? Great way to cause fear, uncertainty and panic over the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, a second national lockdown is coming on Wednesday. However, nurseries, schools and universities are to remain open. Is it a coincidence that the number of cases rocketed in September when pupils and students returned to the classroom? Seems like half a solution to me 🤷‍♂️  https://t.co/VwhZffyWeE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Website states for tier 2 areas: "You must not socialise in a group of more than six outside, including in a garden or other spaces like beaches or parks", yet: "You should not socialise with people who are not in your household or bubble in outdoor venues". Which is it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@travel_rave @NEFamilyFun @jollybeggars It's not covered by GDPR but organisations still have an obligation to protect their customers' personal data.

<|startoftext|>@FunkyRejects @jay_mullen @DCMS @OpenreachHelp Not sure but I believe it usually runs into the thousands. They need to do a full survey. We only want to be brought in line with the rest of the development! Just upgrade the cab!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @DCMS @OpenreachHelp I ended up communicating via DM. All I got was the suggestion of a Community Fibre Partnership - twice, from two different support agents.

<|startoftext|>@bphillipsonMP Looking to get a reliable Internet service for me and my neighbours. Contacted @OpenreachHelp and @DCMS, not sure who can help. Please see my recent tweet to DCMS below.

<|startoftext|>@SP1nightonly Hope you got a pen to go with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to see @SHendry775 coming out of retirement. Got to be honest, in his heyday I always wanted him to lose! He was too good, a bit like Man Utd under Fergie. I felt the same about @SteveSnooker in the 80s, yet he is one of my all-time favourite sportsmen. Good luck to the guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...second-class citizens. If the street cab serving our properties were to be upgraded, there would be an influx of customers wanting fast fibre broadband services. Can you please let me know the best course of action for me and my neighbours? Thank you. 7/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...service. The only suggestion I ever receive from Openreach is to sign up to a Community Fibre Partnership. We cannot reasonably be expected to foot the bill when the exchange and the rest of the development have already been upgraded? We are being treated as... 6/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...houses were still being built, before people moved in. However, the final properties became occupied over three years ago. Given the current situation and the need to work from home, it is vitally important that my neighbours and I have access to a reliable Internet... 5/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...at home, yet this is also unreliable. I have spoken to a number of residents that are in a similar situation to me - desperate to sign up to a fast fibre service but unable to because Openreach refuse to upgrade the street cab. I understand why it wasn't upgraded while... 4/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...download speeds of between 6 and 16Mbps (1MBps upload), yet the service is so unreliable that it isn't worth having. I had to ditch my landline last year - NOW TV allowed me to leave my contract early due to the slow, unreliable connection. I now rely on a 4G connection... 3/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...fibre. The cab serving my house has not been upgraded; the houses in the final development phase were not considered when fibre was being rolled out, meaning a lot of households across several streets are connected to an old cab. The ADSL service on offer should provide... 2/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCMS I've had several discussions with @OpenreachHelp but am no further forward. I live on a new development in a residential area, the exchange at the end of the street is fibre-enabled and one of the two street cabs serving the development has been upgraded for... 1/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpenreachHelp I shall send you a DM but I've already checked and we're not in your plans. I've spoken to a number of people on the development and everyone has said they are desperate to be able to get fibre. I suspect we moved in too late when you were upgrading cabinets previously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreOpenreach please consider upgrading the cabinet that servers the final phase of homes on my development. The exchange is fibre-enabled, all the other street cabs in the area have been upgraded. Only me and my neighbours are stuck on very slow ADSL. House is only 3 years old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgsparkyuk @jay_mullen @disneyplus Yeah Mark, one is LG, the other is Samsung. Works fine on my phone and the PC. Shouldn't have to Chromecast it to the telly every time!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUK I used to be happy using them in my 4G router for my home broadband but this year the service has degraded to the point where it's barely usable.

<|startoftext|>The way the government has defended his actions has sickened me. I have lost all respect for the PM and certain members of his cabinet. When I hear their attempts to justify what he did, I become increasingly angry. By failing to condemn his actions, they've put lives at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he had admitted an error of judgment, shown a little humility, apologised... maybe people would have had some sympathy for him. The truth is he thinks he is better than everyone else, all the ordinary people that have sacrificed so much over these last couple of months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were going to act like an idiot and test your eyesight by making a 60-mile round trip in your car, surely you would leave your child at home? And your wife for that matter, who coincidentally celebrated her 45th birthday that very day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story spun in Downing Street's rose garden yesterday was carefully concocted, yet it was full of holes. The crowning turd in the water pipe was Cummings' claim that trouble with his vision led him to load his family into the car for a 60-mile test drive to Barnard Castle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How anyone can justify driving 260 miles to a family member's home, whilst symptomatic, is beyond me. To claim no wrongdoing is supreme arrogance. Thousands of people have struggled with childcare yet they continued to follow the government's advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My own mother - who has been shielding due to being extremely vulnerable - has just come out of hospital after having emergency, life-saving surgery yet I have not been able to visit her either in the hospital or at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ordinary people understood the rules and the vast majority followed them. Old people have suffered from loneliness during isolation, people have died alone in hospital, families have been unable to say goodbye to their loved ones at funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least there's one government minister that has acted with integrity over the last few days. As someone that voted Conservative at the last election, I can't quite articulate how furious I am at this whole Dominic Cummings fiasco. The rules were clear and he broke them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @BorisJohnson I'm feeling more angry every day about this. I voted them in at the last election and have stuck by the rules 100% since lockdown began. They have lost my vote and, I suspect, that of many other people who voted for them last time round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwhoo @RobertCollings_ @JoeCMerriman Lovely to hear how supportive they were Sam. Hope everything is OK now 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pam Doove! Brilliant 😂 @ReeceShearsmith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman Tough one this week, 78% overall - started strongly with 88% from the first four questions, let myself down with just 61% from the last four. (Before anyone questions my maths, there were more points up for grabs from the first four questions.) Expected "Greta Garbo" to appear 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDesKelly He's pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman 47 in this week's quiz, highest score yet! Can't believe I didn't get Fiona Bruce... even after re-reading the intro I missed the reference!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteffenPeddie Happy Anniversary 🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman I scored 44/50 this week. Thanks for another great quiz 👍🏻 Incidentally, I've just put my pre-order in for the book 📖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman Another great quiz Richard.  I scored 46 this week, which is my best score so far!  Looking forward to next week's 'E' quiz Smiling face with open mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottspde @Authy "correcthorsebatterystaple" had to be blacklisted as people took the cartoon too literally and used it as their password!

<|startoftext|>@AllanMayStewart A friend sent me your Captain Tom twist on Space Oddity and I immediately recognised you from Copy Cats - I used to love watching that when I was a kid 😃 Welcome to Twitter 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeCochrane1 The Hairy Bikers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUKSupport Having a look at my options now. Just really surprised that they were happy for me to cancel three SIM contracts, no attempt to keep me as a customer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUKSupport I've had similar issues for months. Sick of phoning and not getting any support. It's clearly not good enough to rely on for home broadband. I'm out of contract and got my PAC today. They weren't interested in keeping my custom for my two phones either so also got PACs for those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport very disappointed. Long-time customer, 3 x SIM cards all out of contract. Called to discuss options only to find I'm better off cancelling all three and going elsewhere or signing up as a new customer, which would get me £187 cashback. Now got 3 PAC codes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gossipmongers1 That would be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susan_turne @Timewalkproject @ij851227 @sharpeleven But exactly the same thing could have been said about the North East, for example Blyth. Always been Labour, Conservative won the seat at the last election. I get the point about feeling like your vote is wasted but it's only like that because everyone thinks the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I used the cheque imaging feature this morning and I was very impressed with it. Very quick, photos accepted first time. The money appears in my feed as an upcoming payment due on Monday. Really well done 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HalifaxBank I know you're busier than usual but I'm currently on hold and have been for the last 2 hours and 4 minutes. Do you have an estimated response time please? The automated voice at the beginning of the call suggested around 60 minutes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryBritain Well, whatever he thinks he won't be opening his pubs tomorrow! And I would like to think he'll take advantage of the extremely generous measures just announced by @RishiSunak and keep all of his staff on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suspect @RishiSunak is a future Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickygray33 @mrmjansen @AdamCatterall @talkSPORT Haha, mad skillz 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is incredible from the government. I hope that whatever people's politics, they can appreciate what @RishiSunak is announcing right now. Don't make staff redundant and the government will pay 80% of the wage bill, up to £2,500/month for 3 months (to start with)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman They should really stop filming and free them up for the important work going on in the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosieAnn83 @coop_food Most people have been following the guidance, being sensible, etc. Sadly, this situation has highlighted that there are some in society that are selfish, greedy and just not very nice people. Hope your Mam is OK.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinSLewis on the back of the Bank of England's second emergency rate cut, do you think that people stuck with high fixed rate mortgages should be given the opportunity to switch to a better deal, WITHOUT having early repayment charges applied?

<|startoftext|>@hwinkler4real No, they're extremely selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LPerrins @TheConWom So selfish - this is the reason that people will lose loved ones who may otherwise have survived. The government's response will only work if everyone pulls together. Despicable attitude.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@richardhorton1 Of course the science has changed. Science changes all the time. It adapts as new information comes to light and our understanding increases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of relying on the tabloids, journalists or TV presenters, have a read of this if you want some facts on coronavirus, COVID-19 and the government's response. Everyone needs to be pulling in the same direction if we are to have any chance of slowing this thing down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@objectivegreen @garethimurphy @RoryStewartUK It's not as straightforward as you think. A lot of kids will end up congregating in public spaces or having to be looked after by their (potentially vulnerable) grandparents. Also, NHS staff may have to take time off work to look after their kids. No easy solution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC ...available, they've realised this would lead to too many deaths (~250,000). This leaves only one option, hence the change to the plan. The problem with the new approach is that there is no end in sight. You can only safely stop these new measures once a vaccine becomes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC The numbers they put into their model have been revised as we've seen how the rate of infection has risen in the UK and elsewhere. The original plan was to try to flatten the curve and prevent a second peak coming further down the line. Unfortunately as more data has become...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garethimurphy @RoryStewartUK I thought they were doing that. Trying to get more beds from the private healthcare sector, hotels, etc. and more ventilators built by various manufacturers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC They are making decisions based on the best science available at the time. The very nature of the scientific process means that as new information becomes available, a different approach may need to be taken. Let's not knock them for that. The aim is to limit the number of deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swannyg66 It's complex. Partly because it's likely grandparents (i.e. vulnerable people) would end up looking after children and partly because NHS staff may need to be off work in order to look after their kids, leaving the NHS understaffed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshuaPotash This is a bit disingenuous. Of course taking the hit would be one way of dealing with it. I believe he went on to say that we are sticking to our 4-part plan, meaning we are still trying to contain the virus before we move to the delay stage. This is to ease the burden on the NHS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy Did you sync them earlier? You must have entered your backup password on the second device, otherwise there would be no way to decrypt the tokens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy Once you've added your additional devices to your account, you can turn the multi-device option off. This will prevent any further devices being added but you can still sync between your existing devices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy The multi-device option just allows you to authorise additional devices to use the same Authy account. The backup option actually syncs your tokens to Authy's servers and any additional devices you have authorised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateRobbins Were they all married?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy Backups and multi-device support are one and the same thing. If you backup your account tokens, you can access them on other devices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Authy @csshsh I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you decide to enable multi-device support, you enter a backup password. This is used to generate a key using PBKDF2, which is then used to encrypt your account tokens before they are sent to Authy's servers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGeordieLass @LesDennis I don't really know if Les would want to do that on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh What's messy about it? I use Authy, highly recommend it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajivPerera @csshsh @Authy is great, I recommend it to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReeceShearsmith Great news! Although I would have loved more League of Gentleman and Psychoville, it's usually best to go out on a high and leave the audience wanting more.

<|startoftext|>@AGeordieLass Sean Connery jokes are like my brother's young daughter. They're a little niche.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gillinghamjoe I'm not sure where but I think it was around Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @TCPAwards Congratulations 🍾  https://t.co/tFtE70vGPd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRayPurchase @StevenToastRADA I suspect he may be round your house Purchase. How is Mrs P? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to "Limitless", the new album by @richardmarx. Absolutely fantastic! Still sounds just as good as he did thirty years ago. Big fan 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenny_Radcliffe Very sorry to hear this, thoughts are with you, your Mum and your family x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaSValls Voted. Slightly behind (49%-51%), closer than Brexit! Come on people, Waffle has to win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictoriaCoren Unless he means he'll procure a wife for himself with the winnings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Duck ☑️ Unicorn ☑️ I will concede that Monster is quite possibly (probably) @CeeLoGreen, providing Danny John-Jules denial above isn't a bluff... 🤔 Still convinced I'm right with Fox and Queen Bee. Surely Octopus is @KathJenkins #MaskedSinger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfry Spreadsheet. For some reason, I always get the 's' and the 'h' the wrong way round 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuncanBannatyne  https://t.co/xwqCxRiSqd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niai1612 You don't have to use Google Authenticator, even if that's what the site suggests. Any app that generates TOTP codes will work fine, including @Authy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonManford What a lovely message. Wish I got praise like that at work 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouchPotato_ @Jakeshears @DannyJohnJules @wonderwomanshel @skinskinny @denise_vanouten @kenjeong @ThisisDavina @RitaOra @wossy @joeldommett It does sound like CeeLo but I'm convinced it was Cat from Red Dwarf doing a Pussycat Dolls song. Plus I don't think CeeLo is a Grandad yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK #MaskedSinger I said at the start that Unicorn is @Jakeshears. I think Monster is @DannyJohnJules, Queen Bee is Michelle Heaton @wonderwomanshel and Duck is @skinskinny. Fox is defo @denise_vanouten. 100% correct, thank you! @kenjeong @ThisisDavina @RitaOra @wossy @joeldommett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbdelatySuliman @StarlingBank There is already a loan facility for personal accounts. If you're eligible, you'll see the option under Spaces, next to Goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonManford Clue HQ in Sunderland is fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonManford @MusicalCurtains Coming to see you at the @SundEmpire on Saturday. Now I'm going to spend the whole show wondering at what point the pus filled your mouth 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izzybbb @SunderlandEcho No, I think the "threatening tones" she's alluding to is the thinly veiled threat made by the Secretary of the Durham Miners' Association suggesting she speak to the police to ensure her safety at the event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all those @LastPass users unable to login to their accounts, I recommend having a look at @Bitwarden. Outages can happen but when it goes on for several days and the company refuses to acknowledge there's a problem, you have to question the viability of the service #passwords<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gossipmongers1 STOSHTY!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheLastLeg the best thing about leaving the EU is that @adamhillscomedy is going to get rid of the facial hair. It's like a diseased badger. Like a depressed Geordie. Like Worzel's worst head #AdamsBeardGoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yes, in that picture Joaquin Phoenix does look overwhelmingly white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @Dan_W_91 Presumably it requires an app update?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRayPurchase @StevenToastRADA Yes. Yes. Yes! YES! YEEEEEEESS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsimC86 Is this @rickygervais in the bath again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stachedawg No worries... I get so much abuse aimed at this guy 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr0idAndy @OWASP_Newcastle No need to be nervous Andy, the last talk I saw you give was well delivered, interesting and entertaining 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stachedawg Wrong Dan Mullen... again! 🙄 #fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seat2d @StarlingBank @AnneBoden As a "Dan" myself, I found it even more confusing!? 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eljonesuk If you're willing to go halves I'll send you photos of my feet and you can forward them on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_smiles Only thing missing is the overhead headphones with the furry orange covers 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertBathurst @UKTV Really?! I've never seen it repeated. That's my viewing sorted for tonight then! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertBathurst I love this programme, I've been hooked since the beginning. Really pleased they brought it back. Another @RobertBathurst programme I'd love to see brought back is "Joking Apart". One of the funniest, most underrated comedies I've seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this 😄 Really makes me look at my colleagues in a new light... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brian_bilston Haha, love this 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secretbort @gossipmongers1 I think this is for you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CouchPotato_ @CraigDavid And to you Lou, hope 2020 is a great year for you, Tom and all your family x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/vc0X7m4hbq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Year to all my family, friends and followers. What better way in to see in a new decade than watching @CraigDavid and drinking QC Cream Sherry 🍷🎉 #NewYear2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtomskinner Bought two pillows previously but just ordered two more. Can't pass up a discount code like that! #bosh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuart_smiles All the best to you and yours mate 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Texboy68 @DanMullen_ESPN @NCAA @GatorsFB You know when you sign up to Twitter, you get to choose a unique username? And you aren't limited to just your first and last names, e.g. @Textboy68? Why do people assume that a coach in the US has my Twitter handle? I get a mix of praise and abuse intended for @CoachDanMullen 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeONien rolling all over League One 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonTonStu @prodnose Like cricket, I'd even be happy for three VAR calls per team. However, there should be no more than three replays. If it isn't obvious that a mistake has been made after three replays, then you go with the on-field decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prodnose So Danny, just to be clear, do you like VAR or not? #VARisshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyberGoGiver Congratulations Nicola! 🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beatlesstory Cranberry Fields Forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5arcen @Authy I would add Bitwarden to that list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayGarrett2 @RealBobMortimer Great minds think alike 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobMortimer Home for Christmas, on the road to hell, so he can have a nice bath with an egg in it. No doubt he'll pat himself dry with a nice gold doily. It's just so Chris!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRayPurchase I was thinking of treating myself to a bit of plastic surgery for Christmas. Considering the wonderful job you did on Miss Kikini Bamalam, perhaps you could bring your scalpel? #RaysBigOne P.S. Tell Mrs P. I said, "Hi" 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very angry and disappointed with @cineworld. Called and emailed regarding what is potentially a serious security breach relating to payment card details but have not received a response. I would have thought a company this size would take such reports very seriously. Clearly not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AsimC86 @BBCOne Loved this last year, very funny 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr0idAndy I've put proposals forward at work that will hopefully see the end to needless password changing every 90 days, along with some other much needed changes regarding complexity requirements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelVaughan Did she get a run for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sad to hear of the passing of Dr Vernon Armitage, principal of the College of St Hild &amp; St Bede @durham_uni during my time there in the 90s. A lovely man well liked by the whole student population. My thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got home from @cineworld after seeing @starwars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Wow! Everything about it - storyline, musical score, Leia... couldn't have hoped for more. (BTW, that's my dark side in the photo - light side just out of shot.) #StarWarsRiseofSkywalker  https://t.co/oD0PbLW2Dh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great article by Huw Edwards @huwbbc regarding perceived bias in the media. "There is a desire to embrace only those sources which confirm your own 'worldview' or 'groupthink'; in short, it's 'biased' if it challenges your own bias."  https://t.co/y9SLOLD6PO #BBCnews #GE19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtomskinner @jackeverett92 @FazzaGBR @girlgrouptrash3 @Lord_Sugar If it's any consolation to you Jack, I bought the same pillows recently and they're very comfortable. Lying on them now. Worth the wait #bosh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@weather_katie @starwars @HamillHimself @jjabrams @NWS Fantastic work 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_nobster @StarlingBank @AnneBoden I have to agree that charging a higher overdraft rate depending on credit score doesn't seem right to me. I have said the same to the other "digital bank" referenced in the article. People with lower credit scores are likely to be hit the hardest with a rate hike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hatton_julian @takethat The College of St Hild &amp; St Bede Jules 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@takethat I was at University in Durham. That week, my college was putting on a "Stars In Their Eyes" event. I took part and sang this song as Gary Barlow, resplendent in black leather trousers, white shirt and a waistcoat. I came second behind five guys dressed as the Spice Girls #robbed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @Conservatives That article is from 25 November.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ryanmarkparsons Are you working the tills? What time do you clock off?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoryStewartUK Well, you did tell your wife to believe in the bin 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Can Labour be considered a Remain party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerryAGodliman I always thought it should have been UKexit anyway. Brexit, being a portmanteau of Britain and Exit, excludes Northern Ireland.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Yeah, definitely the Hoover Dam. It's the one Superman restored back in 1978 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelycett Just wait until those 10,000 men come forward and spill the beans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qikipedia I like that all these numbers are divisible by 16. Not sure why, it just feels good 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoogleStadia Yes, I'm all good thanks 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank 9 + 3 + 2 = 14 7 x 10 = 70 14 x 70 = 980 980 + 4 = 984<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtomskinner @karren_brady @claudelittner @Lord_Sugar Gutted to see you go, you were the series winner for me.

Best of luck with your future endeavours, I might even buy a couple of pillows from you 😉 #bosh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imacelebrity @romankemp @Caitlyn_Jenner This is one of the best impressions I've ever seen! Absolutely spot on 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just caught up with this week's #TheApprentice and am so impressed with @iamtomskinner. He's been fantastic throughout the whole process. Taking Pamela's place in the boardroom was an amazing act - proof that you don't have to be ruthless to succeed in business. Hope he wins 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Authy Nothing to stop you and a buddy adding the same TOTP codes to separate Authy accounts... 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frankieboyle To be fair, it can probably be effectively used for that purpose too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gossipmongers1 You see Mia, you've revealed a weakness. Never do that. BTW, you can get some cream for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gossipmongers1 I like it.  I think "Big Gay Roy" could be the next dance craze. "Big big big big, gay gay gay gay, Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy..." 🎵 It's got a great beat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GylesB1 This is going to require fundamental changes to some classic song lyrics...  "I'm leaving, in a jet plane" "He's leaving, in that midnight train to Georgia" "I'd love to get you in a slow boat to China"  I'm not sure it works... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlegibbo @StarlingBank @OnedoxInfo @mrjonburton @Habito @pensionbee @TailOffers @wealthify_com @Wealthsimple I'm sure they acted with the best of intentions but it was never going to succeed as a subscription-based service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlegibbo @StarlingBank @OnedoxInfo @mrjonburton @Habito @pensionbee @TailOffers @wealthify_com @Wealthsimple People thought they could get the service for nothing because they COULD get the service for nothing. Onedox had other ways of monetising, including energy switching commission. To take a completely free service and suddenly start charging is classic bait and switch tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JemVenn @StarlingBank Great decision, I can't recommend @StarlingBank highly enough! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @OnedoxInfo @mrjonburton @Habito @pensionbee @TailOffers @wealthify_com @Wealthsimple I found the service quite useful but deleted the integration and indeed my Onedox account when they introduced fees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OWASP_Newcastle @pentestltd Gutted, I'll be at a security expo in London that day. Would have been really keen on this. Any plans to make the slides available, maybe a walkthrough of the best approaches, etc.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewPerry It depends on whether or not you've had any work done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfry Hoping to see full General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett by the end of the month 〰️ 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a fantastic time at @mbro_townhall  tonight seeing @DaveGorman and his brilliant support act @NickDoody. Highlight of the show has to be the giraffe joke 😂 Will have to arrange a trip to the zoo to see if it's true 🧐🤣 #NSFW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Ah, OK. Thanks for the explanation 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've just noticed this page under Account Management, pretty sure it's just appeared since installing the latest update (on Android). Have I missed an announcement? What's this all about? 🤔  https://t.co/orecc5Q9RK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneBoden This is fantastic news Anne! I've been hoping for a USD account for a long time, wasn't expecting an announcement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesBlunt I've had this album on repeat since it was released 😃 Absolutely fantastic, like all your other albums. Not a bad track on it! Looking forward to your Newcastle gig in February #OnceUponAMind<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonManford My dog is called Locksmith.  Every time I shout at him he makes a bolt for the door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sulaimanaa @somenerdliam There are lots available, including Google Authenticator, though I would recommend @Authy. You have the option of backing up to the cloud so you don't lose your accounts when you switch device.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatalieSFergie @StarlingBank Great idea! I've also been using Starling roundups for quite a while now. Why not find a local charity, perhaps a village hall or youth centre, who I'm sure will appreciate any donation, large or small 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@somenerdliam I mostly agree although I would tweak the advice slightly. Having SMS-based 2FA is better than not having 2FA at all. That said, authenticator apps are much more secure and very easy to use. They also work fine when you don't have a mobile phone signal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahPresley19 @SEC You keep tweeting but you have the wrong Dan Mullen... I'm not a football coach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport had no service whatsoever for the last 6 hours. No voice or data on my phone, no home broadband... relying on a hotel internet connection currently whilst wife and kids are at home and uncontactable. Not good enough 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFletcher Lol, we literally had the same problem this week! Well, apart from the morning television commitments... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Aaahh, TV advert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DigitalLawyer Step 2 giving out your member number was crucial... "that number, by itself, is useless". Seemingly not! Good to hear they weren't able to access your money. I wonder how many people have been scammed in this way? It does sound very convincing and would fool a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Great news, I was very happy to hear that when I watched @AnneBoden's latest Q&amp;A!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeOnSmithLake @AUFAMILY How hard can it be to tag the right person? I'M NOT A FOOTBALL COACH! #fail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealBobMortimer Beardsley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRDANOKE @StarlingBank I reported this back when the forum was alive! The Pulse currently displays individual transactions when it would make much more sense to display them grouped by merchant.  In the above example, after a few more transactions it will show one as "Tesco" and four as "Other".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrissyAll @StarlingBank Haha 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank ...brand new 🎵<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trevordonut @StarlingBank Summer 2019 could have meant as late as September, whereas mid-2020 indicates June/July.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I'm very disappointed at the news that personal credit cards have been pushed back from "summer 2019" to "mid-2020" 😟 Are there any personal current account innovations we can expect to see before the end of this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to see @OnedoxInfo start charging for their previously free service. I understand they need to make money but I don't think a subscription is the right way to do it. I wish them the best of luck but I've removed my @StarlingBank integration and deleted my account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrsmarywright @StarlingBank @AnneBoden Yes, you can integrate with both Xero and FreeAgent via the Marketplace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @StarlingForBiz @Sibos Haha, that's my answer 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank @Sibos All of the above?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McDonaldsUK Don't bother. I used this offer in the app and paid for my order. When I turned up they said they couldn't see it on their till and refused to give me the food or a refund. Raised a formal complaint but been met with silence. Now dealing with my card issuer. Appalling service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActualJBP @McDonaldsUK It's been a number of days now and apart from an initial response to my complaint, I've had nothing back. Absolutely furious 😡 Going to have to raise a chargeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely angry at @McDonaldsUK - paid for an order through the app only to be told they had no record of it on the till. Wouldn't give me my food or a refund despite me showing proof of payment and an order number. Complained through the app and since been met with radio silence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madebygoogle Sent s DM over 7 hours ago, no response...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @Google @GoogleUK @madebygoogle I just received the OTA update to @Android 10 and it's broken my Pixel 3 XL ☹️ Lots of issues... can't turn mobile data on, notifications not displaying, can't pull down notification drawer, power button camera shortcut not working, etc... 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank 09:33 and 13:35, no notification. Hope that helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank any issues with notifications today? I've had a couple of Personal transactions where I didn't receive a notification, yet a Business transaction popped up as expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden Any timescales for when this will be available to view?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesBlunt I've got it on repeat in my car! Any plans for a tour next year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank That is shocking! Raise a chargeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Owtcast1911 I'm unsure how that'll help preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information at my place of work but I'll bear it in mind 👍🏻 #WrongDanMullen #NotAFootballCoach #InformationSecurityManager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dolphin4321 @kingcfb @GatorsFB The irony is you've tagged the wrong Dan Mullen in that tweet... 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden What was the question? You replied to your own tweet, not the one from James! 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesBlunt @FayeCarruthers You're beautiful 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden I'd love to know what's happening with digital cheque imaging, the Starling credit card, Euro account debit card payments and any other exciting app developments for personal customers that might be round the corner #AskStarling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport It came back on after just over an hour. I'll DM you my postcode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK Is there a problem with your service in Sunderland?  For a number of days the speeds have been severely degraded and my connection keeps dropping.  Today I lost all connectivity at around 11:30.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Right-handed, very logical, always tap with my right 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @thehoxton Will you be publicising the accelerated roadmap plans after the event? Looking forward to seeing what innovations we can look forward to next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden I have investment plans set up for all three of my kids with @wealthify_com, I've consolidated my former workplace pension plans with @pensionbee and I do all my day-to-day banking with @StarlingBank. An added bonus is that I can see an overview of all three in the Marketplace 😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank We use Cloudflare at work but haven't noticed any issues. I can see they have an issue affecting certain IP ranges though. Hope it's fixed soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Working fine here - is this only affecting certain users? By geographic location perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV @FayRipley @RobertBathurst @JohnnyThomson2 One of my favourite programmes 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoryStewartUK Very disappointed with this result. Congratulations on a very successful campaign Rory, at least when it comes to the voting public. I hope and expect we will see much more of you in the years to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@homakhaleeli I'm fairly certain that the sentiment was that he is proud to live in a country that is culturally diverse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoryStewartUK @BBCPolitics Congratulations @RoryStewartUK, looking forward to the debate tonight 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allanfr87884526 @ThreeUK Happy days 😀👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Break a leg @jay_mullen (my brother) #The39Steps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allanfr87884526 @ThreeUK I very much hope that's the case but I'd be very surprised! Would be great to get an official response on here...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OWASP_Newcastle Very kind of Sage but I think the city centre location is probably more accessible for most people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK What happens if you're in a 4G contract, is there going to be the option of upgrading without any additional fees? Also, when are you releasing details on pricing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankieboyle Attention all passengers! Please remain calm #SixWordHorror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #C4debate was like watching a job interview when they were asked about their weaknesses. "I'm so impatient, want to get things done immediately." "Too stubborn, stick to my principles." Very impressed with @RoryStewartUK and his honest, humble response. Came across very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I was reversing my car this morning and I thought, "Ah, this takes me back!" #DadJokes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton I suppose the intention with the EUR account then is to receive payments in EUR, thus no fees. It'd also make sense to spend from this account in EUR, again no fees. In that case, I would hope that it becomes possible to use the Starling debit card before the fees are introduced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingBank @HelenBierton Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton With the introduction of a fee to transfer between GBP and EUR accounts, I'm genuinely failing to see the use case for the new offering. With fee-free spending and cash withdrawals already available, the only use I can think of is to be able to lock in a decent rate, a la Revolut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton Sadly this fee negates the whole point of having the account! May as well continue to spend using the GBP account at the Mastercard rate with no markup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vertumotors Very sorry to hear this sad news. Thoughts are with his family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingBank @HelenBierton Disappointing if correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton I haven't seen the fees mentioned Dan, must have missed it! Would be interested to hear the response to this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobMortimer @antanddec Lad, lads, lads... ha'way man. What you need are some nice new Geordie Jumpers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesBlunt Is that a colloquialism meaning that you're waiting until you win the lottery, or are you still prepubescent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank One has no fees, the other has no fleas. Which is which? You decide...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden @AmazonUK I just bought the Kindle edition 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwhoo @karljobstgaming You can buy yourself a shiny new PS6 just in time for when you're allowed to play games again... 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank "You can add your own images as profile pictures for each account... one cat for personal, two for joint and a cat wearing a beret for euro."  You can't have different profile pictures for your GBP and EUR personal accounts. Change one and it's reflected in both accounts 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @amysgerbil @AnneBoden Yes there are plans - you even state it in your app!  https://t.co/N1nVxvU9VC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I have a Google Sheet called "Finances" containing multiple worksheets. This covers things like my income (including payslip checker), budgeted outgoings, mortgage overpayment calculator, savings calculator (with compound interest), etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden £180m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@money2themasses @StarlingBank Thanks Damien 😃👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@money2themasses Good review of @StarlingBank  https://t.co/odNYjQ2iEg but it's wrong to claim that Monzo's overdraft is "more generous" at 50p/day. If you were overdrawn by £1,000 every day for 30 days, Starling would charge around £11.60 compared to £15.00 with Monzo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @BritBankAwards What was the suggestion? Just a heads up but you often reply to your original tweet rather than the other user, which means no-one else can see the conversation 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeONien Great performance and great class shown at the end in that interview. Well done lad, good luck at Wembley!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobMortimer Looks like the bastard lovechild of Elvis Presley and Donald Stott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daraobriain @jnoahmorgan Dara, you're forgetting that any picture of a chimp or monkey is automatically racist, every time, regardless of context or intent... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petercorser @RobertBathurst @prodnose @bbc5live Yes, chimps/monkeys may have been used by racists for a long time but that doesn't automatically make any imagery featuring a chimp or a monkey racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petercorser @RobertBathurst @prodnose @bbc5live I don't even consider it to be a mistake. When I see a picture of a chimp I don't think of black people. I think of chimps. Are the old PG Tips adverts racist? Is anything featuring a picture of a chimp racist? Ludicrous! Racism in any form is disgusting but this is not racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prodnose @bbc5live Absolutely outrageous. To claim that Danny Baker's tweet was in any way racist is absurd. Says more about those who felt offended (or claimed to be offended) than Mr Baker himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prospratlin @ahmadblack35 I agree that it's unlikely I'll ever win a major sporting trophy. Mainly because I'm not @CoachDanMullen #mistakenidentity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @HelenBierton Good news! Anything you can share?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank it appears that there is an issue with notifications being delayed currently. I've noticed a 2-3 hour delay this morning where usually notifications are instant. I've spoken to a number of other customers who are experiencing the same issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForGreenerGood @StarlingBank Right. Some ATMs charge a fee. When spending using your card, definitely request local currency though 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForGreenerGood @StarlingBank Always make sure you tell the merchant you want to pay in the local currency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n26 @N26UK @N26_Support I wrote to you two weeks ago to request the closure of my account. Other than an automated response, I have had no reply. Multiple emails have been ignored and the chat facility in app only works sporadically. Can someone please get back to me ASAP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Emojis make it too obvious 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I do hope you sensed the sarcasm in my tweet... 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank if you could offer a different coloured card, a custom Settle Up link and some stickers for less than £36/year, you could win some serious market share #MonzoPlus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobMortimer 8mm? Or DVD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopVinyls I saw your tweet earlier before you deleted it, in which you referred to me as "an idiot". That's not very nice, is it? Of course the irony is I suspect you aimed it at the wrong Dan Mullen. You should really double check your tweets before posting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank The round-up feature - saving when you don't even realise you're doing it! I've rounded up my transactions manually since May last year but was delighted when automatic round-ups were released at the end of last year. I have just under £200 in my "Coin Jar" Goal 😃 #stealthsaving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switch to Octopus using this link and we'll both get £50. No minimum term, no exit fees, just low prices and great customer service!  https://t.co/Wo6FhDoSRR #FreeMoney<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I'm pleased to read that you'll be introducing biometric authentication later in the year. SMS isn't a secure method of communication, though I appreciate a OTP via text is better than not having anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gerrin @SunderlandAFC! Got tickets for the @CheckatradeTrpy final for me and my family. Just need to figure out how we're going to get there now... any spare seats on the bus @stewartdonald3? ;) Ha'way the lads! #SAFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevindickson83 @Michael_Jones42 @Musicinfocus @stewartdonald3 @TyroneW1996 @SunderlandAFC If you have family set up with customer numbers you can add them to your account. You can then buy one ticket per customer number.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @dr0idAndy, thanks for the heads up about last night's @OWASP_Newcastle event. Enjoyed the talks, looking forward to the next meetup 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cringed so much during the social media section with Simon that I'm now in pain all over. Think I may have early onset arthritis #AlanPartridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertBathurst Looks like "Bloody hell!" to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btocher @mike_mcgrail @StarlingBank Many banks provide a little card reader that you have to use to set up new payees or make transfers using internet banking. You don't have that nuisance with Starling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank can someone please, please look at my support tickets regarding merchant logos? Multiple tickets, some responses but very little action. This is the one feature that I find frustrating with an otherwise excellent bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar Notwithstanding the fact that Honda have stated this decision isn't due to Brexit, why would you single out the people of Sunderland? The majority of voters in the area voted leave - 61.3% in fact. 72.3% of voters in Thurrock, Essex also voted to leave. Bit of an ignorant tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lizzie_Thompson @AirFranceFR What if this man suffers from anxiety and can only fly half naked? What's he supposed to do, NOT take his trousers off? THAT'S absurd...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavin460 @YODELhell @eFloristflowers Pretty much the same has happened to me today.  My wife has now left work, flowers not delivered.  Contacted @YodelOnline by DM but got a generic response about drivers having a set route. Emailed eFlorist but no response as yet. Gutted :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @itisJames Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @itisJames I have exactly the same issue. I submitted a number of support requests the other day regarding this very issue but haven't heard anything back as yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen Do they have a phone number on their website?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Congratulations! Hugely impressed with the success of your banking-as-a-service and back-end payment products 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickg_uk @StarlingBank I believe they are planning to launch one this summer 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @DaveGorman's Modern Life is Goodish and just learned that the "Lamprotornis Superbus" is the Latin name for the "Superb Starling".   https://t.co/OAU29vMy6M  Anyone know why @StarlingBank aren't using this in their advertising?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyyBecca Have a look at Starling Bank too - very similar but completely free-free ATM withdrawals when you're abroad (no limits), no fee to deposit cash into your account via the Post Office, a very fair overdraft rate and lots more 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kieransampson @lloydjbirch @StarlingBank You can receive EUR into your Starling account but I agree. The ability to receive USD payments would be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quick shout out to @stinky_ink where I recently ordered a full set of 5 replacement compatible cartridges for my Canon printer. Cheap as chips (total cost about half the price of a single Canon cartridge), free delivery (arrived next day) and great quality prints! Very pleased :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Great article, some very good advice in there. We've been taught over many years to use passwords that are hard to remember but easy for computers to crack! The four random word approach is much more secure and far easier to remember 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAlexMerry @StarlingBank @AnneBoden @secretleaders1 Nice one Alex, you won't be disappointed! Personal account next...? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank If you want to make regular payments to one of your other accounts, you still need to set them up as a payee. The new functionality is nice but you've forgotten to add options for date and frequency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Cleared the cache but still no sign of the update. Is it a phased rollout?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Don't see the update in the Play Store yet - is this on Android too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewartdonald3 @sf49ersman Some people are never happy... 🙄 Thanks for backing the manager during the transfer window @stewartdonald3 👍🏻 Ha'way the lads! #SAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jajayourlife I've signed up and can confirm the onboarding process is very slick and very easy. Had my digital card in minutes. The app looks great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuxuryTravelled @StarlingBank I've now had some duplicate notifications from earlier today and have noticed that some of the upcoming Direct Debits due tomorrow that were showing earlier have disappeared 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled I haven't noticed, no notifications recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled I'm on Android and noticed a small delay earlier, probably a couple of minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr0idAndy @OWASP_Newcastle Thanks for letting me know Andy, sounds really interesting. Pretty sure I'm free, will book my ticket now 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FreeviewTV Pleased to finally see a streaming app from Freeview. Very disappointed though that it's iOS only (until March) ☹️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn 1. No deal is our only bargaining chip. The EU want a deal as much as we do. Without the option of no deal we lose all leverage in the negotiations. 2. Over the years you've been happy to meet and talk with various terrorist organisations but you won't sit down with the PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneBoden Hi Anne. I received notification this morning from Amazon that my pre-order for your new book has been cancelled. Is there some sort of delay or is this purely an Amazon issue? Looking forward to reading it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Is there a way to increase your overdraft limit, is it fixed once set or is it a case of submitting a CS request?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatevillurks @StarlingBank Ok, I think you know what I meant but perhaps I should have worded it as, "... when it reaches four figures I'll use it to pay for a holiday, the upshot being my monthly budgeting is unaffected and the holiday is paid for in full from my stealth savings." 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrissyAll @StarlingBank Hahahaha lmao 😂 You're just envious because you don't have a nice vertical debit card and a pair of Starling socks 😎 #bestbank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I have other specific Goals for Christmas and a holiday but my intention is to just let the coin jar mount up. Perhaps when it reaches four figures we'll have a free holiday or something 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank My coin jar has over £150 in it now - been doing it manually since May and switched on automatic roundups as soon as the feature was available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled @AnneBoden Ok, thanks for confirming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled @AnneBoden Slightly disappointed at that news. In the Twitter Q&amp;A before Christmas, I'm sure Anne mentioned in-app digital cheque imaging was coming in early 2019 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jajayourlife Any dates for the early access launch yet?  Looking forward to this :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Year to all my family and friends. Best wishes for 2019 🍾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmyosmond @brumhippodrome Just read about @jimmyosmond falling ill whilst playing Captain Hook in Peter Pan at the @brumhippodrome.

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @itisJames I have also submitted some recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you very much @StarlingBank, delighted to receive this package today containing socks, chocolate and a personal message! I've exhausted my hearts but continue to recommend you to you friends and family. Keep up the good work 👍🏻 #bestbank  https://t.co/iSSNkje4Xr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank Is this available on Android too? I noticed it was released for iOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw @DefLeppard at Newcastle @MetroRadioA on Sunday. Absolutely superb #hysteria  https://t.co/mdqN86E6P9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstie72120932 @StarlingBank Works fine for me - what is the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've switched this option on and think it's great - very well implemented. One improvement would be to add an option to round up ALL transactions, not just card purchases, i.e. Direct Debits, Standing Orders, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JoshSteveo DM on its way shortly... 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Seems as though there was an issue with the splash screen. Once fixed, I think it would be worth forcing it to appear next time people open the app, otherwise many users may not be aware of the round up feature or how to enable it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JoshSteveo Really?!?! I'm on 4 hearts, will refer someone else ASAP! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@humpinpumpkin @StarlingBank I've also been doing this manually and have saved just under £130 since May 👍🏻  I believe this new automated round-up is for card transactions only, so I'll continue to move the change after my DDs and SOs leave my account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've found how to turn it on (by editing my Goal) but I didn't get the splash screen telling me about this new feature. I'm on Android (Google Pixel 2).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Fantastic news! So happy you've added this feature 😃👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @OnedoxInfo When will this appear in the Marketplace?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Thanks. I've actually just submitted a message to CS through the app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've just accidently re-categorised every transaction relating to all of my accounts as "savings". I expected it to only apply to the particular account I was dealing with, i.e. a savings account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Two bits of feedback... firstly, the options to apply to all or just one transaction are hidden from view. Secondly, and more importantly, it applies to all past transactions for a payee across all their accounts. This is incorrect, it should apply to a particular account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank Most banks levy fees on business customers, Starling don't. Most banks charge a sizeable fee for sending foreign currency, Starling has one of the lowest fees. Most banks don't have nearby payments.  Regardless, they are celebrating what they have achieved in the last 6 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Very happy with round-ups and the full screen message introducing new features is long overdue - great news! Perhaps a full screen message could be used to re-introduce the swipe up for transactions...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank In the last 6 months? Er, joint accounts, business accounts, Post Office deposits, young people's accounts, loans, transaction search, USD payments, nearby payments, ... 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I'd love to see Chromebook support. Just allowing the Android app to run on Chrome OS would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePaul_T @StarlingBank Hi Paul, I believe Starling have said that this will be ready early next year 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharons26765893 @Barclays @biscuit_factory @PeoplesKitchen @KrissyAll @markIvison5 For avoidance of doubt Sharon, neither me nor my colleague Kris work for Barclays Bank. We took part in a charity quiz event hosted by them. Bit unfair to hijack my Tweet but good luck with your complaint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prize for coming second in the @Barclays "Test The Team" quiz at The @biscuit_factory in Newcastle. All for a very worthy cause, The @PeoplesKitchen. Congratulations to my teammates @KrissyAll and @markIvison5, the other two thirds of "Thin Quizzy" #PubQuiz #Taittinger  https://t.co/Ou6uPze4xE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeCMerriman @StarlingBank Me too, can't wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden I'm delighted with this, thank you! Incidentally, I've managed to save around £117 by rounding up the pennies manually since May!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden Thanks Anne. Can you confirm if a change round up feature and in-app cheque imaging are in the pipeline? These are very high up on my wishlist! #AskStarling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden Hi Anne. Firstly, congratulations on a fantastic product. I switched all my banking to Starling back in May and am a very happy customer!  What are the number one priorities being worked on by the development team? What new features can we expect to see soon?  #AskStarling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support No response and it's now been 6 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support I sent one earlier but didn't get any help. As it's now been 5 days and I'm still not verified, feel free to cancel my application. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK Been waiting since Thursday for you to verify my ID. Happy for you to cancel my application if that's easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support Any chance you could check my application to make sure there's nothing holding it up? I've waited two full business days plus the whole weekend. If there's an issue with my ID, I'd like to know sooner rather than later so I can take better photos of my driving licence. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support Ok, thanks for your response. I'm disappointed as I know of a lot of people who signed up after me but have been verified already, some even got confirmation on Saturday or Sunday. Frustrating after waiting months for early access 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reformattday @StarlingBank I don't hand mine over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support could you please give me an update on my ID verification? I signed up on Thursday evening and am still waiting for my ID to be confirmed. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n26 @N26UK I attempted to sign up on Thursday but it's been stuck at ID verification since then ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoneServer @StarlingBank If you ever need your number, remember it is shown in the app under the "Card" menu item 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reformattday @StarlingBank I agree on joint account cards, time for a nice new colour! With regards cashiers putting your card in the machine, I would never hand your card over. Always insist on having the machine brought to you. Can't be too careful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK I signed up Thursday evening but am still waiting for my ID to be verified. When can I expect to hear from you? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @CornishTD Great to hear this is being worked on. Any plans to publish an updated roadmap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I rarely carry cash, which is frustrating when I find somewhere that doesn't accept cards, e.g. fast food vans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @TomREdwards I'm delighted to read this! I've wanted this feature for some time and was under the impression it wasn't being worked on. Great stuff 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterJa30222260 @StarlingBank I really hope that old card is cancelled? Bit of a security issue there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @SunnvaBitch I've just submitted a bug report through the in-app messaging system. A dedicated method of submitting feedback and bug info would be really useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank @Xero @PostOffice It's in the latest Android app update - not sure about iOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank @Xero @PostOffice And now it looks like overdrafts for Business accounts too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusbrig I think it's more likely that this proves negotiations were being controlled by number 10 rather than Raab or his predecessor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PaymentsAwards Congratulations, well deserved! 👍🏻  https://t.co/lEZBqsB9fn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden @VarietyGB @CatherineAwards Congratulations @AnneBoden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @mcmarsh @StarlingForBiz No, that's correct. There's a 0.3% fee to deposit cash into a business account at the Post Office. This is subject to a £3 minimum. So anything up to £1,000 has a fee of £3, anything above is 0.3% of the total deposit amount, e.g. £1,500 would be £4.50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PostOffice I'm really pleased with this announcement, great stuff 👍🏻 One piece of advice... I've read a few comments from people who seem confused over the fee for depositing cash into a business account. It would be better to word it as, "0.3% per transaction with a minimum fee of £3".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pwatsonuk @StarlingBank The chip needs to be updated to allow it to work with PO systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank @zuffle @PostOfficeNews Hi Peter. There's a 0.3% fee, minimum £3, for depositing cash into a business account. No fees on personal accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southcoastbloke @StarlingBank Yes, it's instant 👍🏻 Card in reader, enter PIN, cash available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffpovey @StarlingBank Hi Jeff, I suspect those that have reported having their accounts frozen may have been up to no good... 🙄 Bank accounts get frozen when fraudulent activity is suspected. I've been with Starling around a year, six months since I switched all my banking to them. Very happy here 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LauraPulling Laura, lock your card in-app then use the live chat facility to speak to a customer service agent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @Themanwidnoname @jslee This is a fantastic addition to an already great banking product 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkKCurtis @StarlingBank I suspect cash deposits via the PO could be coming next week. When you say "bigger transfer amounts than £250", what do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PhoneServer I predict Monday... 🙄😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmarcjones @StarlingBank Why would you need two accounts to manage your finances? Not being funny, genuinely not sure why you would need that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricPrasen According to the laws of the game, the bowler is indeed considered a fielder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK been waiting for a loooong time for my beta invite. Any idea when I can expect it? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @barnsguy Try using your card with your PIN, then try Google Pay again. I've seen in the past (with other banks) that occasionally you need to do a physical card transaction as an extra layer of security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rambling_Tweets @StarlingBank You can deposit cash at any Nat West branch - no fees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilmortonnet @JoeCMerriman @StarlingBank No, surely that means they have 1,625 customers who have a Goal called "Christmas"? Starling Bank actually have around 300,000 customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Coin jar (for round-ups, hint hint...), Holiday, Christmas. Also, I have one called "Overdraft Buffer" - this is so if I creep into my overdraft I'm not actually charged, up to the amount I have in this Goal 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goforsergei @LuxuryTravelled @StarlingBank @JoeCMerriman Love it! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuxuryTravelled @StarlingBank @goforsergei @JoeCMerriman Is it a canvas shopping bag? I have one of those! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @goforsergei @JoeCMerriman Joe, you already have every bit of merch Starling have ever had made. What else could you need?!?! 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @Cammers_ This is a feature I really would love to see. I currently round up manually (saved over £100 since May). Many competitors have this feature, I really think it would be a really good addition to the Starling app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @xLITTLETOMMYx In-app cheque imaging would be my number one feature request. A large competitor (ahem) had promised this feature early next year, so I really hope it's being developed by Starling 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I switched to Starling Bank in May and love it! However, I really want to see in-app digital cheque imaging and an aware that a competitor has promised this functionality by early next year. Would love to see Starling offer this so I don't need to look elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Also responded. Best of luck, Starling is by far the best of the new challenger banks IMHO 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Whatever you use to schedule your Tweets, I do not think it works the way you think it works... 😯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I submitted some more merchant improvements in-app almost two weeks ago - submitted them multiple times (and again just now) yet they never get updated. I was told they were done at least weekly. Could someone please take look? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JLWarlow @firstdirect @HSBC_UK Does that mean the feature is being developed or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JourneysinM41 Could do with an updated roadmap...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenAshley @StarlingBank Happy to help Darren 😃👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @thorntog Hi Guy, Starling recently introduced the Current Account Switch Service for joint accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @isamutlib @AnneBoden Hi ISA, Starling actually pay interest on positive balances - 0.5% AER on the first £2,000 and 0.25% on everything above that up to £85,000 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @TeamMCS It would be less of a PITA if you didn't have to enter your password for every... single... statement... 😣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DarrenAshley Hi Darren, Starling Bank aren't part of the Link network so your card won't work in Link-only machines. It will work in any machine that bears the MasterCard logo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Not yet but I'll keep my eye on it. Thanks for the update.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Still not showing in the Play Store for me - is this a phased rollout?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HamillHimself It's OK, Luke didn't die after all! He simply regenerated himself into a guitarist and joined @dariusrucker's band! May the chords be with you #StarWars #LastJedi #RebelBass #UkeSkywalker  https://t.co/n4a7G4jbIb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpenreachHelp Thanks Frazer but will they also compensate me for the wasted time and the prolonged outages that won't be addressed until a new appointment can be made? Doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreOpenreach @OpenreachHelp @NOWTV @nowtvhelp waited in all day for engineer booked between 13:00 and 18:00, received text at 19:23 stating, "We are sorry but our Openreach engineer is not going to be able to make your appointment today". Appalling service #fail #badservice :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Thank you 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've submitted a number of merchant improvements over the last week but none have been actioned. Could you please confirm what the usual timeframe is for these?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad to hear that Geoffrey Hayes has died. Rainbow was my favourite programme as a child 🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBeasleyHarling Absolutely disgusting Dan. I know it's easier said than done but don't give trolls like this the satisfaction of seeing they've upset you. You're my favourite on the show this year and you come across like a proper family man and a really great bloke #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£50 for you, £50 for me when you switch your energy supply to Octopus.  Low prices, no minimum term contract and no exit fees, so you're free to leave at any time. It's a no brainer - give it a go as you're getting £50 off your energy bill!  https://t.co/Wo6FhDoSRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lynden Gooch slots home from the penalty spot to put Sunderland 2-0 up against Rochdale. @ Stadium of Light  https://t.co/GhvXp7raPY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingBank Cheers Dan. What a shame. Now the feedback and criticism is going to be played out on Twitter, which Starling aren't able to censor (unlike the forum). Terrible decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Great timing... I guess your Customer Services team will be inundated now as the forum is no longer a place for customers to get information.  https://t.co/N2If4vi0Hm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Oh, and I noticed your farewell post was originally titled "See ya peeps" before it was edited. A nice touch... very disrespectful towards some of the most loyal and engaged members of your customer base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Very disappointed and a very poor decision. Competitors are able to maintain an online community without putting customer's money or privacy at risk. You clearly didn't like the feedback and constructive criticism. Such a shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOWTV @NOWTVSport @nowtvhelp I bought a Sports Day Pass for the sole purpose of watching the Sunderland v Sheff Wed game this evening, only to find that the TV streaming isn't working. £7.99 wasted. Can't even get any support on live chat :(  https://t.co/OHckzfHYE2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Barclaycard It's a real shame as all the big players support Google Pay. I'll just continue to use my other cards. Thanks for your reply though Brendan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barclaycard Is there any reason why you don't support Google Pay?  iPhone users get to use their Barclaycards through Apple Pay yet Android users are neglected. I'm not interested in using the Barclaycard app to make contactless payments. It's why I hardly use my Barclaycard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@demTICKSdoe @monkeyfoodgames I've been checking every month, gutted as it was one of my favourite games!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@onion2k @JustEatUK But they do charge restaurants - 13% commission I believe. They increased the charge last year from 12% leading to revenue of £375m and pre-tax profit of £91m, up £57m from the previous year. All without administering a "service charge" for customers who didn't pay by card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be using @JustEatUK again following the new "service charge" announcement. Pretty unethical to skirt around the card surcharge ban by introducing a new charge. Treating their customers with contempt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sitting in row V with @loug78 waiting for@rustyrockets to come on. So excited my dinkle is tingling! #newbw2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rustyrockets Looking forward to the gig tonight at the Tyne Theatre. Will you be hanging around for pics and autographs afterwards?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow, the away dressing room ceiling has collapsed at the Stadium of Light, so kick-off delayed until 15:20. Ha'way the lads! #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, going offline now as I'm about to watch all six episodes of Snuff Box back-to-back, again :) Night all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointing performance tonight, hope we can bounce back at Anfield #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevepercival Hi Steve, it's Dan from the Big Jug. I used to come to a lot of Sugarwood's gigs when I was at Uni. Hope you're keeping well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good attacking line up for Sunderland - glad Brucey's taking the cup seriously. 3-0: 2 goals for @DB11TT, 1 for Gyan. Ha'way the lads! #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone tell Wenger that a minimum of 4 mins is just that - A MINIMUM. If the ref wants to add 4 1/2 mins, he'll signal a minimum of 4 #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well deserved goal for @DB11TT today - worked hard up front on his own and was in exactly the right place at the right time. Ha'way the lads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeighFrancis @RufusHound I'm watching on ITV2+1 and am literally crying with laughter :D<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PStanton He isn't this season...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at the pic in this article - proud to be a Sunderland supporter!  http://bbc.in/adngww #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's not forget the youngsters - Welbeck scored twice for the U21s, one assisted by Jordan Henderson #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the moon for @DB11TT, hope you can bang some more in on Saturday vs Wigan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Definitely not Adam Johnson, he was superb tonight.  He has to start for England IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones @SAFCofficial I don't think there have been many, pretty sure Shack would have been the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SAFCofficial @DavidBGJones Was it Len Shackleton?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in @DB11TT!  Lovely finish :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raynersullivan @Teg410 A lot of people have me confused with someone else - I'm not a US football coach :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How amazing is this video?  http://vimeo.com/14173983<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how many Man Utd will put past Newcastle?  2 already, I reckon 5 :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DB11TT Congrats on the England call up - now is the time to cement your place in the squad. All the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k Agreed - @timminchin is a genius... saw him last year at City Hall, got tickets for the Arena in December :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malcuk Good stuff!  Hot Fuzz is another of my favourite films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulOBrien I saw that on Top Gear too - doubt I'll ever be able to afford a £170k car though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaun of the Dead... never get tired of watching this film :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soupytwist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Dunno why I do this... I have the DVD but will be watching on E4.  Meaning I have to watch ads.  Why would I do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malcuk it's not placebos in general that I'm opposed to, it's homeopathy. Far more expensive than a sugar pill, yet just as ineffective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I demand snake oil be made available on the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This infuriates me, especially given the cuts that are being enforced across government departments:  http://bit.ly/flim-flam #homeopathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love this song by @timminchin - You Grew On Me  http://youtu.be/frNpdG4F9mw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well worth it though - Toy Story 3 is a great film! And a bit weepy at the end :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMAX was sold out, so was Cineworld, but saw it in 3D at the Empire. 36 mile round trip to get to a cinema 50 yards from where I live!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toy Story 3 today in full IMAX awesomeness!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is mental... Isner v Mahut at Wimbledon.  2-2 in sets, 41-41 in the fifth and final set!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice one England - an improvement on the last two games, still some way to go but we're through.  Job done.  Come on Ghana!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very interesting theory from Graeme Souness regarding why England have been absolute rubbish...  http://bit.ly/cuJ8Iz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't beat a nice cuppa at half four in the morning... :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really bad insomnia tonight.  Haven't been to bed, now it's light outside!  Ah well, might as well get ready...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIVEROS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracking save Tommy!  Nice to see some entertaining football. #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Bugger o**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Regardless of how frustrated he feels, what he said was out of order. People have paid a fortune to watch that rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Jeffries Yeah, they caught it on camera as he was walking off the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooney, you're a disgrace - if that's what you think you can get on the next plane home.  Knob. #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABSOLUTE RUBBISH #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From BBC Sport yesterday: "Rooney has suggested even an under-par England can beat Algeria in Cape Town" #talkingbollocks #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that substitution was our best option then we're screwed #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBoyler That's offensive to Carlton Palmer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are clueless... this is painful to watch :( #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played Emile #england #worldcup #donkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@porksmith He'll accept any offers since they cancelled Wheel of Fortune<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin Keegan has borrowed Harry Hill's shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones I can't imagine it getting any worse, but we've got 45 minutes to screw it up completely...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schofe SHITE is closer to the mark...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am completely underwhelmed so far... COME ON MAN!!! #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Woah! Great goal, who'd have thunk it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal... #brazil #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>only £2 for a wide range of wonderful spanish cuisine -  http://www.groupon.co.uk/in/.WMlXgY/,21858?nlp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton No, it's not just you... :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elsey_Who_Else Exactly what I've just said... Heskey is a complete donkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Entire goal to aim at, he picks the one spot where the keeper is standing - cheers Emile #donkey #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on our first half performance, any optimism I had left after Heskey was included in the squad has been well and truly sapped away :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've switched off... shocking defending :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulOBrien Thankfully I'm watching on trusty old standard def. Freeview :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET IN!!!!!!! #goal #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Jeffries Put a bet on 2-0 earlier... got Lampard for first goal as well.  COME ON!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason_Manford Whoever did that is a knob.  Still, at least you're a world record holder, so it's not all bad news! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From @engadget:  http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/10/motorola-wants-a-2ghz-android-by-years-end-so-do-we/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenoldenlady If he was genuinely concerned he could have spoken to Corden off stage - no need to belittle him in front of the audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@techno_t Cheers mate :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazed at how many people think what Patrick Stewart said and did was funny, and that in some way James Corden had it coming. #glamourawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfry felt sorry for James though, he appeared pleased that Patrick wanted to speak to him... until he opened his mouth #glamourawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking Katie to see Fantastic Mr Fox at the cinema - I love these £1 weekend deals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k Good call - Michael J. Fox is cool :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Jeffries Congrats Jaffa, made quick work of that :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jellyyyx Totally agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Emile... see, I said @DB11TT should have gone to the #worldcup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New blog post: Gutted For Darren Bent -  http://bit.ly/cVCg4n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DB11TT Gutted for you mate, just hope you keep your chin up and prove them wrong by banging more goals in for us next season. #dbforengland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, the FA's squad announcement has turned into a complete farce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones I hope you're right about Bent. Seems to have his head screwed on, but it must be very demoralising - what more can he do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefadotcom Confirmation isn't really needed though - what a shambolic way for the news to get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevo_football I'll be gutted for Bent if he doesn't make it. Don't judge him on 45 mins in a friendly, judge him on 24 PL goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldcupmotty Hope you're right with those 7. It's shocking that 24-goal Bent could miss out based on 45 mins with no service against Japan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to wait 28 days for my TV to be repaired... no World Cup for me :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe my telly is broke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjfrost Really enjoyed that, looking forward to the final part :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Defo, and I didn't like his reaction there. A very frosty interview and disrespectful walking out before Selby got his trophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great game - would have liked to see Ronnie go for the snookers in that last one, but well done to Selby.  Thoroughly enjoyed that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omid9 Can't believe Ronnie attempted to cut that green back!  Been a great match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Nutcase!  No way should he have tried to cut that back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen lol, hold your horses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen What a shot by Ronnie - putting the cue ball in the jaws of the pocket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen He's definitely got the momentum.  Taking on that red on the cushion was a bad mistake by O'Sullivan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying the Masters final.  Ronnie's been cracking but Selby's putting up a good fight.  Looks like a tight finish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Well, it's pretty bad!  I know what you mean though.  Just hope we have some players back in time for the trip to Everton.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fire alarm went off earlier, had to evacuate the building with Katie in her pyjamas! Back in the apartment now :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I'll watch "The Damned United" before bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it's official, we've signed Michael Turner from Hull.  Great signing IMHO.  Ha'way the lads! #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen Great idea!  I love buying.  Make it 13:30 and you've got a deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen WAIT!  I'm also hungry, so hold your horses and we'll come up with a plan whereby I can eat too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Has to be YGOM... it spread through me like malignant melanoma! #minchinlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Without a doubt, "You Grew On Me" :) #minchinlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to bed now... know I'm gonna have trouble sleeping, but will just have to force my eyes closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen McMurphy, make me big again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilyroseallen NeedAPresent.com  http://www.needapresent.com/gifts/orgasmatron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton Really disappointed at that... arguably the worst team we've played so far this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen I had Subway for lunch... mmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton Hehe, your outlook really does surprise me... :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article on James Randi:  http://bit.ly/5Lui6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to the match today... beat Stoke and we could be third in the Prem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k That theme tune is one of the greatest songs ever written and still brings a tear to my eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End of the evening, time for chicken :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glinner Do you want faults relating to any part of Windows in particular?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on England, let's wrap this series up today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Mummy's with Katie for Sunday lunch now... looking forward to it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing with my new Google Android phone... c'est magnifique!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://www.theatrepeople.co.uk/ via @addthis My brother's new theatre company in Sunderland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton WOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case anyone tries to phone me, I don't have a phone at the moment.  Should have a temporary handset tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took Katie to the hospital today, glad she doesn't need grommets... yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start of the new Premier League season today and I can't wait!  Hope and expect Sunderland will get off to a flying start.  Ha'way the lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracking goal from Defoe, good work lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on West Brom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Your right leg I like - it's a lovely leg for the role. I've got nothing against your right leg. The trouble is, neither have you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the sketch "One Leg Too Few" by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (again!)... absolutely fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT: @RichardWiseman: Stunning  http://bit.ly/BtcZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2-0... ha'way the lads! Get Bent in tomorrow and I think we'll be looking good for this season :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn swine flu! The Tamiflu has made me feel sick over the last couple of days. Seem to be on the mend though, should be back to work Thurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Will be increasingly hard for them the longer Ashley's there. No interest in success on the pitch so no manager 'til he's gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones The Mags have more chance of going down than coming straight back up... they'll be every team's cup final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elsey_Who_Else LOL! You'll have to come to the SOL this season, there's bound to be a banner with your name on it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Phil Silvers will have to come back from the dead before they can do a new series :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got Katie's season ticket yesterday, just waiting for mine to arrive now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@db10thetruth Good luck at Sunderland Darren, hope all goes smoothly with the medical. Will you be putting pen to paper tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subway... mmmm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoyed "The Wizard of Oz" at the Sunderland Empire tonight.  Well done to my brother Jay and the rest of the cast - great show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuk Hehe, nah, I think he got out at the top!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brother is appearing as The Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz at the Sunderland Empire Theatre this week! #lameclaimtofame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Nick Frost (while shaving apparently) #clumsystars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this thing on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to work today although I'm still not well... it hurts when I swallow and I'm practically deaf :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off sick with flu at the moment, don't feel at all well :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upgraded my web servers from RedHat to CentOS 5.2 yesterday.  Got a few minor issues to iron out but on the whole surprisingly painless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Temazepam Grier<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Snoop Dog-Tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Chris Tuckered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k There are too many to choose from!  Anything by Spandau Ballet, or maybe Cutting Crew's "I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A glass of red I think, in a nice new wine glass :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good win tonight - 7-3, two goals for me, lots of good shots saved and kept out by the woodwork.  All in all a good game of football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuk Sweet niblets!  Trust you to get there first!  Ah well, sorry for caring - next time I'll let you find out the hard way :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you Spotify users out there, including @mcuk, take note:  http://tinyurl.com/ar7zjh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuk And if you're unemployed it's whatever's on the radio ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Night everyone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Night all.<|endoftext|>
